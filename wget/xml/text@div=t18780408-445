                  </hi>. I am assistant to Grant and Gask, of Oxford Street—on 5th February Wright came there and wanted to look at a skirt which a lady had seen a few days previously—we had not got it then, and I showed him some others—he selected a black silk costume at six and a half guineas, and asked for it to be sent as he had not sufficient to pay for it—he gave his address "George Lewis, solicitor, 4, Camden Avenue, Peckham," and then said "If you can change a cheque I will pay you for it now," producing this cheque: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Feb. 4, 1878. Birkbeck Bank. Pay Mr. Smith or bearer 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Thos. Pitman. "Endorsed "Wm. Smith, Geo. Lewis.") I took it to the manager and came back and said that we would change it—he turned it over, pointed to "Geo.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Gask and Gask—I received this cheque from a clerk; it was paid to our bankers and returned—on 10th February I went to Lewis at 74A, Southwark Bridge Road, saw him, showed him the cheque, and said "Is this your signature?" pointing to the endorsement "Geo. Lewis"—he said "No; but I think I know whose signature it is"—I asked him to tell me, he said "I can't tell you," or "I prefer not telling you"—I said "Who is Smith?"—he said "I do not know"—I said "Where does Pitman live?"—he said "Stamford Street"—I said "Gask and Gask sold a costume and this cheque was paid for it"—he seemed surprised, and said "I do not know anything about it"—I said "Did you buy it?"—he said "No"—I left and went again three or four weeks afterwards, and asked Lewis who purchased the goods, he said "A man named Wright"—I said "Had he any authority to use</p>

I did not see the cheque before the goods were parted with, not till it came back from the bank—I noticed that the date had been altered—Mr. Bowen May is our solicitor—we instructed him to write a letter saying that he was instructed to apply for the amount of the cheque; that was after I had received Pittman's address at Lav<lb></lb>ender Hill—I did not see Pitman, but I saw his son—I gave his address and instructed Mr. May to write for the amount—Mr. May asked whether we would allow a few days' time, and we allowed the matter to be open till 25th February, and said that unless it was paid on the 26th the action would proceed—I have seen Mrs. Pitman at Gask and Gask's twice since the commitment, but not before—I cannot say whether it was before the committal for trial—I was not present when she tendered the money, but Gask and Gask's banking account was swollen by the pay<lb></lb>ment of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—early in March the case fell out of the hands of Mr. May and got into the hands of Humphreys and Morgan; it is now a prosecution by the Society of Linendrapers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Peter Robinson and Co., of Regent Street—on 5th February, Wright came and selected a dress and asked me to put it away for a lady to see when she called—I made him out an invoice for it, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he tendered a cheque for the same amount as this, and I think drawn by the same person—he did not ask for the balance—I communicated with my superiors, and went back to him and refused to change it, but said that the dress would be sent in the morning to be paid for on delivery—he gave the name of Mrs. Lewis, 4, Camden Avenue, Peckham—I sent it there and it was brought back without the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant at the Birkbeck Bank—Pitman opened an account there in 1872—on 23rd August, 1877, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only stood to his credit—this cheque for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was presented and returned on 7th February—this cheque for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was also presented and dis<lb></lb>honoured—this is the return draft book, it contains a list of dishonoured cheques—it is kept by a dozen different clerks—I know of my own knowledge that several other cheques were presented and dishonoured since November—this is the ledger; I see it every day—on 28th August Pitman's balance was 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 19th November 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in, and on 22nd November 57., that was the last payment—he drew out both those sums in November, and 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was left again—a draft for 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in in August, before the 23rd, it is debited to him subsequently; that means that it was not paid.</p>

It is known that the Birkbeck Bank refer to a customer's name to see that he has the money, before we part with it—it has the largest number of customers in London, over 40,000—Mr. Pitman has at times had over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance, and we never knew anything against him till August—he has paid several thousand pounds to his account—we put cheques to the credit before they are realised, but sometimes they come back—many of the accounts are drawn pretty close—we allow money on deposit at 3 1/2 per cent., and we allow interest on the minimum balance.</p>
               <p>

On 18th March, about 9 p.m., I went to 4, Cambrian Avenue, Queen's Road, Peckham, and saw Lewis, for whom I held a warrant, which I read to him, and he said, "This is all Pitman's fault, if it had not been for him I should not have got in this trouble"—his wife was present—I took him to Eland Road, Wandsworth, and asked for Pitman, for whom I also had a warrant—Lewis was with me—a young woman said something and Pitman came down afterwards—I read the warrant, he made no reply—I did not hear Lewis say any<lb></lb>thing—I took them to the station, searched Lewis, and found these four documents (<hi rend="italic">Messrs. Gask's invoice, a cheque for l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">a letter from Wright in the House of Detention, and a letter from Pitman</hi>)—Wright was then under remand—they wore committed on April 2nd—I only found a bunch of keys on Pitman.</p>

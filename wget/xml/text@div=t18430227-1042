I am a manufacturer of pianofortes, on a new principle, in High-street, Camden-town—the prisoner was in my service at this time, and had been for four years; during the last two years as fore<lb></lb>man—I employ a person named Hall to manufacture what are called dampers—his dampers have something peculiar about them—the prisoner had no au<lb></lb>thority to take any of my dampers, or any other property, to his house in Grove-street—if they had been delivered to him in Oct. it was his duty to bring them to my establishment, and place them among my stock—I have seen this book before—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it is called a pass-book—when goods are delivered, the person who receives them signs his name—this book is generally kept at the factory—if Mr. Hall had sent goods, he would have en<lb></lb>tered them, and the person who receives the goods would sign it—I find the last entry of the prisoner for dampers is on the 15th of Oct.; two sets were delivered then; I have received none since—the prisoner had no right what<lb></lb>ever</p>

               <p>month I was with the vessel fishing off the coast of Holland, upon the high seas—the prisoner was an apprentice on board—he was my watch-mate—the captain had gone off to spend the day with some more captains, and I had charge of the vessel—when we came on deck after breakfast the prisoner said, "Charley, we have not got anything to do this watch"—I said "Yes, you have"—he said, "We have always something to do in our watch," and seemed very much displeased at it—I said whether he was displeased or not, it must be done—I told him to go up and send three blocks down—he did that after some time—I sent him up again to hitch them: he was up then some time—it was a simple job to do; he could have done it if he liked, but he would not, and I went and did it myself—I said, "George, a great fellow like you ought to be ashamed of himself, not to do a simple job like that"—he made me very vexed, and I told him if he did not leave off his <hi rend="italic">sauce</hi>, I would give him a punch on the head—he said, "That is more than you dare do: if you did, it would be a bad job for you"—about 5 minutes after that, he made me very vexed—we were about three yards apart, and I went to him and hit him—it was not a very hard blow—he returned it directly—we had a scuffle for a little while—he began to get very violent—I asked him if he was going to leave off—he Baid, no: be wanted to keep on fighting—I then threw him on the deck, and held him there till his passion was over—he tried to bite me two or three times—I hit him twice for that—after I had held him there some time, I let him get up and walked away from him round to the other side of the vessel—he came round to the side which I was on, and said, "D—you, I will have my revenge: I will go and cut your shifting up (that is, my clothes) because you have torn my shirt"—he had his knife in his hand—he went down to my bed cabin and brought my bag up on deck—I said, "George, it is poor spite to want to cut my shifting up, for I have only torn your shirt"—the cabin-boy was standing on deck, and I said to him, "Chuck my bag below; he shall not cut my shifting up"—the boy threw it down into the fore-part of the vessel—the prisoner directly went down the hatchway after it, with his knife open in his hand—I was rather louth to follow him, because I had seen him use weapons before; but I saw him cut the string of my bag in halves, and I went down to take my bag away—as soon as I entered the forecastle, he ran at me with all his force, and said, "D—your eyes, I will kill you," and he ground his teeth—he ran the knife as hard as he could into my left side—he only gave me one blow; it was about three inches below my arm—I said to him, "Oh George, you have stabbed me"—I got up the hatch-way as well as I could, and fell down upon the deck, the blood pouring out of me—a signal of distress was hoisted, and I was taken into harbour, where I was under the charge of a medical man for four days—I have suffered a good deal from the injury—the doctor said if it had been two inches lower down I should have been dead directly—I feel it now at times, but the place has healed up.</p>

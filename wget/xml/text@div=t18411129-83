                  </hi>. I am assistant to Maria Eliza Stapleton, a hosier and glover, Nos. 10 and 11, Burlington-arcade—they are two houses, but it is all one inside—the robbery was committed at No. 11—about half-past six o'clock, on the evening of 13th of October, I was standing behind the counter, and observed a blank space in the window—on looking closer, I saw a pane of glass broken, and missed a quantity of pieces of handkerchief, amounting to about 180 handkerchiefs—they were not hemmed when lost, but in pieces—I was shown some by Trew, about a week after, hemmed—these now produced are them.</p>

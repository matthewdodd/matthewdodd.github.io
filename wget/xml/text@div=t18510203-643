                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Piper and an<lb></lb>other, builders; they are contractors for the works at the London-bridge terminus of the Brighton Railway. The prisoner was employed there—on 28th Jan. I was at the office on the works, and saw the prisoner in custody—I saw this iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) taken from him—there is no mark on it, but I know it by the pattern and size—it was not part of the prisoner's duty to have it—he is a bricklayer's labourer.</p>

On 28th Jan., about half-past five o'clock, I stopped the prisoner as he was leaving—he ought to have left at five—I asked him if he had got anything he was ashamed of—he said he had got two or three pieces of wood—I asked him to let me look at them—he hesitated—I opened his jacket, and found this iron concealed round his body with a belt—I took him to the contractors' office, and took it from him—he begged Mr. Rincher would have mercy on him.</p>

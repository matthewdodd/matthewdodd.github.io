               <p>Robert Bray. On the 29th of September, between eight and nine at night, I was coming from my labour through a little alley (I think they call it <placeName id="t17521206-35-crimeloc176">Moses and Aaron Alley</placeName>

Some how this money was confistuated out of my pocket, it was in halfpence (nine shillings); I missed it in less than three minutes time, and was in company with no body but her; I know I brought it out of the house; it was lost when she made the second ance. She forcibly held me as an officer or does a man, so I went back again, but could not find her; the Monday I laid hold on her and her into publick house, where two men came and took hold of my collar, so she got away again, but was afterwards apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever confess taking these halfpence from you ?</p>
               <p>Bray. No, she did not; she said if I must g Bridewell, I'll have my own block and bettle.</p>

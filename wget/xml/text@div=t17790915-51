               <p>As I was coming from Waltham Abbey on the 15th of July, in the evening, in a single horse chaise, accompanied by my sister, two men, on the road between <placeName id="t17790915-51-crimeloc260">Islington</placeName>

I seeing them intending to stop me, pushed on my horse. They put a pistol to my sister, and frightened her. It was between nine and ten o'clock at night. One of the men jumped into the chaise, and insisted upon my money. I gave them all I had in my purse. There was I think a guinea and some silver; they insisted upon my watch, which I also gave them, and, seeing my sister in a fit, they left her, and ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A metal watch, with silver seals. They left me, and ran into the fields. One of the seals had the impression of my arms, the other my crest. At the time they were robbing me there was a whistling and some noise, as if there were accomplices in the neighbourhood. I did not attempt to stop after they were gone, and saw no more of them. When the prisoner was apprehended I was sent for, and I do verily believe, that the prisoner is the man who came into the chaise to me.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that the prisoner was one of them? - To the best of my belief I think him the man that robbed me; it was by no means dark; it was light enough to see his countenance, and I most sincerely believe he is the person that robbed me from his profile, size, dress, and every other circumstance; and also because of the person taken with him, Garland; I think he was the accomplice, but I cannot answer as to him; but I think the prisoner is the person that came into the chaise to me; his dress, when taken, was as I had described, a loose great coat, and his hair was hanging down; at the same time his countenance struck me as the same person.</p>
               <p>What colour was his great coat? - It was a dark brown loose great coat.</p>

I am, but at the time I was robbed I had my spectacles on, which I usually wear when I ride or walk; (puts on his spectacles) with these spectacles I have the pleasure of seeing as well as any gentleman in court. The prisoner insisted, if I did not hold my hat before my face, he would shoot me. The pistol which was shown at Sir

Five of us went at half after nine in the evening; we met three men, and the prisoner at the bar, at the end of the duke of Bedford's private road; we attacked them immediately; Steward the prisoner came up with this cutlass to strike at an officer who was along with me; as his arm was lifted up I struck at him, and cut him in his arm, upon which his arm and the cutlass fell; we then secured them, and in searching about where they stood I found this horse pistol lying on the ground.</p>

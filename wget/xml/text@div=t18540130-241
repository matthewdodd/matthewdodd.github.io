                  </hi>. I am a tailor and outfitter. On 17th Jan. the prisoner came to me with this order, saying the captain had written it, to get some clothes for himself and another man—it is written in Swedish; I can translate it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Tailor Davidson, let the bearer, A.

Wilen, ship <hi rend="italic">Atlas.</hi> Also let John Negot have a pair of trowsers, a woollen shirt, and pair of drawers")—I do not know whose handwriting it is—I wrote here, in Swedish, "Clothes to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and the prisoner signed his name to it—the second man received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of clothes—he could not write his name, and the prisoner signed it for him, and wrote his own name under—I gave the prisoner two double back blue shirts, one red shirt, three cotton shirts, three pairs of stockings, of pair of mole trowsers, one cravat, and one pair of drawers—the second man had a pair of trowsers—they each had a bundle—they came together—I have since seen the things at the station house.</p>

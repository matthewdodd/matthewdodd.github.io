                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at the Post-office. On the morning of the 28th of October I was in Maiden-lane, standing upon the canal bridge—I saw a chaise-cart coming down the lane—the horse was at a full gallop—there were two persons in the cart—the prisoner was driving and another sitting—there were some cans and mop-handles in it—when it got to the top of the bridge I observed the man who was. sitting by the pri<lb></lb>soner, speak to him, and the prisoner laughed—I did not observe him whip the horse at all, nor attempt to stop it—I saw them get opposite the Albion public-house, and saw two men coming out of Collard's dust yard, one a little in advance of the other—they did not come through the regular gate, but a place where some palings had been pulled down—they were walking,—they stepped off the foot-path, and made a start forward to cross the road just before the horse—the foremost man succeeded in getting across—the second tried to get across, but finding he could not get past the horse, he made a swing round, when the near shaft struck him in the back—he fell forward, but in falling he caught the shaft, and was dragged several yards—the horse was in the centre of the road at the time the man was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183911250040"></xptr>
               <p>struck, but while he was hanging on, the horse got close up to the foot<lb></lb>path on the left-hand side of the road, which was the side he had stepped off of—just as the horse got to the foot-path, the man left go or was thrown from his hold and fell forward on his face, with his head to the foot-path and his feet in the road, lying in a slanting direction—the near wheel took him just across the hip, and passed over his back from left to right—several people ran and picked him up, and carried him to the Albion pub<lb></lb>lic house, and afterwards to the hospital—the cart went on a short distance, and then the prisoner stopped—I was behind the cart after the shaft struck the man, and could not see him—I did not observe him attempt to pull up before it struck him—if he had made a dead stop instead of going over the road, he could not have been run over—he might have seen the cart coming if he looked that way—he could see into the road out of the yard—when he stepped off the foot-path on the road he began to run directly—step<lb></lb>ping off the foot-path into the road, which is a descent, gave him rather an impetus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I knew the deceased, John Cordery—I was with him at the time of the accident—he was sober—I was going over from the gap in the paling to the Albion public-house to get a pot of beer—I did not see the cart till I was nearly a third across the road—I then saw it coming along at a rapid rate—the deceased was behind me a yard or two—I called to the driver as I crossed, and called out "Murder" to him, that he would kill some one if he did not stop his horse—he tried to stop it, and held as hard as he could—the deceased was not deaf, to my knowledge—the horse appeared coming down the hill in a rapid way—the prisoner did not appear in liquor—it was about eleven o'clock.</p>

I was with the prisoner in his father's cart, who is a dealer in coke—the prisoner was driving—he was sober—the horse was going fast, at a sort of gallop—I saw the first man cross the road, but not the second till he had got near the cart—I called out "Stop" once, and the prisoner tried to stop the cart, as soon as he saw the man who was entangled with the shaft.</p>

Q.</hi> He did all he could to stop, did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—we could not see either of the men till we got on the crown of the bridge, which is about twenty yards from where the accident happened—the horse was going at the same pace before he got there, between a trot and gallop, at between five and seven miles an hour—I saw the deceased on the pavement just before he got on the road—we called to the first, man, and he got over—the prisoner did all he could to stop the horse, and he afterwards took the deceased to the hospital—I do not think the horse was going at more than six miles an hour—it was a cart-horse.</p>

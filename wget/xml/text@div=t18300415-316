Not to my knowledge; I did not hear any thing of that kind - when Dunn came he said he had sold a sack to Kingsford for 48s., and that Woodroffe had 15s. of it; Meredith, another carter, had received part of it - he said he had sold various others to the amount of eight sacks altogether; he said he had given Perry a sack of flour to sell - I left Dunn in custody; Shelswell brought Woodroffe.</p>

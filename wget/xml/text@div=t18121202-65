            . I am a carman in Mr. Griffiths's employ.</p>
               <p>Q. On last Monday night did you go to this stable - A. Yes, about seven o'clock. It was dark At the entrance of the yard I saw a cart standing with a horse, and a man standing at the head of the horse. I was going to Mr. Frith's coachman; that is the middle stable. I then saw the two prisoners and another man standing at Mr. Hammond and Morley's stable door. There was a truss of hay and a truss of straw down in front of the door. I called Mr. Frith's coachman, and rattled his door. The prisoner Lloyd came and asked me wether I wanted Hammond and Morley's carman. I told him, no; I wanted Mr. Frith's coachman; and just as this passed the coachman sent his son down, and I was let in. What I had observed caused suspicion in my mind. I went up stairs and opened the window; I looked out. I saw Messrs. Hammond and Morley's hay loft door open. I saw four more trusses of hay throwed down from the left door, and then the left door was pulled to, and the light was put out. Lloyd and the strange man took up each a truss, and went towards the gateway. Lloyd returned, and the strange man, and took up a truss of hay each; then Oliver took up a truss of straw. He bid them be alive. They all went towards the gateway. The strange man returned. He took the other truss of hay that remained, making altogether five trusses of hay and one of straw. The next morning Mr. Frith's coachman told of it. If I had time I should have gone and told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020051"></xptr>myself. They were regular cut trusses of hay and straw what I saw taken away.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Hammond. On Monday evening last I went to Oliver's stable. I called, carman. I pushed the stable door open, and there were two strange men in the stable. They told me Oliver was above. I said, it was of no consequence. I left the stable immediately. In about ten minutes I went to the cart stable again. My stable are at the top of the yard. I called, carman, again, Oliver came. I asked for some nails; he gave them me. I did not go in. There was a truss of hay and straw at the door, what I saw. I had suspicion. I desired my wife to watch. I did not watch, because I am near sighted. This was past seven o'clock.</p>

            . In consequence of my husband desiring me to look out, I did. I saw two or three trusses of hay throwed out of Oliver, the carman's loft window. I heard them bounce down as trusses. I kept back a minute or two; I did not like to be seen in it. I stepped forward again. I saw two man cross the yard, each with a truss of straw or hay upon their heads. I saw the trusses, but not the mens faces. They were cut trusses.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Gillchrist. My master has a stable in this yard. On last Monday evening I went to do up my horses. I had a candle in my hand, alight. It was half past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any horse and cart - A. Yes. I met the prisoner Lloyd. I knew him before. I met him at the corner of the yard; he had a truss of hay with him. He spoke to me, and I to him. After he had turned the corner of the yard I blew my candle out, and I watched him. I saw him put it into a cart on the top of Addle-hill. I saw the cart waiting there before that, and I had seen two men put trusses into the cart before that; they each of them put a truss into the cart.</p>
               <p>Oliver's Defence. The rubbish that was disposed of was three bundles of hay hands.</p>

               <p>Lloyd said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Oliver called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

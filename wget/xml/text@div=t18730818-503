                  </hi>, M.P. I am one of the Members for West Somerset—I have a residence in town—in July last I had a bay gelding which I kept at some stables in Maddox Street, where the prisoner was employed as horse-keeper—I wanted to sell that horse, and the prisoner came to me and said if I would take his bill for two months he would give me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said he would bring the bill that night or the following morning, whichever I chose—I said the following morning before 10 o'clock, as I was going into the country—he did not come, and a few minutes before 10 o'clock I went to the stables and saw the prisoner's mother—the prisoner was not there, and the horse was gone—I did not authorise him to sell it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said I would not take less than 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had had charge of the horse for six weeks or two months—I told him it was for sale, and I promised him a present if he sold it.</p>

               <p>Mews, Bedford Square—on 24th July the prisoner brought me a bay gelding and asked me to buy it—he asked 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he had been several times previously—I ultimately bought it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave me this receipt—he said he had been a bankrupt, and he said "This is some of it, and I may as well put it in my pocket as anyone else"—he was in liquor at the time, and had been riding the horse about all day—I had known him nine or ten years.</p>

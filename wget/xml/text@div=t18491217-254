                  </hi>. I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi>, which has just come to London. The prisoner was a seaman on board; I believe he was shipped in London—I joined her at Madras, on the homeward voyage—the captain's name is Kreeft—we touched at St. Helena, on the way home, on 12th Oct., in the morning—in the evening we wanted to get under weigh—while getting in the cable, I heard some grumbling, and said, "Heave away, lads! let us have no grumbling"—I then saw the prisoner there—he continued grumbling, saying, "This is a pretty time of night to get under weigh," and things of that kind—the captain then <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Grog, oh! for all hands!"—the prisoner did not have any—I had stopped it before, because he was dilatory in his duty—after that he was worse, and continued grumbling—I went up to him, and told him to desist grumbling, and if he did not I would <hi rend="italic">"stop his wind;"</hi>—I meant, "stop his conversation"—he said, "If that is the case, I will <hi rend="italic">knock off"</hi>—he let go of the windlass—I insisted on his going to work again, and said, "If you do not, I will make you"—the captain then <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Bring that man <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>"—the prisoner said, "If you lay a hand on me I will <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> this knife into you," taking one from inside his trowsers or belt, and opening it—I advanced towards him; he put his head down, ran at me, and I felt the knife grate across my thigh and stomach—I should fancy it was drawn in an upward direction—I struck him, and knocked him down—I allowed him to get up, then pinioned him round the arms, and was bringing him <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>—he struggled to get clear—he pointed the knife a second time at me—I struck him again with my right hand, and stopped the knife with my left—he got up—I pinioned him—the captain and second mate then came to my assistance, and while we had hold of the prisoner he called out to the other men, were they Englishmen, and would they see a man overpowered—I felt my hand cut across, there is the scar—I told the captain to beware of himself, and immediately after he said, "I am cut also," and I saw blood running from his cheek—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found next morning—I suppose he broke the handle, because as soon as he cut my hand I let him go <hi rend="italic">forward</hi>, and ran after him a third time, and the knife was found at the place he ran to—he was then secured—I am not aware that I had given him any further provocation than what I have stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi>, On 12th Oct. I was heaving at the bar of the aft-part of the windlass—I saw the beginning of this matter—Potter knocked the prisoner down—I could not see what the prisoner did immediately after that—the mate gave him several blows in the face while he was down—the captain came and asked what was the matter, and said, "Leave him to me, Mr. Potter," and they led him out—I did not see anything after that—it was dark, and I remained at the windlass—the</p>

               <p>captain said to us, "Heave away, my men; he is only a d----d akulk"—I afterwards heard several blows with the rope's end; I cannot say where it was; it was some little distance from me—I did not see any knife drawn before the first blow—I was on the other side—the prisoner came <hi rend="italic">for'ards</hi> again, running across from the starboard to the larboard—the captain and mate came running after him—the prisoner tumbled down on the deck, and they struck him again—I did not hear anything about the knife till Potter and the captain <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out he had cue them; that was at nearly nine o'clock, when the prisoner ran <hi rend="italic">for'ards</hi>—it was after I had heard the blows given.</p>

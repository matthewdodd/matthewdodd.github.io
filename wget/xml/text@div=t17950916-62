               <p>Q. Were you employed on the 29th of June last to supervise Mr. Wallis's brewery, West Ham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then in the service of Mr. Wallis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And formerly had been an excise-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what past on the 29th of June? - I went there to survey; Mr. Gregory was there at the same time, in the brewhouse, in about ten or fifteen minutes after I had been there, Mr. Rogers came in, and finding that Mr. Wallis, his master, was then abusing me, he, Rogers, took it off his hands, and began himself to abuse me, using very illiberal language, calling me a dirty scoundrel and said that I was villainous liar, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160171"></xptr>dirty scoundrel, and I should be exalted, and said, you will be hanged, you dirty scoundrel, you will.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue this sort of language? - Near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any provocation, or any ill language at all? - Not the least, I never said one single word to him; I was once in a very parlous situation, for Mr. Willis, the master, swore that I should he put into the ton of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that this day? - Yes; and Rogers said that I should be exalted as high as the vats, the vats that contain the worts, I suppose they are seven or eight feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had thrown this abuse on you, did he do any thing to you? - I went to rest my book on the usual place, against the ledge of the window, to enter my survey, he walked before me, finding where I wanted to put my book, and turned his back against it, and prevented me, and still kept abusing me for a dirty scoundrel, and I desired him to stand on one side, he refused; I then addressed myself to Mr. Wallis, and requested that Mr. Wallis would either desire him to go out of the brewhouse, or command him to be silent, that I might take my survey, but Wallis made me no reply. On this, going to rest my book on the window, I laid my hand on him, and desired him to stand on one side, to let me put my book on the window, that I might take my survey, after having repeatedly desired his master to command him to be silent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your hand on him in any degree of force or violence? - None in the least, I had my book in one hand and the pen in the other, and this survey book, open in the place where it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. On that what did he do? - He struck me in the face, and repeated his blows several times, till Mr. Gregory pulled him off; he struck me on the eye, and cut my lip through, and other places about the face and head.</p>
               <p>Q. This must be done with his first then I suppose? - Yes, with his fist, his fist shut, his clinched fist.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows do you think he might give you? - He might give me six or seven, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they violent? - Yes, as violent as ever he could with his clinched fist, at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of the blow on the eye? - It was black, and I could not appear for eight or nine days, and I was obliged to apply conserve of roses to it, and other things, and I was otherwise injured about the side of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to return any blow to him? - I never returned one single blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, Mr. Jones, given him any provocation to do this? - None in the least, he had at the time before threatened to shoot me, and said that he loaded his pistols ready to shoot me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Mr. Rogers and you I believe were not on the best terms? - I considered myself on the best terms with the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some reason to think so; had there never been any connection before between you, in which you was the unfortunate party? - On the 3d of November last he took a warrant out against me, in consequence of my coming forward to give bail for Mr. Higgins.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no other reason?</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a dispute in November between you and Rogers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say you had some words with Waths, his master, before he came, and then when he came in he took it off his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence of that dispute was about a measurement or beer? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160172"></xptr>About a charge that was made by the supervisor and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not be sent for? - I heard Wallis say to some of the men in the yard, call Rogers; I believe he came in consequence of being sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and he quarrelled, I observed that in your manner of telling the story, you said that you put your hand against him; did you lay hold of him and pull him about, or any thing of that sort? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not threaten him to turn him out? - No, I did not, but I desired his master to send him out of the brew-house, or command him to be silent.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not suppose you can deny it, if it was so, that after you had actually put him out of the room, that Wallis said, why did you turn him out? and your answer was, why it shall not be long before I turn you out? - No, I desy any man to say so, and speak the truth about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect for what purpose you put your hand against him in that way? - I did as I said before, I wanted to put my book on the ledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you touch him? - He stood against the middle of the window, and I had not room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the place particularly chosen by you? - That was the place in Mr. Wallis's house where I always rest my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have a rule never to rest it but in one particular place; and so you softly put your hand against him? - To remove him from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not appear for some days, you was so hurt; did you go on with your survey at that time? - One of the officers surveyed for me that day, and the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make three days survey yourself? - I do not mean that it debarred me from doing my duty, I did do it, part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you might even on the very day, within an hour or two have gone to some other place to survey? - I made no survey till the following evening, six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to let me look at your book (looks at it) I see the article on the 29th, "Mr. Gregory on survey, obstructed in survey." How happened this to be put between the first article and the last? - I believe you will see.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go on with your business that same day or not? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Was this written the same time? Did you take any further survey that day or not? - To the best of my knowledge I did not; I went to the supervisor, and then to the excise office, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gregory had been there before you, and taken his survey? - I cannot take on me to say whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are supervisor? - No, I am not supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. From any conversation that has passed since, you really don't know whether he had taken his survey or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt whether he had or not? - I don't know, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not measure it, and Mr. Gregory did? - I did not see Mr. Gregory take a single gauge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whether Mr. Gregory before you went, had taken the survey? - Upon my oath I did not know, nor don't now know, nor ever asked to this moment.</p>
               <p>Court. The first article is, Mr. Gregory on survey; do you ever two survey together? - Yes, Mr. Gregory was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you found another officer there on survey, did you go on with a different survey? - I go on totally different; I don't know what he did, nor he don't know what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160173"></xptr>Q. Do you make a survey of the same articles as he makes a survey? - More officers than are appointed at that house, owing to the different offences discovered at that house.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to ask you is this, whether in point of usage, or in the line of your duty, it is the ordinary line of duty, to have two persons taking the survey; one after another? - Yes, it is the case in general throughout London, and in some houses there are three or four officers go one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you found one officer on survey, is it the common and ordinary mode of business of the excise, for you to proceed on the business of the survey, notwihstanding another officer is there? - 1l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. We have heard of a warrant when Rogers took out against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that warrant discharged when it came before the magistrate? - No, the magistrate said it was a trick warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not tell me just now, that the magistrate discharged that warrant? - No, I was bound over in in recognizance.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you put your hand against this man, to remove him from the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Were you an officer of the excise on the 29th of June at Mr. Wallis's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You see Jones and Rogers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what passed between Jones and Rogers on that day? -When I went into the brewhouse first, there was no person in the brewhouse; I took my gauges as usual, what was necessary to be done, and then spoke to Mr. Wallis, and told him of the irregularity .</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what passed between you and Mr. Wallis, tell us what past when Rogers came in? - Mr. Rogers said, you are a lying villain, you will be exalted as high as the vats, the board are tired of you, and you are a villain; Jones said, they have proved you one, and not an ingenious one neither; then Jones went towards the window, and put his hand towards Mr. Rogers's coat, for Rogers to go out of the way for him to write.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for you to put your book on this place to write? - It is a cleanish place, I have seen Jones do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? - Rogers then began to strike Jones about the face and head, he, Jone, endeavoured to screen his face as well as he could, till I came to his help, but he never struck or attempted to strike.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Rogers continue this beating of him? - He repeated a good many blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Jones get out of his clutches? - I stepped forward and pulled Rogers off, and that ended it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Jones after this? - His eye was very black, and his lip was cut.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Some days before this you had measured a gine, respecting which there was now a dispute. I believe you measured it twenty-one barrels and three firkins, did you not? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. However the fact is this, your measurement, and the measurement of Mr. Rogers agreed? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your measure and Mr. Jones's measure did not agree, Mr. Jones made it some barrels more than you? - Mr. Cooper did I believe, it was Mr. Cooper that found the increase, and pointed it out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper and Jones persisted in a higher measurement, and Mr. Wallis in a lower measurement; don't you know that Mr. Wallis's measurement agreed with your's? - I believe it might, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160174"></xptr>I have heard Mr. Rogers say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What you heard Mr. Rogers say what it was, is not what I am asking you; did it not agree with your measurement? - Yes, nearly thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones make any measurement of that? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Mr. Cooper? - The supervisor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was it not this dispute about the measurement, that occasioned the dispute with Jones and Rogers? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the beginning of the dispute that morning; Mr Jones and Mr. Wallis were quarrelling about this measurement? - Mr. Wallis abused Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones did not quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some sort of quarrel between Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallis, about this gile of beer? - Mr. Wallis said that Jones was a perjured rascal, and after that Mr Wallis sent for the men in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he send for, he sent for Mr. Rogers, did not he? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send likewise for Claridge? - Claridge came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other? - I don't remember any other.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came then the dispute continued between Rogers and Jones? - Rogers began to abuse Mr. Jones, and said he was a perjured villain.</p>
               <p>Q. That quarrel between Jones and Rogers likewise respected the former gile of beer, which was in dispute? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you first recollect a little more particularly about this dispute; did not Mr. Jones attempt to push Mr. Rogers out of the brewhouse? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he neither attempt to push or pull Mr. Rogers out of the brewhouse? -He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so, Mr. Gregory? - I always said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any otherwise to any body in your life? - I cannot say, I perhaps might.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your memory a little further? - I might.</p>
               <p>Q. What you are in the habit of giving different representations of a fact? - I was willing to say to any body that asked me about it, something short, something agreeable and pleasant; I was in a penlous situation then.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give a different representation of that fact? - I give the truth here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you given a false account? - It may be some of the neighbours have asked me a question.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons to whom you have given a total different account? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are swearing for your bread I will ask you no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The measurement was a matter that had passed some days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper took the measurement after you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper reported that he had found an increase? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which made Mr. Wallis very angry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That matter is now depending in the Court of Exchequer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So then before Rogers had began to abuse this man, Mr. Wallis was abusing him, and called him perjured villain, and then he called Rogers, and Rogers began to call him a perjured villain likewise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const addressed the jury on the part of the desendant.</p>

            , the tunman; and for Mr. Rogers, who was in the counting house; to bring his gauge book to shew Mr. Jones what he had got.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers had measured that gile of beer which was the subject of dispute? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Court. What was Rogers, one of your servants? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was your clerk, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Rogers came out of the counting house into the brewhouse, where you and Mr. Jones was, tell us what past between them? - I asked Mr. Rogers to look and see what he had got the gile of ale that was brewed the Friday before, to inform Mr. Jones what he had got.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the gile of ale the subject of dispute? - Yes, it was Mr. Rogers opened his book and told him that he had got twenty one barrels three sirkins, which was the whole of the gile; in consequence Mr. Rogers said, it was a rascally charge, Mr. Jones had made a charge of four gallons and a half more. There was some alteration between Mr. Rogers and Mr. Jones in conversation, and I believe there was such as, you lie, and you lie, on some former conversation or animosity that they had had before; and Mr. Jones said, you rascal, get out of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones said that to Rogers? - Yes. In consequence they had another word or two; but I was so much agitated by the officers charge, that I did not hear particularly what past. Mr. Rogers pointed up, and said, you will remember the vats for that; relating to some former matter, and Mr. Jones shut his book and held his book in his left hand, and took hold of him with his right hand, took hold of his coat below the lappel, with the knuckle part of his hand towards his body, and pushed him to the brewhouse door, with his elbow; in consequence of his pushing him down to the door, he forced Mr. Rogers against the post that the door hung upon, and the door still was between his legs; Rogers said to him,(he had still hold of his coat) you rascal, or you villain, or something to that purpose, take your hand off me, or I will strike you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he, prior to that time, struck Mr. Jones? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his hands off him? -He struck him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his hands off in consequence of that threat? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What past next? - Mr. Rogers struck Mr. Jones first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Rogers never struck Jones till he had previously pushed him to the door past, and he desired him to let him go? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he strike? - I believe it was two or three blows, for Gregory, who stood near, went and separated them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Rogers go then? - As soon as Rogers was loose he walked away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160176"></xptr>Q. Till Gregory intersered to part them, had Mr. Jones even let go of Rogers? - I believe he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you complained of this man having over charged you, and the magistrate dismissed the complaint I believe, in another instance besides this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There it went against you? - Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers was the witness for you on that occasion? - Yes, he surveved.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet Mr. Wallis was unfortunate there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So much for that. I take it for granted you were perfectly cool on this occasion, even before Rogers appeared? - I believe I told him it was a rascally charge, and he used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, did not you use such language as this, you are a perjured villain? - I did not abuse him very much, but I was rather warm, I am not accustomed to abuse Mr. Jones in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, where was it that Mr. Jones began to push Rogers? - It was between the first and third square, he had his back towards the square; Mr. Rogers stood with his back towards a window.</p>
               <p>Q. At which window Jones was going to finish his account? - It is the most ill convenient in the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. So Mr. Rogers likes the most ill convenient place in the brewhouse. Another thing, Rogers did not abuse Jones at all? - There was not much difference in their abuse I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you observed very accurately all that passed? - I believe I did, I was on the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told us a little while ago, you was agitated, you did not hear what past between them? - I did not, I was so agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you describe particularly all that passed. You did not interfere to take Jones from Rogers, your servant? - It was momentary, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know how far he pushed him? - It may be about three yards, or two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. So he laid hold of him, and was pushing him along? - He was; he had only got him by one hand, and pushed him with his elbow; he laid hold of the off side of his coat with his left hand, and his elbow just met him at his stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, you thought Jones was extremely wrong on this occasion? - Yes, I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never thought Rogers was any way wrong in the business? - Yes, in striking him. It is what I did not give any countenance to.</p>
               <p>Q. So Jones was active in pushing this man about, and when Rogers struck him he struck him again? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took all very quietly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps just sheltered his head? - No, I don't know that he did; he had hold of his collar at the time that he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Rogers hold of Jones's collar? - Yes, under the lappel.</p>
               <p>Q. So he was laying hold of the coat just under the lappel, and he had the elbow of the same arm in the stomach? - Yes, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. That was exactly the position in which they were? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Rogers striking him before he was taken off? - Not a minute hardly; he gave him two or three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not give him a black eye? It was not a black eye the moment that Rogers was taken off him? - I did not see him. The next day I see he had a black eye. I had no opportunity of seeing him then. Jones walked out directly and left the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you did not part with Jones on this occasion? - I did, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160177"></xptr>I'disapproved of his conduct in striking him.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you turned Rogers away the next day? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He is, however, in your service, is he not? - He is not, nor has been from that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately is it since he was a witness for you? - It was when we were at Guildford, about a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he is a witness for you in the Court of Exchequer? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many informations against you in the Exchequer? - There was one about six or seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there are informations against you to the amount of six or seven thousand pounds? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to compromise if there was any? - I did offer to settle it for a certain sum if there was any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you would offer to compromise any thing, rather than have a law suit in the Court of Exchequer? - I certainly would.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a cooper, I believe, to Mr. Wallis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being present, the 29th of June, at any dispute about the difference of measurement of beer at Mr. Wallis's brewhouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there before Rogers came in? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a difference in dispute, and Rogers compared his account with Mr. Jones's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that passed from the first of his coming in? - Mr. Wallis asked Mr. Rogers what he had got in his book? and he said, twenty-one barrels and three firkins.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the measure that had been before taken by the other officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did Mr. Jones make to that? - Mr. Jones did not make any answer. Mr. Wallis asked Mr. Jones where he had taken his account from, as he said there was no such quantity there; and he objected going, said, he had no business to go. He did not go, and then we sent for the tunman our of the yard, to correspond, for to ask him what he had got; and he said, no more than twenty-one barrels and three firkins. Then some conversation took place between Jones and the tunman; then Mr. Wallis sent by the tunman, for Mr. Rogers; and he brought up his book, and he said there were twenty-one barrels and three firkins, they all agreed; Mr. Rogers said, it is a rascally charge, there is no such thing on the premises; and Mr. Rogers said to Mr. Jones, you remember the vats, Jones. There was a summons to Guildford concerning the vats, what they held.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mistaking it for any thing else; you understood it so? - I did. With that Mr. Jones took hold of Mr. Rogers's coat; Rogers stood at that time against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did Jones do after that conversation? - He made up to Rogers, and took hold of his coat and shoved him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Jones say any thing at the time? - Not any thing. While he had hold of his coat he said, you rascal, get out of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time had Rogers struck or attempted to strike, or gone towards him in an attitude as if he meant to strike him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it the same instant as Mr. Wallis did? - I did. And Mr. Rogers made a reply, if you don't take your hand off, Mr. Jones, I will strike you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this said loud enough for every body to hear that was present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Gregory was present, then he must have heard it? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160178"></xptr>Q. Did he repeat it once or more than once? - I think twice, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. And that before he did strike him at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having so said, did he take his hands off? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Rogers afterwards struck him? -He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say whether during the time he struck him he still continued to hold him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he continued holding of him? - Just by lappel of his coat under his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he struck him twice, that is a fact? - Yes, he did, twice or three times, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Gregory, we are told, intersered, and he parted them? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Till Gregory interfered he still had hold of Mr. Rogers? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers went away? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Jones went away? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you see Jones afterwards have a black eye? - Yes, the next day he had. I did not see him that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that you and your uncle, Mr. Wallis, are on very excellent terms with Mr. Jones? - I have no occasion to be against Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you quarrelling with him, almost every day? - No, I do not speak a word to him, no further than he comes in and says, good morning, and I says the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Your uncle was extremely cool to him on this occasion? - He did talk to him concerning that gile of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. He talked to him as mildly as you and I talk together? - Really I do not recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect one part of the story and not the other? You do not recollect whether your uncle was in a passion with Jones or not? - He might be. He asked him where he found that quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath? - I cannot say on my oath. He did not seem in a passion when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he might be? - He might have been before that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what past when you was there? You know I know you. You have been before Mr. Bofauquet and other magistrates. Was not your uncle in a passion with Jones when you was there? - He was not when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say that he might have been in a passion? - I thought he might have been, concerning the beer, before that, but he was not at the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps your uncle was not in a passion, nor took any part in the transaction? - Yes, he might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind I speak at this very time. Was not your uncle very much agitated? - Yes, I dare say he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he was? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell that? - No, I cannot tell that; I did not hear him say any thing to Jones.</p>


               <p>Q. How near were you to your uncle? - About two yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so far from them as you are from me. On your oath, did not he call him a perjured villain? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself. On your oath, did not he call him a perjured villain or a rascal? - Not to my knowledge he did not; I did not hear any such a word while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Any word of abuse? - Not while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as any thing that you have told us? - It is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160179"></xptr>Q. Now, pray, what was Jones doing when Rogers was standing with his back against the window? - He had been to tell the casks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Jones to move up to where Rogers stood? - On account of Mr. Rogers speaking to him in that manner, telling him it was a rascally charge, and he might remember the vats.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never made any attempt to minute down any thing? - Yes, he did after the fray was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Jones stood after this affray was over to minute down his observations? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did Jones push Rogers? - Two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner? - He pushed him by his stomach against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Rogers strike him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He struck very gently, I suppose? - I do not suppose he struck very gently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him violently or not? - I cannot really say.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it? - Yes, I see it. He did not appear to strike hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he struck him? - Yes, under his eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Not hard? - It was not very hard to my appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Jones carry the mark of it? - I see it the next day afterwards, and the day after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones came to your house every day for a long time afterwards? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the next day following? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers had been a very good servant? - He was for any thing that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been your uncle's surveying officer before he was dismissed? - He had surveyed for him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was turned away the next day by your uncle? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remoustrate this with your uncle, that Jones was wrong in the beginning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you think Jones was wrong in the beginning? - He might be in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. He might be in the right, might not he? So you really formed no opinion in it at all, whether he was right or wrong. Your mind perhaps was passive on the occasion. I take it for granted you are perfectly indifferent about this defence, whether Rogers is convicted or whether he is acquitted, you don't care a pin about it? Where is the difficulty in telling us whether you care about the event of the prosecution? - It is nothing concerning me; it does not make any difference to me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are quite indifferent about it? - It cannot make any difference to me. I would wish to say right on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You never, for instance, desired people to come forward to be a witness on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care of that now. Have not you applied to people to be witnesses on this occasion? - No, I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never applied to Harris to be a witness on this occasion? - Yes; Mr. Wallis desired me to step up to him, and desire him to step down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. This thing will not affect you, let it go which way it will? - No, it will not.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend seems to understand something about your uncle's conversation. You was not present at the conversation between Wallis and Jones? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing passed between Wallis and Jones while you stopped? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the minute was made after the fray? - Yes, I see him make it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160180"></xptr>Q. You told my friend that you see him there the next day and day after, and every day in the course of his business? - To the best of my recollection he came every day.</p>

               <p>Q. Why would you, or why did you? - Why did you. Mr. Jones turned about and said, and I will turn you out, sir, before I have done with you. He said that to my master. That was all I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had Rogers lived with your master? - About three months. I am not certain; some where thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Q. You put it down? - I did not put it down; but my mistress bid me take notice what day of the month it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master ever speak to you on the subject? - My master asked me if I heard what was repeated? I said, yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they tell you to put down the words? - They did not; but she bid me to keep them in my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. She said then that you would be called upon, perhaps, to recollect them? - She said, in case I should be called upon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your mistress hear what past in the brewhouse? - No, she was up stairs in her own room, looking out of window along with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what account he gave you of this transaction at Mr. Wallis's, on the latter end of June, or the beginning of July? - He told me that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Jones had a kind of dispute, in the brewhouse, about something or other, and that Mr. Jones used, Mr. Rogers very ill, by pushing him out of the brewhouse. Mr. Rogers was sent for about an overcharge of four barrels and a half of beer, that Mr. Jones had made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you this unasked, or was any body about with whom he might be alarmed or afraid? - It was voluntary. And many times he has told me that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160181"></xptr>has not liked to be in that situation under Mr. Jones.</p>

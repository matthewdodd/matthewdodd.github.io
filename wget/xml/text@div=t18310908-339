            . I am a serjeant of Police. On the 31st of August the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse; he said his master sent him to the watchmaker's with the watch, and that he afterwards obtained it from the watchmaker, and hired a man to pawn it at Griffiths'.</p>

The prosecutor was drinking at a public-house at Newport-Pagnell, and, pulling out the watch, said he would not sell it for seven guineas - and then said, "I shall make my servant a present of it," and he gave it me - I did not much like the place - I came to town, and pawned it; I returned into the country, and heard there was a reward offered for me - I then told him where the watch was pawned.</p>

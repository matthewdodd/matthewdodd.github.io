               <p>CHARLES MUNNS. On the 28th of July, I was in Sydney's-alley. The officer came and asked me if I had had any thing taken from my pocket. I felt, and missed my handkerchief from my right-hand coat pocket. I had it about three minutes before - here it is; they had the prisoners in custody with it.</p>

            . About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 28th of July, I saw the prisoners in the courts leading from Leicester-fields to St. Martin's-lane, following a gentleman; the prosecutor came by, and they pressed up against him. I saw Cowden do something, and then put something into his breeches and go away - they then took to the left hand, and the prosecutor the right. I sent Reardon to tell the prosecutor, and took the prisoners into a public-house. I then took off Griffin's hat and found the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GRIFFIN. Q. I was not in company with Cowden? A. Yes, you was for a quarter of an hour backwards and forwards through the courts. I had seen them in Long-acre before they saw the prosecutor.</p>

I did not see them do any thing; but I saw them leave him at the end of the alley, and they turned off to Bear-street. I then went and told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COWDEN'S Defence. I was coming from work. I saw something on the ground, and kicked it before me. I then took it up, and saw it was a handkerchief. I met this young man at the corner of Bear-street, talking to a woman - I shewed it to him, and he said he would give me a pot of beer for it.</p>
               <p>GRIFFIN'S Defence. I live in Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. I met a young woman, and stood talking to her at the corner of Bear-street; the prisoner came to me, and said he had found this handkerchief, which he would sell. I said I would give him a pot of beer for it, and we were going to have it, when the officers came up and took us.</p>

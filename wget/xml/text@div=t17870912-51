            ; on the 6th of last month, I went out in the morning; and when I came home between one and two, I went up stairs to lay my child down, and I found the prisoner at the bar in my room; I asked her what she wanted there; and she said, she wanted one Mrs. Green, a mantua-maker; I told her there was no such person lived there, and I desired her to walk down stairs after me, which she did; and when I went up stairs again, I missed the gown and the sheet; the gown hung upon the line near the door, and the sheet lay upon the box near the door; I did not miss any thing else; I ran down stairs directly, and had her apprehended, but nothing was found upon her, and she was taken before Justice Walker and committed; I never lock the door of my room, it was open.</p>

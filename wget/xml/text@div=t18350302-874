                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Smith, he lives at Brixton, and keeps a baker's shop. On the 7th of February, the prisoner came there between one and two o'clock in the day—she bought a quartern loaf, which came to 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave me half-a-crown—I put it in the till, in a bowl which we have there—I am quite certain there was no other half-crown there, and I did not put any other half-crown in before that was taken out—I saw my husband take it out—no one had been to the till, and I am quite satisfied that the one my husband took out, was the one I re<lb></lb>ceived of the prisoner—on the Friday following I was sent for to go to Mrs. Mather's, about six or seven o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner there, and said she was the person who had been in my shop—she said she never had been there—I gave the half-crown which I took of the prisoner to Woodward, the constable.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 11, Chandos-street, Covent Garden. On Thursday the 16th of October, between the hour of twelve and one o'clock, as I was returning home along the Strand, the prisoner accosted me with open arms, and clasped me round the body, she let go my body and took hold of my arm; we walked on to <placeName id="t18061029-4-crimeloc24">Villiers Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What part was it you first saw her. - A. About twenty yards from Villier-street, I stopped there two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and she stood there about two or three minutes. - A. Yes; during which time I put my hand into my breeches pocket, I found only a four halfpence and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was standing with her. - A. Yes, I immediately charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put your hand in your pocket while you was standing with her. - A.I felt her hand to my hip, I immediately conceived she had robbed me; at that time she had got my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the watch. - A. About twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the prisoner Leary. - A. Yes; he came directly, I called him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she or you make the stand at Villier-street, who proposed stopping there. - A. I do not think there was any proposal about it, she stopped first, and I told the watchman she had robbed me, he said you both must come to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both go. - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass as you were going along - A. I believe the prisoner spoke once or twice to the watchman, I did not hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leary go with you to the watchhouse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in. - A. I cannot say that he did, if he did it was only for a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the officer there. - A. Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see Pilgrim do. - A. Pilgrim searched the watchman and found a guinea in one of his cuffs, and two guineas, two half crowns, and sixpence, out of the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>In what situation were you. - A. I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all. - A. I had been drinking, but I could tell what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. You could just do that. - A. Yes, I had drank two or three glasses of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last perceive the money in your pocket. - A. When I was at the house in Pall Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you left the house. - A. About twenty minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket was it in. - A. In my right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot pretend to swear to guineas. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>- PILGRIM sworn. Your wife searched her and found nothing abot her person. - A. Yes. I searched him, I found in his right cuff a guinea; at the same time the constable had got hold of his left arm, I saw him take out of the left cuff two guineas, two half crowns and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Leary's Defence. He knows me to be an honest man, Mr. Holmes came to me about an hour and a half after; I took her to the watch-house; I know not how the money was conveyed into my cuff.</p>

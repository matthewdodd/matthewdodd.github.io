                  </hi>. I live in Green-street, Leicester-square. I have known the prisoner about two years—in October, 1835, he kept the George public-house, Castle-street—I served him with bread—when he left, about the 28th of March, 1836, he owed me a bill of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 27th of September, he called, and said he came to pay his little bill, and gave me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by J. Harris, in favour of Mr. George Fifth, on the Borough Bank—I gave him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and the receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I do not know his writing—he said he had indorsed his name on the back of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Weston and Young, of the Borough Bank. We keep no account with a person of the name of Harris—we had bad an account with the prisoner, but it was closed in 1834—I do not know his handwriting—he has not kept an account since I have been in the house, which is seven months.</p>

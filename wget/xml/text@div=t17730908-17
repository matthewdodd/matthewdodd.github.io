            . On the first of June, about a quarter after nine at night, I was stopt in a post-chaise about a mile and a half, or two miles beyond <placeName id="t17730908-17-crimeloc91">Paddington</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17730908-17-crimeloc91" type="placeName" value="Paddington"></interp>

               <p>Q. How long might the robbery take up?</p>
               <p>Carter. Only the time he was asking me those two questions; he was in a hurry; the moon shone; it wanted but three days of being at the full; and I am told it was a fine night; I did not take particular notice, I could be almost positive to the prisoner; except it was its being by moon light, that is the only reason why I can't be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason in your own mind to doubt of it; or does seeing the prisoner correspond with the idea you have in your own mind?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080016"></xptr>Carter. Every time I see him, I think him more and more to be the man; he was taken up about the first week in August.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot yourself recollect whether it was a fine night or not; was you not in a hurry of spirits?</p>
               <p>Carter. I saw him stop the horses before he came to me; respecting the night it was not a rainy night, neither was it particularly dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Your recollection does not serve you to say whether it was a fine night or not?</p>
               <p>Carter. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The robbery was a very short time about?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the man to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Carter. At the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you?</p>
               <p>Carter. It could not be above three or four minutes; I had an apprehension of his coming, when I saw him stop the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take a view of the horse?</p>
               <p>Carter. I did take particular notice of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot tell whether it was a fine night or not, can you say what the colour of the horse was?</p>
               <p>Carter. I cannot be positive to that; I have another reason to suspect it to be the same; at the time he robbed me, the horse was particularly shy and spirited; when I saw the horse I desired them to ride him up and down the ride, which they did: and he appears to me to be a shy, spirited horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Carter. The first of June; I went that very night to Sir

               <p>Carter. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. A middle sized man is a man that is not remarkably tall or remarkably short: you can hardly venture to say, that seeing a brown coat by moon light you could swear to that coat by day light?</p>

            . I took the prisoner at Hendon on the 3d of August; he was in bed with his wife, or the person he lives with; I found in the pockets of his clothes on the bed a brace of loaded pistols; and by the side of the bed I found another loaded pistol in a box; the box was not locked; in his waistcoat pocket I found two purses, one had eight or nine guineas; I think in the other four and a watch chain; the horse was in a stable at the back part of the house; Mr. Bond took him out; when it was brought to the door, the prisoner said it was his horse, and he has asked for it several times since; it is a sorrel horse with a bald face; it is pretty spirited, and jumps about, but it is not a very good one; the horse was put at the sign of the George in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter. I saw the horse at the stable near Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Court. You must ascertain the horse (the horse is sent for)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Carter. Did you at all take notice of the pistol?</p>
               <p>Carter. The pistol at the time appeared to me to be longer than either of there that are produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter and Heley return into Court after having been out to inspect the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Carter. Have you seen the horse?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the same horse?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You can't be positive?</p>
               <p>Carter. I can be positive as to the marks, the colour, and the natural spirit of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Heley. Is the horse Mr. Carter has now seen, the same that you say the prisoner acknowledged to be his when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Heley. It is.</p>

               <p>I bought this horse of one Hawkes who lived in Paddington at the same time I did; since the time of the robbery Hawkes's father took him to a fair to sell; and he could not sell him, so I bought him.</p>
               <p>Court. Is Hawkes here?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was taken up for robbing on the highway, and has escaped out of gaol.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called a woman, who said her name was

                  </hi>. At the time in question I kept the Griffin, in Church-street, in the Borough—I now live at Notting-hill. On the 25th of September I was sitting in the bar-parlour, taking wine with a friend—the prisoner and his brother stood at the bar—they had been in the house all the evening, I believe—I invited them to take a glass of wine—they came and sat down and drank—my friend left while they sat with me—my attention was called to a disturbance at the bar, and I left the prisoner and his brother in the parlour—I took my watch, ring, and a bag, containing the money stated, and gave them to my wife, who took them into the bar parlour—I turned the parties out of the house who made the disturbance, and then returned, and sat down with the prisoner and his brother—they left between one and two o'clock—there had been no<lb></lb>body in the bar but them and my wife—the prisoner sat by the side of the drawers—nobody could go to them without his seeing them—shortly after they were gone the bag of money was missing from the drawer—my watch and ring were there—among the half-sovereigns I lost there was one which I had rubbed on the rim, and I should know it among a hundred—I have since seen one produced by the constable, and am confident it is the same—I selected it from nine others at the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

               <p>If you was a good deal frightened, as you have told us, do you think that you could venture to swear that that man is the man that robbed you, knowing that his life is at stake? - I am very cautious he is the person and no other.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know it wanted precisely ten minutes to twelve? - About a minute after I was robbed I met the runner, and I told him, and he said let us look at the time, and he pulled out his watch and said it wanted ten minutes of twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you tell him who you was robbed by? - I told him by Williams; the officer went to the watch-house to call some other men.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Last Wednesday night, a little before twelve, I was going home to my lodgings with the last witness, he was before me a few yards, I saw somebody stop him, and a man came and hit me over the left arm with something in a scabbard; I thought I would give him my money, and another man came up, then I thought I would not give him the money, and I knocked him down, and my hat fell off, and the man that I supposed robbed Pickett, he put my hat on my head.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there were three? - There were two with me, and the one that was with him came and put my hat on.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he do that? - I suppose he was afraid I should take him, as I had knocked the other down.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of them? - I think the prisoner is the man that put my hat on, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>How comes that, was it light enough to see him? - Yes, but I never saw any of them before, and therefore I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What may you be? - A Carpenter by trade, we work together.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a carpenter? - I have been eleven years out of my time.</p>
               <p>Was you ever on ship-board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you a witness last sessions? - I never was in this place before.</p>
               <p>Court. These are the civilest highwaymen I ever met with, the one is knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070123"></xptr> down, and the other comes and puts the witness's hat on.</p>
               <p>They came and met you did they? - The prisoner met me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I shall prove the prisoner twenty miles from town.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was so dark you could not see them? - I could not know them well enough to swear to them.</p>
               <p>How long were they with you? - I dare say they were half a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. You see Gentlemen, the other witness said four minutes, this man says he could not see them to know them, and the other could.</p>
               <p>Court. Which way were they coming? - They met me as I was going towards my home, they certainly must be coming the other way.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Be kind enough to be very accurate and certain, which way were you going and which way were they going when you joined together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, now he has been in Court and heard the other man's evidence!</p>
               <p>Court. He gave his evidence very positive at first.</p>

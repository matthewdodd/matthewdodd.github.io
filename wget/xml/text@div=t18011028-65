               <p>Q. Was Collins gone before you weighed any part of the hemp that was brought by him in the waggon to your premises? - A. Yes, and the waggon gone away; but Armstrong and Ray went after him, and took him on the road; I went with the officers to Griffiths's house on the Saturday following, in consequence of information, and saw some hemp in his dwelling-house, and some in the adjoining house in the garret, which appeared to be of the same quality with the hemp I had lost; Griffiths was asked by the officer, whether he had a bill of parcels from where the hemp came; there was a file with bills of parcels; I looked over them, but there was nothing relative to my business, and he pretended he did not know the person who brought it to him; I was not present when the hemp was weighed into the waggon; Livingstone was the man who superinteded the loading, I trusted him with that business; I suppose the waggoner was to obey his orders; Livingstone has absconded; Griffiths is a twine-spinner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter by trade, and a porter, or what I can get to do: On Wednesday, the 2d of September, I was passing by Shoreditch church about three o'clock, and a man was trying to get a load on his back, but he could not, he was so much in liquor; there were two men, but I did not know either; the drunken man said, he would give me a shilling, if I would carry it into Cock-lane; there were two loads done up in mans, one of which I was to carry; we went up Church-street, and he could not find his home; he then said, it was in High-street, Mile-end New-Town; I carried one bundle there, and it was lodged at Griffiths's the prisoner; nothing passed between Griffiths and me, and help me to take the other bundle, which was left under a window in Cock-lane; we went back, and took it to Griffiths's; we left it in a room where they were drink<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280057"></xptr>ing tea; I left them there, and the man paid me.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - I belong to Worship-street, and apprehended Griffiths on the 5th of September; I informed him I had a warrant to search his house for hemp; he went with me to his dwelling-house, and said, he kept none there, but in the next house; we went to the garret of the next house, where he dressed hemp, and we found a quantity which Mr. Allanson believed to be his, and we brought it away; he shewed me the place; there was some matting in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I am a Police officer, and was with Ray; Griffiths, me, and his wife, were in their house, when Pike came in, and said, it was here that I left the hemp; the wife then said, it was not you that brought it, it was a drunken man; and Griffiths said to his wife, you say nothing at all; there was a quantity of hemp in a bag in the other house; it is what twine-spinners use.(The hemp produced).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burton.) Was the hemp you saw at Griffiths's, in a dressed state? - A. It was just ruffed over a tool; that in the waggon was tied up in large heads, and this had been cut open, worked into handfuls, and laid down, but I take it to be of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the business of a twine-spinner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hemp, at the time it came to your master's, in a state fit for the twine-spinner? - A. After being dressed; this is not in a state for use; a dresser does that, but some twine-spinners can dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allanson. I believe this to be of the same quality that I lost.</p>
               <p>Collins's defence. I can say no more, than I delivered it to Mr. Allanson's foreman; I had no note to go with it; I delivered those two mats to the foreman, and when I came to the warehouse, I unloaded about half the waggon; I said, I had delivered two mats of hemp, and the foreman said, who to; I told him directly, to the foreman that came with me to see it delivered safe; when I got it unloaded, I was going to get a pot of beer, when the officers came, and took me; I said, I had delivered it to two men, but they took me up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That which is worked up you don't mean to speak to? - A. I speak to the quality of this in my hand; I don't think this is of the same quality as the other.</p>

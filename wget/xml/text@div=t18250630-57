In consequence of some suspicion I marked 4 l. in silver, which I put into the till on Sunday night, the 26th of June; I counted it again about nine o'clock on Monday morning: I saw it again on Tuesday morning, but did not count it, but it appeared to be all right; I cannot state what description of money it was; there were crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. About ten o'clock on Tuesday morning I came up from the cellar, and saw the prisoners with two others in the bar, and my cousin, Sparkall, was looking out money for them; I went into the yard for about five minutes - when I came in again they were all still there; I took the bag out of the till, and carried it up stairs to count the money; I missed 14 s. 6 d. - I then came down, and sent for an officer: Lee was searched in my presence; 14 s. 6 d. was found in his right-hand breeches pocket, which I could swear to; there were seven shillings, five sixpences, and two half-crowns; he said he had no objection to being searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the man sitting in the bar? A. Yes, he was. He produced the money himself, and laid it on the table - when I came into the room I spoke to him; he saw me take the bag and go up stairs with it. The prisoners had been there on Monday, after I counted the money; some other persons had been there on the Tuesday morning.</p>

            . I live in the house. I did not know of this money being marked till I heard of it on the Tuesday morning. The prisoners came in together between nine and ten o'clock, and two other persons had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300020"></xptr>come in just before them; one of them called for a glass of ves, and the other for a bottle of ginger beer; Lee then asked me if I had any new shillings; I said I would see: I opened the till, and took out the bag, which I laid on the counter; Lee stood by my side. I took the silver to the mouth of the bag, took it in my hand, and picked out a new shilling, and gave him - I suppose I might be five minutes doing this; I did not see him take anything: my arm was on it all the time; he put his hand to the corner of the bag, and might have taken it without my seeing him - I did not see him take more than four or five to look at, which he returned. I had my eye upon the money, and did not leave the bar while the men were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been absent from the bar on the Monday? A. Yes; and the prisoners had been there that day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and found 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. on the prisoner Lee - he took it out of his pocket himself, and laid it on the table; I kept the marked money, and returned the other to him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BODEN re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner a sovereign about him? A. No, nothing but the 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. in silver. I did not search his fob.</p>

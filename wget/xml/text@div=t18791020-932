                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Edward Lewis, solicitor, of 52, Old Broad Street—on Wednesday, 8th October, after purchasing a copy of <hi rend="italic">Town Talk</hi> at the office I inquired for Mr. Bosenberg—he came from a group of three or four others in the same room in which I pur<lb></lb>chased the copy—I said, "Are you Mr. Bosenberg?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Are you the publisher of this paper?" referring to the imprint at the bottom of the number that I had bought, dated 4th October—he Said, "Yes, I am; what is it, is it an action for libel?"—I said, "I really cannot say what it is"—he laughed at me, and appeared particularly pleased, and said, "I don't care if it is five or six"—I replied, "Very well," and left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The alleged libels were as follows</hi>: On 30th August, "A petition has been filed in the Divorce Court by Mr. Langtry. H.R. H. the Prince of Wales and two other gentlemeu, whose names up to the time of going to press we have not been enabled to learn, are mentioned as co-respondents. We have been informed that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales and Lord Lonsdale and Lord Londesborough are the co-respondents in the suit." On 7th September, "No attempt has been made to contradict the state<lb></lb>ment published in these columns last week as to the Langtry divorce case; and my readers may be assured that it was no invention. I now learn that a few weeks ago an application was made that the case be tried in camera, and I believe the learned judge acceded to the request." On 13th September, "I am informed that the Langtry divorce case will be one of the first tried when the Court reopens in November. It has been finally decided to try the case in camera, and so scandal-mongers will be deprived of a fine opportunity. Mrs. Langtry has, I understand, filed an answer denying the adultery, and as far as I can learn the petitioner will find it exceedingly difficult to make good his case. Anyhow at present I will give no opinion either of the petition or the defence. Of course there will be a great outcry against the case being tried privately, but I don't see why any one need be dissatisfied, especially as the details are not likely to be creditable to us as a nation. I don't care about being more explicit." On 20th September, "I am informed that the Home Secretary has warned managers of the music-halls against allow<lb></lb>ing comic singers making any reference to the Langtry divorce case. The press has always, of its own account, refrained from commenting on cases while they are sub judice; now, comic singers will be compelled to hold their tongues." On 27th September, "Labby says in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> he read in a 'French paper' that Mr. Langtry is petitioning for a divoice from his wife. Why doesn't Labby tell the truth, and say he read it in <hi rend="italic">Town Talk</hi>? He furthermore says there is no truth in the statement. Let me tell him there is none in his. If Labby will take the trouble to go to Scmerset House he will be able no doubt to see the petition. If he doesn't care to bother himself so much as that, let him ask their lord<lb></lb>ships, Londesborough and Lonsdale." "Jenkins, of the <hi rend="italic">Nurdin and Peacock Review</hi>, says he looked through the list of causes set down for hearing in the Divorce Court, and he didn't see the case of 'Langtry v. Langtry.' Of course not, you dunderheaded idiot. The case is to be tried privately, an application for hearing it in camera having been made and consented to as far back as January last." On 8th October, "I am now informed, on authority which I have no reason to doubt, that Mr. Langtry has withdrawn the petition which he had filed in the Divorce Court. The case of 'Langtry v. Langtry and Others' is, therefore, finally disposed of, and we have probably heard the last of it. It is useless for the sixpenny twaddlers to deny that Mr. Langtry ever filed a petition. He did, and, as I have said before, an application was made to Sir James Hannen to hear it privately, and he consented. I am told also that it is not at all unlikely that Mr. Langtry will shortly be appointed to some diplomatic post abroad. It is not stated whether his beautiful consort will accompany him."</p>

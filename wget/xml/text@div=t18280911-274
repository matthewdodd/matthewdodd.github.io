            . I am the wife of James Hale. The prisoner lodged in my house on the 27th of December - she came in intoxicated, I helped her up stairs, and unlocked her door; I was going to put her to bed; I let down the bedstead, and missed the articles stated, which I had let to her with the room - I charged her with taking them; she said if I would he merciful to her I should lose nothing, but I have not seen the duplicates, nor got the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left the room in November; my father-inlaw went to pay the rent, and was rather intoxicated; she said he had better stop there, and he did - he lived in the room, and lives there now. Witness. They came at two o'clock in the morning, very tipsy, and I missed the things.</p>

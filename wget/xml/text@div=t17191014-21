             a Dyer in to his Glass. Pritchards House till they came to 30 or 40 piece and then took them away together, and that Joseph Lawrence, who was Mr. Pritchards Servant had stolen great many pieces out of his Masters Warehouse, and particularly that mentioned in the Indictment, and pawned it at the Prisoners; and to prove that he knew the Goods to be stole it was deposed that they where white Goods, and of such a sort that any bad, would have given ready Money within a Shilling of the Value for them; that they were worth 35 s. and pawn'd for 15 s. that when they went to the Prisoners to demand them, his Wife and Servant denyed they had any such, saying they never took in white Goods; but when the Constable produced his Search Warrant and would have gone up Stairs, they said he need not, their Servant should go up, and if there was any such thing should bring it down, that the Prosecutor gave the Prisoner notice to appear at Lawrence's Tryal, but he did not. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded that his Man took in the piece of Shalloon in his absence and enter'd it in the Name of William James, that he had kept it two Years, which he should not have done if he had known it to be stole, but have made the most of it. His Servant deposed that when they came to demand the Goods, he ask'd where William Jones was; they told him in Newzate; that he went up and fetcht the Piece down very readily; but they enquir'd after another piece, which they had not, and offer'd them freely to search: he produced the Book, where it was regularly enter'd, and the Note, in Court, and further deposed that the Prisoner who brought the Goods to pawn told him his Name was William Jones, and that they were his own Goods. It was also deposed that the prosecutor sent to the prisoner to tell him that if he would give so much. Money there should be no prosecution; and that one had been undyed Goods sold by a Hotpresser . That Mr. Chambers found one piece of Goods and sent it to the prosecutor who changed him with 3 pieces, and took 5 l. for the other two pieces and gave a Receipt for the same. The prisoner called several to his Reputation, viz. one of the Justices upon the Bench, who deposed that he was his Neighbour, and that when any brought Goods to the prisoner to pawn, whom he suspected, he used to bring them before him; Others that the prisoner was very careful in taking in pawns, and that he used to send his Servant to enquire after the Truth of what the persons whom he question'd told him; and that once he stopt Goods to the value of 50 l. and Advertised it in the Gazatte, whereby the Owner had them again.

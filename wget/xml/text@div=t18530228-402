                  </hi>. I am a wine and beer merchant, and live at No. 132, Thames-street. The prisoner was in my employ as cellarman, and I had a boy beside—the prisoner had no authority whatever from me to remove any of my bottles—I could not say positively that I missed any bottles—on 19th February I had retired up stairs from dinner, and I was called down—I came out by the side-door, and observed some prickles up against the back-door, and I overheard either the prisoner or the boy say in a subdued tone, "There is master! there is master!"—the prickles were piled up very high directly in the passage leading to the door, so as entirely to obscure the back-door—they were apparently a screen to prevent observation—I went round behind these baskets or prickles, and saw the prisoner and the boy there (their duty was to be in the cellar)—I said, "What are you about here?"—the prisoner said, 'I am clearing up the place, Sir; I know you like to have the place clear, I thought I would do it by daylight"—I asked him if anybody had ordered him to come up from his work, and he answered in the negative—I directed him and the boy to go back in the cellar and go on with their work of bottling off</p>

I am a waterman at a cab-stand in Thames-street, On 19th Feb., about half past 2 o'clock, the prisoner came to me at the stand; he said, "Do you know a young man here named Charley, a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, a black-haired fellow?"—I said, "Yes;. but he is not here"—he said he wanted him to go with three baskets of wine bottles to Holborn—I said I was doing nothing, I did not mind going myself—I went to Fann-court, Miles-lane; a truck was there, and the prisoner and another loaded the truck with three baskets of battles—the prisoner gave me this paper—I did not see him write it—I cannot read the writing—I know it is the same paper—I go by the letters on it—it looks like the paper—I took it to Red Lion-street, and gate it I to Mr. Garrod—I left the bottles, and brought the empty truck back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bottle merchant, and live in Red Lion-street, Holborn. About 4 o'clock on Saturday, 19th Feb., I received three baskets of bottles; they were brought by the last witness and another man, whom I do not know—they were brought in a truck, and this paper was brought with them—I gave the policeman the same baskets and bottles that were brought—I suppose this is one of the baskets—I have known the prisoner three or four years—I did not see him that day—I do not know whose writing this paper is; I never saw the prisoner write—he worked for a man named Rowe, some few years ago—here is on this paper," J. Quinlan, at Rowe's"—I had not seen the prisoner before the bottles were brought; I did not expect them at all—I did not count how many bottles there were—we usually</p>

               <p>put six dozen quart bottles in a basket, and twelve dozen of the pints; but the baskets were very full, and there probably might bate been more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old; I have been in the employ of Mr. Eastby about twelve months. On a Thursday, I do not know the day of the month, I was at work with the prisoner in the cellar—he said in the morning, "I should like to have a few halfpence, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—he said he wanted a pair of boots very badly for himself, and a pair for his wife—he said, "There are a few bottles up stairs, which I think I am entitled to have, because I brought seventeen or eighteen dozen from a gentleman's house at Winchmore-hill"—(Mr. Eastby has allowed us to bring home bottles to make up the stars)—I said I should not like to do it, unless Mr. Eastby was aware of it—he did not tell me how many bottles there were, pints and quarts together—I asked him—he said he did not know—I asked him how much he would get for the pints and quarts—he said he should not get more than 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for the pints, and the quarts he did not know how much he should get for—he said, "I will give you some of it"—I did pot see the witness Farmer—I wrote this paper at the prisoner's request, and gave it him on the Saturday, between 2 and 3 o'clock—he told me what to write—I wrote" Mr. Garrod, bottle merchant, Red Lion-street, Holbom"—I did not see the bottles put in the baskets—he did not tell me how many there were in each basket—I law three baskets; but there were more than three baskets behind the door, and they were filled with bottles—I did not tell my master, because the prisoner said he thought he was entitled to them; so I did not think it any harm to write the bit of paper—I believed the prisoner was entitled to all the bottles that came from Winchmore-hill, because he was the cellarman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When he said he was entitled to all the bottles that came from Winchmore-hill, do you mean all the overplus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when we go for bottles we sometimes bring more than the number, and the overplus is supposed to be the perquisite—he gave me to understand that there were more bottles brought away than should be—I saw them—the carman and he went to Winchmore-hill with wine—when we are sent with wine, we are sent to the cellar to bring away empty bottles, and Mr. Eastby has told us to bring more than the number for stars—Mr. Eastby does not give his men the bottles; but it is considered to be the perquisite of the men—at Miller's they give the men a penny a dozen for their own bottles—the prisoner said afterwards that they were his own bottles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Eastby gives his men wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but he does not allow his men to take any of these bottles that I am aware of—when he tells his men to bring more bottles they are for him, not for the men—these bottles come from customers whom he has formerly supplied with full bottles, and he takes these empty bottles again.</p>

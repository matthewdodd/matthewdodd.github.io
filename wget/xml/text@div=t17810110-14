               <p>I took the prisoner about half after eight o'clock on Saturday morning the 23d of December. I came out of a gate of my father's yard, who is a dyer, in <placeName id="t17810110-14-crimeloc76">Gosswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Where was the bag? - In the middle of the street. I came up to them and asked the prisoner if he belonged to that cart? He said yes. There was a cart standing by. I saw part of it come out of the cart. I went about five yards farther, and heard the other man bid him lift the bag on his shoulder. He did so, and shut the cart door. Then I went up to the prisoner again and asked him where he was going with the cart? He said to Watkins's, the dyer. I asked him where that was. He gave no answer to that; then I suspected he did not belong to the cart, and took him into custody. I asked where the carman was? He said at the publick-house, and he would fetch him. I said he should not, and took him about twenty yards up my father's yard, and I met the carman and asked if he had lost a wrapper? He went to the cart, and said he had. I told him to go up the street and he would overtake the other man. He did, but could not meet with him; he got clear off with the goods. I told him I saw the prisoner take the things out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take the things out of the cart? - Yes; it was all in one piece. I saw part of it come out of the cart and he pushed it into the bag.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of December I lost thirty yards of woollen cloth out of my cart. I saw it in the cart when I went into Mr. Seward's yard. I went up to ask a question. There was a load of hay, I could not get my cart up the yard; coming back I met the last witness; he asked me if I had lost any thing? I went to the cart, and missed the cloth. He said he saw two men putting it into a black bag, and that one of them was gone up Compton-street, opposite the yard, and the other he had secured. I ran up Compton-street after the man and made enquiry, but could hear nothing of him.</p>

               <p>The other man stopped me and asked me to help him up with the bag. I know nothing of it. I helped him up and he went away with it. This man came up and stopped me. He would not stop the man who had the property.</p>
               <p>To Mulgrave. What did he say when he was charged with it? - He flatly denied that he knew any thing of it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called his father and mother who gave him a good character.)</p>

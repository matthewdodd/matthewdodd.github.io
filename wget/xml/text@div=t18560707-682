                  </hi>. I am registrar for the district of St. Saviour's, Southwark. I produce the register, containing An entry of a marriage on 13th Jan., 1852, between Thomas William Blewitt, of full age, bachelor, clothier, of Tower-street, Lambeth, and Mary Shields, of full age, widow, tea dealer, of——street, Lambeth, married by banns, by S.

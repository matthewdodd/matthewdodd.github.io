                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Jacobson, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner Woolf is my son by a former husband—for some time before this he had been away from home—the female prisoner came to me for the purpose of reconciling us, and inducing me to receive him—she made trifling purchases, but she said she did not come for that—she knew my son was in distress and poverty, and I agreed to receive him again—he came, and about a fortnight after, be quitted the house very suddenly, but was only away a few minutes—we sent to the female prisoner to know if she had seen him—she came soon after, and said she hoped we would never suppose that she would encourage him coming there, as she had heard what she had before and what she now heard—I had missed articles for some time before this—the evening Mrs. Ghost came to ask for his return I remember her looking at a coral necklace—she inquired the price, and admired it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I have the fellow snap to it—I know these other goods—they are all mine, but not a fifteenth part of what is gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness. The prisoner Woolf returned to our house in February, after being absent some time—I slept up stairs, and he down stairs—one morning, about a fortnight after him return, he went out, leaving the errand-boy there—when he came back I asked where he had been—he said, nowhere; he had been to take a pair of boots—I went to Mrs. Ghost's, and asked whether he had been there—she denied it—I left, and went again, and asked her whether he had not been there—she said, "No"—I said, "He says he left a pair of trowsers on the stairs," and I said, "You brought this boy back again on purpose to rob me"—she said, "No, Sir, I never encourage him to come here"—I missed about £200 worth of articles in the fortnight after his return—I had him taken up—he denied stealing them all along, and all connexion with Mrs. Ghost.</p>

I am a constable of Marlborough-street Police-office I went to the premises of Mrs. Ghost, No. 338, Oxford-street, where she lodges, in company with Mr. Jacobson—I asked her whether Woolf had at any time brought watches or articles of jewellery there—the said "Never"—I asked whether she had got any there belonging to him—she said, "No"—I asked whether she had any objection to my searching the root—she said, "Not the least;" I might search it; but on searching a drawer in the room she suddenly snatched hold of something, which proved to be this necklace, and something else she had in the other hand, which I did not observe—we had a violent struggle for the necklace—she said it was her own, and she had bought it—she then sat down, and I thought I perceived her putting something under her apron—I felt under, and these articles were under her apron, on her knees—here are some clasps and jewels, with the stones removed, which the prosecutor has identified—after I found the things, she said that Woolf had left them there.</p>

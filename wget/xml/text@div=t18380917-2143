On the 29th of August I was going down the Commercial-road, and fell in with the prisoner—she took me to some apartments—I stopped there a little time—I paid her for the time I was in company with her, and when we went out together I asked her if she would take a glass of any thing to drink, but she ran off, and left me standing there against the door—then missed my watch.</p>

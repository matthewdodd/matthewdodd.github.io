                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bell, who keeps the Blakeney's Head, in Whitechapel. On Monday, 6th March, the two prisoners came in together in front of the bar, a little after 7 o'clock in the evening—they called for half a quartern of gin and a screw of tobacco, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they drank the gin together, and the female paid me with a shilling—I gave her change, a sixpence, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I put the shilling into the till—it is a draw out till, and I am quite sure there was no other shilling there—the prisoners remained there—my husband came out of the parlour for change, and I gave him the shilling, which was the only shilling there—he discovered that it was bad—he threw it on the counter, and said, "What have you got here?"—I put the shilling on a shelf in the bar parlour by itself—in consequence of this, I kept my attention on the prisoners, who were still there in the house—Hudson then called for another half quartern of gin, and another screw of tobacco—he gave me a shilling; I saw it was bad, but I gave him the change, and put that shilling with the other—Cave drank part of the second portion of gin—I made a communication to my husband, and he went out to fetch a policeman—after he was gone Cave came to me, and said, "Hald a quartern of gin, my dear"—I took a shilling from her hand, and said, "You are all right, my dear"—I took hold of her hand; a policeman came in, and I gave the three shillings to him.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—on Monday night, 6th March, my wife gave me a shilling—I examined it—it was bad, and I returned it to her—in consequence of that I remained in my house—both the prisoners were there-—I did not see Hudson tender a shilling, but as soon as he had tendered it I was called, and I went and got a constable.</p>

About five days before the prisoner was apprehended, I went to White's box for a piece of cloth, and found a handful of notes there; the prisoner was present, and said, " put them in again, and say nothing to the coachman, or he will think we have been rumaging his box." I did so. There was nothing but rubbish kept in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was in the box - A. Old stocking and things. One of the hinges was off.</p>

On the 3rd of June last, which was Whit-Monday, I had a mare, which I had bought at Tilly, and had had two years. She was in my field that evening at nine o'clock. I had seen the prisoner close to the field that night at seven o'clock. The next morning the mare was missing, at about four o'clock. The next time I saw her was in Smithfield, and I knew her very well.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WEBB. I am a dealer in horses. I was at Redbourne on Wednesday, the 5th of June; that is about four miles from St. Alban's; I saw the prisoner there, on the mare in question; I will swear to it; I saw him about half a mile on the other side of Redbourne, between Redbourne and Market-street; he was riding towards London; but turned up a lare, I believe on account of seeing me; that laue only leads into fields. I was on horseback myself; I hed no conversation with him; and I saw him again on this side of Barnet. The mare was very much fatigued; it might be two hours before I saw him the second time. The distance from Baruet to Redbourne is about fourteen miles. I had no conversation with him then; he kept on the road to London; he continued going towards London, and I passed him. I saw no more of him that day. I came to London. I was in Smithfield on the morning of Friday; I think soon after two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner on the mare; he had got her there for sale; he was riding her about for sale. I am sure the mare I saw him on at Smithfield, was the same I saw him with at Redburne and Barnet. I went and asked the price of her; he asked twenty guineas for her; twenty guineas in the state she was then, was a good price for her. She was very much cut up, and looked as if she had been hard ridden; I agreed to give him twelve pounds for her; and I took him to the toll-book to hare her booked; and I told him he must find a voucher before I could pay him for her, as I was not satisfied she was his property; he went and brought a voucher. He first told me his name was

            , living at Knighton, in Leicestershire, or some such place. He weat for a voucher, and when he came back with one, he gave a different name, the name of John Hardy; a man came with him. He said, he lived at Grimley, near Market Halborough. I saw the mare was about three years old. I found him in various stories. At first he said, he had had it three years, and afterwards he said it was his uncle's. I left the mare at the Ram. Worrall was in the room, and I gave him charge of the prisoner, on account of his various stories. I don't know whether he saw me with the mare.</p>

             Worrall. I heard the conversation between the last witness and the prisoner; the prisoner told me his sister would confirm him in his story, and I went to Gardner-street. I afterwards saw Mr. Poynor; I gave the mare to Mr. Poynor; that was the same mare I saw at the Ram. The prisoner was first discharged, and then he came to the Ram, and insisted on having the mare, and I said, I would detain it, and risque the consequences, and I wrote down to his uncle, to whom he first said, it belonged, Dr. Thistleton, and I have the answer.</p>

I know Pecklington, it is a few miles from Leicester; it is between Hinkley and Leicester, it is about one hundred and seven miles from London; Redburne is twenty-six. I knew this mare; I knew it belonged to Mr. Poynor. I saw the prisoner in the Compter; I had no conversation with him, only he said to me I hope you will beg my pardon of Mr. Poynor not to prosecute me, and my friends and relatiors will pay all expences. He also asked Mr. Poynor's pardon when he saw him; Mr. Poynor had nothing at all to do with him. I saw the mare; it is the same mare.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Whit-Monday, I was at Hinckley-fair, and I went into the sign of the Ram about five o'clock, and I fell into conversation with a person about coming to London, and I said, if I could get a horse any where, I would go to London myself; and John Jameson said to me he had a horse to let; upon which, I asked him what he would let me have it for ten days or a fortnight for; he said four pounds, and I offered to give him three pounds down, and one pound when I returned. I staid there until about nine o'clock, and I agreed to this man to bring this horse to Southeol, which is about seven miles off the Fair; he was to bring it on the Tuesday morning, and put it into Mr. Messing's field, which was a friend of mine. The next morning about six o'clock, I took a bridle and saddle to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100017"></xptr>see if the mare was there, and I found her there I then came to my uncle's at Knighton; he asked me where I was going, and I said, I was going to see a friend at London. He said, I think you ride your mare too hard; don't ride her so hard. Then I went to Northampton, and staid there all night, and came to London about eight o'clock the next day, and put her up at Riding-house-lane; and on the Friday following, I went through Smithfield, and this horse-dealer Webb, whom I had seen on the road, asked me to go into a house to have something to drink, and tie my horse up with his, which I did; and I called for some beer, and after that I had some liquors, and ram and water, until I was very much intoxicated, and this horse-dealer pulled out ever so many bank notes, and said, now I have got plenty of money, what would you like for your horse; and another horse-dealer pulled out ten guineas in gold, and I refused it, and I came out, and wanted by horse to go away, and they wanted me to have more liquor, and I said no, I would not have any more, and another said pay my reckoning before you go, and I refused; and the man said, give me the horse; and he tied it up at the Ram; and I was quite intoxicated in liquor, and did not know what I did.</p>

I had a house taken for me at Knowle-green, at Staines, where I intended to live—I left Kemble in charge of that house while it was being fitted up ready for me—I had a chest of linen there, which I saw on Monday the 5th of June last—I did not look into it, but I saw it in the back drawing-room—I saw next morning that it had been opened, and all the linen but a few trifling articles taken away—we had every possible search made, but without any effect—I have since seen a small part of the linen—I know both the prisoners—Hyde had been employed about my house digging a ditch, and Day had been employed to take my boy to school, but not from that house—I could not replace the articles lost for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed by the prosecutrix to take care of her house—I slept there on the night of the 5th of June—the chest of linen was safe in the back drawing room, which is on the ground floor, when I went to bed at ten o'clock—I slept in the north part of the house, at I considerable distance from that room, and on the first floor—there is a door leading from the drawing-room into the garden—that was fast when I went to bed—the window of the water-closet was down, but it had no fastening to it—it opens as a sash—I got up at about half-past four o'clock next morning, which was my usual time—I found the garden door open, which was fastened over night, by an iron bar across it, and a lock, but the key was in it—it had been opened from the inside—I found the water-closet window up, high enough for a man to get through—I went in to the drawing-room, and saw the box broken open—it was a very large box—it took three men to take it into the drawing-room—I looked out at the door, and there was a ladder standing at the water-closet window—it belonged to our premises, as the labourers were working there—there was a mark under the water-closet window, where somebody had got off the ladder on to the window—I traced the footsteps of a man from the road leading from Southampton, to the house, coming towards the water-closet door, and there were the steps of more than one going away from the house—I traced them over one large meadow and one small one, which leads into the turnpike road, within about twenty yards of Day's stables—I then went, and alarmed Mr. Craig, and called his servant—about six o'clock in the morning, as I was going after the patrol, I saw Day, and asked him if he would tell me where the horse police lived, and told him there had been a box broken open in Mrs. Trevelyan's house, and the things taken out—he said the patrol lived just on this side of Bedfont, but it was not any use for me to go, because they were gone to keep Ascot-heath race ground the day before—however, I went to Bedfont, and found one policeman at home—there are two stationed there, but one was gone to the races.</p>

               <p>I am acquainted with Mrs. Trevelyan—I was at the post-office when this letter was presented to her, and she delivered it to me—in consequence of what it contained, I went to see Day, and read the letter to him, he looking over the letter with me—it was in June—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mrs. Trevelyan. Madam, I have wrote to inform you that I have got some information of what you lost, if you please to go to William Day, near the White Lion, and ask him if he did find your property lodged on his premises in Birch-green, last week; he is as innocent of the robbery—I shall hear how you get on before I say any more; so no more at present from your well wisher."</p>

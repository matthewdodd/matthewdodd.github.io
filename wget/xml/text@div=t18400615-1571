                  </hi>I am porter at the Spread Eagle coach-office, Grace<lb></lb>church-street. About a quarter-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 20th of May, a gentleman came and inquired about the rail-road, and when he had got about twenty yards from the place I saw the prisoner follow him and take his handkerchief out of his pocket—he turned round to go up the market—I caught hold of him and detained him—the gentle<lb></lb>man walked on, and I could not get to him—this is the handkerchief the prisoner bad in his hand when I took him, and which I saw him draw from the pocket.</p>

He begged me to let him go—I said, "Yes, I will, as soon as I give you in charge"—I could not detain him and the gentleman too, as they went different ways.</p>

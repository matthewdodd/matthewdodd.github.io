                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Augustus Manning at No. 189, Sloane-street. On Thursday week the family went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I fastened up the house—I barred the door leading into the garden, bolted it top and bottom, and Placed a bell on it—there is a sliding window at the end of the passage—that was fas<lb></lb>tened by a screw—it has bars to it—it looks partly into the passage, and partly into the water-closet—there is an inner door plated with iron, which shuts off the water-closet—that was fastened inside by a bar and two bolts—I am quite sure that was secure—next morning, on coming down and opening the inner door, which was still fast as I had left it, I found seven</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040155"></xptr>
               <p>holes had been bored in the panel of that door, to the iron plate, and the window wide open—the outer door was unbarred and unbolted—the glass of that window was broken, I suppose to undo the screw—it was a small pane close to the screw—a hand could then be put inside—I discovered several footmarks in the garden, of two persons, one large and one small one—I found a piece of rag inside the house, and a piece in the garden—that in the garden was bloody, but not the piece inside—there were chips of wood under where the holes had been bored—the inspector came to look at the house, and he has the chips—he took them away—he afterwards compared some boots with the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am serjeant of the police—I was called into Mr. Manning's house the next morning—the servant accompanied me—I went about half-past nine o'clock, I found a square of glass broken outside the door in the garden, and the window put back—a man could by that means un<lb></lb>bolt the outer door—I found some blood on the glass, and on the inner iron bars—I found seven holes bored in the inner door—the inside was lined with sheet iron—on the next day, Saturday, I went to the prisoners' house, in Perkin's-rents—they both lodge together in the same house—I went into Wood's room first, found him in bed, and a female there, who was up—I examined Wood's hand—there were no marks of a cut on it—I then went to Draper's room, found him there, examined his hand, found a cut on the fore finger of, I think, the right, and some blood in front of his shirt, which was recently done—I took the two prisoners to the station, where they were charged with attempting to enter Mr. Manning's house, in Sloane-street, they denied all knowledge of it—I went back to Draper's room, and in the cupboard found a female's pocket with two centre-bits and a skeleton-key, and in the same cupboard I found two pick-lock keys under some glass—I went to Mr. Manning's house with wood s boots and Draper's shoes, which I saw taken off their feet—before I compared them I saw there was a mark in the heel in the mould, which Wood's boot fitted—it was a piece of loose leather, and in the mould there was a mark of a piece of loose leather—Draper's shoe was rather higher on one side than the other, and that fitted the marks in the mould—one side was rather worn down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I was at Mr. Man<lb></lb>iling's house on Saturday morning—I tried the two centre bits produced with the holes which had been made—in my judgment, the holes was made by one of these—the window was broken and the outer door open—I tried the boot and shoe with the marks made on the ground—before I tried them, I observed that on one mark the leather of the heel was worn off, and turned over, and I saw that indentation in the footmarks, before I tried the boots—I compared them carefully—there had been several foot-marks, but these two were more distinct than the others, and were covered over to preserve them—I have not a shadow of a doubt those two marks were made by the boot and shoe I tried—I had not seen the prisoners about there.</p>

            . I had a note of hand for the payment of 3 l. 9 s. dated, I believe, the 1st of March last. It was for money I had lent to a coachmaker. The prisoner signed it as a joint note with him.</p>

            . I received the note of Mr. Dolting last Saturday was a week, about two o'clock, in order to go to the prisoner to get the money for it. As I was going into the prisoner's house, the George in St. Giles's, I met him. I said to him, Is your name Maginnes? He said it was. I delivered the note to him. He looked at it, and said, Why could he not put his name to it? How long has this money been come due? I said, I would look and see. I was going to read it to him, when he snatched it out of my hand as soon as I had read the first of March, and refused to give it me again. When I asked him for the money, he said, I might get the money and be d - d: he would go and stay in the Marshalsea before he would pay a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver it to you again?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, I never had it again; neither has he paid the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner ask you to drink a glass of gin?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He did. After this, Mr. Dolting sent word, If he did not pay the money, he would arrest him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you shewed him the note?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He said, D - n the rascal, why did he not sign this note?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the note to him?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, I did not; for he snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he would go and enquire about the?</p>
               <p>Thomas. his passion was over, he said he would go and enquire about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not desire you to sit down?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bring the money afterwards?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My wife told me he or some man had been there, to pay the money. Then I had been at Mr. Fielding's, but he not being at home, I went to Mr. Spinnage's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you willing to take the money now?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I wish I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prisoner. Will you pay the money now?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes.</p>
               <p>His attorney pays the money in court.</p>

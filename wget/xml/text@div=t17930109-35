               <p>Last Tuesday afternoon, the Prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and asked to look at some waistcoats, I shewed the prisoner at the bar three or four, and then he asked to look at some breeches, I shewed him some, the prisoner after looking at a few pair tried two pair on; after that he gave them to me, and says, put these two pair of breeches by, I shall have one pair of them; then he put his own breeches on, and came and looked at the breeches by the light, and then he said he would give me no more than half a guinea for them; then the prisoner stood at the door a few minutes, and says he, I am sorry I cannot deal with you, as I have given you so much trouble, and he walked out of the shop for about six yards, and I collared him and brought him into the shop again, I told him I thought he had got a pair of my breeches in his breeches, he seemed quite alarmed at that; I told him if he did not unbutton his breeches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090055"></xptr>I would unbutton them for him, he took and unbuttoned the two flaps, and pulled his breeches down, and I saw my breeches; I called to my wife and said here is a man got a pair of our breeches in his breeches, and then I sent for a constable; I took him and the breeches to the Rotation-office, and the constable had them till yesterday about ten o'clock, when the constable gave them to me; I had no mark on them, no more than the shop mark; the shop mark is not a mark of my making, it is to tell the size they are, what we call a long sour's, it is the man's mark that supplies me with breeches; I am certain they are my breeches, but I could not miss any, I have got several dozen pair in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the shop mark is put on by the man that sells them to you; does not he put on the same mark to different shops? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for the man to have bought these breeches at another shop with that mark? - Yes, it is possible, but it is very improbable; when I was pulling the breeches out of his breeches, he said don't, don't, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in liquor. - He did not appear to be so.</p>

               <p>I saw the breeches taken out of the prisoner's breeches.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did I say first when I came into the shop? - He said he wanted to look for some waistcoats and breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop, I asked to look at some velveret breeches, I wanted some pretty good ones, he shewed me some, and I looked a pair out, which I thought would fit me, and I asked what they were to be, and I cannot be sure whether he said 15 s. or 14 s. but it was one of the two, and I think to the best of my remembrance I bid him 12 s. and 10 s. 6 d. and he would not take it, I said I think these would fit me, I pulled my own off, and put these breeches on, and if I pulled two pair down, it is more than I know, I was in liquor, and therefore I put on these breeches, they fitted me very well, and when he found the breeches afterwards hanging out here behind, I did not know I had them about me, when I had my own on.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were they folded up? - They were, and I saw the prisoner conniving at these breeches in his own breeches, in order to put them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lived with the Earl of Effingham, and Esq. Hardington, and Mr. Hardcastle, and the Countess of Mexborough; I have been trusted with thousands of pounds, and I never wronged them of a penny in my life.</p>

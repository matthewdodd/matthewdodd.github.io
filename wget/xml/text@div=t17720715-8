On the 11th of June, between eight and nine at night, I heard a cry of thieves! thieves! I ran up stairs; when I got to the top of the stairs I saw my chamber door open, and my housekeeper down upon her knees, holding the prisoner round the waist; she appeared vastly frightened; she let him go when she saw me, and I secured him. I saw my bureau was broke open; I said, I am ruined! I am ruined! he said, no you are not, I will deliver up all I have taken from you; I held my hat, and he took the money and two rings out of his pocket; I locked the money up directly. I looked at it and counted it next morning; I found two rings next day, which were dropped near the bureau; when he returned it to me, there were 13 guineas in a bag; there was 19 l. 14 s. in silver, seven guineas and a half guinea, and a 36 s. piece; that money was loose.

I went for candles up stairs; I unlocked my master's door, and saw the prisoner standing by the bureau; he had opened it by a picklock, and locked it after him; I had the right key. I said you d - g, what do you do here; he came to me and struck me on the side of my face. I catched him in my arms, and held him fast; he drawed me down three steps, and back again into the room; I called out for help; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150005"></xptr> let him go till my master came; the door is always kept locked.</p>

            . I am high constable for the Tower Hamlets; he was brought to me by one of my officers; he delivered me a bunch of picklock keys, which he said, he found upon the prisoner; I searched him and found two picklocks upon him; (producing a large bunch of picklocks about two dozen;) I have tried these and they open every door in my house. I found this knife upon the prisoner, ( producing a strong clasp knife with a square end like a chissel.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That collection you paid over to Mr. Claypole amounted to a great deal more than ten pounds? - A. Yes; a great deal more.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Hanbury: On the 9th of June, I received a bag from Mr. Wortley, the contents of which I did not know; I put it into a drawer in the iron safe; two or three days after, I was asked for it by Mr. Wortley, and I could not find it, the drawer was then locked; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130045"></xptr>soner was in the service of Messrs.

               <persName id="t18020113-63-person650">Q. </persName>
            There are a great many clerks in the house who have access to this safe? - A. Yes; the doors of the safe are open, but the drawers are locked; two drawers hold the cash collected, and the other holds common papers, and different things; they have each of them a different lock, so that one key will not open two; I had one key in my possession the whole time this bag was in the drawer; I had been there several times before I missed it; there were two or three other bags in the drawer; the notes were tied up in a little sample bag, I did not miss it, because there were other bags, and this was a very small bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody could have access to this drawer but yourself? - A. No; but it has been found open once or twice, nothing was missed before then; it was entirely forgetfulness of me to leave it open; I am sure I locked it when I put the bag in.</p>

             sworn. - I was collecting clerk to Messrs. Hanbury, and know the prisoner; his province was to post the cellar-books: On the 26th of December last, I was in the box which is appropriated for the use of the clerks to make up their cash, in order to carry to the banker's, and the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I could oblige him with change for a ten-pound Bank-note; I asked him if he chose small notes, or gold; he said, gold, which I gave him; I asked him if he had marked the note; he asked me what I meant; I said, there were a great many forged notes about, and I always wrote on the notes the person's name I took them of; he said, it was almost impossible he should remember who he took it of, because, perhaps, he had had it in his possession six or seven months, but if he wrote his own name on it, he supposed it would do; I said, yes, but I should write his name also upon the face of the note, as I always did; he took up the red-ink pen, and wrote his name on the back; I did not know how he wrote his name, but I looked at the manner in which he had spelt it, and wrote it myself on the face of the note, with the date of the month; he thanked me for the gold, and walked away; I put the note into a bundle of notes without taking any account of it, which led to a disagreeable mistake, for I found myself ten pounds out of pocket; that delayed me an hour or more from going to the banker's, but when I found it out, I carried it to Taylor's and Co. No. 60, Lombard-street; I had mentioned this circumstance to Mr. Evelyn, who asked me about it, and of whom I had taken it, which introduced the enquiry after the note; I paid it into Taylor's the same day I received it of the prisoner, about two hours after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It was a fact well known, that a number of notes had been lost in June last? - A. Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have been an easy thing for this young man to have got change for the Bank-note any where else? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not know what you meant by marking the note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You explained, by saying you meant marking the name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you, he did not think it possible for him to do that, because, perhaps, he might have had it for six or seven months? - A. Yes, I think that was his expression.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mean to fix it precisely, whether five, six, or seven months? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, if he put his name, he supposed it would do? - A. Yes, and I said it would; upon which, he wrote it at full length; he never attempted to decline or conceal it.</p>

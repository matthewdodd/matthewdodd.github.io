                  </hi>. I was in Brown's employment in Oct. last, and had been so about three months—I remember Thomas Hartley being at Brown's in Oct.—he left about the middle of Oct. as near as I can recollect—I know Muieller, and remember his being at Brown's house in Oct.—I was present at a conversation between Brown and Muieller about the 12th I think—there were two or three men present who went away in the American ship along with Thomas Hartley, and a youth that went away with Thomas Johns—I heard Brown say more than once or twice that he would get Muieller an English ticket to get him in an English ship—I heard Brown tell him he must have a ticket, and I was present when Brown bought the ticket of Thomas Hartley in the yard for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave it to Muieller the day after—Hartley stated that he was going in an American ship, and did not want the ticket, and if Brown would like to have it, he would sell it to him, as it might be of some use to some of the foreigners in the house—he handed the ticket to Brown, and Brown gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my presence—the ticket was not in a case then—I saw Brown hand it over to Muieller—it was then in a the case, and he told Muieller he should have it for the same he bought it for—that was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 166.) I was at the station-house at Shadwell, somewhere about Oct. last, and was fetched to Brown's house one evening towards dusk—I saw Brown at the door—he said, "I want you, 1 have got a fellow down here who has robbed me"—he took me down stairs where I found Muieller—Brown pointed him out to me and said, "That man has stolen 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my coat-pocket while it was lying on the drawers"—he said something which I did not understand, and I said, "Well, if you give him in charge I must take him into custody"—there was another man there—I cannot say his name—he was a dark complexioned man—Muieller said he would pay Brown the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when he came back—Brown said, "But how about your stealing that man's box and ticket"—I think he said a register-ticket—they then said something in a language I did not understand, and Muieller said, "The captain has got the ticket on board the ship, and the ship is going away</p>

               <p>to-morrow morning"—the other man said, "Never mind the ticket, I can get a ship and go to America without a ticket"—when Muieller was charged with having stolen the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he did not say he had stolen it, nor did he deny it, to my understanding—I could hear what he said, but did not know the meaning—he asked for mercy—he cried, and went down and put his hands together—Brown said, "He begs me not to lock him up, and he will pay me when he comes back again"—Brown said that in English to me—I said, "If that is so, I have done with it." and it was then that Brown mentioned about the ticket and the box—the other man wrote out a ticket—something passed between them in the shape of a ticket, but what I do not know—it was almost dark in the kitchen, and Muieller sat with his back towards the window—the writing referred to the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the reading of it—I heard the man who wrote it read it—I do not remember now what it was—it is a long while ago—there was a ticket of some sort passed from Muieller—whether it was a pawnbroker's ticket I cannot say—I did not handle it—I heard Brown say, "Is that the ticket for the coat?"—from those words I should say it must have been a pawn ticket—the other man took it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PETERSDORY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went in there was a good deal of dis<lb></lb>cussion between the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, partly in German and partly in English—the principal part of the conversation between Brown and Muieller was in a language I did not understand—the first expression in English was Brown saying to me, "That fellow has stolen 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Muieller's answer I did not un<lb></lb>derstand—the discussion went on for a minute or two—I was not there above ten minutes altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Mr. Foster, an outfitter in Rat<lb></lb>cliffe-highway—in Oct. last I remember Muieller coming there—he purchased clothes, and produced a paper to me which he told me was an advance note of the <hi rend="italic">Tom Tough</hi>—I gave him goods and clothes, and the balance in cash—he exchange for it—I do hot know what became of the note—I gave it to my principal, Mr. Foster—he was out at the time—I do not know whether I passed it away—it never came back as not being paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and have been so about nine years—I have had a hurt which has lamed me—I have lately been assisting Brown in his business—it was part of my duty to look out for sailors to recommend his boarding-house to them—I took a run to Liverpool and returned about the 3rd or 4th Oct.—I then went to lodge at Brown's—Muieller was lodging there when I went, and Thomas Hartley also—there was only one other man lodging there at that time—he used to eat and drink there, but did not sleep there—he got a ship and Went away the same day I came, and then Hartley, Muieller, and myself were the only lodgers—I remember</p>

               <p>one day in Oct. Brown going out and leaving Muieller at home—I went out that day—when I returned Brown opened the door to me in his drawers and complained of Muieller's robbing him—Muieller was not then at home the policeman had been before I came in—I saw Muieller next morning in the front kitchen—I have seen Muieller and Haynes together twice since this—they were drinking together in the Highway—Haynes and Brown have not quarrelled—he robbed Brown, I believe, and Brown kicked him out of doors, that was all—he was not living at Brown's at that time—it was in Aug. before I went to Liverpool—he had nothing to do at Brown's house after that.</p>

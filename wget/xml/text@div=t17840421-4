               <p>I was going from my master's, and I saw the prisoner with a carcase of mutton on his shoulder, he was going very fast towards the House of Commons; I saw him at the end of Union-street, in Palace-Yard.</p>
               <p>Which part of Bridge-street does the prosecutor live in? - The lower part next King-street; I told Mr. Hurdmon, and bid him follow me; we pursued him, I saw the man on the other side of the way, under the dead wall of the Parliament-house, at the place they call hell, where the pump is.</p>
               <p>Was it the same man you had seen before? - Yes, I saw him go on a gentle trot, till he came to a coach that was standing a few doors off; I went across and caught him, he had thrown the carcase down into the place they call hell, where the pump is.</p>
               <p>Did you see him throw it down? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>What time of the night was it? - A very few minutes after eight.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw the man again, when he was going on as you say at a gentle trot, had he then the carcase? - He had not, I did not see him throw it down, because there is no lamp at hell gate; I ran after the man, and seeing him hiding himself under a coach, I went and catched him, me and Mr. Hurdmon; I took particular notice of him when I first saw him, and he did not appear to be a butcher; he had another coat on when I saw him; when we came to Mr. Hurdmon's the grease was on his shoulder, and on the left side his hat.</p>

               <p>Jury. What coloured coat had he on at that time? - I think it was an olive green.</p>

               <p>I crossed the road to ease myself, and I saw two men before me, and this man swore I was the man; I was carrying meat in Newgate-market the Saturday before, and that was the reason my hat came greasy.</p>

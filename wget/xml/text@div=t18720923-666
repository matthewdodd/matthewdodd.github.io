                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 231). On the night of 3rd August I was on duty in a street near the Britannia public-house—there are dwelling-houses on one side, and on the other a passage bounded by the Metropolitan Railway—I saw the gas alight in the bar-parlour that night up to about 2 o'clock, as near as possible; I can't say to a few minutes—at 3.45 I observed smoke coming out of the cellar-flap, which projects on the pave<lb></lb>ment, and also under the bar doors, and from the fan-light, a pane of which was broken—I went to the side door in the passage and knocked and rang the bell and <hi rend="italic">hammered</hi> and kicked at the door—some person answered me from the second-floor window; I can't say who it was, and in two or three minutes the prisoner came to the door; he had on his shirt and trousers and stockings, but no boots—when he opened the door I said "Your house is on fire"—he said "Is it?"—I said "Yes, you had better get the people out"—he then shut the door at once; he stood there hardly a second—I said "Come and see the smoke coming out in front"—he did not come out; he shut the door at once as I was standing at the door—I remained outside four or five minutes; I then knocked and kicked at the door again—the smoke was increasing—the prisoner came down again immediately, dressed just the same; he opened the door; I told him he did not seem to exert himself to get the people out, nor to see where the fire was—he was not agitated in the slightest—I then went into the house through the bar-parlour and opened the door into the bar; I shut the outer door—the pri<lb></lb>soner went up stairs again—the bar was full of smoke—I closed the door again immediately—there are two doors out of the bar, one into the tap-room at the end of the bar, and the other into the bar-parlour at the other end of the bar—the bar-parlour was quite free from smoke—the fire-escape came almost immediately—the fire-escape man came in at the door; it was open—he went up stairs and brought down a child, and the other persons followed down—there were two lodgers, a servant, two children, and the prisoner's wife; the prisoner came down with them—it was unusual to see a light in the bar-parlour at two o'clock—I never saw it before at that time—I was past the premises a number of times between 2 and 3.45, and I saw that the light was out—other constables and the fire-escape man came and examined the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the light up to about 2 o'clock, as near as I can say within a few minutes—I can hear the clock chimes every time I go round. King's Cross—I saw no light when I passed after that—the children were undressed when I saw them; in their night-clothes—the wife was dressed when she came down stairs—I should say that was about ten minutes after I first knocked—the servant had got her outside clothing on—she appeared as if she had put them on in a hurry—she seemed very much frightened—the lodgers were dressed; I can't say fully; they had their trousers and that on—they brought their box down with them—when I first gave the alarm the prisoner shut the door and fastened it—he unfastened it again and let me in after knocking again between four and five minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a fireman on 3rd August, in charge of the escape stationed at the corner of Liverpool Street opposite King's Cross Station, between four and five minutes' run from the Britannia—on the Saturday morning between 3.50 and 3.55 I received a call—I went at once with my escape to the Britannia—I noticed smoke issuing from underneath</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230028"></xptr>
               <p>the window and the doors of the bar; the door's were shut—I saw a light in the top floor window and I pitched my escape right under that window and I was in the act of going up when the constable told me I could get up the staircase—I then found that the side door was open—I took one of the lamps off the escape and went in and up the staircase to see if there were any inmates—I went into the prisoner's bedroom and there I found him and his wife ready dressed and a child lying on the bed undressed, fast asleep—that was the room where I had seen the light, the second floor front—I said it was rather a curious game to see his child lying a-bed fast asleep like that and his house on fire, and I was in the act of taking the child off the bed when the wife said she would carry it down—the prisoner made no reply to what I said; he seemed perfectly calm and cool about everything; all the dress that he was minus of was his cap—I then went into the ser<lb></lb>vant's bed room on the same floor, the next room, I found her, as I thought, fully dressed—there was an infant lying in her bed fast asleep—I took hold of it and brought it down and gave it to a stranger or a policeman; it was undressed, in its nightgown—I did not see the lodgers at that time—when I came down the firemen had arrived, the volunteers came first—after I had moved my escape to the opposite side of the road, I walked back and found they had got the cellar-flap up, and had a branch down there working from a stand-pipe—I remained until the fire was put out—I examined the pre<lb></lb>mises as far as I could—I noticed a quantity of paraffin or petroleum or some other kind of mineral oil on the top of one of the casks in the cellar, right under the funnel-hole which communicates with the taproom; the cask was standing on its end, the oil was on the head of the cask, not in anything—there was a very strong smell of this oil in the cellar, but I was a long time before I could find out where it was, the smoke was so dense—I afterwards went into the taproom with Mr. Bridges, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, and the officer, and there we found a quantity of wood shavings strewed all over the taproom, but the greater part was just round about the funnel-hole—there was a very strong smell of this oil in the taproom, the shavings were saturated with it; and there were stains on the wainscoting partition about two thirds of the way up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> One of the children was about two or three years of age and the other about eighteen months—the oil on the top of the cask I took to be paraffin, it was a mineral oil of some kind—Inspector Hume was there and made a careful survey of the premises, with Mr. Bridges and Mr. Hutchins—the cellar where this cask was is right at the back of the beer cellar, it communicates with it; the flap was in the beer cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the officer in charge of the Metro<lb></lb>politan Fire Brigade at Farringdon Street—at about 4.54 on Sunday morning, 4th August, I was called by a policeman in a cab to go to the Britannia public-house; I went immediately—the Volunteer Fire Brigade had arrived at that time, and had been pumping with a portable hydrant—I went in at the street-door, and went first into the taproom—I observed a considerable quantity of shavings on the floor of that room—they were smouldering in two distinct places—there was a very strong smell of paraffin—I at once took up the shavings and smelt them; they smelt of paraffin of some description—I should say there had been a great quantity of paraffin upon them—they were wet, but, of course, water had been poured upon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230029"></xptr>
               <p>them as well—I examined all the shavings in different parts of the room, and they all smelt of paraffin—the wooden partition had streams of wet oil in one or two places—I put my hand on it, and drew the oil from it—that was a boarding against the wall, 4 or 5 feet high—there were settles attached to the walls, and the greater part of them were covered with paraffin, and some had splashed on to the sawdust—there was also a quantity of paraffin on the table, and a large empty sack was nearly half saturated with it—there was nearly a sackful of shavings about the room, and many of them were burnt—the door between the taproom and bar being shut, there was no draught—the wooden panellings in the corner behind the tap-room door were considerably burnt; they had most certainly blazed—I then went into the cellar—there had been more fire there by a great deal than there had been in the taproom—there were consumed shavings on the floor; some partly burnt, and some not burnt—they were principally in the back cellar, the spirit cellar, immediately under the taproom—there is a funnel-hole about the size of a crown-piece communicating between the cellar and taproom, for the purpose of pouring 'spirits down—the taproom floor forms the ceiling of the cellar; it is only flooring, joisting—by the quantity consumed, I should say there were more shavings in the cellar than in the taproom; there would be at least a sackful—the staircase or passage, about 8 or 10 feet in length, leading from the ground floor to the cellar was else strewn with shavings—there was a smell of paraffin in the cellar, but not quite so strong as in the taproom—the ceiling was charred, but not to a great extent—the cellar is about 6 1/2 feet in height—on one of the casks, which was lying on its <hi rend="italic">belly</hi>, there was a mound of sawdust and burnt shavings deeply saturated with paraffin, that was nearly consumed—I found an empty two-gallon stone bottle in the cellar which smelt very strongly of paraffin—I poured some into my hand; there were three or four table-spoonsful of paraffin, or a little more, left in the bottom—I should say there had been two distinct fires in the taproom, but not enough to clearly swear by, and one fire in the cellar distinct from the taproom fire—I am quite sure of that—I saw the prisoner shortly afterwards next door—I told him that the circumstances were very curious, and asked if he had had any repairs done lately, or could he in any manner account for the shavings—he made no reply at first, but he ultimately said, within a minute or two, that he had carried some through the previous evening into the back place, and he might have dropped some—I called his attention to the shavings more particularly in the taproom—he said he could not account for them—I asked who was the last in the place—he said he was—I think he said he went to bed about 1 o'clock—I took a cursory view of the stock; I did not see closely into it—I saw that all the spirit casks were empty; I should say there were about eight or nine in the cellar—the one on which the little mound had been was charred—I went up stairs with the inspector and the prisoner; he accompanied us through the house—a bed was pointed out to me in the front room second floor—the prisoner said that was his bed where he had slept, and a person drew my attention to the fact that only one person had lain in it—I noticed only the impression of one person—I put my fist on the bed to see if it was one—that would give an impression of a person lying on it, and my fist went into it; it was an ordinary soft bed—I told the prisoner the facts did not look as if he had slept there—he made no reply that I know of—I saw a cask standing on its top in the cellar—it is a mistake of the last witness; it was not paraffin on that, it was water</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bed was an ordinary bed, on an iron bedstead; there was an impression of one person having lain in it, on the side next the wall—I did not see a child on the bed, or any impression of where a child had been lying—the bed was against the wall—Ward is a man who has had very little experience in fires—he was with us for a very short time, and he has left—I should say a great quantity of paraffin had been used here—I could not form an idea how much—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the jar I found—the sack I saw did not contain many shavings—there was another sack found under the staircase leading to the cellar—that was about the same size as the other, and was to all appearance empty—that was strung over a sort of wicket gate that was placed to keep the children from falling down the stairs—when I saw the lodgers they were dressed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Inspector G</hi>). On 4th August, about 4 o'clock in the morning, I went to the fire—I was outside, in charge of the police—my attention was called by the last witness, and I accompanied him into the building—I went into the taproom—I should say there was nearly a sack<lb></lb>ful of shavings strewn all over the taproom—I took them up and smelt them, and they smelt very strongly of paraffin oil—the table in the middle of the room was also saturated with the same oil—the wainscot was stained with oil, and the settles or wooden benches—there was a sack with a quantity of paraffin oil on it—there was a quantity of charred shavings in the corner of the room, close to the door leading to the bar—the lower part of the door was also charred—I produce one of the panels—I have not any of the shavings—I saw charred shavings in different parts of the room—I should say there had been two distinct fires in the taproom—I went into the spirit cellar—there were shavings on the staircase and in the passage; they were not burnt, and did not smell of paraffin—the cellar door was wet with paraffin oil—there was a cask on its side, with ashes of shavings on it, smelling very strong of oil—there was a quantity of shavings strewn over the cellar, partly burnt and unburnt—I was present when this jar was found; at that time it smelt of paraffin oil—I poured out a portion of the dregs, and have not the slightest doubt it was paraffin oil—I found the prisoner next door, at a neighbour's house—I brought him in, and his attention was called to the shavings and the oil—we asked if he could account for it in any way; if he had had carpenters in the house—he said no—he said he had got in some shavings to light the fires with, and in carrying the sacks through the tap-room to the cellar some of them might have fallen out—I called his attention to there being about a sackful in the room, but he made no further answer—he said he went to bed about 1 o'clock, that he closed the house himself, and was the last up—I asked him to show me where he slept, which he did—he said that he slept with his wife and child in there, and I saw an impression of one person having slept in the bed—I could not see the impressions of two persons—the outer side of the bed had not been apparently slept in—there was no impression on the pillow—the clothes were off the bed altogether—I understood afterwards that they had been thrown round the children—I called the prisoner's at<lb></lb>tention to only one person having apparently slept in the bed—he declared</p>

               <p>that he had lain there—I went downstairs and spoke to Mr. Bridges, and then came up again to the same room—the prisoner and his wife were then both on the bed, at least his wife was lying on the bed, and he was leaning half on and half off the bed—I told him that everything was very sus<lb></lb>picious, and as he could give no account as to how the fire originated, I considered it my duty to take him into custody for wilfully setting fire to the house, there being other persons therein at the time—he made no reply—he took the policy of insurance out of his coat pocket, and handed it to his wife, and I took charge of it—I produce it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated ith March, 72, and was a policy effected with the Phoenix for </hi>100<hi rend="italic">l. on stock and utensils in trade, and </hi>100<hi rend="italic">l. on household goods, premiums paid </hi>6<hi rend="italic">s. up to Christmas.</hi>) I examined the stock—there was very little, and the furniture was very poor indeed.</p>

I am a butcher—on Saturday, 3rd August, I was lodging in the prisoner's house with a man named Cousins—we occupied the same room, the first floor back—I went to bed about 11 o'clock that night—I remained in the room until the alarm of fire was given—my fellow lodger came in after me—I left the prisoner up when I went to bed, and the house was open at that time—I was awoke by the knocking' at the door—the prisoner was coming down stairs at the same time that I came out of my room—he called out, and said either that there was a fire, or the house was on fire—Cousins and I were the only two lodgers.</p>

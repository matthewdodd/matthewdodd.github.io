             sworn. - On the 20th of May I turned up my basket on the pavement, with my bread in it; I was going to serve a customer with a loaf; in the mean time I saw the prisoner take two loaves out of the basket, and run as fast as he could; I pursued him and took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what he is? - A. He told me that he was a baker out of place; I understand since that he has been a baker, and had a shop over Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please you, my Lord, I acknowledge doing this; I hope in God you will have mercy upon me for the sake of my wife and family, I have six children; they were in want of bread.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a woman called at my house; she said she was his wife, and she had five or six children.</p>

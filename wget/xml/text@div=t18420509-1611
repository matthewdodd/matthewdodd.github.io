                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Shepherd, a chinadealer, in Goldsmith-row, Hackney-road. On Sunday afternoon, the 8th of May, the prisoner and another woman came to my shop—(we do not sell goods on a Sunday, unless any one happen to knock at the door)—the prisoner asked for some white plates with blue edges to them—I told her we had none—she then asked to look at some white ones—I showed her some—she then asked to look at some blue plates, which I showed her—I missed a jug—this is it—it is my husband's—I am sure I lost it that day, and I did not sell it to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I and Sarah Edwards went in together. I bought two plates. I asked for some sugar, while she turned to get it, Edwards took the jug off a shelf on the right-hand side, and put it under her shawl. I gave her a shilling to get a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I went into the shop with the prisoner—she called for two plates, and while the lady was turning her back the prisoner took the jug, put it under her arm, and told me to fetch the pot of beer—I asked her whether she had paid for it—she said, "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I gave her the shilling in the shop before I came out at all. I was standing talking to the mistress of the shop, she being hard of hearing, and when Edwards came home I asked where she got this jug—did she borrow it? she said she took it out of the shop. I told the Magistrate this.</p>

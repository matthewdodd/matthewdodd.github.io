                  </hi>. I keep a boot and shoe and tobacconist's shop at Hackney. I have known the prisoner three or four months—on the 24th of November he came into my shop about nine o'clock, and desired to have his boots mended—I could not do it then, but said if he came in a few hours, I might do them—he came again about one o'clock, came into the back-room, and pulled off one of his boots—at that time my watch and seals hung over the bench where I work—he sat down while I mended his boot—he then found a little place in the other boot, and desired me to mend that—just as I had finished that, he told Mrs. Warr, who was in the back-parlour with me, to weigh him a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—she went into the shop to do so—while she was there, a young man came into the shop for a cigar—I went into the shop, leaving the prisoner in the back<lb></lb>room, putting his last boot on—at that time I am quite confident my watch and seals were there—while I was in the shop, the prisoner came out of the back-room with his left-hand in his left-hand trowsers-pocket, saying he found he had a hole in his pocket, and had lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and could not pay me, but would come again and pay me directly—he threw 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down to Mrs. Warr, telling her to take a farthing change—he lived about a mile from me—he walked*out rather quick, and ran down a little hill—I went into the back-parlour, and missed my watch and appendages—I inquired for him, but heard nothing of him till he was in custody.</p>

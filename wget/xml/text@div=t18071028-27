            . ESQ. - Mr. Reynolds. I believe you are a captain of the royal navy. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you go to Mr. Hatchett's house. - A. On the 11th of September; I slept there that night in the room No. 53.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you bring with you. - A. I brought a writing desk, containing two five pound notes, several one pound notes, and six guineas in gold; they were in different pieces; a vast number of letters and other papers, they were all in the writing desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What else had you. - A. A trunk containing linen of all kinds, shirts, stockings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following morning what time did you get up. - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up and dressed, was your property all there. - A. That I cannot swear to. I had seen the desk and opened it the day before, and rather think if it had not been there I should have noticed that. I went down stairs about eight o'clock, and went up again about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Court. Your desk you said you opened it the day before, did you leave it open. - A. No, I locked it, and left it locked. When I went up at half after nine, I went on purpose for my writing desk, I found it missing; I mentioned it to Mrs. Hatchet; I came back immediately and looked at the trunk, and the trunk was broken open; it was still locked, but the has was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What things were in the trunk missing - A. Every thing except a book of letters.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw some of this property afterwards. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Captain Chetham, have you seen the trunk that you lost since. - A. I have it in my possession now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you confident that it is your trunk that you had in your possession. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Court. What trunk.</p>
               <p>Captain Chetham. I fancy he means the writing desk, the trunk was never gone. I have the key of the writing desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you open it. - A. That key will not open it, the lock has been taken off and another put on.</p>
               <p>Court. Now prisoner be upon your guard, you may ask questions that will do you essential harm, you have no counsel, it becomes me to caution you to be careful of the questions you put.</p>
               <p>SARAH BISHOP. - Mr. Reynolds. Were you chambermaid in September last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember captain Chetham coming to your master. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he sleep in. - A. No. 53.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does No. 53 stand, with reference to No. 45. - A.53 is lower down, on the one pair stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it direct under it. - A. It is not quite under it; 53 is under 45.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Persons coming down from No. 45, do they pass 53. - A. They pass near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man at your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner at the bar, are you sure that he is the same person. - A. Yes, he came on the 10th, and on the 11th, and went away on the morning of the 12th; he slept two nights there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. When he came what did he bring with him. - A. He brought a portmanteau and a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they put. - A. They were brought down stairs from his room No. 45.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he go to - A. No. 45.</p>
               <p>Court. Then they were carried up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away they were brought down from this room where they were carried to, trunk and portmanteau. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. He went away on the morning of the 12th. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the following day did you see any thing outside of the window. - A. On the day after I saw outside of the room, No. 45, I found eight bricks, they were wrapped up in paper, and a piece of old carpet over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else slept in that room. - A. No, nobody after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked out of the window on the 12th when he went away. - A. Not that morning; I had looked out of the window into the parapet the day before the prisoner came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this parcel of bricks there then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was not. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think when he went away, his trunk and his portmanteau was taken away. - A. Yes, his trunk was on the landing place of 53, and his portmanteau in his own room; the porter brought down the trunk, and the prisoner brought down the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock in the morning was it. - A. A little after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he go away. - A. The porter brought his trunk down stairs, and the prisoner brought his portmanteau, and they took them to the corner of Bond-street; the prisoner himself carried the portmanteau to the corner of Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the porter carry the trunk to the corner of Bond-street. - A. The porter followed him.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of October did you apprehend the prisoner any where. - A. I did, at a public house in Upper Berkley-street; I searched him; I found upon him some duplicates, a key of a street door, and a small key, which unlocks this writing desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing about the key of the street door. - A. No; I knew where he lodged before I apprehended him; I secured him at another house; I then returned back with Mr. Hatchett, and went to the lodgings of the prisoner Magill's, three or four doors from where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street were these lodgings. - A. In Berkley-streek; I opened the door with the large key that I took out of his pocket; I went up one pair of stairs; finding nobody there I went up higher to another flight of stairs; I found this writing desk in the first room on the first floor; there were letters and papers in it. I found in a closet on the first floor back room papers with captain Chetham's name on several of them; they were delivered to captain Chetham. In the same room, in a closet, I found two pair of stockings and a towel.</p>
               <p>Court. Have these two pair of stockings and towel any mark on them. - A. The stockings are marked E. C. and numbered, and the towel is marked E. C. This book was in the writing desk. (Witness unlocked the desk)</p>
               <p>Q. Now I see you have opened that desk. - A. Yes, by a small key that I found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the duplicates that you found upon him. - A. Yes; several of them was given to Mrs. Magill; I found a great number of duplicates on him that were pledged chiefly in the name of Williams; and the ticket of a gold epaulet I found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. The parcel that you describe that there were razors with it, was it I that pledged that parcel. - A. It appears in your name; I remember they were pledged the second time in the same name, with other articles; I remember his pledging them first, and taking them out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Captain Chetham, look at that desk - is that your desk. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the desk you had at Hatchett's hotel, which you found you had lost on the morning of the 12th. - A. It is; I know it by being in the habit of using it frequently; I have had it seven years; here is Johnson's dictionary in the form of a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the desk the last time you saw it. - A. It was; and this picture, I stuck that on it, and that almanac is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the picture. - A. Of Time; the pantaloons I very much believe them to be mine, but the buttons have been changed.</p>
               <p>Q. What buttons had yours on that you lost. - A. Anchor naval buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the stockings and shirts. - A. These stockings are mine, and the shirts are mine; this epaulet is mine; they are not always made in this manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the two five pound notes being in your desk. - A. I can; it was on last Friday morning; I opened it.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the lock appear to be changed on looking at it. - A. It is changed; it is new; and the key was new, and this catch is new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, the indulgence I received from this court yesterday did not avail me; I had a witness to bring forward, but it has been counteracted, in consequence of my being immediately called back to be arrainged for a crime in the city; on that account, my witness has not come forward, even to prove a thing that is a fact, that my wife and I have dealt in purchasing second hand wearing apparel for many years; and indeed the number of things that have been accumulated, they have been honestly purchased by her; and if I ever was guilty of crimes, she never knew nothing of it. My lord, I stand in this court, in a most awful situation - a situation that harrows me up to the soul, to think that ever I should come in this disgraceful way; having lived twenty years in Westminster a respectable housekeeper; it grieves me to my very soul; and I earnestly intreat your lordship to shew mercy to one whose crimes have been, indeed, but very few. I am deprived of the means of that defence, that I could wish to make before your lordship. I have been confined three weeks in Cold Bath-fields, I had not an opportunity for it; I was only last Friday evening sent to Newgate; it has not been in my power even to get friends to my character. I have been anxiously hoking round the court, I see one face, I will call him to speak what he knows of me; I therefore implore your lordship, on account of my children, on account of my family, that you will have the kindness to extend that mercy that your judgment thinks my present situation requires.</p>

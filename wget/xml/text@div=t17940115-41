The 2d of January, Mr. Jones came to me, and asked me, if I had lost any thing, if I had lost a pair of boots? I told him, I would go and see; I went, and missed a pair of boots; he asked me, what sort they were? I told him; this was on the 2d, the Thursday; on the 4th, they came down to me, and told me, the man that was taken that offered the boots to fell, was at the office; I went down to the office. I saw the man there, and I saw my boots; the boots were in the hands of the officer, I don't know his name; they were a new pair of boots with three C's wrote behind in the leg of the boots.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of this month, the prisoner came to my shop with a pair of boots, and offered them me to fell. I am a shoemaker, in Rosemary-lane, near to Tower-hill. I told him, I thought, he did not come honestly by them; he said, they were his own property, I told him to call again on the Saturday following, and detained the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you again on Saturday? - After that, I shewed them to a man that happened to know Mr. Plimpton, and he gave me his address.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to think that the boots belonged to Mr. Plimpton? - His name was on the boots, and this man gave me Mr. Plimpton's address, and I went and asked him, if he had lost a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come on Saturday to you? - He did, he came about eleven o'clock, as nigh as I can guess; I sent for a police officer, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say how he came by them? - I don't recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Court to Plimpton. You missed these boots you say on the 2d of January. Did you miss them before Mr. Jones came to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon had you seen them before that time? - The morning before, the first of January, (New Year's Day).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming down Houndsditch, coming towards Bishopsgate church, I picked them up in a bit of a bag. I am a silk-dresser by trade.</p>

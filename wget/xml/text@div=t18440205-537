                  </hi>. I am the wife of Nathan Phillips. On the 15th of Jan., about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, at No. 125, High-street, Shadwell, and, on going to the cupboard, saw the prisoner crawling on his hands and knees down the shop—I went to drive him out—he was a good while before he got up; he pretended he was lame, and could not walk—I saw a coat lying down on the floor, which had been lying on a shelf in the shop—I turned him out, said he had come in to rob me, and called him a thief—he said if he saw a policeman he would give me in charge, he was very insolent, and caused a mob round the door—sergeant Harris came up, and I gave him into custody—the coat had been in the shop twenty years—there are divisions between the shelves, and it could not have got down without being pulled down—I had seen it safe about six o'clock—no one had been in between six and nine, that I know of.</p>

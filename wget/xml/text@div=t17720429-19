            . I live at Mile-End; the prisoner lodged at one Price's, a brewer's clerk, just by me; he had lodged about the neighbourhood five or six months, I bought this whip and the spurs of him; I believe it was the 16th of March that Mr. Pigot had them of me, and I had then had them about a month; the prisoner came by me smacking the whip as I stood at my door; he came another day, and said he had a mind to sell it; as I kept a horse, I purchas'd it of him; I bought the spurs some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a name on the whip?</p>
               <p>Francis. Yes; I did not take notice of the name then; he said a gentleman had died at Edmonton, and had left his whip, boots, spurs, and great coat, to his servant, of whom he had them; I went out with two friends to Little-Heath, on one side of Wormly, two of us in a chaise, and one on horseback; we stopped to dine there; from thence we went to Edmonton; I lay at a publick-house there; a man at the publick-house examined the whip, and then asked me how I came by it; I told him; he said it belonged to one of his neighbours, and that it was stolen out of Mr. Pigot's house; I told him I had bought a pair of spurs of the same man; my friends and I, and this person, went to the prosecutor's house on the Monday Morning, and shewed Mr. Pigot the whip, which he owned.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he sell you the whip?</p>
               <p>Francis. I was at my door; we went down to Mr. Horsenail's, and I agreed with him and paid him there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not done in any private way, was it?</p>
               <p>Francis. None in the least, it was open to all the people that were in company. He was fully committed on Thursday, and on Saturday Mr. Wilmot sent after me; I went to Mr. Wilmot, who informed me that the prisoner had sworn against me, and that he must commit me. I sent for my father and several of my friends, and Mr. Wilmot indulged me with going to a sponging-house instead of a gaol; we were fully committed a second time, I and one Walby, who is a man of character and property; we were re-examined on Wednesday before six justices, and, when the justices had heard the whole of the case related, we were honourably acquitted; we were committed to the bailiff's house from Saturday night till Wednesday.</p>

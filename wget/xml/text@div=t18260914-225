            . I live in City-gardens; I am a silversmith. On the morning of the 16th of July, about five o'clock, I opened my back window, and saw the prisoner; I thought he made a mistake - considering it might be a thoroughfare; he then went away - I came to my front window, where I saw him returning; I dressed, came down, and saw him in Hirdsfield-garden - I asked what he did there? he said, he was taken ill, and had been to the privy; he ran away, and I called, "Stop thief! and ran after him - Hirdsfield hearing the noise, jumped out of the window, and he was stopped.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live at Ratcliffe-cross, about two miles from Mason's wharf. The prisoner offered to sell me some aqua fortis, on the 18th of January, in the morning. He was a stranger to me. I said I could say nothing to it till I saw a sample: he went and brought a sample, and said there were six bottles of it. Upon examining it I said, I could not afford to give above 7 d. a pound. Two porters brought it to my shop, but the prisoner was not with them at that time. He came soon after. I then asked him for the bill of parcels and the tare of the bottles; he said he had not got them: he said the weight of them was about four or five hundred pounds weight, and the value would be 15 l. 2 s. The bottles were not all full; three of them had been recently opened. I told him I could not pay him in less than a fortnight. He desired to have six guineas then. I paid him three, and promised him a draft for the rest, which was 11 l. 19 s. the next morning. The prisoner called twice in the morning, but I was not up; after that a porter called for it, and I gave it to him. I went to breakfast, and then I saw an advertisement of six bottles of aqua fortis being lost out of a boat. I sent to give notice to Coney and Co. that I had such a number of bottles. The prisoner came about ten. I said, Here is a fine piece of work, the bottles are stolen. He said, I have stopped the draft, and returned it. I then asked him for the three guineas, but he denied he had received any. I stopped him before any body came to my house from Coney and Co. then the prisoner said, he was not the man that sold me the goods; and before Sir

               <p>It is a very unlikely thing that I should go to dispose of the bottles, where I have lived twenty years, in the open day, if I had known they had been stolen. A well-dressed man came in at the back door at the Ship-a-Ground, within thirty yards of my own house; he said he was mate of a ship, and had this aqua fortis to dispose of. He took out a bottle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220033"></xptr> from his pocket, and desired me to go over to Mr. Tease and ask him the price of it, and said he would satisfy me. I went to Mr. Tease, and asked him if he bought aqua fortis; he said, I do. He spoke German to his man. I shewed him the sample; he said he would give 7 d. a pound for it. I said I thought it was sold by the gallon. Said I, I will go to the man, and let you know in half an hour whether you shall have it. I went to the gentleman, and said, I believed he could get no more. Then he said, Go over again, and ask if he will give 8 d. I went, but he said he would not give it. I went home; and after that the gentleman sent me word to go over and see the bottles weighed. They weighed four hundred, two quarters, and eighteen pounds. Mr. Tease told me he had no money in the house, but that he would pay in a little time. I told the gentleman. He said he must have five guineas. I went again, and he gave me three guineas in part; which I never put in my pocket, but went and gave it to the gentleman. He got up, and said, Do you stop a bit, and as soon as I come on shore again, I will pay you for your trouble, but he made off, and I saw him no more. I went as soon as I saw the advertisement to Mr. Tease, and returned the note.</p>

He brought a phial of aqua fortis to me on a Monday in January, about eight or nine in the morning, and asked me if I knew the value of it. I said, I did not. He told me a mate of a ship delivered it to him for sale. He is a very honest man.</p>

            . I am a sugar-refiner at Old Shadwell Stairs. The prisoner brought a sample of aqua fortis to me, saying he had a parcel that must be sold for ready money; and he was to be satisfied for his trouble if he sold it. I said I did not know the value of it. He called some time after, and said he had been offered 7 d. a pound for it by Mr. Tease; and he dined with me that day, and said then he had agreed. I have known him five or six years, and never knew, or heard, any ill laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a seafaring man with him at this time?</p>

            . I keep a public house. On the 19th of January, in the morning about nine o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, and asked me what I chose to drink, saying, he was afraid he had got into a hobble. How so? said I. He said, as he came along he went into a public house, and reading some paper, he saw the very same quantity that he had sold advertised; and that it was aqua fortis? I said, What business have you with aqua fortis. He said, it belonged to a ship at Bell Wharf. While we were talking, in came a porter with a piece of paper in his hand; he said to Mr. Starkey, Have you seen him? (They were the very words.) What is that you have in your hand? said Mr. Starkey. It is a bill I got of the Doctor, said the Porter. Mr. Starkey took it and opened it, and gave it me, and said, Here is the thing I was relating to you, and added, What shall I do? I said I knew Mr.

Mr. Tease was standing at his door, who said to Mr. Starkey, Here is a fine piece of work! Starkey said, I have stopped the draft, for I saw the advertisement, and am come to acquaint you of it: you know it was not mine. Mr. Tease said, I do not care for that, I shall stop you.</p>

            . I am a weaver. On the 18th of January I went to the Ship-a-Ground by Ratcliffe-cross, about eleven o'clock in the morning, where I saw Starkey come in with a couple of men. I heard him say something to them, and saw him put down two or three guineas upon the table, but do not know who took them up. They talked about meeting the next day. They seemed to be seafaring men. One of them looked like a mate of a ship.</p>

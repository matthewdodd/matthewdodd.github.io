I keep the Terminus Hotel Tap, London Bridge-on 3rd March, about half-past 11 at night, the two prisoners came in—I knew Burton—Sullivan asked for a pint of beer, and gave my wife a shilling—she put it in the detector—it bent—she said it was bad, and put it on the counter—Sullivan took it up and said to Burton, "You must be a fool, you must have known it was bad, you must have got it from your favorite"—I did not hear Burton make any reply—she paid for the beer with two penny pieces, and they left together—I followed and gave them into custody—I had served Burton three or four days previously, and she then gave me a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, which I bent and returned to her.</p>

On the night of 3rd March I saw the female prisoner in Mary's Pond; in a few minutes the man joined her; she gave him something out of a basket and said, "You call for a pint;" they went into the Terminus Tap; they came out in about five minutes, and in consequence of what the landlord said I took them into custody—I found the bad shilling in Sullivan's hand—he said Burton was his sister.</p>

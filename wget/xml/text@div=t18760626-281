                  </hi>. My mother keeps a toy shop in Powis Street, Woolwich—on 22nd May, about 8.45 p.m., the prisoner came in for a pocket knife—I said that I had not got one, and he asked me for a black-lead pencil and gave me a half-crown—I put it in the till where there was no other silver and got the change, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., from my mother—two or three minutes after the prisoner left I found that the half-crown was bad—I went after him and saw him at the corner of Union Street; two children joined him—I spoke to a policeman who followed him and touched him on the shoulder, he then ran away—I gave the bad half-crown to my mother and afterwards got it from her and gave it to the policeman—this is it—going to the station the prisoner said "I will give you another for it"—I said "I cannot take it."</p>

On the 22nd May about 9 o'clock the last witness pointed out the prisoner to me; he had two children with him—I put my hand on his shoulder and said that I should take him for passing a bad half-crown at a toy shop—he ran away, but I caught him about a dozen yards off and took him to the station—he said going along" I will give you another if that is bad," and produced a good half-crown—I found on him a half-crown, three shillings, and four sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and a Hanover medal, a pocket-book, and two pencils.</p>

I had no coppers when I went into the shop. I got them afterwards; my purse is very long and the small coins went to the bottom and the half-crowns came to the top.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George's parish. I know Jago. On the 10th October about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, (my beat is on the cast side of the square, by Mr. Ord's door) he called me to him. I saw his wife standing at the area gate, they said they had been down the area and could not get in at the kitchen door, he put the key in the door, and said, "Now it is locked," he unlocked it, and said, "Now I cannot get in." - He tried it once or twice, and told me to try it, which I did, and said it must be fastened inside. We at last got in by breaking the door open. Jago, my brother watchman, and myself all went in, the door had been bolted inside. We went into the housekeeper's room, in the passage, I asked him if all was right; he said, "Yes;" but turned round and said, "This door is not right." The door hung on one screw. Supposing there was thieves inside, we got more watchmen, and went into the back kitchen, saw the window half up and one iron bar loose, this was in the back area. We went into the area, and Jago took hold of the iron bar and pulled it, and said "This is where they have got in." We went up to the hall, and on the first pair of stairs, we found a candle, not a-light, the house was quite in disorder, and a cutlass in the front parlour, and a bundle of keys, some clothes and things were scattered about the room. We went up to the next floor and found all the drawers broken open and the locks forced, the house appeared to have been plundered from bottom to top. We found the scabbard of the cutlass at the top of the house, but could find nobody, though we searched the whole neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time was your attention called to the house - A. About a quarter past ten, it appeared to me to be plundered.</p>

            . I have known Beck six week, or two months, I believe I knew him a week or a fortnight before October last, he came into a chandler's shop where I was, Pugh lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on any occasion, Beck's letting you into any secret - A. After I bought the duplicate of a coat of him, which was lined with silk, and trimmed with fur, he told me I must get it out, for they were going to make a crack, where it came from. I did not know what that meant then, I have since been told it meant they were going to break into the gentleman's house where it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the night of the 10th of October, last A. I do not know the night, but it was on a Wednesday night; Beck, and the hackney coachman came to my lodging, and brought a bundle each, Beck asked me to lend him 2 s., to pay for the coach, he took the bundles to his lodging, I do not know where they were put at that time, but he took them to his lodging, and then came to my lodging, with a white bundle under his arm, this was the same night, it was a white bundle that I saw both times, this was between eight, and nine, or ten o'clock I believe; I saw the bundle opened, and saw, what I supposed to be a Coronation dress, it was a buff, or white cassimere jacket, trimmed with light blue silk, and a star on it, it was embroidered with silver; there was also a little time-piece, about nine inches long, with a yellow face, and in bronze, and a pistol, about twelve inches long, these things were brought down into the cellar, of No. 19, Vine-street, where I lodge, I held the light. On that same night I received from him a sheet and a table-cloth, marked, H. O.; and I think there were more letters, but I will not be sure. I wanted to pay Beck for them, he was to have 18 s. I took them next morning to the prisoner, Lewis, to raise me money to pay for them, I said, "Lewis, can you dispose of these, for I want to pay the men for them." He said I do not know, but if you will call on me, or meet me at a public-house, in the evening, I will do what I can for you; I left them with him. He was to meet me at the One Tun, public-house, in Chandos-street, in the evening, and did so, he went by the name of Lewis, I always knew him by that name. I have said his name was Jones, I told Pugh so, who was there, he met me and Pugh there, he brought a bit of linen with him, with a mark on it, it was the mark that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050041"></xptr>came off the sheet or table-cloth, he gave it me, and said, "We won't be done." I do not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A tailor. I live in Vine-street, Chandos-street. I have been assisting in a chandler's-shop and coal-shed, for two years. I know Mrs. Toole who lived in the same house as Lewis, I never employed her, I knew her by her lodging there. The sheet and table-cloth were brought about seven o'clock in the morning, on Thursday, I had no part of the contents of the first two bundles; Beck brought them. Lewis lodges about a quarter of a mile from Vine-street. I was apprehended at work, last Friday three weeks, I did not ask to be a witness. I advanced money on the things before I went to Lewis's, I got it from Pugh, and to repay him I took it to Lewis. After I was apprehended, I sent to Lewis to give me a character, if I should want one.</p>

            . I lodged in the same room as Gates. Beck came there about half-past eight o'clock, in the evening of Wednesday, the 10th of October, he brought nothing with him the first time, he had some conversation with Gates, and presently went out. Gates asked me for the key of the cellar, which I gave him, and presently Beck came in with a bundle; they both went into the cellar with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any second bundle that evening - A. I cannot say, as it was dark; but I believe Beck went out again, and brought in another, but I am not certain. About five minutes after, they both came out of the cellar, and the key was given me, I went from curiosity into the cellar, to see what the things were, and I saw a large table-cloth, loose out of the bundle, I noticed no mark. I saw a large bundle tied up in a cloth, and in it I saw a time-piece, the face was a gold colour, I lifted it up, the cloth appeared very heavy. I was with Gates, at the One Tun, public-house, the next day, the 11th of October, about one, in the day, when I went in Lewis sat there with a pint of beer before him, I did not then know his name; but a few minutes after, Gates told me his name was Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know Lewis before - A. No; I delivered myself into custody, and told the officers what I seen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you were there, did any thing pass between Lewis and Gates - A. They had some close conversation between themselves, I did not hear it, I did not see either of them give any thing to the other.</p>

I still objected; in the course of another week she watched me out of the house again, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, as soon as I opened the front door of the house, she rushed in, and insisted on my letting her have something - she went into Mr. Ord's dressing-room, and through that into a passage, and I went with her; she pulled open a drawer in the passage which was not locked - there was a quantity of Court dresses there. I told her that the drawer contained Mr. Ord's clothes, before she opened it - I was induced to do so by her urgent way of insisting on my compliance with her wishes. She took a coat out of the drawer, which was trimmed with fur about the collar and sleeves, and carried it out of the house - I went out with her as far as the Covent-garden Piazza, when I got there, she asked me to go and pledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050042"></xptr>the coat, which I said I could not think of doing; she continued to entreat me, and at length prevailed, and I went and pledged the coat at Mr. Lamb's, the pawnbroker, at the corner of Stanhope-street, Clare-market, for 1 l. 10 s., she remained out-side; when I came out I gave her the whole money, and the ticket, we separated - I went to my work in Duke-street, Lincoln's nn-fields.

She said she was acquainted with two or three men, and the best thing I could do to clear myself, would be to let them break into the house before Mr. Ord returned to town - I said I could not consent, this was on a Friday evening, she then proposed that she should come to the house the next day (Saturday,) and that I should let her in, and give her something to pledge, which I refused, and we parted. On the next evening (Saturday,) she watched for me again as I was going home, and asked when she met me, whether I would do what she proposed; I said "No." She then produced three keys, and asked me to try if they would not open some of Mr. Ord's drawers - I told her I could not think of doing such a thing, and that I had done enough for her; in reply she again threatened me with a disclosure if I did not comply. I refused; she then seized me by the collar, and said if I did not comply with her wishes she would immediately carry me to Bow-street, and charge me with having robbed Mr Ord - I then consented to take the keys and try them, she then left me, and I went home.

We had a pot of beer, and conversed about a quarter of an hour, he asked me if I would sell for him some tickets, as he was in want of money; he then shewed me an immense lot of beads, ear-rings, necklaces, two crosses, (one with hair, and the other garnet set in gold) which I declined doing; he invited me to call on him in Berkely-square, where he wished to converse with me, in the absence of his wife. I expressed my doubt of his having come honestly by all those things, he said he had; that he had possessed them for a long while, and now wished to raise money on them, in consequence of his having a brother who was threatened with an execution for debt, and who he wished to serve; he then told me that the house was No. 17, in Berkely-square, and appointed me to come at four o'clock, I was not able to get there till a little after six o'clock - I knocked and he let me in, he shewed me all over the house, his wife was absent, and he was in a hurry in going over the house with me, for fear she should return; he asked me if I would take away a sword for him, with a cut steel handle, which he said had been made a present of to his wife - I took it to my lodgings, and the next day he came and had it away. I told him I was afraid he was doing something wrong, he said, "Never mind that he wanted money for his brother, and he must have it," A day or two after he brought me a pair of pistols, and asked me if I would sell them for him, which I declined, he then asked if I would tell him a place to sell them at, I told him there were many gunsmiths, where they would buy such things; he then again pressed me to tell him where my sister was, as he said he would be a pound or two in her way, as he was sure she would tell him a place to sell the pistols at; I declined to tell him. In about two days after, he came to me again, and brought me a ticket of a watch, which was in pawn for 5 s., and asked me to take it out for him. I declined; he then left me in my room, the two pair back, saying he would find a person; he returned immediately, I asked him what he had been about, he said he had found a woman at the door whom he knew, and that he had given her the ticket to bring out the watch - shortly after a woman whom I did not know came and knocked at the door, and called to him, she gave him a watch, which he said was the one he had sent for, I then looked at it, it was a gilt one and small, there was a gold key, with a black ribbon to it, he asked me if I knew where he could sell it, I told him if it was his own, he had better pawn it; he took it away, but brought it another day, and I sold it for him for 16 s.

He then, for the first time, said he had been doing something wrong, and he must now go on with it; I asked him if his wife knew any thing of it, he said, "No," I advised his never letting her know. He said upon one occasion, he was afraid she would know by his being in a room which she asked him about, and he satisfied her.

            . I lived in Mr. Ord's family. I have reason to believe the piece of cloth produced by Mr. Till, to be a piece of Mrs. Ord's, shawl, she had such a shawl, which was left among other things when the house was robbed. I left town with the family, I know she left a red pelisse behind her, not a green one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You believe the cloth to be part of her shawl, from the colour - A. Yes; it is a common shawl, and here is a sheet, which I am quite confident of, it was in the house when the family left town. I have every reason to believe the table-cloth to be one which was left in the house; one end of it was hemmed by a person in the house. The marks are gone off all the linnen, it appears fresh hemmed where the mark ought to be.</p>

I left town in June, and returned in October, I have the care of the linen, this is one of the sheets left out for Mrs. Jago's use.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BECK'S Defence. With great difference, I submit the following statement: I was innocently led into this; Jago called on me where I live, and asked me to sell the duplicate of a coat and waistcoat, which I did, having no suspicion that he came dishonestly by them, as he said they belonged to his wife's brother, who lived in the country - Some days after, he again came, and I gave him the money I sold the duplicate for; he asked me to walk with him to a public-house, he asked me to walk to Berkley-square, where he said he lived, which I declined, he asked me if I could come about eight o'clock; I asked the reason he was so urgent for me to meet him there; he said it was not of much consequence, but if I would, he would be obliged to me; I accordingly went, and met him outside of the door; he said "I expected you sooner," and asked me to carry a bundle home for him; he gave it me, and I carried it home, without knowing the contents, and the next morning he came to me I gave it him. My character, up to this time, was unimpeached; I served three years in a seventy-four gun ship, Captain Sir C. Cole, was then drafted on board the Fly, was servant to Captain Baldwin eighteen months, I was then paid off, and went on board the Bulwark, bound for St. Helena, I then returned to London, and met an officer of the Conqueror, who recommended me to a ship at Woolwich, I could not get money enough, and have been looking for a ship. I declare myself entirely innocent. I implore you to consider my case, and hope my character will induce you to shew me mercy. The whole of Gates's evidence is false.</p>

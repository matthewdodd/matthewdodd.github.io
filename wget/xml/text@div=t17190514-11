The Prisoner in her Defence said that she was early up in order to go to work, and that meeting the Prosecutor, he prevailed with her to go to a Brandy-Shop with him; that he was in a Loving Fit, pull'd out what he had, and would have to do with her, but he was not then fit for a Woman; that he having no Money to pay the Reckoning would have sold his Tobacco-box; but she would not let him and paid the Reckoning her self; that he told her he would fetch her Gown and Petticoat out of Pawn, and accordingly went with her to the Pawnbroker, and would have pawn'd his Box there for that purpose and some more Money; but the Pawnbroker, seeing what a Condition he was in, would not take it; that then he gave her the Box to sell; but she would not sell it; that she going up and down with him had laid out 10 or 11 Shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171905140003"></xptr> for him therefore refused to deliver the Box till he paid her.

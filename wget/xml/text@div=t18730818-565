                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of J. C. &amp; T. Field, of Upper Marsh, Lambeth, wax bleachers—we have another business in the name Cowan &amp; Co., in Moorgate Street—at the time he Was taken, Ralph had been in our employ as a labourer about six years, at Upper Marsh—I did hot know any of the other prisoners—in April this year, three blocks of yellow wax were shown to me by my foreman, Brockwell—in the preceding January, I had executed an order for Messrs. Clark, for shipment of ten tons of wax of a particular kind; the blocks were white and of a special shape—in executing these orders there was necessarily a surplus—that order would be executed at Upper Marsh, and such surplus blocks as remained would be kept on the premises to be worked up again in the next quantity—ten tons of yellow wax were supplied to Messrs. Clark, and I had no complaint of any deficiency—I caused inquiries to be</p>

               <p>made in April, and came in communication with King, who carries on business in Union Street, Southwark; and about the same time I saw some wax in a bag at my premises at Moorgate Street, broken up—I put two of the blocks together, and am prepared to swear that it was my make and my property—it was not in a state in which I should have sold it—I commu<lb></lb>nicated with the police at Scotland Yard, and obtained the services of Sergeant Croome—I went with him on 18th April to King's premises, and asked him to show me about 3 cwt. of wax; he showed me both white and yellow wax, and I took samples of it on a subsequent occasion—I can swear to 3 cwt. of wax as our manufacture, but I cannot swear we had not sold it, although the white wax I can swear was stolen—the yellow wax was finished, but the white wax was unfinished—King showed me two blocks, about 25 lbs. each, of unfinished wax, besides the 3 cwt. of yellow—I suppose the yellow to be mine as well—in consequence of what King said, I went to Jewell's premises in Gibson Street, Waterloo Road—he is a marine store dealer—I had a prolonged conversation with him, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I went, on Friday afternoon, to Mrs. Castle's premises, a marine store dealer's, of Union Street, Lambeth Walk, about ten minutes walk from Jewell's—I said "My name is Field, and this is Sergeant Croome of the Detective Force; I have come here in consequence of what I have been told by Mr. Jewell, who tells me that on various occasions he has purchased wax of your son, the wax so purchased is my property, and has been stolen from me, and I have called to ask you what account you can give me of it" (I ought to have mentioned that in the first instance I had asked for George Castle, but his mother said that he was not at home)—she said "I know nothing about the wax; I never had any on my premises, and I am sure my son has not, I don't even know what beeswax looks like; does it look like grease or tallow?"—I said "When will your son return"—she said that it was uncertain, as he was frequently away for days together, and it was quite possible he was in Yorkshire—I said I wished very much to see him—she said "I promise that he shall call on you directly he returns, and if I hear from him before he returns, I will let you know where he is"—I had brought some papers from Jewell's, and I said "I have his receipts which Jewell holds, which he says are in your son's handwriting, for money received for beeswax; is that your son's writing?"—she said "It is like it"—she said "You may, if you please, search the house;" 'that her son in addition to helping her in the business did business on his own account—I then left—next day I went again, but I, had received four other pieces of paper from Jewell—I am not sure whether I had seen Jewell before I went to Castle's house again, but it is quite likely—I merely inquired whether George Castle was there, but did not find him—that was Saturday—I saw Jewell on the Monday, and gave him some information about George Castle, and on that Monday evening George Castle came to me at my office in Lambeth Marsh—I said "Mr. Jewell has given your name to me as the seller of a large quantity of wax"—he said "I have sold wax to Jewell on many occasions, and I can give the receipts of the parties from whom I purchased it"—I asked him where the receipts were—he said "At my house"—I said "I am willing to go with you and see them at once"—I walked with him to his house, and a search was made—two pieces of paper were shown to me—one was a receipt in the name of Howe, of Clapham Road, and another in the name of Woolf, but no address—a statement was made that Woolf resided in the neighbourhood</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180189"></xptr>
               <p>of Spitalfields—I called Castle's attention to the fact that both the receipts related to sales in 1872, and said "Surely the blocks of wax I have seen were not manufactured till 1873, and therefore these receipts can by no possibility apply to them"—he said "I have many other receipts, but they are probably at my mother's house, from where I have only just removed"—this was at his private house, two or three minutes' walk from his mother's—he said "I have made no recent sale to Jewell"—I then went with him to his mother's house, and searched there, but no receipts were found—I then went back to his house—Croome took the particulars of the two receipts, and we left—Castle said "I will call on you on Wednesday"—he did come on the Wednesday, and said "I have been endeavouring to find the parties whose receipts I have shown you, bat I have been unsuccessful"—I told him that Croome had been trying to find Howe, and no such person could be found in the neighbourhood—I don't remember that he made any remark to that—he said he was in the habit of doing business with persons whose names and addresses he did not know—he said "I have bought wax from such parties, and I shall, no doubt, come across them in the course of business shortly, and will get their names and addresses and let you have them, and I will call upon you again next Monday"—I said "Castle, this is an attempt to throw dust in our eyes, and you may call again if you please"—that was Wednesday evening, 23rd April—I saw nothing more of him till the 3rd June, when he was in custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts handed to me by Jewell, which I showed to Mrs. Castle, some of them have no dates—they show a total of 5 cwt. 3 qrs. 2 lbs.—the prices are; 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10 1/2 d., and 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—the yellow wax I saw at King's was worth from 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and the white wax from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—I afterwards went to the premises of Johnson &amp; Co., Bishopsgate Street, and saw seven blocks of white wax, representing 2 cwt.—I indentified it as my manufacture—four blocks were saleable and in a finished condition, and three blocks; were unfinished—I afterwards went to Mr. Edwards, the doll maker, in Waterloo Road—he showed me some papers, and I showed him a sample of wax—I did not see any of my wax there; it had been used—I received a communication from a person named Rumble, which I communi<lb></lb>cated to Croome with certain instructions, and he came back to me and brought two pieces <hi rend="italic">of</hi> yellow wax, each weighing six or seven pounds, which I identified—it was in an unfinished state and not as it would be sold—it was worth about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—about the same time I received information from a person named Gadsden, and went to the place of Mr. Williams, 108, Minories, where I saw the witness Addis—I had a conversation with him, in eousequence of which I went to Howe's shop in Cambridge Heath Road, on 28th April—Croome spoke first; he said "I was here a day or two since, purchasing wax, and on my return I found that you charged me less than you should have charged"—Howe rectified the amount, and Croome paid him some money—Croome then said "This is Mr. Field, and he has come about the wax that I purchased"—I said "I am Mr. Field, of Lambeth. I have been robbed of this wax to a very large extent, and this is an officer from Scotland Yard who purchased some wax from you that I know to be mine, in a state in which it would not be sold, I must ask you to tell me from whom you bought it"—he said "I bought it from a man, whose name I do not know, from a traveller who comes round to me every Thursday, and with whom I have done business for some time"—I said "You must</p>

               <p>know his name and address"—he said "I know neither"—I said "Do you buy goods without getting a bill or receipt?"—he said "No, no doubt I have one somewhere"—he searched, and produced a bill from which the printed head had been torn off, and the writing was so obscure that it could not be deciphered whether it was wax or not—I said that he had made a mistake in giving me that—I still pressed him for the name and address—he said he would ask the man when he called again—on 30th April I called again, leaving Thursday between—I said to Howe "I have called again about that wax, and hope you are in a position to give me the address of the person of whom you bought it"—he said "Yes," and he gave me a receipt in the name of Haywood on one of his own bill-heads—I said "This is no address"—he said "The seller declines to give his address"—I then produced some samples I received from Mr. Gadsden, and said "I am informed you have offered wax to this sample, for sale to the amount of 2 cwt."—he said "I have not'—he was asked that question several times, and repeated the same answer—I can't say whether the samples I showed him were my manu<lb></lb>facture, because they Were so small—Croome mentioned Castle's name amongst several others, as persons from whom he might have bought the wax—he said "No," to 'every name that was mentioned, including Castle—Ralph's name was not mentioned—on Tuesday, 3rd June", my manager, ‘Mr. Walker, brought Witham to me—I made no inducement to Witham, but I had offered a reward by placards—I did not promise not to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>but Howe possessed only yellow wax and no bleached wax, to my knowledge—I identify the wax Howe had by its peculiar appearance, and it also fitted into my tins—I swear to my own manufacture; it is my positive and absolute oath—the samples are about as big as walnuts; they are for the purpose of tradesmen judging of the quality—I declined to identify these samples on account of their smallness—samples are generally double that size, you seldom see a piece so small as this—Mr. Gadsden gave this to me—Howe had no idea that Croome was a detective till I said so—Hove was not open in his answers, quite the reverse—he represented the invoice of some oil as the invoice of wax—he said that the man had been there on Thursday and given the name of Haywood, and refused his address—he keeps am oil and colour shop, not a marine store dealer's—I should not have sold this wax in this state; it is competent to anybody to buy, but we don't sell goods in am unfinished state—I do not say that nobody ought to have bought it—I have always denied that—James King has bought a good deal, and Jewell also—John Edwards purchased a large quantity of my wax from King—the is not present—80 lbs. of my wax was purchased by Mr. Sundell, but it was not found there; he had none left—Sundell and Edwards purchased pieces in a finished state—I told Howe that unless he told me how he came in possession of my property I must find out for myself—he knew at that time that Croome was a detective—MESSRS. Johnson are a highly respectable firm—I buy wax largely for the purpose of making up, and I may purchase wax in the market—I very seldom buy wax of my own unfinished—Rumble is my witness—he has been paid money by me in the course of this case—I can't tell you how much—none of it has passed through my hands—he is a painter—I heard it stated at the Police Court that he is a convicted thief—I have given Sergeant Croome money to be expended amongst the witnesses for their travelling expenses to the different Mice Courts—I believe any direct money paid has been paid by our foreman, Thomas Brock well—I saw no wax in Howe's shop—I have heard that it was in the window, exposed for sale, and sold over the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Field's foreman, at Tipper Marsh, where the wax bleaching goes on—Ralph was a labourer there—I remember a package being brought from the City premises—I found in it three blocks of yellow wax, similar to those I had manufactured for Clark &amp; Sons in January—I identified a portion of it as sample blocks of that manufacture the remainder of it consisted of oblong blocks of yellow wax in pieces, which I also identify as Messrs. Field's manufacture—I went to King's premises, and saw two blocks of semi-refined wax there, which I identified as Messrs. Field's—it was wax which is not sold by itself, except for the purpose of being mixed with other wax—I also saw, in King's bedroom, about 2 cwt. of refined yellow wax, which I identify as our manufacture—I then went to the landing, and saw four boxes of refined yellow wax, bleached</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180192"></xptr>
               <p>and finished, in condition for sale, which I identified as Mr. Fields manu<lb></lb>facture—I also found a bag there with two sorts of wax in it, mixed up in pieces—that was our manufacture also—I sent to Messrs. Johnson &amp; Sons' some wax of Mr. Field's manufacture, and noticed that two blocks of it were not finished for sale—as to the second lot supplied to Clark, 10 tons of it were made in earthenware vessels—I identify it by the shape of the vessels in which it is made—the former parcel was made in tin vessels—Rumble was ultimately brought to me—his name was mentioned, and I remember his coming to the premises about 24th or 25th April—nine men were brought out altogether, and Ralph amongst them—Humble pointed out Ralph the moment he saw him—on 30th May I went to Messrs. Middleton's premises in St. George's-in-the-East, and was shown some wax there—I had with me a portion of wax that Croome gave me, which had been purchased at Howe's—part of what I saw at Middleton's was in an unfinished state—a portion of that which Croome gave me was unfinished, and both were part and parcel of the same material.</p>

I saw some wax in pieces, in a bag, at King's; some of them were as large as the palm of your hand, some larger, and some smaller—I can't say whose manufacture this piece produced is, because it is in such a dirty condition—I don't know that I could recognise it if it was clean, but if it was white wax, and a little larger, I could; if the pieces were clean, it is very likely I might pick out a great portion of them—I think I could recognise this piece without any difficulty, because no one manufactures it in the same way as we do—I know it by the beautiful was in which it is got up; our wax is, I believe, got up better than anyone else's—I don't think it is more difficult to identify white wax than yellow, if you give me a piece of the proper size.</p>

I am the wife of Walter Dennis, of 44, Carlisle Street, Lambeth—I know Ralph by sight; he lives in the same Court opposite me, and Mrs. Scott lives in the same house with him—I have worked for Mrs. Castle several years at rag and paper sorting and house cleaning—I have seen Mrs. Scott come there from the end of September, or the beginning of October, till three weeks afterwards—she generally came every morning at 9 or 10 o'clock, and brought a large bundle under her shawl and went away without it—Mrs. Castle has been in the house at the time, and sometimes her son and son's wife—after Mrs. Scott left I have seen white and yellow wax on the floor, in the shape of basins—I saw that every time she came—when she came in I used to go out in the yard to do my work, and sometimes I was Bent for to get change, which I brought and gave to Mrs. Castle—I did net see what she did with it—my mother, Mrs. Cook, sometimes went there to work—our court is not five minutes' walk from Mr. Field's factory—Mrs. Castle sometimes told me to fetch her son while Mrs. Scott was there, and he came—I have seen Ralph, and Mrs. Scott, and George Castle, several times drinking together at the Carlisle Arms, which is not far from the factory—I went there to fetch beer—I saw Jewell there once with George Castle and Ralph—on 14th December George Castle told me to go to Jewell's house, and I went there and assisted them, and saw Ralph drive up to Jewell's door in a cart, which I believe was George Castle's—they brought something in a bag to Jewell's shop, and after they had gone I saw some large pieces of white wax in the parlour—once when I was working at Mrs. Castle's, George Castle gave me a bag, and asked me if I would take it to Jewell's for him—on my way I fell down—I then went into my own house and sat down, and the top of the bag came open, and I saw pieces of yellow wax in it—my sister-in<lb></lb>law and my mother were there, and saw it—that was in November—I took it to Jewell's, and saw Mrs. Jewell; Mr. Jewell was not up—shortly after dinner, in consequence of something my mother' said, I went to Mrs. Castle's, and told George Castle that a gentleman had been to my mother, and asked her if she was aware that Mrs. Castle bought, white wax and scented soap—he said "I have heard a different thing altogether"—Mrs. Castle came in and said "<hi rend="italic">Liz</hi>, what is that?"—I asked her whether she was aware that the gentleman came and asked that—she said it was no such thing; that Castle used to try, but they did not now—I did not see the gentleman—I said it was nothing to do with me, but they must take warning—I went home and told my mother to come—I left off going' to Castle's on the Saturday after I left—I still saw Mrs. Scott going out of the house every morning with a bundle under her arm, not going towards Mrs. Castle's, but in a direction that would lead her to Jewell's, which is a quarter of an hour's walk—when she returned she had no bundle—Mrs. Castle's is ten minutes'</p>

I was employed by Mr. George Castle, of Union Street, Lambeth Walk; in June last a man drove up in Union Street, with a horse and cart, in front of a paper shop, near Castle's house, with three lots of wax. I weighed one of them; it weighed three-quarters of a cwt I don't remember what the others weighed. Mr. Castle was present at the time.</p>

Field's, and that Ralph was at the station—she said Ralph was a lodger of hers; if he knew anything about the wax she did not.</p>

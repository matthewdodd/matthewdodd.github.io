                  </hi>. I carry on business as the proprietor of some Turkish baths at King's Cross—I am a member of Tattersals and make books on races—sometime before February, 1873, I had been acquainted with a man named Vere—we had had betting transactions together, and I had lent him a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which he gave me a promissory note—he called on me in February, 1875, and on 23rd March, I attended at some offices at 52, Chan<lb></lb>cery Lane—prior to that, in February, 1875, I had been introduced by Vere to the prisoner—he introduced him to me as Mr. Rees, his solicitor—in consequence of that representation, I handed to Vere certain sums of money; I did not advance it on the guarantee produced—this letter was not shown to me; I never saw it before I saw it at the police-court—on 23rd March, I had an interview with the prisoner and Vere, at 52, Chan<lb></lb>cery Lane—I went there with Vere and saw the defendant there—I believed him to be Mr. Rees, the solicitor, as he had been previously introduced to me—Vere said in his presence that he wanted to borrow 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, and would Mr. Rees be guarantee for him—I cannot give the exact words, but that was the meaning of it—he said he would—I said they must go to my solicitor, Mr. Apps, and have the business transacted there—Vere and I went to Mr. Apps, and I had a conversation with him in Vere's presence—Mr. Apps went back with us to Rees' office—there was no one in, we waited there a few minutes and then the prisoner came in—Vere said to Mr. Apps "this is Mr. Rees," meaning Johnson—Johnson assented, he did not say anything to the contrary—Mr. Apps asked him if it was true that he, Rees received 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year on Mr. Vere's account—he said "Yes" it was—he then asked him if he would accept the bill with Vere—he said he would do anything to oblige Mr. Vere—Mr. Apps then drew out this promissory note. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "March 23rd, 1875, four months' after date I [<hi rend="italic">altered to</hi> "we"], promise to pay to Mr. Robert Vere on his order 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for value received. Thomas Rees &amp; Co. Payable at 52, Chancery Lane.") I know nothing about the "I" being altered to "we"—the prisoner signed "Thomas Rees &amp; Co."—I handed to him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., ho had previously had 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he promised me for the accommodation—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is my cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was induced to part with it by the prisoner representing himself to be Rees, Vere's solicitor, and I thought he was so, I thought it was quite right, as I asked the prisoner when I first went to the office how long he had been Vere's solicitor, and he said two years, and that he paid Vere 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for two years—the 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pro<lb></lb>missory note was never paid—subsequently, in April, a fresh application for money was made to me by Vere, while the promissory note was still running; I attended again with Vere at the office of Rees &amp; Co.—I there saw the defendant—I said "How do you do," and he said "Very well thank you," and he appeared to know what business we had come on—Vere said that I had come to lend him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: I asked Rees if he would accept a bill,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310070"></xptr>
               <p>and he said "Yes"—a bill was drawn (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know whose writing it is, but this is the prisoner's signature—Rees or Vere produced the bill already drawn—the prisoner wrote the acceptance in my presence; I handed this cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Vere—the bill was for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered to give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the money, and I handed him the balance, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes. (<hi rend="italic">The bill and cheque were read, the acceptance to the bill was "Accepted at our office, Thomas Rees &amp; Co."</hi>) I parted with my cheque and notes in conse<lb></lb>quence of Mr. Rees guaranteeing it, I understanding Johnson to be Rees &amp; Co., and he said that he had the money quarterly, and he would see that I was paid, I believed him to be Mr. Rees, a solicitor—I thought him to be Vere's solicitor, and that Vere received from him 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that bill" was never paid—I subsequently gave instructions to Mr. Apps, my attorney, for the purpose of recovering the money; I then discovered Rees to be the prisoner—when I gave the first cheque, I saw Vere and the prisoner coming towards the bank at King's Cross, on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> together, 200 yards up Gray's Inn Lane—that was about an hour after I had handed over the cheque—I have seen Vere since—the last time I saw him was on the Sun day night, before the summons was taken out against Vere and Johnson—this case was four or five times before Mr. Vaughan at Bow Street—Vere did not appear on any of the occasions; I have not seen him since, or been able to ascertain where he is.</p>

She did not go to Mr. Apps' office, but I have seen her—I saw him go and speak to her in Holborn; I cannot tell whether going to or coming from Mr. Apps'—I know nothing about the sister not liking the proposed engagement; if I did hear of it I have forgotten all about it—to the best of my knowledge I know nothing about it—I might have heard of it, if I did I do not see that it has anything to do with this—I have not squeezed anything out of Vere, whatever I had from him he owed it me—the horse he backed did not always lose, sometimes it won—he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> hare had more from me than I from him—I have two books which show the extent of my transactions with Vere; they are not here, they are at my house, 25, Harrington Square—I can fetch them before this case is over, I think—I really cannot tell you whether I won from Vere or he from me till I examine my books—if I laid him against the winner I paid him and</p>

               <p>he did not pay me—he owed me 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had only three or four transactions; there were four meetings—I do not know whether he or I won on the general transactions because I have not searched my books since, and it is about five years ago—I never won 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on one transaction—there is not a balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my favour—I have never said so—the first time I went to 52, Chancery Lane was in February, and on that occasion I went with Vere—I was taken there on 25th February and this man was introduced to me as Mr. Rees, Mr. Vere's solicitor—I refused, on the 25th, to advance 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on getting warrant of attorney to enter up judgment, and I went away and I had a letter from Mr. Vere on the following morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 26th February was it agreed that you should advance 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., having stated that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was already due, and that you should take as secu<lb></lb>rity a warrant of attorney to enter up judgment on three respective sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left it to my solicitor, it was something of that sort-on the 26th February there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on an old debt, and I was to advance 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more; it was not 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, and I was not to add another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to it, making 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) never came to my knowledge before I was at the police-court—it was produced there by my attorney's clerk—I can account for how my attorney got it—Mr. Cork got it (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> To Josiah Johnson, Esq., 25, Harrington Square.

Yours truly, Thomas Kees &amp; Co.") My solicitor did not, after that was in his hands, prepare a warrant of attorney and send his clerk, Cork, to 52, Chancery Lane, with it—I do not know anything about the warrant of attorney being prepared and taken to 52, Chancery Lane, for execution; I only know that I had not seen it—I was not told afterwards by Mr. Cork or Mr. Apps that when they took it to Johnson he said he could not witness it, for he was not an admitted attorney; I wish they had told me that, they would not have got any more money from me; I did not hear anything about it—I believe that Mr. Cork got it executed and witnessed by an attorney, Mr. Stretton, and paid over 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account—I do not remember being at the office, 52, Chancery Lane, in February, 1875, when a Mr. Dear was there—the first time I saw Mr. Dear was at the police-court—I know the man you are speaking of—I do not remember being with Vere in the office, 52, Chancery Lane, when Dear and other persons were present; I will swear I was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember that while you were so there waiting, Dear and you and the others, that Johnson came in and passed the lobby and went into the room opposite? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nobody in the office but me and Vere—Mr. Dear did not say "I believe that is Mr. John<lb></lb>son, I must see Mr. John<lb></lb>son first, I have important business and I cannot wait"—he was not there—I did not hear a conversation with Dear, and my asking as to the fact that Johnson the clerk, was Johnson, and the betting man was. Johnson; nothing of the kind took place—Dear did not ask me whether I knew a person of the name of Hope Johnson, and whether I could not tell him whether he was likely to get some money out of him, for he owed him a large sum of money; it is all fabrication—it appears that I only left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Mr. Apps to go to the borrower; I believed I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was cross-examined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310072"></xptr>
               <p>about it—I swore I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I believed I did leave 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a remand, and on the sccond occasion the question was put <hi rend="italic">to me</hi>, "How much money will you now say you left?" and I said "I will swear positively I left 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never thought about it since, but I had really agreed with Mr. Vere and left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I thought it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., although I saw that document—I believed I had left the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Mr. Apps, but it was a mistake, I only left 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I advanced the second sum on the 25th or 26th April Mr. Apps was not with me, I went with Vere alone—I expect the bill was taken already drawn, it was produced ready drawn—either Vere or the prisoner produced it ready drawn—it was accepted by the defendant—I took possession of it after it had been accepted; I am sure of that—I must have taken possession of it, I will swear I did; that is the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the contrary, was not the bill brought to you enclosed in an enve<lb></lb>lope by a messenger named Frederick Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know such a person unless it is the Jones who is a witness in the case, and I never saw him until I was at the police-court—I did not afterwards get that bill from Mr. Vere; Vere did not tell me that he had received it through the hands of a person named Jones, in an envelope; I am sure of that—I did not get it from Mr. Vere out of the office, I got it in the office, and there was not a fourth person there—I was there when the defendant accepted the bill; there is no mistake about that—I am sure I did not get it from Vere sub<lb></lb>sequently.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think this is the first time I have been asked about this being handed to me by Vere after I left the office—I don't remember being asked before—I cannot tell to a few pounds which way the result was of my betting with Vere—I should have to search my books, and it is five years ago—I did not bet with him at more than four meetings; the last time was four years <hi rend="italic">ago</hi>, and he had owed me 267. when he left off—I went to the office of Rees &amp; Co. on the 25th, and got this letter from Vere on the morning of the 26th.

Dear Johnson—I am sorry you have had so much bother to-day; I have seen my solicitor again, and will meet you at the Baths, at 12 o'clock to-morrow morning, and will have with me the letter exactly as you wished from him. Although I am comparatively a stranger, permit me to offer to Mrs. John<lb></lb>son and her niece, my kind regard, and believe me, yours faithfully, R. Vere.") He had introduced me Johnson as Rees, on the 25th, as his soli<lb></lb>citor—I did not go again when the security was taken—I did not hear, from Mr. Apps or his clerk, or anybody that he was not Rees, but John<lb></lb>son, not till he had been sued, and I had advanced the money—I never heard of this document till it was produced at the police-court, or of any warrant of attorney.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 7, South Square, Gray's Inn—I have been acting as solicitor for the prosecutor some years—he and Vere called on 25th February, at my office—he was going to advance Vere some money, and I advised him as to the best security to take—no one was to be guarantee then—I understood the prosecutor to say that he could not get a guarantee, and I thought a warrant of attorney would be better than a bill—Mr. Cork, my clerk, carried out the transaction, and I knew nothing further about it, except that it had been done—I did not see the document for a considerable time afterwards—on 23rd March, I saw the prosecutor again, when he said that he had arranged to lend some more money to Vere,</p>

               <p>and in consequence of other statements he made to me, I went with him and Vere to 52, Chancery Lane—(I don't know whether Vere had come with him, but I saw them together)—Vere walked in first, he took us up<lb></lb>stairs into some offices at the top of the house—there was a clerk there; I did not notice anyone else—Vere said that Mr. Rees was not in, and asked the prosecutor and myself to go and sit in his room, and we went—shortly afterwards the defendant came in—I don't remember Vere saying anything, but the prosecutor said "Oh, here is Mr. Rees"—I then spoke to the de<lb></lb>fendant I said "Oh, Mr. Rees, my chent, Mr. Johnson tells me he is about to advance a sum of money to your client, Mr. Vore, and I am in<lb></lb>structed that Mr. Vere has 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from, his sister, which comes' through your hands, is that so?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I am also in<lb></lb>structed that you are willing to guarantee the loan, and that it is proposed to do it by a bill to which you will become, a party;" he said "Yes"—I then drew this bill, "I promise to pay," &amp;c.—it is now "We promise"—the de<lb></lb>fendant appears to have altered it, but I did not notice it at the time—the "We" was not written by me—after drawing it I got up from the chair, and the defendant sat down and signed it, and upon that the prosecutor handed him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think the amount was—I knew nothing. of the man before—I knew nothing more till the note became due—I then issued a writ against Rees on it, and there was an order for leave to appear—there was substituted service—Mr. Rees could not be found—eventually judgment was signed, and then they took out a summons to set the judgment aside—it turned out that in the interim while the three days were running, three days after service, they filed-an affidavit for leave to defend, and they got leave, but they did not serve the order on me—I believed that no such order had been obtained, and signed judgment—it was obtained <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi>, and they got leave to appear upon affidavit—the Master made an order to set aside the judgment, because they had got leave to appear—this is an office copy of the affidavit of James Thomas upon which the order was made. (<hi rend="italic">This was the affidavit of James Thomas, of 52, Chancery Lane, staling that a copy order for substituted service of the annexed copy writ of summous was left at Rees' office, on 16th August, in his absence, and that this affidavit was made for leave for Rees, who was suffering from illness, to enter an appearance.</hi>) That was successful—there was another affidavit, stating that the housekeeper had not given them the order—Mr. Thomas is the gentle<lb></lb>man who was called at the police-court for the defence.</p>

I did not go to Chancery Lane until the 23rd March, but I was aware of my clerk, Mr. Cork, going there—I saw the warrant of attorney that was executed, possession of which was taken by Mr. Cork, about the time that the bill became due—my clerks. have been with me many years—I cannot say whether Cork sometimes passes for Apps, I should think it very wrong; he would not be in my office five minutes if I heard of it—I do not know that gentlemen of the Bar ever speak to a clerk as a principal—I was never called by the name of my prin<lb></lb>cipal when I was a clerk—I went over to the office with the prosecutor on the 23rd of March; I did not go after the prosecutor and Vere had been there; we all three went together—I am perfectly clear about that—I have no entry of going separately—they produced their Chancery Lane, call book, but that was their book and not mine, and I forget how my name appears in it—when I did see the warrant of attorney I observed that it was not witnessed by Rees, but not at the time, not till the time of the proceed<lb></lb>ings</p>

               <p>upon this bill, when I began to make inquiries—Cork retaiued the proceedings for the purpose of stamping—I became acquainted with it about the time of the writ being issued, and then I observed that the person who witnessed the warrant of attorney was not Rees. but Stretton—it needs an admitted attorney to witness a warrant of attorney, acting on the part of the party granting it—I consider Mr. Cork perfectly competent—I should suppose that if the person my clerk took to be Rees had been an admitted attorney he would have executed it without going to get somebody else to witness it—the defendant was not at my place of business to my know<lb></lb>ledge on the evening of the 25th February; I will swear that I did not see him—my call book does not show that he was there; I have got it here——' here is an entry, "Johnson and another and Mr. Rees"—Sweetlove, my clerk, wrote that; he is here—I did not see them—there is no time entered, but it is low down in the day—I do not remember the prosecutor leaving 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my office; whatever money he left he gave to Mr. Cork—I was not there—I have said before "I have no recollection of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being left on the 26th February, my mind is a perfect blank upon it"—I meant that if I had received money I must have recollected it—I do not feel that sometimes my mind becomes a blank—I was asked, and I said "No"—Mr. Cork has got his own room—I was not in his room—I handed the prosecutor over to Mr. Cork, I was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Apps—I first saw the prosecutor on the 25th February, and when they went out I saw Miss Clifford and Mr. Thomas—there were not two separate interviews; Johnson and Vere came into my room and were alone with me; Thomas and Miss Clifford were not in the room—the prosecutor said that he had arranged to lend Vere 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he also owed him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if Mr. Rees would guarantee it he would let him have the money—I men<lb></lb>tioned a warrant of attorney, having consulted my principal, and Vere said that it would be given—they then left, and I believe I saw Miss Clifford; I saw her next day, and I believe she was the same person—on the 26th I saw the prisoner at Mr. Rees' office—I had not been there before—I went there with Vere, and Miss Clifford followed—it was about 12 o'clock—I saw the defendant—Miss Clifford was not present, she sat in the outer office—when I went there Vere said to the clerk, Carter, "Is he in?"—the clerk said "Yes," and he pushed his way in, and said "Now, then, let us sign the papers"—the prisoner said "All Mr. Vere cares about is to get money and go and get drunk with it"—that was in Vere's presence—he said "I will do it if you will guarantee the repayment of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he already owes"—I had prepared a warrant of attorney, and I asked him if he would sign it—he said "Yes"—this was the guarantee which he sat down and wrote in my presence—the defendant read through the warrant of attorney, and hesitated over the attestation clause a minute or two, and then said "Mr. Rees is not here to-day, and I am not admitted yet, but I will take you to somebody who will attest it"—he called at one or two rooms and he took us to Mr. Stretton, who witnessed it, and the wan-ant of attorney was handed to me, and I took them back to Mr. Apps' office and put them in the safe—I made no communication to the prosecutor about his signing it before Mr. Stretton—I did not see him for a long time after<lb></lb>wards;</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk to Mr. Rees during his life—I entered his service on 8th February last year and continued till he died in September—I am at present in Mr. Hope's service, his successor, at 52, Chancery Lane—there is a general clerk's office to which clients come first, the middle office; that is the office which you enter first—I am there and keep the call-book in the absence of the other clerk—the name outside the office door is Rees &amp; Co. and Johnson—that is so that persons who come into the office must see the names—I was there on 25th February—-this is the call-book; I find the name of "Vere and friend" calling at 2.30 on that day—I did not know who the friend was at that time—when Vere called he said "Is Mr. Johnson in?"—I said "No"—later in the day I find Mr. Apps' name as calling at 4.10 alone; he asked for Mr. Rees—I told him that Mr. Rees was not at business, he was ill, but Mr. Johnson would be in shortly—Mr. Apps left, and when the prisoner came in I told him that Apps had been there and he left the office to see Mr. Apps, I believe, and he was absent</p>

I am an upholsterer at Hyde Park Corner—I have been there about forty years—I know the late Thomas Rees, of 52, Chancery Lane, well—he acted for me as my solicitor—I have known the defendant between three and four years as near as I can tell—his name is William Harril Johnson—I know that he was an articled clerk in Rees' house because he told me and my friend so, and Mr. Rees told me the same—I know no-thing about his articles being transferred to Mr. Hope—as near as I can tell I have seen Mr. Rees there generally two or three times a week—I have had Equity suits and ordinary common law suits and County Court suits—I am unfortunatily very much a patron of the lawyers—I some times get a bill, which I cannot get the cash for, and I have a great many interpleader summonses, more than most men in London—I have discounted bills for Rees and Co. to a large amount; I have had bills from Mr. Rees and I have had promises and I have had other bills put into my hand—when bills came</p>

               <p>to me by way of security, or bills endorsed to me, the signature of the firm was put either to an original document or an endorsement in the presence of Thomas Rees, Mr. Johnson would write "Thomas Rees and Co." by Rees' order—I was at 52, Chancery Lane on 25th and 26th Febuary 1875, I think I was there four days that week—Mr. Alfred and Mr. Thomas Hollington went with me on the 26th—Mr. Thomas Hollington is here—I think I went in first about 10 o'clock and I don't think Mr. Johnson was in—I went to see Mr. Rees and neither of them were there—I believe I went out and came in again—while we were there I saw Mr. Vere and the prosecutor in the outside office but do not think I had any conversation with them—I heard Vere say that he was very queer and wanted a bottle of soda water fetched, and I think Carter was asked to go, and he came back and said that he could not get a bottle—Johnson afterwards came in and went into the room on the right; the opposite room—as you go in from Chancery Lane there is "Rees and Co." and I think on the next floor or the nest, "Rees &amp; Co.," and when you got to the top there is "Rees &amp; Co.," and "Mr. Johnson," with a separation between the two—I don't remember whether there is anything on the door of the room into which Johnson went—when he came in I almost think Thomas said "Here is Mr. Johnson"—the prosecutor was in a position to hear that as well as myself, everyone could hear it, it is an open place—I then said "I must see him first because here is an interpleader case; and I have brought these two gentlemen to be security for me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."; I think it is was about the club at Brighton—I think the other two both spoke together and said "We must see Mr. Johnson directly," and I said I must see him first—the name of Johnson was, I believe, mentioned by both of them—I said "I must see Mr. Johnson first," and he would go as Mr. Rees was not there, over to Master Johnson at Rolls Buildings, because Mr. Hollington could not wait—having said that I went into Mr. Johnson room—no one was there I believe but himself—I did not stop long because I requested him to come across the road directly—I don't know who succeeded me in going into the room—I don't know what became of Vere and the betting man—I went over to Stone Buildings with the defendant—we then returned to 52, Chancery Lane, and I think we met Vere in the street, and he said "I must see you directly"—Johnson said "I have to go to the Judges Chambers for a few minutes"—no one was with Vere,<lb></lb>but this man Johnson, the betting party—that was said at "the foot of the door when we come out of "Stone Buildings—we all went up into the office again waiting for the, defendant to come in because I had some other business besides the inter<lb></lb>pleader matter, and when he came in the other Johnson was in the same room where we had been before—I asked him about Mr. David Hope Johnson, who owed me 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., hearing that he had some connection with the turf, and he said that I was not likely to get a penny—I said "You are a nice lot of Johnson's altogether"—I think I waited there till they had transacted their business, and I then went out and started Mr. Alfred Hollington, who was sitting in his trap below, and I returned and settled some other business with Mr. Johnson—I said to Josiah Johnson "I think you are a Staffordshire man"—he said something about Mr. Vere, who said I that he had a sister who was a rich lady, and I think he asked Mr. Hollington, who said "Who are the parties?"——he said "They are on the turf," and he said "They are not good enough for me"—I put it that he</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLE</hi>, I have known Mr. Johnson two or three years—I did not know him while he was practising under the name of Miller—I swear that—you know I was present when Johnson gave evidence in "Dear and Edmunds"—I heard him cross-examined then—I don't recollect hearing him admit that when he was called as a witness on one side he had given his evidence to the other side, or that he had given a paper to the other side to say what evidence he would give to them—I am cautious—I have no opinion to give as to how he came out of that cross-examination—Johnson did not act as broker on that occasion; I think it was some man in Hand Court, Holborn—it was not Rickaby—I believe the man lives between Holborn and Bed<lb></lb>ford Row—how could Johnson be the broker? he is an articled clerk—I believe him—I don't know whether he has any articles entered; it is not my business to look into articles of partnership—I think the first time I saw him was at the house where my goods were taken away—he did not put a distress into a lady's house; I believe it was a man who lives between Holborn and Bed<lb></lb>ford Row—if you had the lawyer here he would tell you whether the distress was put into the lady's house for half a year more than was due—I kept two lawyers in my counting house and paid them weekly, but not to practice as lawyers; one was Mr. Hunter, who does all my agreements for houses furnished and unfurnished—I paid him three guineas a week, and I kept; an Irish lawyer, Mr. Basterville, but not as lawyer, as clerk—I had no objection to take a little good advice from them—I require a great deal—I cannot say whether I have brought 100 actions in the last ten years—I am not a director of "Campbell &amp; Co." that I know of—I do not know whether this "W. Dear, Esq., 30, and 31, St. George's Place," on this prospectus is all a myth—I suppose there was some intention of bringing out something; you know something is required to enable a man to be a director of a particular company—show me my qualification—my son is not in the office of Campbell &amp; Co. to my knowledge; he was with Mr. Rees, but only a short <hi rend="italic">time</hi>—he might have been there twelve months, but really I cannot tell you the exact time—I have seen "Campbell &amp; Co., Law Agency," put up in Southampton Buildings—I mean to say that I have never seen this prospectus—I have an impression that Rees said something to me one day and I said "No," and I never consented to be a director—I do not know the Llanthony, Oxide, Lead, and Copper Mining Co. (limited)—capital 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I know "William Dear, Esq., of 12, St. George's Place, Knightsbridge"—I know nothing about this prospectus—somebody has taken a liberty with my name—I know nothing about "Auditors, Campbell &amp; Co., Chancery Lane, Mr. F. O'Brien, secretary"—I heard of Mr. O'Brien, as a solicitor, in the Exchequer, the other day, and there he is—I saw him at the police-court, but I did not know he was Mr. O'Brien, or whether he appeared for Vere—he never stood up in Court—he met me coming from the Exchequer Court, but I did not know he was Mr. O'Brien till he stopped me in Parlia<lb></lb>ment Street, and told me who he was—he was not instructing Mr. Matthews, the barrister, before the Magistrate—when the policeman asked me who was defending Vere; I said "Young Mr. Matthews"—I never saw O'Brien before, and did not know who he was—he never acted as my solicitor to my knowledge—I did not hear of an action between Lynch and Thomas Rees, in which they had seized some furniture—I put in a claim to the furniture</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310082"></xptr>
               <p>—I do not know that Mr. O'Brien appeared as my solicitor—there was an execution against Rees, the furniture being mine—I do not know who appeared for me—I forget whether it was on 26th April, 1875. (<hi rend="italic">A notice signed A. O'Brien, stating that the furniture in question belonged to William Dear was put in</hi>). My son heard of this during my absence and gave notice as it was his business to do—I know nothing about O'Brien appearing for me, and I have never paid him—Johnson may have instructed him to appear—he would be a very nice man if he did not, having my business, try to protect my interest—I had an impression that some Counsel acted—Johnson asked me to supply him with furniture—he said that Mr. Rees was coming into the office, 52, Chancery Lane, that he was a very clever man coming to practice there and would I do it, and I said that I had no objec<lb></lb>tion to do it—I do not know when that was, without my books, but I think it was between two and three years ago—it was my furniture—anyone that I can get the hire from was to pay for it—I like to get money out of people—I got between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of Hope John<lb></lb>son, and I believe I got a judgment against him—I only know what Rees told me twelve or eighteen months ago—I suppose it is a regular judgment subsisting now; I have not seen the judgment, but he told me so—I served a writ on Johnson (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know whose writing it is, certainly not mine—I will show you my writing in a moment with a pen and ink—I served David Hope Johnson on Lewes' racecourse last year, close to Brighton—he was stopping in the hotel at Brighton—it was for the hire—I swear that no-part of it is in my writing—I do not know that I served it; I do not know, but what you have been getting that up—I really don't know whether I signed a judgment on it—I don't sign judgments; I am not a lawyer—I haw heard that it was set aside—I do not know anything about the writ—I served another writ at Newmarket in 1873, and I can give you the secret of all that—I do not know whether a writ was issued on the 24th, the day after—I did not see it—I instructed Mr. Rees to attend to the matter; I was told that Mr. Hope Johnson would be at Newmarket—I drove up to Chancery Lane; one of the clerks handed me a writ; I drove to the station and went to Newmarket, went to the hotel and asked if David Hope John<lb></lb>son was there—they said "He is up at the course," and as he rode down the course with the Earl of Stamford and Warrington, an acquaintance of mine, he said "How do you do Dear," and I served him—it was last year that I served him at Lewes because he never would pay—this copy writ is not a forgery; there is no forgery—he said "It is a little mistake"—I said "You ought to have known better than make mistakes sending me all that distance on that wet day"—I do not think Johnson was attending to that business or I should have had some money—he is sharper than some of his clerks—I was going to the master's office on that day—my appointment was I believe at 11 o'clock—it was not a reference in Dear and Garrett, don't waste precious time—I could preach to you, if I had you quietly—I can lean preach in a railway, I never get into a pulpit—if Mr. Carter says that I go to church and preach, he knew nothing about me—suppose I do preach what would be the result of that?—I had not a case of Dear and Dr. Garrett, you mean the she doctress Mrs. Garrett not Dr. Garrett—her name is Anderson now—I do not know any Dr. Garrett, I know Mr. Garrett—I brought an action against him, I think it was for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I got an award made me of 300 of freehold land at Aldborough in Suffolk, and materials to the value of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not</p>

               <p>prove articles delivered, and therefore I was thrown upon that point and lost my articles; how dare you to say it is a forgery, Sir, I am not here to suffer a sa thief or a forger, Sir—I had to pay costs but I have got the land and the materials, but have not got them delivered yet, and therefore I shall have to bring another action—an agreement properly stamped was pro<lb></lb>duced be<lb></lb>fore the Master.—there were no interlineations in it—the Master found against me to a certain extent, but only because I could not prove articles delivered, but he gave me the 1,200 of freehold land and the materials, and I have been waiting seven years for it—I furnish houses for young gentlemen, but not for many young ladies—I have had some of the best customers of the day—I charge hire for the furniture, and deterioration if there is delapidation, but those we have to prove—I do not do much in bill discounting, I believe some of the people I do business with do; I asked you to try a good bill of yours before Baron Martin, and then you might try me, but you have never done it—I never, heard the defendant sing or play—he did not want a piano of me—I forgot whether Brins<lb></lb>mead &amp; Co. wrote to me about him—I had great confidence in his honesty—I do not know anything about bis giving his evidence on both sides in Dear <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Edmunds—I know I could not get my money out, I sent and paid half a crown the other day, but it did no good—I do not know whether this is the draft evidence produced on the part of Dear <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Edmunds, but I be<lb></lb>lieve it is Johnson's writing—here is Mr. Miller who was struck off the Rolls at the bottom of it—I had something to do with his being struck off the Rolls—I know Rickaby; I don't know whether he is the secretary of the United Lead Oxide Mining Company (limited)—I am not a director; if he has put me down I have never consented—I do not know whether O'Brien is the solicitor—I did not furnish Campbell &amp; Cos office, I furnished 52, Chancery Lane," but I never saw Campbell &amp; Co. there to my knowledge; I only knew Mr. Rees there as Thomas Rees &amp; Co—I do not know when the premises were taken, or whether they were taken by Johnson; I never heard from him that he took them—I know nothing about the rent or who pays it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. When I let furniture I do not inquire what the rent is, or whether it is paid—if Mr. Cole wanted me to furnish a house for him I should not inquire whether the rent was paid—I furnished a house in Gros<lb></lb>venor Square for a clergyman, and never made any inquiry—I might know something of you as Commissioner Kerr, and that would be enough for me; I should only like to get a good order from you.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a notice to withdraw the man in possession at the top floor of</hi> 52, <hi rend="italic">Chancery Lane, the premises being the property of the person signing the notice.</hi>) I believe when that took place I was out of town, and he might have written it to protect the furniture till I came to town—I was told about it, and I did claim it; it is still my property, was and is—I know of no case but one—I simply claim my property—it is of no consequence what it is—I tell you it was and is my property to-day, and the Judge said to the opposite solicitor "I am afraid you have no case," and he said "No, I shall with<lb></lb>draw"—I do not remember about the pianoforte—this letter, is in my writing.

The proof of that is that I had already done it—I do not know whether he ever got a piano, or whether a van was sent to take it away, or whether there was an action about it—I suppose Messrs. Brinsmead must have sent me a letter, and that was my reply—I do not know whether it was to know whether they could trust him with a piano—this letter is written on my paper—there is no doubt that they wrote me a letter, and that was my answer—I do not know that they are pianoforte manufacturers; I have no transac<lb></lb>tions with them; I think I have heard of the name—if you had given me notice I should probably have found the letter if I have it.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, carrying on business in Walworth—on the 26th February I went to 52, Chancery Lane, with my brother and Mr. Dear—my reason for telling you the date is that I had to go to Stone Buildings to become security, with my brother; we were bound over in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and that was the first time I was in Rees' office; that was the 26th February—after being bound over I went to 52, Chancery Lane, with Mr. Dear—I do not remember seeing anyone there when we got back, but I did not go into the office, because Mr. Johnson was not there; I only went into the intermediate place—I did not go into the clerks' office—I waited there for the defendant's return, and during that time persons who I believe to have been Vere and the prosecutor came in—when the defendant came back whoever was waiting tried to go by, and Mr. Dear said "No, I must see Johnson first"—the persons waiting could have heard that without doubt, because Mr. Dear spoke very loud—Dear went in to see Mr. Johnson, and I waited in the outer office; I did not go into the inner office—I saw Mr. Dear come out again; I was waiting for him—I think the other parties were waiting in the clerks' office, because they went in afterwards—Dear then went into the clerks' office to arrange something with them; he then went back again into the defendant's office; they were all there together—I was in the little aute-room, and stayed there the whole time till Mr. Dear came out again, and then went away with him—I have discounted bills for Rees &amp; Co.</p>

Johnson owed him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would have taken a fiver for it, but afterwards he paid him all, and he believed that if he had the money he would pay Mr. Dear—Mr. Dear said that he thought of making him a bankrupt—Dear told Mr. John<lb></lb>son not to take any proceedings at present, in the prosecutor's presence—after it was settled Dear asked the defendant whether they were brothers, whether they were all Johnsons, for there was Johnson, the defendant, and Johnson, the Master of the Exchequer, who had just been taxing the bill against Mr. Vere for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said that they were a bad lot—that after<lb></lb>noon a clerk, who I have since ascertained is Mr. Cork, brought a warrant of attorney to the office, Johnson having left with Vere in the meantime and taken the guarantee away with him; I am certain of that—Mr. Cork was shown into Mr. Johnson's room, and I went with him—he said that he wanted that warrant of attorney attested—Vere was not there, only the defendant and Cork and myself—Johnson said that Mr. Rees was away ill, and he was not admitted and he could not attest it—I suggested that they should go over to Mr. Watson, a gentleman who generally takes affidavits, and Cork and the defendant left the office—I saw the warrant of attorney afterwards, and Vere's name was to it—I do not know where or when Vere put his name; it was attested by Mr. Watson—Cork and the defendant came back together, and Vere was in the room when they came back, wait<lb></lb>ing—Cork gave some money to Vere, I did not see how much; I thought it was a guinea for himself, but I do not know—on the 23rd March Vere and the complainant came to the office; the defendant was there, and I think the complainant said "Vere wants another loan"—I do not remember the defendant's reply—they brought a promissory note ready drawn to Thos. Rees, Esq.—I think it was for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the defendant objected to sign it, because he said that he had no authority to sign that, but he could sign "Rees &amp; Co."—it was taken away, and he said he would see Mr. Apps about it—no other bill was drawn up—the prosecutor said that he would take it to Mr. Apps—in the course of the day Mr. Apps came,</p>

Hope &amp; Co.'s employment—I received my last salary last Saturday; Mr. Johnson paid me—I took part in preparing the brief for his defence, Mr. Hope is the solicitor who is defending him and instructing counsel for him, and whose name is on the briefs—they were prepared at 52, Chancery Lane—I have had daily and nightly interviews with the defendant—I was in the house the other night—I dare say Thomas took a part in it, and Carter too.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not articled clerk to the late Mr. Rees—my father is a solicitor practising in the Temple—I don't think I advised Thomas that there was a defence to the action on the bill, Mr. Rees was ill at the time, and we did not want to bother him about it—I do not believe there is a word of truth about Mr. Rees being a lodger at Sandy's—we were concerned for Sandy's—he is a man who has been convicted once or twice, and we got him a verdict of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there was an attachment to the amount of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance was for him—I think I have seen George Harper once—I never went to Rees at Paxton House, Fulham. but I have addressed letters there—Mr. Lynch never charged me with embezzlement—I first heard at Bow Street, of any charge Mr. Willicomb had to make against me, and he had known my address all the while—that was in the examination of this very case which we are dealing with to-day, and yet this took place prior to April 1875, because here is the letter in which he never mentions it—I got a letter subsequently from him, dated 11th January, 1876, in which he does not say a word about my having committed this offence—I saw him afterwards at the police-office-, and he made the charge—as to the bag, I was very ill, and I asked a clerk out of employment to assist me while I went home to rest, that clerk had the bag, and I asked him to leave it in Chancery Lane, with Mr. Carter, at Rees &amp; Co.'s, and Mr. Willicomb asked me for the bag; I said "It is with Mr. Carter"—I had seen Carter the next day, and asked him if the bag had been left, he said "No"—I said "Willicomb is very much annoyed, when it comes bring it to the office"—it was an ordinary 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bag—I bought it with Willicomb's money, and it was used in the business—I required somebody else to use it, because he was assisting me when I was very unwell, and he used to go out for me while I went home to rest—that was while I was doing Willi<lb></lb>coinb's business—I think his letter shows clearly that I had explained all that to him—I saw Jelf about 9th January, and I said "Did you ever re<lb></lb>turn that bag to Willicomb's—he said "The fact is, I did not"—and I directly sent a post-office order to Mr. Willicomb for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he re<lb></lb>turned it.</p>

The Jury, in reply to questions from the Court, stated that they disbelieved the evidence of Jones, Hollings, Thomas, and Carter, and the greater portion, of Dear's evidence. Mr. Cole stated that the prisoner began life as an omnibus driver, that he had been an infidel lecturer and editor, and the promoter of eight or nine bubble companies—<rs id="t18760131-183-punishment-32" type="punishmentDescription">

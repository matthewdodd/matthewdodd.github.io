                  </hi>. I keep an ironmonger's shop in High-street, Islington. Thomas Goulding was in my service—I received information, and gave him into custody—I then proceeded to his mother's lodgings, and, after searching some time, we found these various articles in her cup<lb></lb>board—the apartments were occupied by the prisoners as well as his mother—I found, at Mr. Smith's, six ten-spoons, one pepper-box, one flat-iron, and 2 pairs of scissors—I am able to swear to the whole of them.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to the house of the female prisoner—as I was going up stairs I met a female, I believe the prisoner's daughter—she ran back directly—I followed her into the room, and got up in time to see the female prisoner and the other female huddle something into a cupboard—I searched in some other places, and said I wanted to search in that cupboard—she said she could assure me there was nothing in that cupboard—I had known her so many years, and she pretended to search herself, which put me off my guard—I told her I must search, and then I found these things under some sauce-pans—I found some duplicates in the place, relating to other property, some under pots and kettles.</p>

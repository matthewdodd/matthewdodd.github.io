                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 92). On Saturday evening, 22nd January, I was in Guildford-street, Greenwich, in plain clothes, about half-past 7 o'clock, and on passing the Guildford Arms, I saw a horse and cart at the door—I looked into the house, and saw the prisoner Adams leaning on the bar reading a newspaper—I walked into South-street, Devonshire-road, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I saw the same horse and cart draw up in front of some unfinished houses, which I knew to be Mr. Fleay's—there was nobody with the horse and cart—I walked by it, and just as I got by, I heard footsteps behind me, and saw Shread come from one of the houses with a stick in his hand, smoking a pipe—knowing that there was a watchman there, I thought he was the watchman—he came up and looked me in the face but did not say anything—I went away and returned on the opposite side, and when I got past the cart with my back to it, I heard something fall in the cart, and saw Adams in it pulling at something, and a man with his back towards me pushing something into the cart from behind—they then went into the house—Shread was standing just where I left him, about thirty yards from the horse's head, still smoking a short pipe—a man whose face I had not seen, came out, brought out some lead, and shot it into the cart—I then saw his face, it was Walker—I am sure he is the same man who went into the house—he had something on his shoulder wrapped up in bass matting, but I did not know what it was then—I stepped into the road, and immediately heard a whistle which I believe came from Shread—Walker then ran through the house—Adams jumped out of the cart with the whip in his right hand—I pursued him; and finding I could not catch him, I made a feint after Shread who was walking away, and immediately I did so, Adams got into the cart again—he took the reins in his left hand—I ran to the back of the cart and said, <hi rend="italic">"Pigeon</hi> is it" meaning lead; "if you attempt to drive off, I will knock you down," draw<lb></lb>ing my staff—he immediately jumped over the side of the cart, ran away, and I saw no more of him—I had seen him at the public-house—I am sure of him—the lamps were at some distance apart—I then took Shread, and said "Halloa, Mr. Watchman, what <hi rend="italic">game</hi> are you after?"—he said, "I am not the watchman, I do not know the watchman; I have been to Mr. Jennings with an estimate for work"—I told him that I should detain him—a lad and a girl came across the road and said, "That is one of the men I saw in the house half an hour ago"—Shread said that he was not in the houses at all—I examined the cart at the police-station, and found these two pieces of lead, and two other pieces—I afterwards went back to the house and found another piece rolled up ready for removal in a piece of bass, weighing one cwt.—those in the cart weighed two cwt.—I have been on the roof and seen where they came from, but did not see the plumber fit them.</p>

I live at 2, Coldbath, Greenwich—I was at work at Mr. Penn's factory about half-past seven that evening—I was in South-street, Greenwich, near the new houses, and saw Shread going into No. 5, with a bass bag on his shoulder—I did not know him before—I went half-way across the road, and saw him—I was then about ten yards from him, and took notice of him—this is the sort of bag; it is rather worn—I am quite certain he is the man—when I came out, I saw Walker—there was a cart there then—Shread was about five yards from it, with a stick in his hand—I did not notice whether he was smoking—I saw his face—the lead was put into the cart, and a policeman came across the road, and said, "Halloa, what have you got here? it is lead"—Adams went round the horse's head from the house, and got up into the cart—the policeman said, "If you dare to drive that horse, I will knock you down"—Adams then jumped out of the cart, and I saw Walker run through the house—I had seen Walker come out of the house with a load, which afterwards turned out to be lead—I saw Shread at that time about five yards from him, walking slowly away—he was about two yards from the cart, with his back to me at the time Walker was bringing out the lead; he was behind Walker but not looking at what he was doing—this looks like the bag that I saw Shread go in with.</p>

               <p>—it was through Walker that I engaged shread—I never authorized any of them to remove lead from the houses.

I am a plumber—I did not make these gutters, but was called to examine them—I measured them, and they corresponded with the lead—there are no edges, because they take half gutters up without cutting—I did not put them down Again because they were too heavy to get through the trap-door on to the roof—one end was turned up and the other down—they correspond in length, width, height, and weight—the lead is five pounds to a foot, and that on the roof is the same—I did not examine to see if the nail holes corresponded—supposing this lead was stretched out, it would cover the whole of the place which had been stripped—the gutter is in two pieces, joined in the middle: one piece comes over the other, and this is one half of the gutter—this would make it complete—about half a ton altogether was removed.</p>

               <p>Did you know the man before? - No; my daughter went to Leadenhall-market and saw him at a fishmonger's, and came and told me; she was in the shop all the time he was there; on the Friday morning I went round the market, and saw him standing about the same spot; I informed Mr. Comyn, and he was taken up; I delivered the spoons to the constable.</p>

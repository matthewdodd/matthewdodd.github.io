             sworn. - Q. On Wednesday, the 12th of September, I had been out with a parcel, and when I came in, the last witness desired me to wait upon the prisoner; after I had shewed them several different patterns, they were going out of the shop unserved; I called the young man to wait upon them, and when he had shewed several different patterns, the prisoner at the bar ran out of the shop; on seeing her hand under her apron, it gave me suspicion that she had stole something; I immediately ran out of the shop after her, and overtook her in St. Martin's-court; I took the piece of printed cotton from under her apron, and told her to come along with me; she resisted at first, but the neighbours interfered, and she came home with me; I went and fetched a constable; I did not suspect her till I saw her running out of the shop.</p>
               <p>- HART sworn. - I live with Mr. Porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was the prisoner, or the other person, that produced the pattern? - A. The other; I let her go; the prisoner went out first; there were a great many other customers in the shop at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, in Lamb's Conduit-street. The prisoner has been my shopwoman nearly twelve months—I have several other young women in the house, engaged in dressmaking, but not in the shop—on Tuesday evening, in consequence of something that had hap<lb></lb>pened, I sent for a constable, and after he came I sent for the prisoner into the room—Mrs. Gunton was there, and I said, "Mrs. Holder, I want an explanation respecting this lace; this lace that you have had on your garments is precisely the same as the one Mrs. Gunton has just made op for herself"—the prisoner said that the milliner who made the gown had procured it for her, and put it on—we then asked who this person was; and she stated the name of the person, but said she was out of town—we then asked her where we could ascertain whether she really was out of town or not; and the statements she made were altogether unsatisfactory to me—I then said, "We should like to look into your boxes"—she made no objection, and we went up-stairs—she unlocked</p>

               <p>one of her boxes; turned over a great variety of things, several lengths of ribbon, many hundred yards of thread-lace, and among them were these two pairs of pink gloves—I asked her where she obtained them—she said she had them before she came to my house—I said, "These gloves are my property; I can swear to them; they have a private mark in the inside"—after she had turned over that box, she went to another, unlocked that, and in it was found a piece of diaper, which has my own private cost price on it, and which I also said I could swear to—she said she pos<lb></lb>sessed it before she came to live with me—I found several other things that I have no doubt are my property, but which I cannot swear to—I gave her into custody—she began to cry, and begged me not to do so—I said I had a duty to perform to the public, myself, and the other young people in the house, and I felt it my duty to do it.</p>

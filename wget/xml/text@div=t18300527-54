            . I am a bedstead-maker. On the 10th of May, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was in <placeName id="t18300527-54-crimeloc296">Wardour-street</placeName>

               <p>Jones. When he came to me the other day, he said he never saw my face at all. Witness. I have known his mother a long time; she requested me to come and bring him a shirt, but I deny what he says.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q. What proposition did you make to him? A. I said I did not know him till he was taken to the public-house, because his back was turned to me - I can swear to the dress he had on; I did not propose to receive money not to appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing their faces when they were in the street? A. No, but I saw their dress - I did not know it was Jones till after he was brought out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you go to the prisoner? A. Because he wished to see me - I was told I could not get in unless I said I was his brother, and I said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not call Stop thief! and take them? A. I hardly knew what to be at.</p>

On Friday morning, 12th June, I was on duty in Old-street—I was called to the shop of Mr. Hoare, pawnbroker, in Old-street, about noon; half-past 12—I found the prisoner there—Yorke said, "Hornsey's house has been broken into"—I did not then know it—he produced a coat and said, "From the manner in which the lining of this coat is cut," pointing to a coat in the prisoner's hand, "I have suspicions that it is one of Mr. Hornsey's"—I then left the prisoner in charge of another constable, and proceeded to Mr. Hornsey's shop, and brought him there—he said that it was his coats; he knew it from the shape and make, and said he would show me the mark—he turned it over to show me the place where it was, and the piece of lining was cut out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I took the prisoner to Old-street police-station—the inspector told me to take him to Moor-lane—after he had been taken to Old-street a woman came up and attempted to rescue him—we took her in charge—the prisoner was very violent—he gave his address, 12, Pound-court—I could hear nothing of him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Hoare, pawnbroker, of 150, Old-street—I remember the prisoner coming to me with this coat to pawn on 12th June, about a quarter past 12 in the forenoon—it attracted my attention by the piece being cut out of the sleeve—that is a very unusual thing—I never saw such a thing before—I took it indoors to the foreman and mentioned it to him—I then sent for a constable, to whom I handed it—he left the prisoner in charge of another constable; took the coat down to Mr. Hornsey, and came back with Mr. Hornsey, who identified it—while the constable was gone to Mr. Hornsey's, I asked the prisoner if the coat was his, and he said yes, he had had it for six months.</p>

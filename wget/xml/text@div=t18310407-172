I know the prisoner well, he has never been a pauper in our workhouse, but has been relieved by me repeatedly - it is customary for the overseers to leave in my hands a sum of 10l. to distribute to paupers, according to the orders I receive - the accounts are balanced every week, and the 10l. is left in my hands; the orders are signed by the overseers, and presented to my by the bearers for relief - there are three overseers; Mr. Tickner is one, and acted as such. On the evening of the 26th of March I was absent from the workhouse - Mr. Carvill, the assistant overseer, attended during my absence, in consequence of an arrangement between us - I left the workhouse that day about six o'clock, and know nothing of this occurrence myself - I left from 5l. to 10l. in Mr. Carvill's hands to meet these orders.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing the signature to this order to be genuine, should you have paid it if presented to you? A. Yes, most decidedly - I had relieved the prisoner by order of Mr. Tickner a score times, I may say, before.</p>

            . On Saturday evening, the 26th of March, I was in St. Bride's workhouse; the out door bell rang about eight or half-past eight o'clock - I answered it; when I got to the gate I saw a man standing there in white trousers, and another man stood behind the gate - the man in white trousers told me to take in the note; I think I should know the note again if I saw it - I can read, but not write; I know this to be the paper (looking at it) - I know it by this mark here (pointing to the top of the letter T, and a flourish under the name) - I took the paper in to Mr. Carvill, the assistant overseer, and gave it to him - I left the two men at the gate; in consequence of what passed between me and Mr. Carvill he went to the gate, but before that I returned to the two men, and the man in white trousers spoke to me - I am sure he was the same man as I had received the order from: he asked if I had got the money - I told him I had not got the money, but Mr. Carvill would be there directly; he wanted me to let him in at the gate - I told him I would not: it was my duty to keep all people out - by this time Mr. Carvill came up, and asked the two men what they wanted; the man in white trousers said he wanted relief - Mr. Carvill told him he could not have relief without an order, and asked him his name - he said John Green; I did not know him before, but the prisoner is the man who gave me the order, I am certain - I know him again, and I knew him before the Justice; he is the man who had on the white trousers, I am quite sure.</p>

            . I am assistant overseer of St. Bride's, On Saturday evening, the 26th of March, I was left by Mr. Mott with money to relieve the casual poor - I heard the bell ring between eight and half-past eight o'clock; it was the particular duty of

             to attend to the bell - shortly after it rang Jones brought me this paper; it is not usual to pay such orders as these without some previous inquiry - the overseers generally direct me to inquire into the circumstances if they give orders for 8s. or 10s., but they have power to give money without inquiry - no communication had been made to me on the subject of this order, and the amount excited my suspicion; I went to the gate, and found the prisoner there (who I myself did not then know), and another man - the prisoner was dressed in white trousers, and I think a blue jacket, a sort of sailor's dress; when I asked Jones who gave her the order, she pointed him out as the person, in his presence, and I asked his name - he said John Green; I cannot be mistaken in his person - I know he is the man: I may have known him as a casual pauper, but never relieved him myself - on his saying his name was Green I opened the gate, and told him he must go with me; Mr. Tickner lives in Bride-lane- the workhouse is in Fleet-street, directly opposite to the new avenue at St. Bride's church; I took the prisoner down Fleet-street, towards Bride-lane, in a direction for Mr. Tickner's; I did not tell him where I was going to take him, or for what purpose, and when we got nearly opposite the crossing to Bride-lane, he asked where he was going to, and before I had time to answer he followed it up by saying he should not go to Mr. Tickner's, it was of no use to go there for he would not give him any thing - that immediately strengthened my suspicion, and I said, "Very well then, you must go with me;" I then turned round Black Horse court, where the parish watchouse is situated; that is in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070086"></xptr>a different direction from Bride-lane - as I turned the corner of Black House-court he attempted to resist and to escape; I was obliged to take an additionel hold of him, and forced him down the court; he still resisted - I was obliged to produce a staff, had insisted on his going with me; I looked round when he attempted to escape and then saw the other man was close by, for the first time - I am sure it was the same man; on producing my staff the other man ran away - I took the down Black Horse-court, and he attempted to resist again, but I compelled him to go to the watch-house with me - he used very powerful endeavours, to escape; I had the paper in my possession, and have kept it ever since - this is it; the initials E. T. are on it - they were not on it when I received it; I saw Mr. Tickner do that at the Justice room, where I produced it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever paid any order of that description? A. I very frequently pay orders of precisely the same description signed by the overseer, in that forme we pay upon the signature of one overseer.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever pay the prisoner any money? A. No - it did not strike me as a forgery at the time; I thought the amount was wrong, but on his refusing to go to Mr. Tickner, I thought it must be a forgery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would this paper, written as it is, and spelt as it is have imposed on you? A. I really did not read it particularly as I saw the name of Tickuer - that was sufficient for me; I did not particularly read the writing, nor should I have done so; I did not notice the word bearns till now - the only singular thing in the order was its not having the name of the person to when it was to be paid; the orders do not always specify a name, but they should do so - I should have paid this order without looking further at it, if it had not been for 6s.; if it had been for 1s. I should have paid it instantly, but not 6s. without inquiry, the amount being unusally large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that order payable without previous inquiry? A. It is payable, and if Mr. Mott had received it he must have paid it, but, I being assistant overseer, knew there had been no previous meury; I am in the habit of receiving a communication from the overseers before an order for that amount is issued; I should not refuse payment in consequence of not having that order, but it being the practice of the overseers to direct an inquiry before they give relief to that amount, and not having been so directed, caused my suspicion - I am in the habit of receiving a communication where more ham 2s. or 3s. are to be paid.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the overseers authority to order that amount? A. Yes - my suspicion was excited by the time of night at which it was given; I considered something particular must have occurred, for an order for 6s. at that time - had it been on a Thursday I should not have questioned it; there is no customary form for these orders - they are written on paper; I never recollect seeing the word overseer added to the signature - either of the overpeers sign orders; they are generally written on such small pieces of paper as this - I am well acquainted with Mr. Tickner's hand-writing, but it did not strike me that it was not his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Mr. Tickner has no right to draw on Mr. Mott, except in his character of overseer? A. No.</p>

            ; ESQ. I was overseer of St. Bride's at the these in question, and am a Common Councilman. I knew the prisoner very well previous to the 25th of March- I very frequently gave him orders for relief; I recollect that I gave him an order on the 14th of March - (looking at the order) this is not signed by me, nor by my authority; I never saw it till it was produced before the Justice.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you been in the habit of signing similar papers to this for relief? A. Tickets a bout the same size - they are more vouchers for payments to paupers, given at the moment on any paper that is at hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence stating, that he had applied for relief to a Mr. Hobbs on Saturday evening, and was referred to Mr. Carvill at the workhouse, where he went, but could not get in at the gate in Shoe-lane - that he met a man at the gate, and asked if he had an order; he said he had one from Mr. Tickner, that they both went round to the Fleet-street entrance, when the man gave the girl the order in question, and on her return asked if she had brought the money - she replied No, that Mr. Carvill would come and speak to him; Mr. Carvill came, asked the man some question, and desired him to go along - that the man ran away, and the prisoner went with Mr. Carvill to the watch-house, it concluded by solemily declaring he had not presented the order, and knew nothing of the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday night, before I was taken into the watch-house, I told Mr. Carvill if he would give me the prisoners, or let me be remanded for a day or two, I would bring forward the man who brought the order; he said, "No, I have got the girl who will swear you are the man; I said I could bring the man forward, but they would not allow me, nor to name where he did live - I am willing to write, to prove I am innocent; I never was guilty of any thing, nor in prison before, but for fourteen days, and that was for begging - I had three witnesses to character, but they are not aware that I was to be brought up to-night.</p>
               <p>The Jury, upon comparing the forged instrument with the record, appeared to doubt whether it was accurately set out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. If the Jury are not satisfied that is a fast simile, we are very happy to receive the suggestion, and retire from the prosecution.</p>

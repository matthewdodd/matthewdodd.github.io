                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Massey, and live at James-street, Oxford-street On the 4th of November, I hung out a gown on a line by the room door—I saw it safe at twenty minutes past eight o'clock, and missed it at the half-past—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

               <p>About twenty minutes to ten o'clock, on the 4th of November, I was called to search the prisoner—she was brought in on another charge—I found this white gown on her, underneath her own gown—she undressed herself—I gave her petticoat—she said "No, I will have the gown next"—I said "I never heard of such a thing"—I found it was wet, and said it was not hers, she had taken it off some person's line—she said she had washed it, and thought it a very good place to put it on to dry—I delivered the gown to Johnson, to find the owner—she was wearing it round her, under her petticoat, not on her shoulders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had the gown outside; it was not so wet as she says; I bought it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It was quite wet, or I should not have noticed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Burge. I saw the two cart-loads of bricks at Elston's, in the Old Bailey—they were Mr. Burge's carts and horses, and bricks—I saw Dunkley at Elston's, and asked him why he came there; if he had any dirctions to come there—he said, "No"—I asked where he was directed to go—he said, "To the rail-road"—I asked him why he came there, and by whose authority?—he said, "By Lovett's authority."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in the Old Bailey. On the 12th of February I was called out into my premises by hearing a very great noise on the railway of my premises—I went out, and a cart drove by—Dunkley's was the furthest in the premises—another cart was behind it, driven by Brown—I called to the men to stop, but they did not stop—the horses being spirited, began to prance about—I called to my man to stop the first team—I called to Dunkley to come to me, but he did not—I told my man to bring him to me, which he did—I saw he was in liquor—I asked him what he had in his cart—he said, "Bricks," which he had brought there by direction of Charles Lovett—I said it was no answer to me where he had brought them from—he said, that was nothing to me—I looked at the cart—Burge's name was on both carts—I went into my counting-house—having suspicions from a transaction which took place with Lovett the morning before, I sent my clerk to Mr. Burge, who brought Limpus—I asked Brown also where he brought the bricks from—he was in liquor also, and gave me no answer—I asked Dunkley again where he brought them from—he then knew I had sent for Mr. Burge, and said he had brought them from Mr. Burge's fields—I asked him for the tickets—he said he had no tickets—I asked about his bringing them from Lovett—he said, as well as Lovett telling him to bring them to my premises, that Burge's kilnman had told him to bring them—I then asked Brown who told him to bring the bricks—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Lovett"—I told him to back his team dut into the street, and directly he got out he was attempt<lb></lb>ing to go on with his horses—I directed my man to put a scotch to the wheels, to prevent the cart going on—I went into my counting-house, and told my man to stop Dunkley, which was done, and he was given into cus<lb></lb>tody—Brown left the cart in the street, and went away, while I was in the counting-house.</p>

Q.</hi> They were both in liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I would not have the bricks, and they were going away with them—I stopped them—when Burge's clerk came, my carman drove Brown's team away by the di<lb></lb>rection of Burge's clerk—I am at times in the habit of paying for bricks on delivery—I have bought bricks of Burge—I did not pay for them on delivery—I have bought bricks of Lovett, and always paid for them on de<lb></lb>livery—I always had bills of them—I had ordered no bricks from Burge<lb></lb>nor Lovett—Lovett has sent bricks to me without orders.</p>

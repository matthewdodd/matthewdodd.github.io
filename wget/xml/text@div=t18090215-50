            . Q. What do you know of this - A. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in your custody a box belonging to Barrs - A. Yes, it was in the one pair of stairs; the prisoner lodged in the one pair of stairs, there are two rooms on a floor; whether the box was in the first room I do not know; you go into one room to get in the other where he lodged. I missed the property on the 5th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Barrs abroad at that time - A. Yes. On the 5th of January, the maid went up stairs to clean the room, she found the box that was under Barrs' broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the property gone out of Barrs' box - A. Yes; there were some things left, paper and other things; every thing of any value was gone. The prisoner quitted my house immediately; he was in the room when the box was discovered to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner leave your house - A. On the 5th of January; on the morning the box was discovered to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your house, did you discover whether Barrs' box was broken open or not - A. No; it was on the next day, or in two days after I discovered it; Barrs' box was corded; I found it out by it being light; I undid the cord, and found that all the things were gone. Barr's box had been uncorded and corded up again. I suspected the prisoner, and as soon as Barrs came from abroad, I sent for a constable and apprehended him; he was searched at the watchhouse, and duplicates were found on him at the office. Barrs said the stockings that he had got on were his.</p>

            . I am constable of St. George's, Hanover square. I searched the prisoner on the 10th of this month, at the watchhouse; I found nine duplicates in his breeches pocket. When he was at the office, a pair of stockings were taken off his legs; the prosecutor has them. I found a shirt at Mr. Lichfield's, the pawnbroker, he has given it up; he could not swear to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. LYONS. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 33, Chandler's street. I received a shirt on the 26th of December; to the best of my recollection, I think it was the prisoner.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—early in January, I recollect finding a bad shilling in my till—I had gone out that morning, about 10 o'clock just previous to going out I had examined the till, and looked through all the money—there was no bad money there—I returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and in consequence of what my wife told me, I went to the till and found the bad shilling; it was a very greasy looking one, and rather dark—I bent it, and afterwards gave it to the constable <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> 269.</p>

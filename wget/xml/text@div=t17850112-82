I shewed them to Mr. Allen, and he said he thought they were counterfeits, and I stopped her; Mrs. Flint desired the woman to be detained.</p>
               <p>What made you think them counterfeits? - I knew them to be counterfeits by scraping the edges of one of them, and they were all of the same coin.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman afterwards? - The woman remained in the shop while Mrs. Flint sent for a constable; the constable did not take charge of the woman, I cannot say why.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120097"></xptr>Did he refuse to take charge? - The woman was searched in my presence, I went with her and the constable up stairs, and when she was searched in the counting house, they found no bad money upon her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You take a great deal of silver, I have no doubt, Sir? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You suspected this to be bad, because, as you tell us, the heads were all the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the course of a day you take a deal of bad money? - We do. (The money produced.) It has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to swear that was the same money the woman gave to you? - So far as this, I am confident she paid me three shillings the first payment, our family were at dinner, and Mrs. Flint always takes the money out of the till when she goes to dinner, there was only one shilling in the till, and I put that three shillings to it, and I went to the other side to serve her with the other things, and when I took the other six shillings, one being in the drawer before, I would not be positive which of those three it was that was good; but she might give me one good one among the first three; the other six were never mixed with any other money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say you take a great deal of money in the course of a day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the same? - I am able to say they were not changed.</p>

             some time before I saw this money; Mr. Pincham shewed it me, it was what I supposed to be bad; a silversmith was sent for, that examined the money in the presence of the prisoner, that was after she came to the shop, and bought these articles which Mr. Pincham has mentioned, and the money he shewed to me, I said I thought it was bad; it being so very well managed in the finishing part to appear as a good shilling, that Mrs. Flint thought it proper to send for a silversmith.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Vernon, I have seen all these shillings before, and I decided by day-light that they were bad, I can swear to them now.</p>
               <p>You are sufficiently acquainted with money? - I am perfectly clear that they are counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You said you had seen them by day-light, and you then decided they were all counterfeit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, if these had been given to you as change for money at the play-house, would you have taken them? - Certainly, I have taken much worse.</p>
               <p>And you are very conversant on the subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>However you have taken much worse? - Certainly I have.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. From what circumstance are we to infer that this woman knew these to be counterfeits?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I will save Mr. Silvester the trouble by saying a word or two in a case that certainly does not require a word; for in order to convict the prisoner you must be satisfied of this, that she, perfectly well knowing that these shillings were bad coin, and with a view to impose that shilling to the witness as a good one, she did offer it to him in payment: Gentlemen, you have heard from every body, and even from that young gentleman, whose judgment I did not think fit to trust to, and whom I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120098"></xptr> chuse to trouble with an answer; and I am sure that before the next Sessions, if this woman is convicted on such evidence, I shall not have the honour of attending this Court, for I am very free to acknowledge that this very morning to a hackney-coachman who brought me hither, I tendered some shillings in payment much worse than these, and I trust the Court will believe me, when I say I so tendered them without knowing they were bad: Gentlemen, I need not inform you, for his Lordship will do it much better, that it is not from the accidental circumstance of a man's uttering two or three bad shillings in payment, or even from his having two or three more about him, that you are to infer he is an utterer of bad money, knowing it to be bad: Gentlemen, the punishment in this case if the prisoner is convicted, is, that she shall lay in gaol for a year, and I am confident that there are none of us who have attended here, and who know the situation of that gaol of Newgate, who know the miserable situation of the wretches that are confined there, thatwill feel any sentiment but compassion, for anybody who has lain in a gaol only one night; and I am perfectly satisfied that you will not, you cannot, I am perfectly satisfied, that you dare not commit that poor woman, and that unfortunate infant, to have its education in the gaol of Newgate, on evidence on which every one of you, every man who now hears me, might long since have been committed to Newgate: Gentlemens in your hand, I leave the poor prisoner, perfectly well satisfied that your verdict will be an instant acquittal; I will not insult you in calling any evidence, I will leave her in perfect security in your hands, and not say one word more to procure the acquital of a person, who certainly ought not upon such evidence to have been brought here at all.</p>

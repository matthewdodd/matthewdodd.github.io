The prisoner was in their employment - in consequence of suspicion, I went and searched his lodging, on the 19th of September, in Union-court, Westminster - he came home from his dinner, at his usual time; I found property there, which I could not speak to - two officers who were with me, searched him, and found several iron nuts and bolts, in each of his pockets, and watch fob, and a paper of nails in his hat, and inside his waistcoat, we found a bar of iron - I cannot say any of it belonged to my master; we had such things on the premises, and had repeatedly missed them - he begged my pardon, and asked forgiveness; I said I had no power.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One Nunn owed me some money I wanted a pair of bedstead screws - he said he would make them for me, if he had tools, his wife brought me nails, for the sacking of the bedstead. On the 17th of September, I went again, he could not not make the screws, but gave me scraps of iron, to do them myself, as he had no tools, and asked me to lop some nails for him - I took them to Mr. Adams in the morning, to make them, but did not take them out of my pocket, as I thought he would not like it. After breakfast I put them all in my hat, and took them home at dinner time.</p>

            . I am a smith and farrier, and live in New Millman-street. Sheen came to me the begining of August. I owed him a little money, and told him I could not pay it; he asked me to make some bedstead screws - I gave him a loose paper of nails, and some small pins for the sacking. About the middle of September, he came and asked if I had made the screws, I said I had been busy, and had no opportunity, and gave him a square piece of iron about a foot long, to make them with, he looked round the shop, and saw six or seven bolts, and about three dozen nuts, and said he thought he could bring nuts for the screws, as he did not work late of an evening, and he thought he could make them near his own home - I said, "What nuts you have to spare, if you will tap them, I will be obliged to you" - he was to tap them with a coarser thread than I had got. The nails produced are very much like what he had of me - I did not give him the brace.</p>

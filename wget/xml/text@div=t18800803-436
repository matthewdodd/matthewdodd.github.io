                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 26, Vere Street, Clare Market—on 26 July I came down and found the private door unbolted, and also a door leading from the bar to the passage—when I opened the house I saw a constable—I examined the premises with him and missed about 500 cigars, the boxes were all empty; also two pounds tobacco, a coat and</p>

I am manager of Wood's Chambers, a lodging-house in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—on 31st July, a little after 5 a.m., Kirby came in with a pint bottle of brandy and asked me to have a little drop, which I did—he took off his coat and then another, a black one, and asked for a sheet of paper, which I gave him, and he made a parcel of the under coat and put something into the coat—I had seen him at the table taking some cigars out of the pockets of the different coats, and he made a parcel of them—he went out and asked me to call George Leath, and while he was gone I found these two cigar boxes and a screw-driver where he had been sitting—he came back at 7 o'clock, went up stairs and came down with Leath, who had been staying there for six weeks—Kirby was not sleeping there, we had turned him out—they went out together, and Kirby gave the parcel into my charge; I locked it up in my private cupboard, and from information I received I went to the White Lion and Mr. Wright sent two detectives—the articles were taken to the station, and Mr. Wright identified them—Leath came between 10 and 11 a.m., and asked for the parcel Kirby had left—I did not agree at once, but at last I gave it to him and he said "Will you allow me to leave the coat behind"—I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>, you must take them all away off the premises"—he said "I am very sorry I have had anything to do with him; he caused me to lose 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at bagatelle last sight; and when I get rid of this parcel I shall drop his acquaintance, if I don't I shall perhaps get into 'trouble"—he left with the parcel—I afterwards went to the station and identified the coat—I have no doubt it was the one Kirby gave into my charge.</p>

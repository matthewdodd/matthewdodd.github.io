                  </hi>. I am a shopman in the employ of Samuel Lewis, draper, of Holborn Bars—on the afternoon of 2nd December the prisoners came there—in consequence of what the manager, Mr. Phillips, said, I watched them—I saw Should take a piece of silk, roll it up, take it off the counter and put it underneath her shawl or cloak, and Lee took up another piece of silk open so as to hide what Should was doing—the manager, who was watching with me, went down to them; they were sitting at the counter—I had been watching them from the warehouse on the first floor—we have some glass counters there which we can look through and see all that is going on down below in the shop—we were directly above them—I could see everything quite plain—a young man named Jones was serving them—when Mr. Phillips went down and spoke to the prisoners they both rose up from their chairs, and this piece of silk dropped down at Should's feet—Mr. Phillips picked it up—there is 49 yards of it—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a con<lb></lb>stable was sent for, and the prisoners were given into custody.</p>

Should had been there the week before, and she called on this day to pay some money, the balance of some goods which she had bought previously—I heard Mr. Jones ask them to go into the warehouse—they rose up at once—I think I was watching them rather more than five minutes—there were at least a dozen customers' in the shop, and about four or five assistants—it was shortly after 4 o'clock—the gas was alight—it is not a very large shop—we keep about forty hands.</p>

I am manager to Mr. Lewis—On 2nd December, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was up stairs in the warehouse—in con<lb></lb>sequence of seeing the prisoners I gave instructions to Mason, and with him I watched them from the first-floor—I was about three yards from them—looking straight down I had a complete view of them—Jones was serving them—there were several pieces of silk opened on the counter before them—Jones went away for a minute—during his absence this piece of silk was upon the counter under others—Should rose it up and placed it on her elbow, she placed her arm in that way, and Lee placed a piece of silk so as to shield what she was doing—Should placed the silk under her waterproof cloak and concealed it—on seeing that I went down stairs, removed all the</p>

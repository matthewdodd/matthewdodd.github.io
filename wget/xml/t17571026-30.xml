She locked her door in the morning on the 5th of August, went out and returned about six in the evening; when she unlocked her door the prisoner started out of her room upon her and cried, hush hush, then pulled her gown out of his pocket and flung it on her bed. She endeavoured to run down stairs, but he clapt his hand upon her shoulder and said, d - n you hush, and put his hand to his breeches pocket; which so affrighted her that she thought he was going to cut her throat. She said, for Christ's sake don't murder me. Then he was going to salute her, and she said, pray Sir go along, what business have you in my room? Then he ran down stairs, and she cried out stop thief! He was taken in another house about three doors from her, with the smoothing iron in his hand, and pull'd out a parcel of false keys from his pocket. [Thirteen keys produced in court] She took one of them in her hand and said, this hath been tried, and will unlock my door.</p>

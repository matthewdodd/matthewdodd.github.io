                  </hi>. I am a watch-case maker in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner was occasionally employed in my business—on Friday, the 2nd of December, I saw him sitting at his work a few mi<lb></lb>nutes after two o'clock, and, in consequence of what another man said to me, I said to the prisoner, "How is it that you charged one case more than you did last week?"—he said, "It was a mistake"—I said, "I am afraid it is not the only mistake you have made"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "You know very well what I mean"—he immediately slipped</p>

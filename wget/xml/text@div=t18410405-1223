                  </hi>. I am in the service of John and Benjamin Matthew, pawnbrokers, in Liquorpond-street. In the afternoon of the 5th of April, the prisoner Read came to our shop and pawned an apron—about an hour afterwards a policeman came and produced a linen shirt and a flannel shirt, the property of my employers, which I had seen banging up in the shop close by where Read stood, about a minute before she came in—she came alone—I did not miss them till the policeman pro<lb></lb>duced them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Read.</hi> I found them on Eyre Street-hill, and there is mud on the shirt, where I trod on it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not observe any mud on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable Q</hi> 23.) I took the pri<lb></lb>soners into custody—in the station they were both sitting together, shuffling about, and during the time I took Read to be searched by a fe<lb></lb>male, one of them, I cannot say which, put this linen shirt on the table—if I have said it was Melon, I cannot <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to it—there was no one there but the prisoners to put it there—the sergeant on duty asked Melon if it was her property—she said no, she knew nothing about it—I was ordered to take Read to the cell to be searched by a female—on coming back I found this flannel-shirt under the seat on which they were sitting, which put it there, I cannot say—when the sergeant asked Melon if the linen shirt was hers, she said it was not, it was Read's—Read said it was hers—the sergeant asked whether it was marked—Melon said it was her sister's husband's shirt, and Read said it was hers—Read said it was not marked—Melon said it was marked G. B.—the searcher is not here—it was the flannel-shirt that Melon said she knew nothing about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Watt, a pawnbroker, in Ex-mouth-street. In the afternoon of the 5th of April the prisoners came to our shop in company together—Melon offered this linen shirt in pledge, but would not take what I offered on it—I observed a flannel under her arm, rolled up, which I believe was a flannel shirt—I did not look at the linen shirt enough to identify it again.</p>

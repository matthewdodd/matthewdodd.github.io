               <p>On the 13th of August, about eight in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a pennyworth of tobacco. I served him. He gave me a shilling to change. I gave him sixpence in part, out of a box in which I kept the silver. I then went round to an adjoining room, to strike a light. Turning suddenly round, I saw the prisoner leaning over the counter. He ran out of the shop directly; and I saw him go into a publick-house opposite. I missed the box: there might be 20 s. in it; but I can swear I put in 6 s. I went over to the public-house. The prisoner was gone. Soon after, I was informed that Carpmeal had taken him. He brought him into the shop. 14 s. 4 d. and a pair of new pumps, were found upon him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120057"></xptr> When he first came into the shop, he had a blue jacket on; when he was taken up, he had a brown great coat over that jacket. He afterwards escaped out of the cage, and was retaken. I had seen him before frequently, and knew him well. I had light enough to discern him. When he was taken, he denied having been in the shop at all.</p>

               <p>About eight o'clock, I stood at the corner of an alley, near Mr. Spence's, and saw the prisoner, in a blue jacket, come out of the shop, and put a little box into his bosom. He went into a public-house opposite, which has a back-door leading into another street.</p>

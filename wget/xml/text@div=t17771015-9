               <p>How old are you? - I shall be 10 years old a little before Christmas.</p>
               <p>You know you are to take an oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you been taught your Catechism? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there is a God who punishes wicked people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where do wicked people go to? - Hell.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is a wicked thing to take a false oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(He is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; my father sent me for some silk to Bow-lane, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>What quantity of silk was there? - Fifty bobbins; the silk was delivered to me by the foreman of the warehouse; I was bringing it back to my father; a young man came up to me, and said Mr. Collier, the foreman, had sent him after me for eight bobbins.</p>
               <p>What young man was that? - The prisoner Parkinson; I told him to come to my house with me, and my daddy would weigh them for him; he said he must have them directly to Mr. Collier to be weighed, and he took the basket out of my hand; he took eight bobbins out, and put them in his apron, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose at first that Collier had sent him? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you imagine? - I bid him come to our house, because I meant my daddy to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Did he take the basket by force from you, or did you let him take it? - I did not let him, he took it by force, and took eight bobbins.</p>
               <p>What do you know of Anderton? - He stood on the opposite side of the way when the other asked for them, and when he had got the bobbins they both laughed, and Anderton crossed over the way to him; I saw no more of them; I knew Parkinson before by sight, I did not know the other.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Nine in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was it in the street? - Yes, in Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Were there any persons in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you try to have them stopped? - Yes; but they soon got away.</p>

               <p>Whether Parkinson said any thing? - Yes; he said Anderton had half the money; that they sold the silk for 14 d. an ounce.</p>

               <p>Did you see any conversation before he took it? - No.</p>
               <p>There was no time for conversation? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you run after him? - No; I knew him twelve or thirteen years before; I saw Anderton on the opposite side of the way; he ran after him.</p>
               <p>Did he seem to take the basket violently, or did the boy seem to give it to him? - He took the silk out of the basket.</p>
               <p>Whether you think he took it by force? - The boy seemed unwilling that he should have it.</p>

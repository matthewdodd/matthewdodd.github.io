               <p>April, I was called at 4.6 p.m., and searched Mr. Pardoe'e house, about six or eight minutes after that—I found a great many strangers in the house endeavouring to extinguish the fire, which was burning in the first-floor front room—the bed and bedding were well alight—after that was put out our attention was called to another fire in the first-floor front room—there was no communication with the other fire—it did not appear to be accidental—it was in the bed and bedstead—it was nearly out, some buckets of water had been put upon it, and then there were only a few sparks left—the flooring under the bed was nearly burnt through—it appeared as if the fire had originated in a bucket containing some clay pipes, the bottom of which only remained—I noticed on the ground floor that a piece of flooring, about 2ft from the fire-place, was burnt through—there had been a fire in the grate—the sideboard or dresser was slightly scorched—I do not think it possible that a coal or cinder could have six fire to the places I saw, because the fire appeared to be very low and to have burnt out—the fire down stairs could not have set fire to the place up stairs—the prisoner came there about 6 o'clock, and Miss Pardoe said to him in my presence, "O, Henry, you villain, you have done this"—he said "That's right, blame me; say I have done it, but it has to be proved yet."</p>

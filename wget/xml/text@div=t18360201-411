                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in Wormwood-street, Bishops<lb></lb>gate. Dullam was my apprentice, and Rolfe, a journeyman—I missed a great quantity of lead at different times, and on the 1st of January I missed a roll of pipe-lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of January, before five in the evening, I was desired to watch, and saw Rolfe go out at the shop door—I could not see what he was carrying, but Dullam was at the door when he went out—he had opened the door to let Rolfe out—he waited at the door a little time, he then came in and shut it after him—I could not see whether Rolfe was carrying any thing, as I could only see his back, and there was a noise, and I came up a few stairs which pre<lb></lb>sented my seeing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was on the watch, about five o'clock, in front of the house, and saw Rolfe partly pass the shop—the light which shone from the next shop, which is a broker's, shone on him—I saw the pipe on his shoulder, and followed him through various courts and places into St. Mary Axe—he went into a house about three doors up on the left hand side—there was a light in the house—he appeared to go down into the cellar, and he came out afterwards without the pipe—I have never recovered the pipe.</p>

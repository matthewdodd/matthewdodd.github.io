These shoes hung on some nails in the shop; the prisoner came in last Wednesday, about half-past seven o'clock - my father had known him about three years ago; he asked if my father was at home - I told him he was not: he said I could do as well - he wanted three or four pairs of shoes for a person at Finchley; he gave me the measure: I looked them out, and while I was making out the bill, he sat down in the shop, where the shoes were, within his reach - I made out the bill; he said he was going to the haberdasher's, and would return in about a quarter of an hour; he left - I looked, and missed a pair of women's shoes: I went after him - he was not above twenty or thirty yards off; I asked him where he was going to - he said to the haberdasher's; I said "I think you have got a pair of shoes;" he shook his pockets, and said, "No, I have not, upon my honour"- I felt, and found a pair in his pocket; I took him back, and sent for a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Rathbone-place, Marylebone. On the 10th of March, the prisoner, who is a policeman, came to my house—I missed a razor off the mantel-shelf when he was there—I took no notice of it till the 16th of June, when he was there, and I missed another—I went with the officer to his house—he offered to show me all his razors, and the second razor that he produced from his box was</p>

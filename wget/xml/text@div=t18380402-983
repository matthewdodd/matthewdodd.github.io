                  </hi>. I am the daughter of George Harding, and live with him. On Thursday evening, the 2nd of March, I left the parlour at a quarter past six o'clock—on returning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, I found half the blind open, and the articles in question stolen from the op<lb></lb>posite side of the room—I found a decanter taken out of the cupboard, and placed on a chair; a tea-caddy, a glass sugar-basin, and five books, were taken from the sideboard on the other side of the room—the decanter was left</p>

                  </hi>, (a prisoner.) On the evening of the robbery Stone and Paine asked me whether I would go with them—I went with them to Helmet-row, and stood about there a long time—then Paine and Stone went up to the prosecutor's window—I was a little distance from them—they came, and said, "Now then, come along, it is all right"—they told me to get in at the window—I asked them what I was to give them when I got in—they said "Any thing"—I put my foot on a bar by the side of the house, and got in at the window, and gave them out the tea-caddy and some books—the window was open, the sash <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up, the blind was open—I gave them out a tea-caddy and some books—Payne took them—there was a decanter I had in my hand, but I heard somebody coming, and put it down, got out of the window, and ran away with the stopper in my hand—I met Paine a little way from the place, and we went to Stone's house, and the property was there on the table—I stopped there some time, and then went home—I went there again at eight o'clock the next morning, and in about half an hour a boy named Cox came, and he was going to the pawnbrokers, and they asked him to pledge the books—he took them, came back, and said they would not take them—Paine and Stone were both in the room at the time Cox went away—he brought them back the prisoner bill and another young woman came in soon after, and then Mrs. Stone came in out of the country—we had not been there long before the officers came and took us into custody—I do not know that Hill did any thing—she was in the room—when the officers came Paine and Stone were gone out—they were in the room when Hill came, and she asked Stone if his mother was come home, as he expected her—Hill sells fish in Whitecross-street—the books were not there then—I do not know what had become of them—the tea-caddy was there—Mrs. Stone came in, and Paine and Stone went out to get some shavings for a dog to lie on, and the policeman came and took me and Hill.</p>

In consequence of information on the 3rd of last month, I went to No. 12, Graham's Buildings, Twister's alley, St. Luke's, to a front room—I saw Hill, Lawrence, and another female—Hill and another fe<lb></lb>male were sitting on a bed—a young man sitting between them endeavoured, as I thought, to conceal something underneath the bed clothes—I proceeded to search towards the bed—the prisoner, Hill, said, "That is Mrs. D.

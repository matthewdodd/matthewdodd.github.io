               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Long-acre; the prisoner brought two pair of silver studs to sell to me, on Tuesday, the 5th of February, about five or six in the evening; I asked him how he came by them, he said, he bought them of Mr. Pratt, the Silversmith in Cheapside; he said, he worked for him as a carpenter; I bought them of him for 2 s. which was a fair price for them; he came again on Thursday, and brought three pair more, that gave me a suspicion that he had stole them, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>(The studs were produced by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Perkins. Two pair of the studs are plain; I cannot swear to them; the other pair are not, and are my own manufacture; I can swear to them; I never saw any marked in the same manner those are, except these; there were six dozen plain and marked, in a paper under the counter; I lost the whole of them; the prisoner was at work for me on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270015"></xptr>Monday the 4th, and Tuesday the 5th of February.</p>

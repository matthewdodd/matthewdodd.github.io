About half-past four o'clock, on the 30th of November, I locked the shop door, went down into the kitchen, and in five minutes I heard the shop door bell ring; I went up in a few minutes, and saw the prisoner coming out of the shop door, which was then open - I asked if she had been into the shop; she said No - I said I was sure I had locked the shop door, and she must have broken it open; she said she wanted some linen rags, and they must be very clean, as they were for a particular purpose - I said I had none, and while I was speaking to her, I saw the gown under her feet; she was going, but I said I would not let her go yet, and pushed her back into the shop; I saw the gown under her feet - it had been on a shelf in the window when I went down stairs; I had to unlock the shop door before I could lock it again, but how she opened it I cannot say - some force must have been used.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know very well, I only just touched the door, and the bell rang, Witness. Yes, the bell rang with the door being opened; she was going from the passage - she had one foot in the street, and one on the threshold; I made her stop - I took her back; I said I had met with a very heavy loss at my door, and for her impudence I would follow her as far as the law would allow; I said I had lost some silver spoons - she swore a great many oaths; I said I would make her pay for all -I called a man out of the kitchen, who went for a Policeman; she did not attempt to go away - I was on one side of the counter, and she on the other; I cannot say who was nearest the window; she was not three yards from the gown when I took it up - the whole place is not three yards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure you saw the gown upon her arm before you brought her into the shop? A. I saw a piece of it under her arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If you saw it why did you say you would have me searched? A. I did not say so at the shop - I said at the watch-house, "I dare say she may have the duplicate of the other things I have lost."</p>

I certainly went into the shop to ask for white linen rags; I turned the handle of the door, and the bell rang - I waited a moment, and Mrs. Bowles came up and asked what I wanted; she said she had none- I was turning out at the door, when she said, "Come back, woman - I was robbed a fortnight ago, and perhaps you are the same party;" I staid very quietly while the man was gone for the officer, and she went round into the parlour - she stooped, and picked up the gown the length of the counter from me; she said, "Here is a gown which was in the window, and which you must have had."</p>

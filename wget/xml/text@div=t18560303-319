                  </hi>. I am assistant to a tobacconist, in Oxford-street. On 13th Feb. a small child came for half an ounce of tobacco—she gave me a bad sixpence—on the following evening the same child came again for the same article, and gave me another bad sixpence—I went round the counter and proceeded with the child to where she stated sfce resided, in Duke-street, Marylebone—on the way I met a constable, and we went to the station—from there we went to a house in Braying-ground passage—the prisoner came there, and the question was put to him, if the child was his own—he said, "Yes," and acknowledged having sent her with the sixpence for the tobacco—the constable told him it was bad, and searched him—I saw a packet taken from his pocket.</p>

I saw the last witness on 14th Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—he had a chiled with him—we went to the station house, and then to Burying-ground-passage—on going into a house I heard some one down stairs—I called out "Galvin," twice, but there was no answer—I went down, and met the prisoner coming out of the cellar—I told him to come into the kitchen, which he did—I told</p>

               <p>him that his daughter had said that she had been sent by her father for some tobacco, and that he had given her the sixpence—he said that it was his daughter, and he had sent her for the tobacco—I asked him what money he had about him—he gave me a good sixpence and some coppers—I asked him if that was all he had, he said, "Yes"—I searched him, and found in his waistcoat pocket five bad shillings and six sixpences, in two packages, and all enclosed in different papers between each coin, to keep them from chafing—I asked what he had been doing outside, he said, "Nothing"—I said that I should look in the cellar, and there I found four other shillings wrapped in paper, with a layer of paper between each—he said he had found the bad money in the dung hole—I found on him three half ounces of tobacco.</p>

                  </hi> These are all bad—four of the shillings are from one mould, the others are from two or three moulds—the sixpences are all bad, three of them are of 1833, and are from one mould—two of them are dated 1844, and are from the same mould as the one uttered.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; at six in the morning of the 21st of June, my house was broke open; I heard the prisoner come into my apartments, I am sure he is the man; my brother lodges in my house, and as he passed, he said, are you awake, I said, yes, and just after, I heard somebody up in the two pair of stairs room, I heard a chest opened; a person went after him and brought him back, the witness's name is Thomas M'Gee; I saw him drop the property from under his arm as he went past my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What property? - A. A coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of your house broke open? - A. No; the outer door was upon the latch; my brother is here, he shut it when he went out.</p>
               <p>JAMES COCKERFLL sworn. - I lodge in my sister's house; I went out about a quarter before six in the morning, as near as I can guess, I pulled the door after me, and left it upon the latch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming down Nightingale-lane, I turned down by a sence, where there was a public privy; I went down to it, and that man came up to me, and told me, I must go with him; I behaved with no violence; I told him, I was going to my daily labour, and being the only man that was there, that woman said, that is the fellow; I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

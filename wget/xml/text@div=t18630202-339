                  </hi>. I am a baker at 117, Houndsditch—the pri<lb></lb>soner has been in my employment from eighteen to twenty months—he was in the habit of delivering bread daily—it was his duty to take the bread from me, and accounting for it when he came back, and all the money he received it was his duty to pay to me—if it was convenient I used to take it when I first saw him; sometimes it would be inconvenient, and I used to let it be until 6 o'clock, or sometimes, if I was not in, I used to receive it the next morning, but that was seldom—I do not think I left it over the day, it would be very unusual—on 1st January the prisoner paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Riley, but not for bread delivered that day—Riley owed me for fourteen days, about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been taken off a previous de<lb></lb>livery—I only knew from the prisoner that Riley owed for bread—he told me Mr. Riley would pay when he received some money from the country—I had been in the habit of giving rather longer credit, and he did not pay—I did not receive from the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bread supplied on the 1st—I have received nothing in respect of Cohen's account, since 21st December, 1862—I have not received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in respect of bread supplied to Cohen on 5th January—I have a book showing the monies I received in respect of the deliveries of bread—the prisoner accounted for bread delivered, but I have not received any money.</p>

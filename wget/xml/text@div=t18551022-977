                  </hi>. I am the widow of Daniel Geary. The prisoner's wife was related to my husband—the prisoner lived at the bottom of the same street that our house is in—on Sunday night, 30th Sept., I and my husband and three children went to the prisoner's house about 6 o'clock, and stopped till 12 o'clock—I and my children then went home, and left my husband behind—he, and Patrick Geary, and the prisoner, were all sober—about 1 o'clock Patrick Geary came to me, and I went to the prisoner's house—I found my husband down stairs, lying in the landing; and all the blood was about him—I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner—I asked him what made him kill my husband—he told me to take him home, and he said he would stop with him till the next day, till Monday, and he said he would give the same slaughter to Patrick Geary—a doctor came to see my husband, and he was taken to the hospital—he died about 7 o'clock on Friday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at this christening party—I remember Mrs. Geary going away—nothing happened after that till 1 o'clock, and then Daniel Geary and ray brother Patrick Geary got up to go home—they were going to get up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with John Mahoney, and John Mahoney got up to give them a civil excuse to go down quietly—Daniel Geary went down two or three steps of the stairs, and my brother Patrick said, "Are you going like that?"and Daniel Geary came up into the room again, and said, "Now we shall have it out," and he caught hold of the prisoner by the shirt collar, and they had a struggle about the room, but no blows till they fell down on the other side of the floor, and the prisoner got away from him—the candle fell off the table, and went out—I went into the back room to take the baby to my aunt's arms—the prisoner got into the back room, and he hallooed "Murder!"out of the window three times—I was so frightened I thought they were all coming into the room—I got under the bedstead—that was all that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cousin of the deceased man. I was at this christening party—Mrs. Geary left about 12 o'clock—about 1 o'clock in the morning my cousin and Mahoney got up and struck one another, and Mahoney slipped into the next room, and got some weapon—I saw the weapon in his hand, and, to the best of my belief, it was a fender—Mahoney broke the upper part of the door, and he struck my cousin twice through the broken door—my cousin fell down with the blows on his head—I pulled him a little way from the door where he fell—we went away, and when we came back, he was down at the bottom of the stairs—we took him home, he was hallooing and saying he would not go home—one of the blows was given on his forehead, and the other on his head.</p>

Q.</hi> You and Daniel Geary went to Mahoney's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was there before my cousin came—I had lodged one week with my cousin—we had been drinking something—Daniel Geary struck the first blow—the prisoner went into the other room—I do not know whether he shut the door—the door was closed—I did not hear him shout out, "Police!" and "Murder!"—as soon as he went in the door was closed—the next thing I saw was, he broke the door, and struck my cousin twice—there was a little light in the room, in at the window—I was never inside the room with the prisoner.</p>

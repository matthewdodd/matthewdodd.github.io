                  </hi>. I am a wholesale milliner, of 64, Bartholomew-close—the prisoner has been in my employ from January—I took the business from him under a bill of sale, having advanced him money, and have carried it on from that time to this—I continued on, the prisoner in my service—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week regularly—his duty was the general management of the concern—it was part of his duty to collect orders and get in money, which he was to pay over to me immediately he received it—on 26th June I gave him instructions to go to Messrs. Vyse's and to Messrs. Morrison's to receive money—he accounted to me on that day for the money he received from Morrison, and I said "Where is Messrs. Vyse's money?"—he said, "The buyer was very busy taking down stock, and had not time to pass the account, and will leave it till next week"—he has never accounted to me for that sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on 10th July I dis<lb></lb>covered that it had been paid by Messrs. Vyse—I did not say anything to the prisoner about it, as I had discharged him before that, but not for that amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him first about twelve months ago, at 87, Queen-street—he was in business for himself at that place—the change in the management took place on 19th January—the first letter that passed about negotiating for the business was in August, 1862—some of the letters he wrote to me about it, are in my attorney's hands—we finally arrived at an agreement on 19th January, when I took the business under the bill, of sale, as the prisoner was unable to return me the money I had advanced him—I first had a bill of sale for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to secure to me the goods, chattels,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260004"></xptr>
               <p>and fixtures at 87, Queen-street, Cheapside, for twelve months—if that was repaid at the end of twelve months the goods and fixtures were to be released—that is dated 27th December, 1862—we entered into another one on 9th January, 1863—that was for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I advanced 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and the former was merged in that—that bill gave me the right, at twelve hours' notice of taking the goods if the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid; if it was paid the right would cease—on 27th December it was agreed between me and the prisoner that he should pay me 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I should act as his servant—I had sup<lb></lb>posed that he was in difficulties, and asked him the question, and he said he was—the second bill was given because I was not satisfied with the security of the first—a change took place in that agreement on 19th January—I gave the prisoner a written notice on 17th January that I required the repayment of the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within twelve hours—I knew nothing about judgments against the prisoner—I know that he was in Whitecross street; I visited him there—he did not give me any money there—I never sold any pony for him, and never saw one—his wife put about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my hands—when I first went to the premises in Cheapside, Farnham's name was on the doorposts, and also on a glass inside—that name did not con<lb></lb>tinue up until the prisoner was arrested—my name was put on the office door on 20th January—his plates were not removed from the door, they were covered over with my plates about a week afterwards—I gave instruc<lb></lb>tions to the prisoner to order the plates to be written—I first made a claim to the goods under the bill of sale, on 19th January—I entered into posses<lb></lb>sion then—a claim was afterwards made by a sheriffs officer under an execution against the prisoner; that was some time in February, I think—I had to try an interpleader issue in the Exchequer—I kept the goods—the hands who made up the goods were engaged by the prisoner by my instruc<lb></lb>tions—he knew the business, I did not—I ordered some of the goods and the prisoner others—I never told any person that the prisoner was my partner.</p>

Did you establish your claim to the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was examined as a witness on my behalf, and I heard him state that he was in my service as an assistant, at a salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, which was correct—it was not upon that that I established my claim to the goods; it was partly, of course—if he had said there was a partnership I should have lost my goods—the prisoner had no right to order goods on his own account—he had general instructions from me to buy what was necessary for the business—I was for many years in the grocery business—I had a little money to invest at the time, and unfortunately I invested it in this business—the first distinct account I have of paying the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Saturday, was on 14th March; I paid him every Saturday—previous to that time I had advanced him sums 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time—from 14th March till he ceased to be in my service, the wages were paid regularly—I have regular entries of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every Saturday—the bill produced is made out in my name—the prisoner did not carry bill heads about with him—this was made out at the warehouse—it is part of Messrs. Vyse's system to make out their own accounts—it is made out in my name, only without any "Co." and is receipted by the prisoner—that was the ordinary practice.</p>

I am a tailor, residing at Monkwell-street—in February of this year I applied at 87, Queen-street, Cheapside, for a situation—I saw Mr. Farnham and Mr. Hannam—Farnham said to me in Hannam's presence, that he would look at my references, and if he was satisfied I was to come on the following morning—I went there and continued in the employ about four or five months—I always thought the prisoner was a partner with Mr. Hannam—I supposed so by the way the business was carried on—sometimes Mr. Hannam kept the key of the premises, and sometimes Mr. Farnham—I have often known Mr. Hannam come late—to the premises when he had the key—I cannot say that I have heard the prisoner say anything to him upon those occasions—during the time I was there persons called to inquire for the prisoner—he was sometimes in and sometimes not—they have frequently made inquiries of Hannam, and he had said that Mr. Farnham was not there—I remember an officer calling there in February, he saw Mr. Hannam and inquired for the prisoner, and Hannam said he was not there—he just then came to the door—they removed from Queen-street, Cheapside, to Bartho<lb></lb>lomew-close—Hannam and Farnham carried on business there in the whole<lb></lb>sale millinery business—I left a week after they were in Bartholomew-close—Farnham acted there as he had done before—I went from Bartholomew-close to Wells-street—Farnham had the business there—Hannam used to come hack wards and forwards occasionally—the prisoner took some goods from Bartholomew-close to Wells-street when he moved—that was a week after I left Bartholomew-close—I left there before June—the goods were cloths and lengths of cloths, and several other things—there were two or three sewing-machines—I should say one would be worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and another about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was one piece of cloth of forty yards, another of twenty, and another, a shepherd's plaid, of about thirty or forty yards.</p>

Hannam" on the door, and I immediately asked Mr. Farnham about it—I don't think Hannam was there at the time we had some conversation about that—I called there several times and saw them in the shop—Farnham took the leading part in the business, and he attended to the orders, goods, and so on—on one occasion Farnham came into the back room when Hannam and I were there smoking—Farnham said, "Well, gentlemen, this is not business, smoking"—I have seen Farnham bring in sums of money and pay them over to Mr. Hannam several times—I recol<lb></lb>lect him bringing in Morrison's account, and I heard him also say that he had been to Vyse's—I heard nothing pass about Vyse's account, more than that he had been there, and I saw money on the desk, and a book—I don't know what money it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master wheeler in the Royal Arsenal carriage department, at Woolwich—the prisoner was employed there as a wheelwright since last Nov.—on 18th March, I found this metal plane secreted under the prisoner's work bench—it was suspended under the board which projects below the bench—the prisoner, the next day, was reported to Colonel Tulloch—thisplane was found on Thursday, and it was produced and shown to the prisoner, when he was taken before Colonel Tulloch, on the Monday morning—theprisoner acknowledged making it, but said it was for the use of the shop—I engaged the prisoner myself—I engage all the men, and the engage<lb></lb>ment is that they should find their own tools—they are not allowed to make tools out of Government property to work with—nothing was said to him about finding his own tools—it is not said directly to every man, but it is a standing rule in the place—a man cannot go to work till he brings his tools—theprisoner was told to come to work—I cannot swear that he was told to bring his tools—it is the practice of the wheelers when they come to work to bring their tools—the prisoner brought his tools with him—he had no right to use the Government property to make a plane to work with—this plane is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the metal is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after the inquiry the prisoner was suspended from his work—he then packed up three planes, and was going to take them out—he would have taken them out if I had allowed him to pass the gate—on examining them I found the mouth of the planes were bushed with brass, which, is a piece of metal let into the edge—I detained the pri<lb></lb>soner on account of the brass being in the mouth of the planes—I told him so—I do not think he said anything—the pieces of metal were taken out of the planes; these are them—they are gun metal; such metal as is in use in the department—he had no right to have this metal in his planes—these chisel handles are of a kind of wood which is used for the greater part of the wheels of carriages fitted out for China—the prisoner had no right to have this.</p>

On Tuesday night, 23d March, I took the prisoner into custody, at hit lodging, at Woolwich—I told him it was on a charge of stealing three pieces of gun-metal, value 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I showed him these pieces, which I received from Mr. Morris, the master wheeler—he said he had bought them in Petticoat Lane, and he afterwards said that two of the pieces were the property of the Crown, and one piece he had bought—I searched a box which was in the back yard; he said the box was his, and all that it contained—I found in it twenty-six pieces of wood of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and fourteen smaller pieces of another sort of wood—I asked him how he came by this wood—he said he bought it in Woolwich; I asked him if, when he bought it in Woolwich, it was an entire piece of wood? he said it was—I asked hint where in Woolwich he bought it—he said he did not know—he afterwards said it was three pieces of wood that these were made of, and that he had them of a man for whom he was mending a chest of drawers and that the man's name was Bowden, who was employed in the carriage department as a fitter—I searched, his room, and found about 11b. 9oz. of brass screws, which were marked with the broad arrow, and about 2lbs. of iron screws—the prisoner was not present, when I found these.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I live in Smith-place, Wapping. About half-past eleven o'clock at night, on the 3rd of March, I met the prisoners between Hermitage-bridge and Wapping—they asked me to pay for a pint of beer—I said I had no money, but if they would come to my room I would give them some out of a barrel—they both took my arm, and went home with me—on arriving there the table was laid, and the soup was all ready—they supped, and drank some gin out of a tea-pot, as much as they liked—after supper I said I was going to bed, I felt tired, and if they liked to come to bed they might—M'Carthy went to bed—Sweeny sat by the fire—I went to sleep directly, as I was a little heady—I awoke about three in the morning—I looked right and left, and felt right and left, and felt nobody there—I jumped out of bed, and went to look for my snuff-box—I missed it, and three shirts—I gave information to the police—I went to a public-house in the neighbourhood with the police, and saw Sweeny there—I saw Murray find my shirts and snuff-box in a house.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 133.) At four o'clock in the morning of this day, I saw the prosecutor with sergeant Brook, who could not understand him—in consequence of what he told me in his own language, I went to his house—he gave a description of two women—I knew them—I found Sweeny at Skipper's public-house about six in the morning—the pro-secutor recognized her directly as one who had robbed him—I told her he accused her of stealing his snuff-box and shirts—she said she knew nothing about it—she said she had been in the room and supped there, and he made them drunk—I took her to No. 6, Blue Anchor-yard to see after M'Carthy—I stood at the door with Sweeny while the other officer and the prosecutor went in—he found the shirts and snuff-box—the prosecutor said, "They are my shirts," and on unfolding one of them, the snuff-box was in it—I went to the watch-house with Sweeny and the property—I went back to look for the other prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock—Murray knocked at the door, and M'Carthy came out of the back part of the house, partly undressed—I took her as she was going into an opposite house—she said she was drunk, and had no recollection of any thing of the kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this house in Blue Anchor-yard. It is a house where M'Carthy lived for five weeks—Sweeny. I have known for five or six years—she knocked at my door about four this morning—my husband let her in—she said she had had a few words with her husband, and asked to leave a bundle with me, as she was afraid he would tear them—I told her to put them on the table—she said it would be safer to put them in the box—the box was unlocked—she put them in, locked it, and gave me the key—at a quarter past six the policeman came with her—I gave them the key of the box—I said she had been there—M'Carthy was out all that night till she was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Strutton-ground, Westminster. On the 31st of December, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop—I observed her go out with the piece of print now produced under her arm—I sent my young man after her—he overtook her in a pork-shop a few doors below—she was brought back with this print, which is mine.</p>

I was serving the prisoner and another woman—I showed them almost all the prints I had, and they would not please them—I showed them this print—my master said the party I was serving had got a print—I went to the counter, and it was gone—I went and took the prisoner in a pork-butcher's shop—I tapped her on the shoulder, and she dropped this print from her—I said it was the very thing I wanted.</p>

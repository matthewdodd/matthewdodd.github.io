Goods are deposited there by noblemen and gentle<lb></lb>men leaving England—the prisoner was employed as a porter—on 27th Decm, he was sent up to mat up the stowages—I went up, and saw him in a part of the room where he had no business to be, and where I afterwards dis<lb></lb>covered Mr. Carter's box and the sheet—I heard him to the other end of the warehouse—before he left the stowages I heard this hammer drop—he had no business with it—I said, "Fitz, what is that dropped?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Look and see"—he saw is his hammer, followed me to the end of the warehouse, and I went to the stowages and saw this sheet between two stowages—I had seen the prisoner draw the mat over them—I found that the lock of Mr. Carter's trunk was forced off—there were two more sheets similar to this in it.</p>

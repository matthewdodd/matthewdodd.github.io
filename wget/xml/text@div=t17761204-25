             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor: the prisoner came to our house that night about ten o'clock, and said, the young man that lay at our house was gaming at a public house, I said, that was nothing to me; he wanted me to go out to fetch a pint of beer, I refused; I said, I did not want any; at last he persuaded me to go and order a pint of beer, it was not out of sight of my own door; as I returned I met him coming out, he said, he was coming back again; I went into the room and found the watch gone, and then he was gone; I went and waked my husband and told him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOX sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in the Minories: I took this watch of the prisoner on the 14th of October last.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the prisoner? - Yes; I offered him 18 s. upon it, he said that would not do, and went out; he came back again and took the 18 s. that made me take particular notice of him; the next day the prosecutor came with the prisoner and claimed the watch.</p>

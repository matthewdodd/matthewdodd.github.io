                  </hi>. I sell crockery-ware, and live at Twickenham. On Monday, the 28th of December, I left my pony and van outside the bar<lb></lb>racks beer-shop, at Hounslow, kept by Beacham—I afterwards missed the things stated in the indictment—the china was in a basket in the van—the tea-pot was in the van, and some other things on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old. I recollect my father stopping at the beer-shop—I stood by the van some part of the time—I saw the prisoner's brother lean his head over the wheel—a man came out and asked what he wanted there—he said he was sick—the prisoner does not live far from where we stopped—it may be two or three hundred yards</p>

               <p>—she is single—I went away—we were in the beer-shop two or three hours, so that any one might have plundered the cart—I saw nothing of Chapman near the van.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house on the 12th of January—it is within eighty or ninety, yards of the beer-shop—she came to the door—I asked if she was aware that Mr. Beacham had lost a pair of candlesticks—she said yes—I said, was she aware of the china that was lost out of Mr. Smith's van—she said yes, she had heard of it—I said, "I have every reason to believe yon have both the candlesticks and china in the house; you have no objection to my looking?"—she said, "No, certainly not"—she said, "I must get my bonnet, I am going out"—she went up stairs, and came down in two or three minutes—I saw something bulky on her side—I said, "What have you got here, some crockery?"—she said, "No," and then said, "It is only a cream-jug that John Chapman gave me; and if you will go to John Chapman's, you will find the rest of the china"—I went there—he very willingly allowed me to look over his premises—I found nothing there—the prisoner's mother, who lives with her, came in while I was talking with her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 181.) I searched the upper part of the prisoner's house—I saw a box in the room—the prisoner came into the room, and I asked her whose box it was—she said it was hers—I said, "Are you sure; is it yours, or your father's?"—she said, "It is my box"—I asked if she had any more china like the jog my brother officer took from her—she said no—I looked in her box, and found this tea-pot lid—she said John Chapman gave it her—the prosecutor gave me the tea-pot—he had not lost that—I went to Chapman's, which is about three hundred yards from the beer-shop—I found nothing there—he allowed me to search the drawers and any part I liked.</p>

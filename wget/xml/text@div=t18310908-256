In consequence of what Painter, my lad, told me I examined my stock, and know that I have lost these things - I do not know the prisoner - she informed me that she sold fruit opposite the Post-office; I have not found this property - Painter was four months in my service, and had access to my goods; I gave him over to his father the last Saturday in July, and on the Monday the father gave me information, which induced me to prosecute the prisoner.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I had known the prisoner about two months before I left Mr. Bunn's. On the 19th of July I took this pair of gloves from my master's, without his knowledge - the prisoner had asked me to get them for her two or three days before - she gave me 1d. for the fan; that was on the 19th of July - I do not recollect when I took the gloves; I did not tell master of this - I knew I was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>JAMES CARR. I am a stone-mason. The prisoner sold fruit opposite the Post-office; I heard her acknowledge that she had received a handkerchief from the boy.</p>

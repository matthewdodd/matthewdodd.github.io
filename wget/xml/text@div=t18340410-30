               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the corn put in? A. No; but he told me it was clean corn - I had a quarrel with the prisoner after this transaction - he struck me because I told him I would tell master - I am a day labourer - I look after horses, or anything else - I have never been in trouble above once or twice - I was only put into the station - I never was tried - I never was at Brixton - I never was transported - I never ill-treated a gamekeeper, and was never punished for it.</p>

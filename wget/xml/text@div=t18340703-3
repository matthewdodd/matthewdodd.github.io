About twelve months ago I was acquainted with the prisoner - we were both in Maidstone prison - I was there for bringing a few spirits across the water - he was a stranger to me before that - I became acquainted with him there, and I never saw any thing amiss in him - in March last I came to London, and learned that prisoner was lodging in Wentworth-street - I found him at the public-house there - I called for two glasses of brandy and water, and paid for them - I produced my money - he was close to my side, and could see what I had - I then went to the vessel I had come to town in, and he took tea with me on board the vessel - Mr. Sheepwash came there while we were at tea - he stayed there about an hour, or an hour and a half - I afterwards went with the prisoner down Whitechapel - we fell in with another man in Whitechapel - not so low down as the church - I think it was before we got to the butchers' shops - somewhere on the right hand side - it was a great deal nearer to the church than Aldgate pump - it was on the other side of the Minories - I do not know the other man's name - he and I and the prisoner were walking together - I asked them to go into a gin shop to have something to drink - we all three had some gin - this was between six and seven o'clock, as near as I can say - while we were there the prisoner said he had no money - I took out my purse and gave him 5s. - I put my purse in my pocket again - we came out, and walked down Whitechapel - the prisoner was on my right side, and the other man on my left, I being in the middle - we were not arm in arm then - the prisoner asked me to go and see his girl who was down Bethnal-green-road - when we got down the road, one took hold of my right arm and the other of my left - they told me it was Bethnal-green-road, but I was never there before - we entered it from Brick-lane, on the left hand side of Whitechapel - when they got me part of the way down <placeName id="t18340703-3-crimeloc16">Bethnal-green-road</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. He says he was sober when with me, but when I left him he was drunk and speechless - he was with a young woman - I was in his company from three o'clock in the afternoon drinking, and from then till eight, when I left him in Whitechapel - I never saw him in Bethnal-green-road.</p>

            . I am an oilman. On the 18th of March I went on board a vessel at Billingsgate, where the prosecutor was - the prisoner was in his company - I am sure he is the man - I was in their company from half to three quarters of an hour - I knew Foard before, but not the prisoner - I took tea with them, and after tea I left them - I saw nothing more of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not take tea with us - he was on deck. Witness. I went down into the cabin, and took tea with them, and some oysters likewise.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of May, in consequence of information I received from Foard - after getting him out of the skittle-ground, where he was in company with twenty or thirty thieves, (I had great trouble to get him out,) I told him what I took him for - he denied it - Bethnal-green-road is in Middlesex.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction - I had apprehended him, and was present at his conviction - I know him to be the person - I can swear to him, as when I was taking him to Newgate he was called Bobby odd eyes - he has a black and a grey eye - I could swear to him among a thousand.(Certificate read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Foard swears falsely - he says he was not drunk - I say he was - I was in company with him from three o'clock till about eight, and was drinking all the while - I left him in the public-house, in Baker-row, Whitechapel, with a young woman, so drunk he could not stand - I did not take him into Bethnal-green-road - I am not the man who was convicted.</p>
               <p>JURY to FOARD. Q. When you went back to the ship, did you see any body? A. No - the men were in bed when I went on board the vessel - I saw nobody to men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030005"></xptr>tion it to that night - we were walking about I believe from the time I went into the public-house till half-past ten o'clock - the prisoner asked me to go and see his girl, but I was not in company with any girl whatever - I gave no alarm - when I was knocked down I saw nobody near - I found that I had been knocked down I saw nobody near - I found that I had been robbed directly, but gave no alarm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If he was knocked down and robbed, would not he make an alarm? - it is a public road - is it feasible that he would tell nobody?</p>

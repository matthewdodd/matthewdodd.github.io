            . I am shopman to Mr. Baylis, a pawnbroker, of Aldersgate-street. I have seen the prisoner at our shop - he pawned fifteen mahogany chairs, which I took in, and I believe some more, which I did not take in; they were pawned in the name of John Dexter; I showed them to Mr. Stacey, and have one of them here now. On the 13th of June the prisoner pawned two candlesticks, and two sets of ire-irons. I am certain he is the man.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of June I was there rather sooner than usual; I got my work done, and then took home a box of linen which my wife had. On my return the house-keeper asked how many chairs there were - I said I did not know, I thought there were two dozens and a half; she said No, there were but two dozen. She said when she went to the baker's that he told her he saw a man in a dark blue coat, coming out of the house with two chairs, and he went up Jewin-street; I was then anxious the chairs should be counted, and there were but nineteen left, making seventeen deficient; a gentleman then called me up stairs, and I went and told him - he said he thought it better to take no notice, as probably the thief would come again. I sent for an officer, who said he had not a doubt it was a man named Collins, who was well-known about the Inns of Court. The pawnbroker swore on the first examination that he took in the chairs, but could not say of whom; on the second examination he said I took fifteen.</p>

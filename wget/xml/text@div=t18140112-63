            . I live in Cato-street, Edgware-road. On the 13th of December, I was coming home between ten and eleven at night; I was coming from the Borough, through <placeName id="t18140112-63-crimeloc332">Oxford-street</placeName>

I walked on briskly to escape him, and immediately he seized my hat and veil. I alarmed the watchman with the cries of murder; he ran about fifty yards; I pursued, and took my hat from him. He had the hat, but not the veil.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he afterwards searched; was the veil found upon him - A. No; he chucked the veil away.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Oxford-street was this - A. On the Hanover-square side.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you overtake the prisoner - A. In Oxford-street, near Hanover-square. It is a bye place, no houses; there are a parcel of stables there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nobody in company with you, had you - A. No, I had just come out of a coach when he followed me. I came in a coach to Oxford-street. A lady was with me in the coach, but we had separated.</p>
               <p>Q. He had offered no violence before he took your hat and veil - A. Not before, but when I took hold of the skirt of his coat, and took my hat from him. He held up his fist; he then said he would knock me down.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 13th of December, the patrol and watchman brought the prisoner to the watchhouse; the lady charged the prisoner with robbing her of her hat and veil; the prisoner said she was a false woman to say he took her hat and veil. This is the hat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is the hat; it is mine: the value of it is two guineas. The veil cost me three guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of December, a little after nine in the evening, I met with this young woman in King-street, Covent Garden; she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink. I went with her to the watering-house in Bedford-street; we had sixpennyworth of gin and water, and after that I called for sixpennyworth of rum and water: we drank that; she turned sick, and vomited in the coal-box in the tap-room. She wished me to go home with her; I refused, she being in such a state of intoxication. In the street she vomited again; then I left her. I went into Oxford-street; I met her again. I never had her veil in my hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

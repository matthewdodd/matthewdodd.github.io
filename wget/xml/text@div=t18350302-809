He has no partner, but trades under the firm of Philp and Co.—on the 9th of October I was at his warehouse at No. 82, Gutter-lane—the prisoner had been at our warehouse, buying something before, and on that day she bought four pieces of Irish linen, and gave me this bill in payment—it purports to be drawn on H. Maxwell, Esq., Turnham-green, Middlesex—I asked her who Mr. Maxwell was—she said he was a most respectable man, living on Turnham-green, on his property; a man of independent property; that she had done business with him; supplied him with goods, and also his son with goods, and she took that bill in part payment of goods supplied to him—I let her have the linen—the bill was paid over to Williams and Hill—the prisoner at that time lived at No. 3, Jermyn-street, Piccadilly, where the bill was made payable—on the 13th of January it was due, and returned to us as dishonoured.</p>

On the 26th of July I gave him a check for 36 l. 13 s. 6 d., to pay some duties on balsam of Peru to Mr. Watson, at the Custom House - this is the check (looking at it).

            . I am in partnership with the last witness. In consequence of what Bailey, our carman, told me, I asked the prisoner if these duties had been paid, he said they had been paid; I said it was very strange, for Bailey could not get the goods. Next day I told him I would go down to the Custom House, and investigate it myself - he said he would accompany me, and did so; on our arrival there Watson came from his seat, and beckoned to me - I turned round, and found the prisoner had slipped off - he never returned, but was brought back about ten days after by the officer, and said he had been lead by his distresses to make use of the money, to pay some bills; he mentioned some other sums, and wished me to interfere. He said we might receive the money we had been defrauded of from his relations.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect his father's death - A. Yes; I have heard that he supported his father till his death. We gave him 15 s. a week - he did not board with us. He expressed great contrition.</p>

Griffins', and I supposed he knew what business I came on, and that I was an officer from London; he said he was very uncomfortable, expected it, and what he had done was through distress; that he paid the money away in different sums that he owed, and a young man, named Blundell, had led him into a good deal of company; he was sorry for what he had done, and hoped the money might be made up.</p>

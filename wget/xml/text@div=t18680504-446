                  </hi>. I live at 2, Hair brain Court, Blue Anchor Yard, White chapel—on 13th February, about 11 or 11.30 I was in the court and saw the prisoner standing by his own door—he asked me to go up-stairs for a minute—I went up with him and he said "Stand still a minute"—he went towards a box and lifted up the cover—I did not see him, take anything out; but he went from the box to the bed—he stood by the bed about five minutes, his back towards me, and lifted up the clothes with his hand behind his back—he then turned towards me, put her hand behind him, and came towards me quickly and shot me in the breast—I could not see what with—he then ran up and caught hold of me, stopped the blood, and, seemed very sorry—I asked him to let me go to my mother's, and he let me</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at the London Hospital—the boy was brought there on 13th February, with a wound in the upper part of his chest to the left of the sternum, and the cartilage of the first rib was fractured—I could pass my finger in sufficiently to feel the fracture, but was not justified in probing to search for the ball—it was such a wound as would be caused by a pistol—I am not certain whether the ball penetrated the lungs, but there is reason to believe it has—he is an unhealthy boy—he was ill for some time from the effects of the wound, and is so still—the bullet if still in him.</p>

I saw no half-pence, but 1 saw a pistol. I called him up, showed it to him, and said, "Aint this a fine one." I said it was a fine one. Wethrowed were playing with it together, and somehow or other it went off. I put it back in the box, and went to him. He would not let me look at him, and went down stairs. I did not know the pistol was loaded. It belonged to my brother.</p>

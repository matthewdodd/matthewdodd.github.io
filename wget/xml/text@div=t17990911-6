             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the parish of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what parish the house is in which Mr. Bye lived? - A. Yes; in the liberty of Glasshouse-yard, in the parish of St. Botolph. I was upon duty at the watch-house; I heard an alarm of fire; I went to the fire, and pulled out my staff, to keep the mob off, that the engines might play. In about ten minutes after, I saw the prisoner come out of the house; he had a wash-hand bason-stand and an old pipkin in his hand, or a glass, I do not know which, and he called out, where am I to put these things? and the mob cried out, between the rails; meaning the rails of the Square. I then took him by the arm, and said, if you have any more property, throw it down like a man, and go about your business. I had a little pocket-staff in my hand at that time; says he, I know you. I said, never mind that; if you have any property, throw it down. He said, search me, I have none.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that he said he had none? - A.When I first took hold of him; then I ran my hand down his waistcoat and his breeches, I found nothing there; I then took off his hat, and found this property in it, (producing the cloak, salt-spoon, and punch-ladle.) I found them between the lining and the crown of his hat, in what they call the false crown. I then got assistance from the Gentlemen of the Association, and took him to New Prison.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman of the parish of St. Luke's. I heard the alarm of fire; I went, and Mr. Rittson desired me to stand along with him; and the prisoner came down with a wash-hand bason-stand and a glass. He told him if he had any thing more about him, to put it down like a man. He said he had nothing, and then he searched him; I saw him pull the things out of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Bye.) Is that your cloak? - A. It is; I know it by the pattern of the lace and the pattern of the gauze: there are the initials of mine and my husband's name upon the ladle and upon the salt-spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the ladle and the salt-spoon? - A. On the same day, in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to this fire to give every assistance I could; I came down with several loads; I found a cloak in the two part of stairs room, and put it in my hat, that I might have my arms at liberty to carry the other things; he would not give me the least time in the world, or else I should have put the things down, but I had not time; and I was so exasperated at his saying search him, when he knew me, that I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BYE sworn. - Q.Whose house was this? - A. Mr. John Solloway's; we only had the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live in the house at the same time that you and your wife did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOWLER sworn. - I was at the fire, at the next door but one; nobody could wake the woman of the house, and the prisoner climbed up the lamp-iron, and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was through his means that the people of the house were preserved? - A. Yes, I would not have got up upon any account; for, if he had fell, he must have fell upon the iron spikes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his master with whom he worked for two years up to the present time, and three other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

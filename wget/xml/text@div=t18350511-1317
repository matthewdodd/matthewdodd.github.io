The prisoner was in my employ from fifteen to eigh<lb></lb>teen years, at the Repository, in Gray's-inn-lane, where I had a great quantity of lead, which had been taken off some buildings—I have com<lb></lb>pared this lead with some that remained on a building at St. Pancras—I believe it is part of it—it is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the shop. On the 13th of May, the prisoner and another man brought the lead—the other man had it in a basket—the prisoner said, "We have got a bit of <hi rend="italic">pigeon</hi> for you"—the man then put the lead into the scale—I examined it; it weighed eight pounds—I questioned them where they lived—the other man gave his name and address; the prisoner gave a false name—I then said, "I shall stop this"—the prisoner instantly ran out of the shop, and the other followed him—I watched them into a house, and sent the officer.</p>

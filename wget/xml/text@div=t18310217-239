            . I am occasionally employed by Mr. West. On the 16th of February I was at his brewery in John-street; the prisoners came with a waggon, and said they had brought twenty quarters of malt - they left twelve sacks there; Porter brought them all in - I saw him count them, and counted them myself; the empty sacks were put on the waggon, but not tied.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. West, at his brewery, Turner-square, Hoxton. The prisoners came there with a waggon, and said they had brought fourteen quarters of malt - I attended to the delivery; after Porter had brought in six quarters I saw that he had an empty sack doubled up on his shoulder, and a full one on it - when he had shot that I took the empty one, and asked if he had brought two sacks at once - he said his mate had thrown it on his shoulder; after delivering four or five more sacks he took the empty sack, and said he would throw it into the waggon - master came up, and I told him what had occurred; he counted the empty sacks - there were twenty-eight, which was right; I should think an empty sack on his shoulder would be an hindrance to him.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILLIAM WEST. I was at Turner-square - I did not measure what was delivered.</p>

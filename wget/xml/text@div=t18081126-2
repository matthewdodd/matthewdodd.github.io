I had, about twelve o'clock in the day received thirty pounds of a man in bank notes - two two-pound notes, and about ten or eleven one pound notes I brought home; the others I paid away; I cannot swear whether it was ten or eleven. I put the notes in a leather pocket book, and there were six or seven seven-shilling pieces; I put them in an iron hooped trunk in the chamber where I was sitting at supper, where I lodge myself; I locked the trunk, and I unlocked it again to shew

            ; I thought it might help her to pay her rent. Accordingly I called Elizabeth Black, and she agreed the prisoner should sleep in her room. I had a beautiful India shawl, and I asked her if she could wash it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the trunk in which you had put the pocket book - A. It was; she looked at the shawl, and said she thought she could wash it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take it out of the trunk - A. No, I took it out of the trunk, and I put it in again, and she sat down and supped a little mutton broth with me; the other young woman came and said she should sleep with her that night; accordingly she went down stairs to fetch some things, as she pretended, to sleep in. I suspected nothing till the next morning. A young woman came for me to pay her a pound note; I opened my trunk and said, Oh dear, my money is gone. I missed my pocket book, my notes, and seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. I saw the prisoner that day, and I thought she behaved awkward. I saw her in the room where Black lived. She bought a great many fine things, and was dressed out like a lady.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was she apprehended - A. I applied at Worship street office for a search warrant, and on Friday the 7th of October she was taken to the justice in Worship street; and then they chose that I should look in again on the Monday, and there they convicted her to come to the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your pocket book again - A. Yes, Mr. Armstrong has it; she confessed having it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it, or Mr. Armstrong - A. I said to her, pray where is my pocket book; she said I will go and fetch it; I asked her this in her own room in my house; this was on Friday the 7th of October; - she took the pocket book out of a basket from a heap of rags.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to lodge in the same room with you on that night - A. Yes, Mrs. Waylett called to me about half after seven o'clock to come into her room; the prisoner was with her. Mrs. Waylett asked me if it was convenient for her to lodge with me; I said I did not know it was, but I would let her be there; then the young body said she would come in about half an hour; and she came back at the watch going ten; I never saw the young woman before; I was in bed. The next morning the young woman dressed herself, and I did not see the wearing apparel she had on; I had no candle; I did not see there was any alteration, no further than she was smart. On Friday the pocket book was found in the old lady's hamper, with some rags; Mr. Armstrong found it. The hamper was up in my room, with some rags belonging to Mrs. Waylett.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took it out of the basket - A. I do not know whether it was her hand or mine, they were both in at once, but I believe my hand catched it before it came to the sight of the people; I thought the notes were there, but there was nothing but duplicates and receipts. This is the pocket book, I have had it ever since.</p>

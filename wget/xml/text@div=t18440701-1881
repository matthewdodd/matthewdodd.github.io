                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Mr. Briant's, at Hammersmith. On the 22nd of June I left London to go to Acton—I was at the Swan at Bays<lb></lb>water, and was too late for the train—I saw the prisoner there—the female who was with me knew him, and asked him to take the box which I had—he put it on his cart, and said we could both ride—we had a pint of beer together at the Swan—I gave my friend a sovereign to pay for it—she brought me the change, a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the silver</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 38.) About a quarter before ten o'clock, on Saturday, the 22nd of June, I was standing near Providence-place, Shep<lb></lb>herd's Bush—I saw the prosecutrix and another young woman jump out of the cart—the prosecutrix said she had lost her money—we went after the prisoner in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I caught him, and asked him to give me the money that he took from the prosecutrix—he declared to God he had not got any, and be wished God might strike him dead if he had got any belonging to her—I then searched the place where the prosecutrix pointed out to me she had been sitting—I did not find anything—I then went to the back of the cart, where they had jumped down, and could not find it—I was then just beginning to search the prisoner—I had pulled off his hat, and he said, "Look there"—I then saw the glove on the right hand side corner of the cart—I asked the prosecutrix if that was hers—she said yes, but that was not the way in which she put it into her pocket, she had rolled it up loose, and put it into her other glove, and when I found it it was tied—I took the prisoner to the sta<lb></lb>tion, got a lantern, and found this other glove in the centre of the cart, where the prisoner had been lying down—I desired him to come down from the cart while I searched, but he would not.</p>

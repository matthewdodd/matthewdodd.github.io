I am the daughter of William Bishop, he keeps a beer shop and coffee house in Cleveland-street, Middlesex Hospital On 5th April, a little before 12 o'clock, Sarsfield came, and asked for some coffee—I served him—he gave me a shilling, I noticed it was one of the Queen's reign—I believed it to be good, and gave him the 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the shilling in a drawer which I have for myself—there was one shilling in it, and I put this shilling with it—my father came home before Sarsfield went out—my father went to the drawer and took out the two shillings—there were only two shillings there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the coffee shop. I came home about a quar<lb></lb>ter before 12 o'clock—Sarsfield was then standing in the coffee shop—I went to the drawer and found there were only two shillings in it—one was a Queen's, and the other a King's shilling—they were both bad—I took them up, and my daughter said she took one of that man—Sarsfield then got up and went out—I followed him, and saw him join Fitzgerald in Cleveland-street, twenty or thirty houses from my house—Fitzgerald appeared to be waiting for him—I said nothing to them, but I watched them—I saw them put their hands together as if passing something to each other; after that. Fitzgerald went into another coffee shop, and Sarsfield waited outside—while he was waiting I saw a policeman, and made a communication to him, in consequence of that he went into the coffee shop and took Fitzgerald into custody—I spoke to another policeman, and he took Sarsfield into cus<lb></lb>tody—Sarsfield said he was not aware of the shilling being bad, and said, "You want your 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back, that is all you want?"—I said, "That won't do for me"—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>.

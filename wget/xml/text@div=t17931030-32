               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them? - Yes, she took them between six and seven on Tuesday night that I lost them, and I went to the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you see her take them? - I did not see her take them out; it was the 8th of October; I see them again the next day, the 9th, at Mr. Wooden's, a pawnbroker, I found nothing at the pawnbroker's but this petticoat; I found the other things at Mrs. Morley's house, I saw there a table cloth and a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was her house? - The officers went to search her house; she did not send the petticoat to pawn herself, she sent another person, and they stopped her, and the woman took them to Mrs. Morley's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe whoever stole these things got them by force, they broke off a padlock? - No, they did not, the padlock was not broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, the staple was taken off? - No, they wrenched open the door at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was more likely to be done by a man than a woman?</p>
               <p>Court. Was you out or at home at the time the things were taken away? - I was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the alarm at the door? - No.</p>

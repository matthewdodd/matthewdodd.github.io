            . The Prisoner and another Woman, came into my Shop on the 28th of April, between Three and Four, in the Afternoon, and asked for some black Silk Lace; I showed her some, she did not seem to like any of them, and asked to see some others; I had two or three Customers with me, so I told her, I should have more next Week, if they would come then; which they agreed to do: I saw her take the Lace, and followed her into the Street, and took her into my Next-door Neighbour's Shop, and took the Lace from under her Arm; before she went out of the Shop, I saw a bit of it hanging down, and then I took the Box of Lace away, because I would not be deceived by her shuffling it into the Box again: I know it is my Lace, because it has my Mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not take it with a Design to steal it, but only as a Pattern (but the Prisoner said afterwards, that she did not know she took it out of the Shop; that it might be by Chance, that she had it under her Arm).</p>

               <p>Mr Tomkins . The Prisoner lived in our Family as a Chamber-Maid, between two and three Years, and has been gone about three Months; we never mistrusted her Honesty, if we had, we should not have kept her so long; nor was she turned away upon any Suspicion of that Kind, and we had a very good Character of her from a Relation of ours that she lived with; I never heard any Thing amiss of her.</p>

             I have known the Prisoner, a great many Years, her Character was always very good; I knew her in several Places, particularly the last Place she lived in; I know all her Friends in the Country very well; she has very good Friends in Yorkshire .</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The Lace was loose under her Arm; if she had opened her Arm, it must have fell down: Since her Commitment, several Gentlemen have been with me, who gave her a very good Character; and, I believe it to be the first Offence. <rs id="t17430519-5-verdict24" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father in London Street, Greenwich, as butchers—Street was there for six weeks before he was taken, and Rudderwood was in the habit of coming to cut chaff in our loft with his machine—on 17th July, at 4.30, I examined the contents of the loft, and found twenty-four trusses of clover, and half a bushel of oats in a bin in which we only have one sack at a time an empty sack was lying in the other bin—it was a strange sack, but I had seen it before—the police showed me a sack containing two and a half bushels of oats, that was the same sack which I had seen in the loft—I had employed the police in consequence of suspicion—I had arranged that. Gallehawk was to send his man—I was not present at the mingling of the seeds—after the police had taken Rudderwood I went to the premises, the Back was gone, and there was about a bushel and a half in the bin—that was about 5.30 p.m.—none had been used in the course of the day, the oats had not long been in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, and collect tradesmen's bills—I live in York-street, City-road. On the 10th of March I was getting out of a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and being rather the worse for liquor I made a false step, and injured my face and legs—the prisoner came up and condoled with me, and induced me to go with her—she was a stranger—we went to No. 13, Woodstock-street, Oxford-street, to lodge for the night—I had in my waist-coat pocket five sovereigns—I sent out a sovereign for liquor, which we had in the house—I had a watch, a chain, a brooch, a pair of gloves, a hand-kerchief, and a scarf—I went to bed before eleven o'clock—she did not go to bed with me—when I awoke in the morning I found I was robbed of four sovereigns, and all my property—this is my watch and chain—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I did not go with her for any improper purpose.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother keeps the house No. 13, Woodstock-street—we let out beds by the night. On the night of the 10th of March the prosecutor came to our house with the prisoner—he was so tipsy I do not believe he knew what he was about—I cannot say how long the prisoner remained there—the prosecutor came down in the morning, and said he was robbed—the prisoner was gone then—I understood they were to sleep to<lb></lb>gether—the prisoner occasionally frequented the house at all times, night and day.</p>

I know this house very well—about a quarter to three o'clock, on the morning of the 11th of March, I saw the prisoner quarrelling with a caiman, in Oxford-street, about the fare—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, as I passed, said, I think on purpose for me to hear, that she had got a good watch—I asked her how she got it—she said she had borrowed it from a friend—I asked her to take me to where he was—she could not—she afterwards said it belonged to a gentleman who lived at the Burlington hotel—I took her in charge with it.</p>

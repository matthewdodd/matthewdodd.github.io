                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, of North-street, Barking. On Friday, 18th Aug., the prisoners came, and asked for a pint of beer and two Pickwicks—I was not in the tap room when they paid—my wife brought me a half sovereign—I looked at it; it was tried, it bent, and I went to my next door neighbour, and asked him if it was good—my wife took it back to the prisoners in my presence, and they offered her another half sovereign she would not take, and a shilling was given to her, and the half sovereign was given back to the prisoners—after that a policeman showed me a half sovereign; it was the same which I had seen before.</p>

On Friday afternoon, 18th Aug., I and two other constables were near Mr. Brown's house; he said something to me, and I went in search of the prisoners, and found them in the Spotted Dog, sitting at a table, with a pint of ale between them, which had been paid for before I went in—they called for two Pickwicks, and flung down this good half sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I spoke to the landlady who took the half sovereign—I went back and said, "I shall take you into custody"—Foster said, "What for?"—I said, "For passing a bad half sovereign"—he said, "This is a good half sovereign, but the one which I offered before I have got in my pocket;" and gave it me—I gave it to Jay, and took the prisoners to the station.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she near that part of the counter where these shirts lay? - A. Yes, close to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have seen her do something that should induce you to suspect her in particular? - A. I saw my boy move some trowsers from before her; she placed her child upon the counter close to the shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her make use of her hands at all? - A. No; when she came back, she said, she did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200051"></xptr>not take them; that a girl about fourteen years of age, who was with her, took them; but there was nobody at all with her, except a little child in arms.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what will become of you if you say that which is not true upon your oath? - A. I shall go to the devil. - I am servant to Mr. Living, as errand-boy: I was behind the counter when the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suspect her? - A. I did not much like her appearance, she looked like a girl of the town; there were some trowsers on the counter, and she leaned her elbow upon them, and I thought she was going to take them, and I took them away; she said directly, take care, or else they will fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any shirts upon the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near them? - A. Yes, close to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her do any thing? - A. No; my master then desired me to go out and see if I could see her; I went up to her, and told her my master can serve you now with the bit of cotton you wanted; and I saw the shirts under her arm, with her gown over them; I caught hold of her, and she said, here are two shirts the child brought away under her petticoats, and I did not know it; she having a child in one arm, and the shirts in the other; she did not make any resistance, but let me take them from her; my master then came and took hold of her, and I took the shirts back to the shop, and gave them to my master.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Living) What is the value of these shirts? - A. They cost me twelve shillings and sixpence each; they are here, in custody of the officer, I delivered them to him; we number all the shirts as they come in, and these are both No. 20, I described them when they were brought back before I looked at them, they were marked with my private mark, D. E. h.(The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was not two yards from the window all the time; when I came out of the shop, I saw two shirts drop from three women that came out. <rs id="t17990220-49-verdict257" type="verdictDescription">

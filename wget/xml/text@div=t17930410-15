               <p>Q. Was it a sort of tea of which you have a great deal more in your warehouse? - We have of the same sort and quality; upon this I asked him where he took it from? and his answer was, he knew nothing at all about it; I asked him several times.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100020"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Do you belong to the tea department? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you cannot say there was any tea missing? - There were seven chests nearly empty.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the labourers all of them pull off their coats when they go to work? - Sometimes those that come in a working dress do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was the tea taken out of the coat he had on? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he take his coat off to work? - I believe he did not, he was in the weighing gang.</p>
               <p>Q. He has worked there three years? - I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In point of fact had the prisoner at the bar a great coat on covering another coat or not? - He had what they call a surtout coat covering another coat.</p>
               <p>Court. You told us there was some missing at this time; you did not know this by going through the warehouses? - We saw the chests plugged, and have had some missing several months before, and it was going away daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not to the amount of some hundred men in the warehouse? - There was between three and four hundred.</p>

Richardson, says he, it is only wanting four or five minutes, it makes no difference, says he, to the company, I live but just by, then says I, I must rub you down; I put my hands down him, and I felt the tea in his pocket, and he immediately wrenched himself away from me, I pursued him, and he endeavoured to make a run, and wanted to make to the gate by force, and I said, Rickman, you must not let the man go out, and I immediately stepped forward, and stopped him again; then I said Barnes, I have had a suspicion some time; now says I, you must go up to the officer Mr. Wilson, we went up, Mr. Wilson was there, and Mr. Wilson sent for the officer, and Mr. Noble came in, and Mr. Noble immediately searched him, and found the tea, and it was put into a sheet of paper before my face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What the prisoner said that that way was his nearest way home was true? - It was, he lived just by.</p>

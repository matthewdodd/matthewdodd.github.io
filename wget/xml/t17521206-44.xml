               <p>Q. When did you see it last.</p>
               <p>Booshire. I saw it about four in the afternoon; and about six o'clock going to put it on, it was gone; I advertized it, and last Wednesday morning I had inteligence of it; the prisoner came to work at our house that morning I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his employment?</p>

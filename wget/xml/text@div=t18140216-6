               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Hartley Smith - A. Yes, he lived in our house four days. I took him in, and gave him some employment. He came to live with me on the 14th of August; he left me on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any watches from your shop - A. I went out of town on the 17th of August; I returned in about a week; the prisoner was gone then. I had a letter sent me that he absconded on the 19th with four watches, and when I returned I missed four watches that I had left in my shop when I went away. They were silver watches, worth about three guineas each.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your family consist of - A. A housekeeper I left behind me and a son; he is gone to sea now; he was at home then. The housekeeper is here. The watches were pledged, and the tickets sent home in a letter on the 19th. The officer has the watches; he happened to be in the shop at the time the letter came in. The officer has got the property. I took the prisoner in out of charity. I did not expect he would have robbed me. I had no suspicion of the man. I had seen him twice before I employed him.</p>
               <p>SARAH UNDERHILL. I am housekeeper to Mr. Winter. On the 14th of August, the prisoner came to our shop to work; he continued to work there until the 19th. Between the hours of seven and eight he came to work on the 19th. I gave the prisoner the watches to hang up. I had the care of the watches, and took them down and hung them up, but being busy I gave them to the prisoner on the 19th to hang them up, about eight o'clock in the morning. There were a great many more watches. Them four were taken down of a night and put into a glass case. I took them into my bed-room of a night. I gave them to him about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw him hang them up. I was in a room adjoining. After he had hung the watches up he went out to breakfast; about ten o'clock he came back; he said he had heard of a situation for

He stopped at work until one o'clock, and then he went out to dinner. He never returned. On the Saturday week I saw him at the police office. About two o'clock Mr. Winter's son came home; I said to him, William is not come back yet. The prisoner had hung up watch-cases in the places where the watches had been. I did not miss the watches until Robert came home; he missed the watches, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181402160006"></xptr>then I missed them. He said he had robbed him; I went to see, and I saw the watches were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. How many watches were gone - A. Four. The prisoner never returned.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUTLER. I am an officer of Shadwell office. The prisoner was given into my charge on the 5th of this month, at New Prison. He was first taken to Hatton Garden office. On the 19th of August I was at Mr. Winter's house when a letter came with these four duplitates enclosed. The letter was directed to Mr. Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Winter's house - A. I was sent for, and when I was at the house a letter came with the four duplicates of the four watches. The letter bears

             I believe this to be the watch; it has been out of my possession ten days. I cannot possibly swear to it. It is remarkable in the dial plate. I believe it to be the same watch; it has the same name as is upon the ticket. It was pledged for thirty shillings; the value of the watch is about three guineas. I believe the prisoner pledged it. He had the appearance of a gentleman; he was dressed very different to what he is now.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these four watches - A. They are all my property; three of them I made myself. I left them in my shop when I left town. My son took an inventory of all that was in my shop in my presence. I was close by him at the time; the prisoner was close by also.</p>

            . Do you know the watches - A. Yes, two of them; they are Mr. Winter's property. I saw the watches when I gave them the prisoner to hang up in the morning; they were missed about half past two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the absence of Mr. Winter, my master, before I left him I heard of a situation at Uxbridge that would suit me a great deal better than his, accordingly, as I had a few shillings in my pocket I went, and when I went I had come too soon by a fortnight, and as I had left my master without any warning I did not return. I went to my father. I came up to town about a fortnight since, when I was taken into custody. I never pawned any of these watches.</p>

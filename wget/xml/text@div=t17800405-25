On Saturday the 25th of March, between eight and nine, I came in and found the two prisoners in the shop. My young man was just going to shew them a gold ring when I came in.</p>
               <p>Is that young man here? - No. I had some suspicion of the prisoners, knowing there were such tricks as changing of rings. When they asked the price of the ring, I took it out of my young man's hand and weighed it myself. I held it to the candle to observe some mark, that I might know it again. I then gave it to

            , and told her the price was six shillings and six-pence. She kept it about half a minute and then went to return it to my young man. She said it would not do. I did not suffer my young man to take it, but took it myself; I held it to the candle, as I had done before, and found that that which she returned me was a brass one gilt; the ring I gave her had the gold stamp, and the maker's name J. K. which are two marks; the one she returned had only one mark, and that a very bad one, a T. or J. K. I do not know which, I have it here.</p>
               <p>The ring you have in your hand is the one you received of her? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Is it a gold ring? - I was immediately certain it was a metal one. On discovering the ring, I sent for a constable and had her searched, but did not fine my ring. I sealed up this ring, put my name upon it, and delivered it to the constable. Before I sent for the constable, I saw her put her hand to her mouth, and give a kind of struggle, at which time I have reason to believe she swallowed my ring. They said the ring was for the other woman, who was to be married the next day. They were both searched; they had not a shilling between them; there was nothing found upon them.</p>

               <p>We went in to buy this ring for Hill. I had sixpence, and was to pawn my own ring to lend her the money to pay for it. The gentleman has my ring now. We went into a pawnbroker's shop before we went into this shop, and he offered to lend me three shillings upon it.</p>

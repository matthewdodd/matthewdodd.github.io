On 18th May I followed Sergeant Packman to a tavern, and found Honess there drinking in front of the bar—Packman introduced me—he said, "Mr. Bull, Mr. Honess"—I told Honess I was a detective officer of the city police, and charged him with being con<lb></lb>concerned—</p>

               <p>with a person named John Nash, not in custody with uttering a forged cheque on 1st May, 1865, to Mr. Ridley, Music Hall, Regent-street—he said, "That is all settled, I wrote to Mr. Ridley yesterday; I am sur<lb></lb>prised at his taking this course"—I told him Mr. Ridley had no power in the matter—he then said, "I had it from Mr. Nash"—I told him I was about to ask him a question, but he need not answer it, and warned him in the usual way—I asked him if he had the cheque—book that the cheque was taken from—he said, "I have not it by me, but you will find it in my study, and likewise a letter I received from Mr. Nash, if you and Packman will go there with me"—I told him we could not possibly go back with him; we had reasons for not doing so.</p>

I took Nash on 26th June in the area at the back of his house, 8, Tennison—street, Lambeth—I jumped over the wall, and nearly jumped upon him—I said that I was an officer, and wanted him on a charge of forgery on the Metropolitan Bank—he said, "Let Me put on my boots"—I accompanied him into the kitchen—he said, "you have not read the charge to me"—I said, "I have, and you will be charged on another case, with being concerned, with a man named Honess, now in custody, for uttering a forged cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Ridley, of Regent Music Hall, Westminster, with intent to defrand;" reading it from this paper—he said, "Honess is the cause of it all, he has led ma into all I have done"—he asked me if Honess was tried—I said, "I cannot answer any questions"—next day, going to the Mansion—house, I asked him if he knew Mr. Manger, of Sydenham—he said, "Yes," and that he received only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque cashed at the Music Hall, and about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the one changed by Mr. Andrews.</p>

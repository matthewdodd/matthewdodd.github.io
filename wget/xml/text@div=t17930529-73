               <p>I am a constable. On the 13th of April I was sent for to Mrs. Moles's house, and was told that a man had stole a stove out of the stable, and I went to the house where that man lived in, and found the stove behind a door in that house. (The stove produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This affair happened on Saturday night, this witness, who is a witness against me, owed me some money; in the course of the week I had asked him for it, and I told him I would summon him for it on Friday; I know nothing about the stove, it was not found in my room; I was in my own room sitting by my own fire when they came; it was found behind the passage door.</p>
               <p>Constable. It was behind the first door before a small passage which leads to other peoples door.</p>
               <p>Court to Limerick. He says you owed him some money, is it true? - I owed him six-pence</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call on you for the money? - No, he never asked me; his wife said, why did not I pay Sam the six-pence; I had not the six-pence then to pay her when she asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a lad of character? - Yes; I never knew any thing else but honesty by him.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnes. Is the lad a lad of character? - He was born in the place, I never heard any thing imputed to him before.</p>

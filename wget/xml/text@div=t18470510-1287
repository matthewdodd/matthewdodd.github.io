                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable K</hi> 381.) I am stationed at Stratford. In Feb. I saw the prisoner and Henry Revel, coming up the Eastern Counties Railway—I watched them—they came to a wall five of six feet high, and Revel got over—White lifted a bag up, and Revel took it from him—they went into Stratford, and carried the bag—I watched them—they saw me, and tried to make away—I ran and stopped Revel, and took the bag from him—White made his escape—this is the bag—I am sure it is the same that White gave him—it contains iron bolts and pins—the prisoner had no business on the railway, nor to get over the wall—they could go a different way.</p>

I can identify these bolts and nuts as the property of the railway company—here is the Eastern Counties Railway mark on them—I am in the habit of receiving them at my gate—there is such property on the railway—they are using on the line daily—people watch the workmen away to their meals, and take these things—these are as good as ever they were.</p>

On 6th September, about twenty minutes to 5 in the afternoon, I was coming from Petticoat-lane to Whitefross-street, and saw the prisoner coming from Bishopsgate-street with something rather bulky in his breast—I crossed over towards him—he sprung forward, shoved me on one side and passed me—I ran after him calling, "Stop thief!" through two streets, and at the corner of Artillery-lane I saw him drop this reticule (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up and followed him into Gun-street when two men tried to stop him—he turned round and faced me and I took him—as we want to the station there was a lady and gentleman; the gentleman said, "Here he is now;" I believe the prisoner heard that, he was close by—they came to the station and charged him.</p>

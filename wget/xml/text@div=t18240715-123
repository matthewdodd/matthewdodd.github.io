I had not got many yards further before I felt a jerk at my pocket, and found the handkerchief was gone - I turned round, and saw the prisoner, in company with another young man, who was discharged at Guildhall. They were the only persons near me - I suspected one of them - I walked after them, and charged them with it; the other man denied it, but the prisoner said nothing. I secured them myself as it was near the watch-house, and the handkerchief was found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you swear it was your handkerchief - I had one like it round my neck - A. I am certain it is mine, your's is a lighter colour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cross-street, Poplar. I saw the prisoner, between ten and eleven o'clock, running very fast down Cross-street, and Mr. Atfield after him—he pointed to him, and called, "Stop thief"—I ran after him about 200 yards up Wade-street, and saw him throw something towards a shoemaker's shop door—he then turned to the East India-road, and there I saw him throw something over Rome palings into a yard—I followed him to North-street, and caught him—I held him till Mr. Atfield came—he asked me to bring him back—I led him back to the shop, and stopped there till the policeman came and took him.</p>

On the 17th of April there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I was passing down the East India-road, and a young man passed me very quickly—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner—I saw him throw the handkerchiefs from his hand over a fence.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 17th of April, was in the East India-road between ten and eleven o'clock—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—he took some pocket-handkerchiefs from his bosom, threw them over the palings, and they lodged on a lilac tree—I saw Mr. Green take them from the tree.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen them that evening yourself? - A. I really cannot say, because there are so many; I am clear he took them from up stairs, because I followed him down stairs directly; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he wanted two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he hold six dozen of spoons in his hand? - A. Yes; they are papered up, and tied. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. They are new spoons - do you know them to be your mistress's? - A. They never were used; I know they are our make.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. I cannot tell, Mr. Anderson can.</p>
               <p>- ANDERSON sworn. - (Looks at the spoons, and identifies them.) They are worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the son of Mrs. Anderson, the widow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with her? - A.No. I sent the last witness down after him, and saw him brought up; the last witness brought the spoons to me at my writing-desk, and said he took them away from George, the prisoner.</p>

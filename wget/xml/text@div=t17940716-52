               <p>I know the timber to be Mr. Lackington's property.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. These are the two pieces of Wood he left with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Rolfe. I see them at Mr. Davis's about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; they are part of the building that has been taken down to make an improvement in Mr. Lackington's shop in Finsbury-place; here are the notches in the Timber which sits with some in the yard, where it has been cut off, I compared it at the time we took it back; the prisoner worked for me at Mr. Lackington's, I am a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those two blocks? - They were worth about four shillings and six-pence in their present state; he had not been at work for me more than a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

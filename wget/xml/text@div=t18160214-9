            . I am an officer. On the night of the 3rd of February, I saw the two prisoners, in company with a third person, about five o'clock in the evening, in Long-lane, West Smithfield; I knew their persons very well, and followed them up Holborn, across Lincoln's-inn-fields, into Long Acre, where they made attempts three times, at a watch-maker's shop; but they did not succeed. I perceived Oates, alias Wilde, take a cord from his pocket; then they returned back to the shop; but the man was putting up his shutters. They then made their way out of Long Acre into Drury-lane, where Furzeman, another officer, joined my company in watching them. We continued to watch them. Then they went to a stay-maker's shop, in Great Turnstile, Holborn; the prisoner Wilde, and the man who is not in custody, went to the window, and attempted it; Marshall walked to and fro; then they proceeded to another shop window, a watchmaker's, in Cow-lane, West Smithfield, and tried that, and did not succeed. They then went to a linen-draper's shop, in Barbican, and starred the windows in two places. Then they proceeded to <placeName id="t18160214-9-crimeloc51">Agnes Terrace, in the parish of St Leonard's, Shoreditch</placeName>

I saw them try the window; I saw one of them working something by the putty at the bottom of the glass; after remaining there two or three minutes, they left the window again. I then made up to the window, and perceived they had starred it; but they had not pushed it in then. During their absence, some person from within came into the shop, and snuffed the candle which was placed in the window. The prisoners stopped a few minutes, and then all three returned back, and made up to the window; the prisoner Oates, stood at one end of the window, and the man who is not in custody, at the other end, and the prisoner Marshall, in the centre, when the pane was starred; I was then on the opposite side of the road, just fronting the prosecutor's shop. I heard something snap like glass, and I went to the bottom of the street, and there I saw there was a hole in the window a great deal larger than a man's hand could go in. The prisoners then had run away to the bottom of the street; they were then all three on the opposite side of the road; they then came along on the opposite side to where the shop was; they came one by one, Marshall was first, Oates next, and the man who is not in custody; Marshall stepped opposite the prosecutor's house, and looked in; the other two passed him, and went to them. They then crossed the road, and made up to the prosecutor's shop again. Marshall and the other person stood on the right of Oates; Oates then put his hand into the hole in the glass, and I saw him take something out; it appeared to be a shoe; he put it into his his right hand pocket. Oates then turned short round, and went away by a street leading to the Tabernacle, and I lost sight of him immediately; there is a watch-box there, about three yards and a half from the foot-path, that is in the Tabernacle-yard. I lost sight of Oates, and I turned round, and took Marshall into custody; I took him into a shop opposite the prosecutor's shop, and a person from the prosecutor's house came in, and I gave him in charge of him while I went to look for the others. I found Oates coming back from the Tabernacle, and I took him into custody, and I searched him, and found on him two knives, a cord, a tobacco-pouch, and two duplicates. I afterwards examined the glass,(produces a piece of broken glass.) this glass was pushed inside the window; here is one of the knives, and there is an impression made on the putty exactly tallying with the point of this knife. Oates said, he had just come from home, and so did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140014"></xptr>Marshall. I told them that would not do for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a scowrer and dyer. I can't tell whether that pane of glass was lately put in or not; the putty was not fresh. Marshall crossed the road when I went after Oates, and after losing sight of Oates, I took Marshall, he was making his way away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Oates. I should wish to ask the officer whether I was coming from the Tabernacle when he took me?</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; my husband's name is Philip; I was in the room behind the shop on the night in question; I went into the shop to snuff the candle; that was a short time before the prisoners were taken; it was after eight o'clock; the candle was burning perfectly straight when I went to snuff it, and there was no hole in the window. I sat in the parlour, I heard a kind of a noise like a draw on the glass, and I thought it was the umbrellas against the window, as it was raining a little; but as it continued, I jumped up immediately, and went into the shop, and found the window broken, and one boot of a pair (which I remembered to have stood opposite to that pane that was broken,) was gone; they stood exactly opposite to the hole. I did not see Barret, the officer, until Monday morning; when he came then I saw him compare a knife with the putty, and it tallied as far as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I was examined before the magistrate, and then I stated that this pane was cracked before.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There was no hole; it stood for six months in the same state; the candle was placed every night near it, and not the least air came in.</p>

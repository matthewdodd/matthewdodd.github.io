I and the prisoner work for Mr, Treacher. on Saturday night the 10th of January, I was in company with the prisoner, drinking at a public-house, next door to his house-that was the last public-house we were at - We left together between twelve and one o'clock-both went home he appeared to me to be in liquor. Next morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to his house and saw him - He was talking to Mr. Jones and Mr. Williams, who were there - I staid about three minutes, went away, and returned again in ten minutes - I asked him why he did not follow us? The first time I was there we wanted him to go with us-he said "I am coming directly."I turned round and asked him where his wife was-he said she was in bed - I went into the bed-room, and said, "Mrs. Evans, it is a fine time of day to be in bed." Receiving no answer, I looked, and saw her lying on the bed with her mouth half open-she was covered with the bed-clothes - I felt her, she was quite cold. I said to the prisoner, "Mrs. Evans is dead" - He said "Good God don't say so."He went and jumped to her, and kissed her; saying, "I hope you are not dead, my dear woman." He kept crying over her, I pulled him away, I asked him what time he spoke to her - He said "between six and seven o'clock in the morning, that she told him her feet were very cold, and that he put a hot brick to them, and that she said, "that is a good boy.'" I asked if he had done any thing to her, he said "No, but I was very much intoxicated - I don't know what I did." I asked if she was drunk? He said, he did not know; that he was aggravated by some of the lodgers-was very drunk, and did not know what he did. He said that one of the women of the house told him, that his wife had had connection with one of the lodgers in the passage; and that the lodger told him, he did not keep a wife but a wh-e; and that the lodger's husband had had connection with his wife two or three days ago, in the passage. I told him not to vex himself, and bid him good by. The floor of the room was not quite dry, it appeared as if it had been cleaned-there was a fire in the room, About ten minutes after I went there again, he asked me to go to his little boy.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards did you see him again - A. About two o'clock he came to my room, and asked me to go to a person to lay the corpse out. I went with his little boy to her, she would not come. In about an hour I saw him again at his house - He asked me to go with him to the undertakers. He said, "suppose we take the length of the body." We did so, and went to Mr. White, the undertaker, he told him his dear woman was dead-he said that she was very low, and he could see death in her face for a week past-that she could eat nothing for some time - He gave White the string, and told him if that would do, it would save him the trouble of coming. White said he was much obliged to him, and asked him if she was stout-he said she was wasted away to nothing. We then went to Mrs. Jones; she and her daughter went with us to the prisoner's house - I left the prisoner's house about ten o'clock at night, leaving Jones there. The next morning (Monday), about ten minutes before seven, I went and asked him to come to work with me - He said he did not think he should to day, and asked me to take a few clothes to my wife to wash. He gave me a bundle, which I gave her - She had not been in the habit of washing for him they were tied up in a course cloth like an apron. I saw him again at half-past seven in the evening, and asked if the coffin was come - He said, no, it was past the time-it came while I was there. I heard the women say, that the man down stairs had killed his wife the prisoner could hear them. He said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the coffin was closed did you see the body - A. I saw part of her hand, when the undertaker was taking the cap off her head, I thought I saw somthing like a crust of blood, it appeared to stick to her head. His wife always appeared a weak person - I had seen her on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I had known the prisoner seven months-he was a very kind good-hearted man - They were very fond of each other - I have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180014"></xptr>her in liquor once or twice; she appeared in a low state for sometime past, and complained that her stomach was weak and she could eat nothing-the prisoner never absconded; he appeared extremely sorry,</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he did not know she was dead, when you found her so - A. Yes; he said he had been aggravated by one of the lodgers, and did not know what he was about. He told the undertaker he might come and examine the body if he liked.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. I work for Mr. Treacher. On the 10th of January, I was with the prisoner - left him at the public-house, at the corner of Falconbridge-court. at eleven o'clock at night. Next morning, at half-past ten, I went to his room, and knocked at the door with my finger, he asked who was there, and said he could not open the door for me, and asked if I saw the key any where outside, for somebody had locked him in and taken it away - He asked me to go to Davis, to fetch the key to open the door for him - I did so, and came back with Davis's key. I was just putting it into Evans's door, when a woman came up from the street, and said,"I have got the key of that door," and gave it to me - I opened it, and took Davis's key back, and then returned to the prisoner Davis came after me, we found him standing in the front-room; Jones, the landlord, came in-Davis asked the prisoner to come out to drink - He said he did not care - We went out, and waited in the street for him to follow. We went back again after him - I observed the room had been lately washed-there was a little fire in it it was between ten and eleven o'clock I asked him if he knew his wife was dead? he said he did - He was sitting on the bed, crying and kissing her - I staid at the door and did not see her. Between three and four, I saw him again at Davis's - They bot went ouht and drank with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His door was locked outside, and his key taken away - A woman gave me the key, she was pregnant - I don't know who she was.</p>

            . I lodge in the one-pair back room of the prisoner's house, he lived in the two parlours, on the ground floor. On Saturday night, the 10th of January, after twevle o'clock, my husband was brought home by two men, intoxicated. I went out and met them left them at the door, and went to get a light. When I came back the door was shut, the prisoner opened it - We all three went in. There was a quarrel between the prisoner and my husband, about his coming home late-no blows passed while we were wrangling; the prisoner's wife was there with a candle in her hand; she was sober, and appeared as usual - She went out of the room and came in again. The prisoner appeared to have had a little drop, but not much. My husband was put to bed. I went out to light the two men who brought him home; as I returned up stairs I heard the prisoner challenging his wife about some money - I stood on the third or fourth stair, against his bedroom wainscot - I heard him call her bad names, and ask what she had done with some money. I heard either 2s. 10d. or 2s. 10 1/2d. mentioned. I heard him strike her; I thought it was with his hand-the noise stopped. I went up to my room. About a quarter after one o'clock I was coming down stairs for some water, and heard him beating her dreadfully; I can not tell what he beat her with, it appeared to be with some weapon. I heard her say"Oh! dear me," and "don't;" very low, several times. I stood listening on the stairs for ten minutes, or more; I thought they were going to bed. In the middle of these expressious, I called him a blackguard for beating his wife; he called me several bad names; he heard me through the wainscot. I ran up stairs to my husband, but could not make him understand, he was drunk; I knocked at the door of the next room - I could not make them hear - I could have been heard all over the house. I returned to my own room, and was afraid to go down, to pass his door, or I should have called the watchman. I thought he had done beating her. I heard no more; my bed-room is over his - I did not lock the prisoner in his room at all. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I was in the passage, and picked up the key of his door - I knocked at his door, he opened it, and had a cloth or flannel in his hand, and was wiping something off the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married - A. I have five children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman - A. I pass as such. I have lived five months in the house. I never was acquainted with the deceased she lived there six or seven weeks. I never had any dispute with her, or used bad language to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling the prisoner about his wife doing any thing with your husband - A. I said nothing about his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never, on any occasion, spoke unkindly of her - A. Never. I never said she had been improperly connected with my husband. I thought he was beating her with his fist at first. I went up stairs without my water. I never got any assistance. I was afraid to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him wiping the floor -

            . I lodge on the second floor in the house. I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, with my husband. I was disturbed a few minutes after twelve, by a great noise in the passage. I heard Mr. and Mrs. Desmond, and the prisoner, talking together. I thought I heard a scuffle - I did not leave my room; the prisoner went into his room. In a few minutes I heard Mrs. Desmond go up stairs, and come down again, and a man came in; she told her husband it was her sister and brother her brother had brought her husband home. I believe he forgot something, and returned for it. After this, I heard Mrs. Desmond quarrelling for an hour and a half at the door of the prisoner's room-some ill language passed. I heard the deceased groan three times. Mrs. Desmond was in her own room at that time she had gone down again. I at first thought it was a dog<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180015"></xptr>growling, but the last groan I knew it was her, I said something wrong was going on - I got out of bed, and told my husband. I heard Mrs. Desmond take a candle and go down stairs. I saw a light under the crevice of my door, she called the prisoner a bad name - He left off beating his wife. Mrs. Desmond asked her why she did not cry out? the prisoner said she could not. Mrs. Desmond said, "I know very well, it is because you have murdered her." The prisoner said, "Yes, I know I have." I was afraid to go down, or to send my husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your husband - A. Clerk to a land agent. The noise was like striking a feather-bed. I thought he was beating her in bed. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I heard the prisoner talking to Mrs. Desmond-he was at his door - She was on the landing-place. She said he ought to be ashamed to beat his wife so. He said,"It was through what you said." She said, "That is nonsense, I say anything when I am in a passion." The prisoner said, "Don't say any more to me; I have more trouble in my mind than you are aware of - I don't want to be bothered with you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Desmond insinuate that the prisoner's wife had been improperly connected with her husband - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>MARY CHAPMAN. I lodge in the same house with the prisoner. I knew the deceased by sight; she was a quiet. sober woman; she and the prisoner appeared to live on good terms. On Saturday night, the 10th of January, I met her in the passage, just before twelve o'clock, and spoke to her, she appeared to be sober. I sleep in the two-pair front room. After one o'clock in the morning I heard a quarrelling between the prisoner and Mrs. Desmond; it came from his room, and lasted about half an hour - I heard no blows, I heard the deceased groan, about eight o'clock in the morning - I was ill in bed, and did not get up. I went out about ten o'clock; when I came back, I observed the prisoner's little white curtain had been blown on one side. The window looks into the street. The bed and pillows were put up against the parlour window, which was down, they prevented any person from looking into the room. A person in the parlour could get into the street out of the window.</p>

            . I live next door to the prisoner. I saw his wife about one o'clock on the night she died; she came to my house, I was in bed - She was sober. Soon after my husband came home. As I looked out, I saw a man lying on the step of the prisoner's door; I also saw the prisoner and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Desmond, and two or three other men-Mrs. Evans was holding the candle in the passage. One of the men laid hold of the prisoner's collar on each side, they appeared to be quarrelling - I went home. Next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, Williams came to me for a key, which he took to the prisoner; be brought it back. I went to the prisoner, between ten and eleven o'clock, he was lying across the bed crying. I said, I hoped his wife was not dead - He said, "Yes, she is." I asked how she had been, and said I hoped he had done nothing to her; he said he could not tell, but he thought he had beat her. I said, "I hope you have not struck her with any thing?" (I believe I mentioned the poker) - He said, he did not think he did; he said he could not tell what he was about. I asked him what he did to her after beating her? he said he left her in that room, and went to bed. I was then standing between the two doors, I was not in the sitting-room. He said, when he got up, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, his wife said to him, "My dear, put me to bed." He said, "You shall not go to bed in that condition, however;" that he took her up, put her on a chair, stripped her, washed her all over, put her on a clean shift, and put her to bed; that she complained that her feet were cold; he said he took a warm brick from behind the fire, wrapped it up, and put it to her feet; that he made her a warm cup of tea, and offered it to her to drink, but she could not swallow it, and that it all came up again. I said, "Why did you not call somebody in, when you found she was so bad? "He said, he did not know what he did; he was locked in, and could not get out. The front-room floor appeared to have been lately washed, it was not quite dry - She was dead, and quite cold. I went and fetched Mrs. Madden. The deceased appeared to have a shalw over her head; when I went in a second time she had a cap on - We both went home. Between twelve and one o'clock the prisoner sent for me - I went; Mrs. Hitchlow was there. He asked me to lay his wife out - We did not. The prisoner came to me the same evening, between seven and eight o'clock. My husband told me I had better go, and help Mrs. Jones and her daughter, to lay the deceased out - I went. I asked the prisoner for a wash-hand bason. Mrs. Jones pulled the cloth down, and held the candle; the prisoner was in the front room. Mrs. Jones wiped her over, she did not appear to want washing, as she was quite clean. The body laid quite straight on its back-the arms were black and blue, and down to her knees. I saw no cuts-the marks appeared to be fresh made. There was a cap on her head. Mrs. Jones took her right ear-ring out, the other was gone. There appeared to be a blow on her temple, and on the side of her head, over the left eye, it looked black. On the Monday morning my husband brought me a bundle, and told me to wash it for the prisoner. I never washed for him before-it smelt very offensively. There were three petticoats, a shift, a pair of stays, a gown, an apron, a cap, and the ribbon which the cap was tied with, an odd stocking of the prisoner's, a half neck handkerchief, and a pocket handkerchief. I did not examine them, but put them all into a pan, and poured a pail of water over them - They remained there three hours. When I took them out, the water looked red like blood, the cap looked more bloody than the others; it being white, made me notice it more than the others. There were two or three holes in the cap, as if it had been cut. They were wrapped up in the wet and dirt just as they were-At night the prisoner himself gave me a bundle, which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180016"></xptr>gave to Webb. I went out on Sunday morning, at daybreak, passed the prisoner's window between six and seven o'clock, and saw, through the holes in the shutter, that there was a light there. I saw the deceased intoxicated on Christmas-day, and the day after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he would have got medical assistance if he had not been locked in - A. Yes.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's house to lay out the body of his wife. Her arms were bruised; there was a cap on her head, I moved it on one side to get her earring out, and noticed the left ear being very muchbruised. It was a clean cap, tied round with a handkerchief, which also tied up her mouth. I told my daughter to ask the prisoner for another cap. When I laid hold of her head, I found some blood in my hand, which came from the back of her head. I asked the prisoner if, when he put the cap on her head, he perceived any cut? He said, No. I said, there must be a cut, or where could the blood come from? he said there must. I have known the deceased fifteen or sixteen years, they lived on very good terms - She was a sober woman.</p>

            . I am an undertaker, and live in Tufton-street, Westminster. On the 11th of January the prisoner and Davis, came to me between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw he was in trouble, and asked how mistress was? he said she was very well, and that he had left her at home in bed-Davis gave me to understand that she was dead. When he came into my room, he said his wife was dead, and asked me to bury her; I said, yes. He told me that he had observed death in her face for several days past, that she had latterly taken to drinking; he said she died from excessive drinking, and had a very short illness. Davis gave me a string, with the length of the corpse, and said he brought it to save me the trouble of going. The prisoner asked me if I could get it coffined by Monday, I said, yes. - I fixed to bring it home at seven o'clock in the evening. I went with my man to take it. and got into the court about eight o'clock, the door was opened immediately, before we knocked-the prisoner and Davis were in the front room. On the shroud being put on I observed the forehead looked black. When I put her into the coffin there was blood on the bolster where she had laid. I went to the prisoner, he was trembling, and asked him when he meant to bury her? - he said, on Friday, he believed. I was surprised at seeing the blood, and meant to go to the searchers', but he was apprehended before I could go.</p>

            . I am a constable of Westminster. I received information, and went to the prisoner's house about a quarter after ten o'clock on the Monday evening - He let me in; I asked him if that was the apartment where the corpse laid, he said it was. I told him, from information. I had received, I came to make some enquiry about it, and said I wished to see the corpse. I asked him if he had had any words with his wife? He said he had been out on Saturday night and got very tipsy, and when he came home a women and two or three Irishmen were in the passage, that they had some words about opening the door, and that one of the persons had made a representation to him of some improper connection of his wife's. That he had some words with his wife when he went into his room, and that he struck her a blow on her mouth with his hand. I asked him if he struck her with anything else? he said he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he had done. I asked him if he got any medical assistance, he said, no. I asked why? he said the woman up stairs had locked him in, and he could not get out. I told him he could have opened the window and called out; I believe he made no answer-the window would lift up, I tried it. I observed some blood on the mantle-piece, and took a candle, looked, and saw blood about every part of the wainscot, it appeared as if it had been splashed on the wall. There was a great deal of blood on the handles of the drawers in the front room, and blood on the floor. There was the appearance of blood stains, and three places covered with sand, which appeared to have been washed out. There was some blood on the bed-room, at the foot of the bed, and on the wainscot on both sides-the blood on the wainscot and part of the drawers appeared to have been washed-the highest spot was seven feet and two inches from the ground-there were a great many spots; the room is about seven feet by twelve wide. I asked him why he had washed it off - He said he thought it looked better. The fender, poker and shovel had blood on them-the poker was bent - I produce it. I found a pair of woman's boots on the chair, the bows have something like blood on them. I asked him where the deceased's clothes were; he said he did not know. Mr. Davis gave me some things. I took the prisoner into custody. I returned and examined the body, it was in a dreadful state, the hair was all matted with blood-there were three distinct places where I could see the scull bare, and nearly put the length of my finger in, the cuts were at the back of the head; there was one on the left side of the temple, besides. I should not think they could be occasioned by a fall. I suppose one of them must have been done by falling against the drawer handle. There were no blows in the face. I found a pan in the room, which had blood in it. There were marks of blood visible on the floor so late as Tuesday last.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did her hair appear to be washed-No; the blood on the drawer handle appeared to me to have been washed, but it was visible on the mouldings.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM JENNINGS. I am an apothecary. I never practised as a surgeon. I live in King-street, Soho, and am employed by the parish. On Wednesday the 14th of January, I examined the body of the deceased. On lifting it out of the coffin I found three cuts on the back of the head, one about two inches long, the others two and a half - They must have been made with some blunt instrument; I put my finger on the length of the orifice, but could not reach the length of it, it was two inches long. I examined the second, I could not reach the end of that with my finger. There was a bruise on the left temple, the skin was taken off, it appeared to have been done with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180017"></xptr>same instrument as the others-there was no intentation; the whole of the forehead was discoloured from one temple to the other. There was a blow across the wrist which appeared to have been inflicted with the same instrument. The skin was off the inside of the knee, for about the size of a dollar; I should think the poker a very likely thing to have inflicted the wounds, it would have cut the scull if it had not been for the hair. She had a great quantity of hair. The scull was not fractured.</p>

                  <persName id="t18180218-37-person247">Q. </persName>
            Were any of these injuries sufficient, of themselves, to have caused death - A. I think the blow on the temple sufficient to have caused death; I am of opinion that the other blows would have helped it, but of themselves I should not think them sufficient to cause death - They might have occasioned a concussion of the brain. I attended the opening of the body, with Mr. Carpuc, that evening, the brains were perfect, the stomach was empty, and there was some inflammation in the intestines.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing in these symptoms to induce you to alter the opinion you at first formed of the cause of her death - A. No; I cannot tell what to attribute the inflammation in the intestines to-that could not produce sudden death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the inflammation such as might have been instantly produced by acts of violence - A. I think so; it could be produced by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the effusion of blood from the wounds be considerable - A. It must. My opinion still is, that the blow on the temple was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person248">Q. </persName>
            That opinion you entertain, although the brain was quite sound - A. Yes. Mr. Carpue is a man of great science and celebrity.</p>
               <p>JAMES CARPUE, ESQ. I am a surgeon, and live in Dean-street, Soho. On the Wednesday after the death I opened the body; I consider the wound of the integuments of no great consequence; as I have patients who have recovered from wounds apparently as bad. The hair was mostly matted. I examined the scull, there was no fracture on the external part, which induced me to have it opened. I examined the internal, there was no fracture or laceration there, nor any division of the dura mater from the scull, nor any extravasation of blood; which induced me to examine the other coverings of the brain-there was none there, or in any part of the head; a blow on the temple is no more than a blow on any other part of the head, provided no injury is done to the internal parts. Not being perfectly satisfied, I examined the body; I found the stomach empty, and at least one yard of the small intestines in a high state of inflammation. I did not examine any more, being satisfied that she died either from this inflammation, or from the wounds on the head; but I think it was from the inflammation of the intestines. I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to be afflicted with the inflammation of the bowels before she received the blows, are you of opinion that the wounds might have increased the inflammation, or the blood that she lost from them - A. I should think the blood she lost the only method of cure; the inflammation was not likely to cause sudden death, but I should think that half that inflammation would have killed any body; she might have died from the blows, but there was inflammation enough to cause her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the blows be likely to produce a degree of irritation on the intestines - 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person249">A. </persName>
            Certainly not; the blows would not increase the inflammation. The inflammation must have been going on for a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. May not blows be so violent as not to produce internal appearance, and yet cause death - 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person250">A. </persName>
            Concussions seldom produce sudden death-it generally produces nausea at the stomach.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not possible for a person in such a weak habit receiving a blow, to die under it, although they might recover, if a skilful person was called in to attend on them - A. If there was a considerable degree of debility; I should not expect it in a person who was able to be about their ordinary occupations.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that, from the state of the intestines of the deceased, that she would be able to be about her ordinary occupations - A. Not well; she must be in dreadful pain; if she had been drinking the night before, it might have occasioned the inflammation. The discolouration of the forehead must have been produced by blows, but they were not mortal. There was a great quantity of inflammation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my counsel.</p>

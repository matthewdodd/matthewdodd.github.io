            , Esq. (Produces it); the acceptance is in red ink; I hesitated some time before I took it, at last I told the prisoner I had not the difference in cash, but I would send it to him the next morning; he said he must have it directly, for he was ordered away to Portsmouth, and must go away the next morning by four o'clock; I still hesitated, but at length I gave him six pounds in Bank-notes, and a check for six pounds three shillings and eight-pence, upon Sir Robert Herries, who is my banker; he then went away, but gave me a direction to No. 6, Cavendish-square; I sent my shopman, Nettleship, up to Cavendish-square the moment he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; the next morning I sent my son to Mr. Bond's, the bankers, he is not here; I called some time afterwards, I cannot say when, and they disavowed the acceptance, and refused to pay the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you endorsed it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do Messrs. Bonds live? - A. In Change-alley, they are bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other persons besides them under that firm? - A. I know of none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I suppose you have taken no great pains to inquire whether there are any other persons of that firm? - A. I have looked at the list of bankers, and I have asked several people, but I have not heard of any others; I inquired of Mr. Pattisall, acting clerk in Messrs. Bond's house; I made great search after the prisoner, and he was apprehended about fourteen days ago, from information that I had received that he went into the Swan, in Paradise-row, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take a constable with you? - A. No; I did not consider him as a felon, and therefore I thought it not necessary; I did not find him then; I gave information round Chelsea, being pretty well known there, and he was apprehended by a soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Nettleship is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your son is not here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. I see the bill is dated Portsmouth; have you any person from Portsmouth here? - A. No.</p>

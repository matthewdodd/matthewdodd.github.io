            . I am churchwarden of St. Pancras, Soper-lane. On the 14th of December, the prisoner came to me for relief; I knew her by having relieved her before. I asked on what pretence she asked relief; she said she belonged to the parish - I gave her 14 s. as a month's allowance, at 3 s. 6 d., a week. On the 29th, I found I was imposed on.</p>

            . I am master of the workhouse of St. Olave, Hart-street. The prisoner came to me on the 29th of December, saying she was very ill, and must have money, and claimed assistance as one of our parishioners. I took her to the churchwarden; she had a written order into the poor-house; she sat herself down on the step of the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here I will sit till twelve o'clock tonight, but I will have money - I want money, and I will have it." I took her to Mr. Gould, who gave her in charge. I know that in 1819, she was removed from Whitechapel parish to St. Oalve's, Hart-street; she was a settled inhabitant of that parish. I was present at the Mansion-house when she signed her examination.</p>

               <p>(A deposition made by the defendant, in which she swore herself entitled to a settlement in St. Olive's, Hart-street, was here read.)</p>

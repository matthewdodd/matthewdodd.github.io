                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper, and live at 20, Turner's-square—on Sunday night, 28th August, about 11.15, I went to the "George" public-house, at the corner of Goodman's-yard, Whitechapel—there were five sol<lb></lb>diers there, the prisoners are two of them—I asked them if they would have a pot of beer, which they did, and then Grover asked me to fill it again—I paid for ten pots of beer between five soldiers, four girls, and myself—I left about half-past twelve—I then had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in my trouser's pocket, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my waistcoat pocket—I left with Elizabeth Cook, leaving the five</p>

               <p>soldiers outside the public-house with three girls—Grover then came up to me, and said, "Are you going to Whitechapel with me?" I said, "I do not mind"—the three girls turned back—I thought there was something up, and did not go with them—I sat down with the girls, and Grover struck me on the mouth, and Gearing also—I felt a hand in my pocket where the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in silver had been, but there was no money in there then—I had taken it out, and the landlord saw me put it into my breast pocket—he told me that I was getting into <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> company—one who is not here put his hand to my throat, Gearing then struck me, and <hi rend="italic">down I goes</hi>—I was knocked down a second time, and then I missed the money from my waistcoat pocket—I took Gearing by the collar, and gave him in charge, but the policeman would not take the charge, he said that there was so much noise he did not know anything about it—I was quite sober—I saw Gearing next morning coming from Whitechapel into Leman-street—he was on one side and I on the other—I held my finger up for him to come over to me, which he did, and said, 'I am very sorry for what happened last night"—I said, "I will give you a pot of beer to tell me where your other mates are, you are the man who insulted me, and struck me"—he was going to strike me, and I did not say anything about his being one who had robbed me—he said that he had not seen his comrades since last night—I was taking him to the station, and three policemen came up and took him, and then he bumped my nose with his head, and made it bleed.</p>

I live at 1, Bell-place, Battersea-row, Whitechapel—on Friday night, 28th August, I went with Stephens to the "George" public-house to have a pot of beer—we left there about half-past 12—I was outside the door, but I did not leave till Stephens came back to me—he then went a little way in the street, and then Grover knocked him down, he struck him, put his hand over his mouth, and had him by the throat, and then he let him go, and the other prisoner came and struck him. in the eye—I halloed "Police" and "Murder"—I saw Gearing with both his hands in Stephens's pockets—I saw no money—I kept hallooing "Murder"—there were five round him—I was struck down by a crack on the head, and a policeman was struck down twice on top of me by the prisoners—I do not know whether that policeman is here—he was there just after the robbery was done—Stephens got the soldier by the neck, and gave him in charge, but instead of taking him they took me—I was as sober as I am now, and so was Stephens.</p>

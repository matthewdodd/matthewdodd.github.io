                  </hi>. I am a hot-presser, and live in Wilson-street, Finsbury. I am in the habit of pressing goods for Mr. Carr—on the 7th of April, a man brought some horse-hair cloth to my premises; he said he brought it from Mr. Boon, a chair-maker, in Soho—I had heard Mr. Carr had lost some—I looked at it, and thought I recognised it as belonging to him—I took it to Mr. Carr's and left it, and they sent it back—I arranged with Brannan the officer, that he should come the next night, or the night after, when I expected Colney, the man who brought it to my house, would call again—he did call, and was asked into my back parlour—Brannan was there—in the course of conversation I learned something about Mr. Boon—I saw Mr. Boon, and had some conversation with him—I heard something about the prisoner, and I and Mr. Boon went to the prisoner's house on Friday evening, 9th of April—he was not at home—we waited till he came in—Mr. Boon had pointed to a man named Holborn in the prisoner's hatter's shop, and</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Thames Ditton, and am a lighterman—on Tuesday morning, 21st January, I was in charge of a barge towing through Kew Bridge attached to another barge ahead of me—I saw the prisoner and another boy in a small boat, which they had stolen away; they had no sculls, and had broken a board in halves to paddle with—I heard the man the boat belonged to hallooing to them to bring it back—they tried to make fast the boat to the first barge, the man would not let them, and they made fast to mine, at the forepart; I told them to bring the boat to the stern, as it was easier for the horses to tow—the prisoner was saucy, and said, "You old——, I shall tow where I like"—I said, as he was say, he should not tow at all—he had attached the boat to the painter, I got a broom to let it go—the prisoner said, "If you let the head go, you old——, I will blow your brains out," and he took up a gun as he sat in the boat—I did let her go, and he said, "Let me get a little further off, and you shall have it"—I left the spot, and went towards the cabin, and as I was going down the cabin ladder he fired at me; one shot struck me above the nose, one under the nostril, one under the thumb, and one on the lip.</p>

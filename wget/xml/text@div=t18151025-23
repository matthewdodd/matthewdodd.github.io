            . The prisoner used to come to see her; I had seen him there three or four times. On the evening of the 10th of this month, I was at Mrs. Crompton's house; my mistress was not at home; Sally was also gone out. I was in the house by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Sally been gone out - A. She went out between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening were you called to the door - A. At about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that came to the door - A. It was; he asked if Sarah was at home? I told him she was not. He then said, she had told him, if she was not at home when he called, to wait until she came in: upon that, I asked him down into the kitchen. He sat there a very few minutes, before I said, I was going to shut up the house, and he said, he would go with me, and help me. We went into the parlour, where the plate was, and shut up the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate was there - A. I don't now exactly recollect; the plate was on the table, in something of a tray; there were some gravy-spoons there, there were some sauce-ladles, a sugar sifter, table spoons, tea spoons, silver forks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these in the parlour when you went in with the prisoner - A. Yes; I had cleaned them all myself, and put them into the tray that day. My mistress did not dine at home that day. We then went into the kitchen, and after that, I went up stairs to see after the drawing-room fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it then become dark - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were up stairs, what then - A. When I came down, the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been up stairs - A About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut the street door after you let the prisoner in - A. Yes, I was sure the street door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then - A. I was very uneasy, and stood still for a few minutes; then I went into the parlour; I missed the plate, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. All - A. No; the greater part of it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The tray then, and some part were left behind - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, all this time, had there been any other person in the house but the prisoner - A. Yes; a porter had come and sat a box down in the hall, and then went away again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house after you had shut the shutters - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon missing the plate what did you do - A. I put the candle down, and stood at the gate; I was very much surprised, and frightened; the first person I saw was Mr. Butterfield; I communicated this to him. I know no more, except I was taken to the police office to identify the plate.</p>

            . On the 11th of this month, I saw the prisoner at the bar, whom I knew, in Tottenham-court-road. I had heard of the robbery. I saw him go into a pawnbroker's; I followed him in, and asked him if his name was not James Moorehouse? he denied his name a dozen times and more to me. I said to him, it is very strange you don't know your neighbours. I then asked him, if he knew that good woman, (pointing to my wife, who was at the door) he said, no; he had not the least knowledge. I then asked the young man in the shop, what property he wanted to leave; that moment, the prisoner ran out of shop, over a basket of linen; I followed him directly; I brought him back; when I brought him back, he acknowledged that he knew me. I said, why not know me before? he said,</p>
               <p>"a guilty conscience wants no accuser." He then put his hand in his pocket, and said, I will give up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250012"></xptr>to your care, all that I have about me; the first thing he gave me was a one-pound note; and then a quantity of plate that he had not made away with; he then gave me as much as three pounds one shilling and sixpence in silver, and fourpence in copper, and said, that was every thing material he had about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, tell us all that was found on the prisoner - A. I took an inventory of it; there were four silver forks, two sauce ladles, one silver fish slice, a silver sugar sifter, four gilt egg spoons, one salt spoon, a one-pound note, three pounds one shilling and sixpence in silver, and four-pence in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the worth of that - A. Why, about fifteen pounds altogether.</p>

Walter looked at a gown piece, and presently she pulled out some plaid handkerchiefs, and looked at them, they were hanging inside the door. They remained there about a quarter of an hour; I stood close to the prisoners; I heard Walter say to Fowle, it would not do yet. Fowle said, you know best; she said, stop a bit. Fowle frowned, and Walter said, as I was looking at them, it was one shilling and nine-pence a-yard; then my friend stepped over to me; she said, has that man bought any thing out of the shop; I said, no; she said, the man has walked off with the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your friend was not standing with you - A. No, she was on the opposite side of the way; the man went away, and the woman stopped to see if any one went after them; I went into the shop and asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing; they looked to see what they had lost, and they missed a piece of handkerchiefs that hung at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Walter remain while they were searching, or go away - A. She remained; she stood round the corner of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When they searched and found one of the pieces were gone, did any body go after them - A. Yes, Mr. Davis, the manager of the business, and I went with him; we apprehended the woman, but the man made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend the the woman - A. In Long Acre; she went into a gin shop; we watched her out, in hopes we should find the man. We watched her some distance from the gin-shop, she perceived we were watching her; she did not go the same way as the man; then Mr. Davis took her; she was searched, but no property was found on her. When the woman had her hearing at Bow-street this man was brought in, I knew him again, I am certain he is the man. I never lost sight of the woman from the time that I first saw her untill she was taken.</p>

We first saw the prisoners at the top of Newport market; we followed them to Mr. Craig's; after being sometime at Mr. Craig's they separated, and after they separated I saw the man with the handkerchiefs; before they separated he had nothing, nor she neither; the man went towards Newport-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And where was he when you perceived him with the handkerchiefs - A. Just beyond the linen-drapers shop: she was with him at that time, and I saw him tucking the handkerchiefs under the top part of his coat. The woman stopped to see if any of the gentlemen of the shop were looking after them; we gave the alarm. I saw Walters taken.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 25th of March had you a piece of handkerchiefs at the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mrs. Walsh and the other witness coming in - A. Yes, and I looked where the handkerchiefs hung, I missed them immediately; they were buff plaid handkerchiefs, I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before that.</p>
               <p>Q. You pursued and took Mrs. Walter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the handkerchiefs again - A. No. Fowle was brought to the office at seven o'clock at her examination, the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fowle seem to know Walter - A. No, they seemed to be strange to each other. I catched Walter in Great Russell-street, Covent Garden. When I came to the door she stood by the door, and when she walked away I followed. I thought she might go into a house, and I might catch the man and her together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walter. Q. I asked Mr. Davis the price of some linen, he told me it was one shilling and nine pence a-yard - A. You did, and when I asked you to walk in you withdrew, and about two minutes after you withdrew Mrs. Walsh came in and asked me if I had sold her any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fowle, Q. to Mrs. Walsh. What time did you see me there - A. I believe, about four.</p>
               <p>Walters' Defence. As I was returning from Oxford-road this person talked with me, as I was walking along I stopped at the house of Mr. Craig, I asked that gentleman what the print was a yard; from that I went into St. Martin's court, and returned back again. I heard a person say, that is the woman. I was taken in Russell-street, I willingly went back with him.</p>
               <p>Fowle's Defence. The woman is quite a stranger to me. I was at home at my dinner by three o'clock; I was not in Newport-street that day.</p>

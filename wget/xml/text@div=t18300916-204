            . I live at Enfield-highway. I had a house in <placeName id="t18300916-204-crimeloc1038">Chapel-street, Spitalfields</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long did the prisoner occupy the house? A. From the latter end of May till the 1st of March; all I got for rent was four guineas - the value of these things was from six to eight pounds; he asked me if I should have any objection to his making improvements - I said I could have no objection to that; he said he was going to make a place to put scaffolding boards in - I never saw him making alterations; I did not say he might make what alterations he pleased - he said he was going to make a shed in the yard; he let the house out in lodgings.</p>

            . I am a basket-maker. I lodged in that house - I saw the prisoner pull up the grating over the area, pull the partition down, and take the bricks away; I did not see him take down the shutters, but he made a show-board for his son with the partition, to put out in the street - it was taken from the premises, but I do not know who took it; the bricks were taken away by the prisoner, in a basket, and lifted on a labourer's shoulder - I do not know when the shutters went, but I think they were gone before; the prisoner lived there till March, and the things might have gone a month or two before - in my judgment the removal of these things could not have been any improvement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might be a month or two before he left? A. Yes - the bricks were removed between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the partition was pulled down in the middle of the day.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I repaired the house before the prisoner went in; I saw it after he was gone - the grating was then up, the partition down, and the chimney in the wash-house down, the tiles of the wash-house partly off, and the gutter gone.</p>

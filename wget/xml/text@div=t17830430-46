               <p>I was in the shop last of all, I went up stairs to the garret, and made my bed at Mr. Hatch's house, where I have worked five or six years; the next morning I found two empty bobbins under the bed, I locked the door being last up, and put the stone up; and then I came over after, to assist in taking the prisoner; we went up into the garret, and found him; I found these two empty bobbins under the bed, which had our master's name on them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who had known him, one for twenty and the other for thirty years, and each gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen the crime of burglary which is here charged upon the prisoner, consists, either in breaking into a house and actually stealing or breaking into a house with intention to steal; and whether the party has that intention or not is to be collected from the circumstances given before you in evidence, the entering by a false key is as much a breaking, as if he had broke the door all to pieces; this offence must be made out in all its circumstances, in order to constitute a crime at all, being burglary, with intent to steal; the question is, whether he broke into this room in the night time, and it will be a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300099"></xptr> burglary, or not, acording to the intention and view, with which he did it, if he did it with an intention to steal, then it is burglary; it is a case which certainly borders very much upon the point where the offence of burglary begins, and were it one step within, it would not be burglary: It is an offence of a serious nature to the master of this house, for perhaps these kind of burglaries are more serious than those that are more violent; and the extent of the mischief of those more violent ones, is very often much less considerable.</p>

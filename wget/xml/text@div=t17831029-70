I was jostled into the crowd the day of the execution of the Portugueze, and I felt a twitch from my pocket, I could not see who it was. I did not miss it till I got to school. I have got my watch again; it was pawned with Mr. Windsor.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner. On the 30th of July a watch was brought, but I am not sure it was the prisoner that brought it. I lent two guineas on it; it was pawned in the name of William Hall. The next morning I saw a warning of the watch, and I took it to Mr. House the watch-maker, and he took me to Mr. Allen, and I delivered the watch to Allen, and told him, if the person should come again, I would stop him. On the 9th of October last, this man came with the duplicate for the watch; I asked him if he was not the person that brought it, he said yes; he said, if you remember, Sir, when I brought it, I told you that my room was broke open, and I had been robbed of every thing I had, and therefore I was obliged to get money on my watch; which words I remember were said when the watch was brought.</p>

               <p>Where was he when the prisoner bought it of him? - At the cock in the Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>How came you to be there? - He made a pair of shoes for me, and a pair for my cousin. The watch was in pawn, and the prisoner was to by it of my cousin, and he went to fetch it out: he gave him two guineas for the watch, to fetch it out, and two guineas and an half he lent him; then there was half a guinea due to the prisoner, that made five shillings over, and that five shillings he promised to pay him the first opportunity: my cousin was gone about a quarter of an hour to fetch it out: he gave him to the amount of five pounds in all for the watch.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two other Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. The words of this statute are privately and without the knowledge of the party. Now, you observe, the prosecutor said he did feel a twitch. This girl has fixed upon a time, when it was impossible for Dickinson to have the watch, for the pawnbroker could not be deceived. Now, if on the 30th of July this was in the hands of Hall, it could not be in the hands of Dickinson in August; but if her story is true, and she should have mistaken the time by accident, you will judge of that. I cannot but say she seems to tell her story without any confusion in her countenance, for I observed her.</p>

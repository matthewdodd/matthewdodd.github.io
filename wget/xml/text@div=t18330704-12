            . I live with Mr. Fairlam a pawnbroker in Lisson-grove. On the 28th of May, the witness, Jones, brought a piece of linen to the shop, about nine o'clock in the morning - I asked whose it was, he said his own, and he had had it from a young man who had been living at a linen-draper's near the Bank - I asked what he gave for it, he said one shilling and sixpence a yard, and he lived at No. 8, Salisbury-street - having a suspicion that all was not right, I went out to go to Salisbury-street - he called me back and said if I would go to Duke's Mews, I should find a person named Dyke, at a wheelwrights - I took an officer and went there - they said they knew Dyke, but he was not there; they recommended me to go to another mews - we went there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040032"></xptr>but he was not there; we came back and met the prisoner - he said to us, "Who do you want?" - the officer said Dyke - he said "I am the man" - I asked him an go to our shop; and in going along he said, "The linen is mine, it is all right" - I said, "Yours is it, the young man says it is his own, and it cost one shilling and sixpence a yard, and in my opinion it is worth two shillings and sixpence or two shillings and ninepence" - the prisoner said, "Oh, no, it is mine, I gave two shillings and ninepence a yard for it;" he went to our shop and was taken to the office - I did not ask the prisoner where he bought it to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The prisoner did not deny that it was his? A. No, and he said he was the person we wanted.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright. I have known the prisoner three months by his coming to the shop where I work, with Mr. Hollis in Duke's Mews - the prisoner brought the linen to the shop, and asked me to take it to pawn for him - I took it and Mr. Swaine stopped me with it; the prisoner was going to grind his scythe when I went away, and he told me to say it was mine, and that I gave one shilling and sixpence a yard for it - I told the pawnbroker so, and at last I told the truth where I got it.</p>
               <p>JOHN LANARGAN (Police-constable, D 49). I took the prisoner, and have the linen - when Mr. Swaine asked him where he got the linen, he said he could make it all right, he had had it in his possession three months.</p>

            , and perhaps he sealed it - we look over the goods that are bought, and to the best of my belief, this is our piece of cloth - other pieces of cloth might have number twenty-six on them, but not the same seal perhaps - I cannot swear that I had seen this piece of cloth previous to the 3rd of April - it is worth about 2l. 3s. 4d. with the other, but worth three pounds to another person.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Cant; we live at No. 5, Crawford-street. On the 3rd of April three pieces of cloth were bought of the prosecutor, but the prisoner only brought two, and one piece of muslin - I did not look at the bill at the moment, but I saw afterwards that there were three pieces of cloth on the bill, and I sent my daughter the next morning to say we had had only two places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say it was all right? No; he said he brought the parcel from Mr. Morley's - I said "Clap it down;" the invoice was struck in it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you not see the invoice at the time? A. No, not till next morning - he brought them just as we were shutting-up; not soul entered afterwards - the next morning I found there were only two pieces.</p>

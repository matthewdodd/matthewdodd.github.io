             sworn. - Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being at the last witness's house on the 19th of April? - A. Yes; I saw him take the flitch of bacon out of the door, and Tracey kept talking to Marr; I told Marr he had got his bacon; Marr went after him, and Tracey called him back; it was near half an hour before he was brought back, I saw the prisoner go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Marr.) How long was it before you took the prisoner? - A. About a dozen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got home? - A. Yes, before I took him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Murray.) Did you think he had bought it or stole it? - A. That he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. No, my leg was unshifted. (The witness had a wooden leg.) I called out to Marr, and told him to go after him; when we went to his room, he knocked me and Marr down stairs; I saw the bacon afterwards in Tracey's house.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; I took him in his own room, in company with two other watchmen; we searched his house, we found there was no bacon; he was quite stupidly drunk, I think he was not capable of bringing the bacon, he was quite drunk.</p>

             sworn. - I was at Marr's on the 19th of April; I do not think he could carry a flitch of bacon if it was ever so; the prisoner was ordered to go for a pot of beer, he was rather intoxicated at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any bacon? - A. No, he did not; I stood by the prosecutor all the time, and he was in the shop all the time; I heard him perjure himself at Marlborough-street, first he swore that he saw the man carry the bacon out of the house, and then he said he did not.</p>

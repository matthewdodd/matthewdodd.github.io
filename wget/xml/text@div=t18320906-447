On the 8th of September the prisoner and another came, and asked to look at some gauze ribbons; I placed a box on the counter before them; both took up different pieces, what I call crosshanded; I replaced them as quick as possible, and observed a vacancy - I observed the prisoner's left arm confining her shawl, and saw a projection; she moved to the other side of her companion - I opened her shawl, and took this piece of ribbon from under it; I jumped over the counter - her companion said, "What have you been doing, how could you think of such a thing?" they were both taken to the station - her companion was discharged, on promising to attend at Bow-street at eight o'clock, to produce the pattern of a ribbon they had bought before, but she never came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. You did not see her take it? A. No; she conducted herself otherwise very properly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young woman in Drury-lane, who asked me to go with her; she looked at several ribbons, and told me to look at this piece at the door; the shop being dark I did so, then came back, and laid it on the counter - she saw none she liked; I took it up again to see if she would have it, and the gentleman snatched it out of my hand; he said I wanted to rob him, and he would make me suffer for all.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALKER. I said I recollected her being there a few days before when I lost a piece of ribbon, and suspected her, and now she must suffer for all; I had missed this ribbon two or three minutes before I took it from under her shawl.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

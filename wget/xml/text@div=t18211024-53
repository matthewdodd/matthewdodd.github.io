            . I was in Whitechapel near Mrs. Fox, I was passing her when I saw the prisoner turn her round, she was walking along - he turned her round, and made a snatch at something, I could not see what; I was about ten yards off - he ran towards me, Mrs. Fox called Stop thief! I did not see any thing fall from him; a gentleman crossed the road, and stopped him, he was taken in custody - I thought the lady picked up part of the chain, as I saw she had part of it in her hand.</p>

             I am a patrol. On the 24th of September, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw Juda, and another gentleman holding the prisoner, Mrs. Fox gave him in my charge, and said that is the man who robbed me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240030"></xptr>I searched him at the watch-house, but found nothing on him. I did not see him running.</p>

The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded, that as she was standing at the End of Windsor-Court, where she lodg'd, the Prosecutor came to her, and ask'd her to drink with him, that she did so; that he afterwards would go with her to her Lodging, and there he gave her 18 d. to lie with her, and afterwards a Shilling more; that she refusing to do so, the Prosecutor swore that he would swear she had robb'd him; and that when they were at the Round-house, the Prisoner being in Bed, he told her, if she would come to Bed to him, he would make it up with her.

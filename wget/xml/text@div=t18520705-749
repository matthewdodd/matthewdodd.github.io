Three weeks last Saturday the prisoner came to my shop, about eight o'clock in the morning—he brought this coat, which he offered for sale—he said it was his own private property, and I bought it—he came again in the evening, and brought this silk handkerchief and these ties for the neck—he said they were his own property—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he came again with a piece of black cloth; I did not buy that—this other handkerchief was in the pocket of the coat.</p>

On 25th June, I took the prisoner—I told him he was charged with stealing some wearing apparel of Clark's—he said he knew nothing about them—he pulled this pair of gloves out of his pocket, and tried to conceal them in his hand—I got the other things from Wearing.</p>

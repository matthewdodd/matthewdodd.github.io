               <p>Mrs. Hulman. Hearing that the Constable had taken the Prisoner, I went to the Ale-house where they were. The Prisoner told me, she never saw the Prosecutor before the last Thursday. I ask'd how she came to see him then, Why, says she, I was sitting upon the Steps at St. Clement's Church, and he spoke very kindly to me, and ask'd me, where I liv'd? I cry'd, and told him, I was run away from my Mother, who was a Basket Woman, and I had got the Itch. He said he won'd advise me how to get rid of the Itch, and ask'd me if I would go with him to clean his Rooms?</p>

            . The Prisoner and another came to me in Drury-lane, offer'd these two Shirts to pawn. She said she liv'd at St. Giles's Pound, and that her Landlady kept a Rag-shop. I bid her fetch her Landlady to justify what she said. She went out, but return'd again in a little time without her Landlady. Upon which, I sent for a Constable, who took her on Suspicion.</p>

            . The Prisoner is my Daughter. She did a Fault in going from me one Day, and then she met the Prosecutor, who entic'd her to go to his Rooms, under Pretence of cleaning them, but when she came there he had neither Mop, nor Broom, nor Pail; and when I talk'd with him about it, says he, I can't swear that the Things are mine, but the Constable has perswaded her to say that I dehauch'd her; and if I did, I am sure no Body did it before me, and she was not the first that I have serv'd so by a hundred. My Character is so well known, that I am not asham'd of lying with any Body.</p>

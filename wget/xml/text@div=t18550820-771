                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>. 573). About a quarter before 8 o'clock at night, on 27th July, I was on duty in Lombard-street—I passed Mrs. Collinson's shop, No. 35, Lombard-street, and saw the two prisoners in the workshop, which is under the shop—the shutters of the shop were up—in consequence of suspicion I watched about five or ten minutes, and saw the two prisoners come out; McAllister had a parcel under his arm, tied in this handkerchief—I stopped him in the street, and asked him what the parcel contained—he told me, a few old pieces of copper, the rakings and sweepings of the shop, which his master had given him leave to take away—Neale said, "Oh, that is all right, policeman"—I requested to look at the parcel, and found it contained some copper—I said, "You must go back with me to your master, and hear whether it is all right"—McAllister said, "We have no master, the business is carried on by two ladies"—they went back to the door, and I asked to see the ladies—they both made the reply that the ladies did not live there, they lived in the country—I then took the prisoners to the station in Mark-lane, and in going along I saw Neale drop from his left hand coat pocket, a small parcel over a grating of a sewer—it fell crossways, and did not go through—I picked it up, and it contained half a dozen spoons—these are them—I took the prisoners to the station house, and searched McAllister—I found in one of his pockets this piece of pewter and these four metal spoons, they are quite new, and in his other pocket these half dozen of spoons of the same kind—I found in the handkerchief this copper bent up, which forms a coal scuttle or part of a coal scuttle—I did not say anything to him or make him any promise, but he said, "We took the spoons, but the copper we had a right to"—"the other things," I believe, were his words—Neale was in hearing at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Elizabeth and Jane Collinson, at No. 35, Lombard-street—they are tin plate workers and ironmongers—the prisoners were in their employ under me—they worked in the warehouse under the shop—I left the shop about 6 o'clock that evening—the proper time for the men to leave was 7 o'clock—that is the usual time for shutting up—Neale has been upwards of twenty years in the employ, and McAllister about twelve months—I left the shop at 6 o'clock that night under the guidance of the nephew of the ladies, Edward Fancourt—his duty was to see the prisoners out, as I have always done—he is twenty-four or twenty<lb></lb>five yean old—there was one gentleman above me, Mr. John Watson, he is dead—he was the late foreman—I am foreman now, and have been so six or seven weeks—I have been in the employ seventeen year—we had such spoong as these in stock to the best of my belief, especially the tea spoons, they are the property of my employers—these pieces of copper would not be considered scrapings, decidedly not, nor bits that a man would be allowed to take away—the men would not be allowed to take anything without the permission of the foreman—since I have been there I got them to clean out the workshop, which was in a very dirty state, and under the benches were some pieces of old iron, which I allowed them to take away instead of giving them beer—but these things produced would not be allowed to be taken by anybody—no one would be allowed to take this solder, being costly metal—this piece is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

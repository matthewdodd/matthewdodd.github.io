                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at Burney Street, Greenwich—on Monday night, 21st April, about 11 o'clock, I was called to see the deceased—she was in great pain all over the abdomen, with her legs drawn up, the stomach was slightly swollen and the whole of the belly, and tender on pressure—there were no external marks of violence—she was in a cold sweat—I did not examine her that night, I did not understand that she had received any</p>

               <p>injury—I treated her for peritonitis—I saw her again the next morning, she was in about the same state—I went again about 6 in the evening; she was worse then, and again at 11, when she was a great deal worse; I was not there when she died—I thought when I saw her last she was dying—I made a post-mortem examination on the 23rd—I made a careful examination of the body externally—there was a bruise on the bridge of the nose—the brain and membranes were quite healthy—there was a slight adhesion of the lungs, but that had nothing to do with death—there was extensive inflammation of the whole of the peritoneum, that is the membrane which surrounds the bowels; in the peritoneum cavity there were flakes of lymph floating in the serum, with patches of lymph adhering to the intestines—the stomach, liver and other organs Were healthy—the inflammation was all over the peritoneum—the conclusion I came to was, that she died from acute peritonitis, but how it was caused I could not say; it might have been caused by a blow—kicks in the stomach would have caused such inflammation, death generally takes place, if it is fatal, in three to five days from the commencement—I have been a number of years in the profession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave her opiates when I saw her, and I afterwards ordered an injection—the inflammation may have been the result of natural causes—and there was nothing within or without the subject to lead me to a different conclusion—if a kick was administered at a particular part you might have the inflammation at that spot, but in this instance it extended over the whole.</p>

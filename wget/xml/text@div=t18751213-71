In "Reg. v. Gray" which was an indictment, charging, a stealing, the word "feleniously" having been omitted the Court held that it could not be supported and the conviction was quashed; persons might combine to steal objects that were not matters of property, such as things that were ferae naturae.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMON SERJEANT</hi>: <hi rend="italic">There are two answers to this objection, first the Statute expressly provides that where an objection is taken to some defect on the face of the indictment which is in the nature of a demurrer, it must be taken before the Jury are sworn; and secondly I am of opinion that the indictment is not defective; the term "unlawfully" is not necessarily a term of art in describing a conspiracy, and when an indictment charges a conspiracy 'feloniously to steal' as this docs, it is perfectly plain that it must be an unlawful conspiracy; then it goes on to say that the subject of the larceny was</hi> (<hi rend="italic">certainly not ferae naturae</hi>) <hi rend="italic">but whiskey and brandy. The case cited does not govern this case: a conspiracy feloniously to steal is obviously an offence, although the word 'unlawfully' does not precede the word 'conspire.'

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Nicholson—there is a house on the right hand side of the entrance to the yard in St. John Street, in which the clerks live, and on the left hand side there are stables—I slept in the house on Friday night, 5th November; Mr. Heapy was also on duty there; he had charge of the keys that night—it is the practice for the keys of the gate and the warehouses to be left in charge of one of the clerks over night, and he has to give them to the first person who comes in the morning—Pateman was a housekeeper in the em<lb></lb>ploy, Sandford was under stableman, and Smith was engineer's labourer—on Saturday Morning, 6th November, I was aroused a little after 3.30 by the ringing of the bell at the end of the lauding; that rings from the side of the street door in St. John's Street—Mr. Heapy got up and went down-stairs to let the men in—he came and made a communication to me, and I dressed myself and went downstairs to the passage leading from the house into the yard; it was-dark—I heard footsteps coming from the direction of the yard gate towards the warehouse—there is a short passage and a flight of steps leading from the yard up to the outer and inner warehouse—be<lb></lb>tween the outer and inner warehouses there are some double iron doors—I waited in the passage, and saw a light in the window of the foreign ware-house, which is under the outer warehouse—I went into the yard and got under a waggon close by the passage door, from which I could see the door leading to the outer warehouse—a person came to that door from within; to the best of. my belief it was Sandford—I then went back to the house and stood behind the door; presently the yard bell rang, and I heard footsteps go towards the gate, and other footsteps returning in the direction of the warehouse door—I waited till the place was quiet, and then followed up</p>

               <p>into the warehouse—I walked across the warehouse, and got behind some casks; from there I could see the door leading to the inner warehouse—a long flight of steps on the right leads up to the cordial room, and on the left is the still room door—vats of spirits are kept in the inner warehouse—I heard some talking, apparently coming from the inner warehouse; I could not distinguish the voices—after two or three minutes Sandford, Finch,—and a policeman in uniform, came from the inner warehouse; Finch was, stoker at that time—Finch expressed a wish that the gas should be lighted; Sandford made some reply, I do not know what—they then went down the steps into the yard—shortly after Finch and Sandford came back and passed through the iron doors into the inner warehouse, and I heard footsteps going in the direction of the still room, and then I heard the still room door closed—Sandford afterwards came back, and went to the—top of the stairs leading to the foreign warehouse, exactly facing where I was—he called out "Below, all right, come along, put it up"—the witness Pedder then came—up the stairs, and Smith immediately followed—they appeared to be carry-in something—I then crept down behind the casks for a minute or so—the next I saw of them they were going in the direction of the yard—I then heard the yard bell ring—Smith called out "Here is Jack, the horsekeeper, with the van," and one of them went and opened the gate, and I heard the wheels of a van roll into the yard—just after that I heard something like a full cask being bumped from step to step down the steps leading to the yard, and I heard a creaking noise like a basket bottle being carried—I heard some one say "I will go and put back the keys," and I heard the sound of a door being locked, and then footsteps came up the foreign ware-house steps and went into the inner warehouse in the direction of the cordial-room, where the keys of the foreign warehouse are kept—I then went from behind the casks to the top of the stairs, from which I could see the stable loft opposite, and I saw Pateman, Smith, and Pedder—Pateman was in the—loft shovelling stuff into the van—I saw two men, one was in the van, I believe both were, but I am not sure; they seemed to be pushing the stuff about in the van, loading it—while I was standing on the steps observing this Saudford came behind me from the direction of the outer warehouse;—he put his face close to mine and said "Hallo!"—I said "What little game is this?"—I then ran down the stairs and went through the house to the street door, where I expected to find a detective—the door slammed behind me—I rang the house bell first and then the yard bell, I was outside nearly ten minutes—Mr. Heapy ultimately let me in at the house door—when I got back into the yard I found the van there—no one had come out of the yard while I was outside—I found Nicholls and Gorringe standing by the van, and Pateman still in the loft—when I first saw him in the loft there was a light there, there was no light there when I came back—I asked Nicholls and Gorringe what they had got in the van—they said only the sweepings and rubbish out of the loft—I said "You had something else a short time ago"—they said "We know nothing about it, if there was"—I remained about the yard till 6 o'clock—Gorringe then took the van away—. it was Stevens' duty to lock up the keys of the foreign warehouse in the cordial room at night, and on Saturday morning I went with him to the cordial room; the door was locked, and when he opened it the key of the foreign warehouse hung in its usual place—I took the key and opened the foreign warehouse, it was locked—brandy was kept in the foreign warehouse the still room communicates with the boilers—you can pass from where the</p>

Nicholson's—he said he knew nothing about it—I took Gorringe on the 11th and told him the charge—he said "I know nothing about it"—on the road to the station he said "It was my horse and van. I did not know there was anything wrong in it. It was very wrong of Nicholls to hire me if there was anything wrong. I have been there six or seven times and removed the rubbish, and previous to that a man named Haward did it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the will of Joseph Bradbeer—our house is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—on 11th March last I was awoke by a policeman at a quarter to 5 in the morning—on coming downstairs I found the parlour window broken—some person had entered; taken a coat, shawl, ten teaspoons, a dozen knives and forks, or it might have been more, and a curtain, which us attached to the window—I used some of the knives and forks at 10 o'clock the night before for supper—they were placed on the window-sill in a basket—the shawl and coat were hanging up behind the door on a peg—I have seen half a down teaspoons and three forks since—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I bought these two forks the day before, from a person next door—this one I have had ten years—this spoon I have had quite as long as the fork—those I bought of a man about three weeks before the robbery, and used them daily—I saw these things at a wardrobe shop facing the Victoria Theatre, where they buy second-hand clothes and different things—the forks were at a marine-store dealer's—I saw those on the same day as I saw the others; the Friday after the robbery—the curtain was with the spoons—this is my shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by having it dyed, and by the plaid I see in it—this is my curtain—I saw it the evening before the robbery—I fastened the window myself at a quarter-past 12, and bolted all the doors—no glass was broken at that time—I know the prisoner by his coming to my place and sleeping with his father—his father was a lodger for sixteen weeks—the prisoner was often to and fro during that time—the father often brought him to sleep there—I saw him frequently—he came to me last Friday, the 4th, and said that he had heard that I had lost these things; that he had bought them of a man and woman, and he felt very unhappy after he had heard they belonged to me, as I had been so kind to him and his father; and he came to give himself up, and hoped I would forgive him—I said I could not think of doing that, I wanted my shawl, which was a present, and I set great value on it—he said he would give me ten shillings to buy a new shawl.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Garratt, of 17, Webber-street, Southwark—we keep a marine-store shop—I saw the prisoner first at the station-house—I did not know him before then—I never saw him before 11th March—he came to me about that time, and said be had got some knives and forks to sell—I asked him if they were his own, and whether he got them honestly—he said, "Yes; particularly honest;" he was out of em<lb></lb>ployment, and he was very sorry that he had got them to sell; he was very sorry to do it—he said they were his—he asked me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those that I gave to the police are the same I had from him—I did not buy the curtain and the coat—this was about 11 o'clock in the morning.</p>

I have had four years' imprisonment, and twelve months for robbery, and ever since I came out of prison I have been at work. I believe this policeman can say that he has seen me coming from work at half-past 6 in the evening. I was working for Mr. Davis, and for a gentleman who is now in Horse-monger-lane. I have not associated with any bad characters. I turned over a new leaf twelve months before I came home. I gave myself up, I never had a better friend than Mrs. Bradbeer. My father bad been out of work sixteen weeks, and she kept him, aad she gave me victuals while I was in the hospital I saw Mr. Davis the other day, and he said be would give me a character.</p>

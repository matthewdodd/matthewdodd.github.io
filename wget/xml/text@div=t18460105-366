                  </hi>. I am cashier at the London and Westminster Bank. On Tuesday, the 16th of Dec, between three and four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, the prisoner came to the Bank, and presented a check for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it—I asked him from whom he brought it—he hesitated, and took it to look at, and on seeing the name of the payee in the body, he said he brought it from Mr. Bandier—I then asked if he brought it from the drawer, and who the drawer was—he evidently did not know—he hesitated, and said he did not bring it from the drawer, but from Mr. Bandier—I detained him, and gave him in charge—Dr. Qairdner, by whom the check purports to be drawn, keeps cash at our house—it is not his handwriting, but is something like it.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I live in Bolton-street, Piccadilly. In Dec. last I had an account with the London and Westminster Bank—this check is not my writing—I know nothing of it—all the checks in my book are num<lb></lb>bered 397—I have looked through my check-book, and miss one check—I hate compared this check with the book—the out does not correspond, it is torn away close to the binding—it is the same number as my checks—I do not know the prisoner—I usually keep my check-book in my drawer, but sometimes I am called away, and may leave it out on the table—I discharged a man-servant in June last.</p>

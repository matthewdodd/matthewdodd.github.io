                  </hi>. I am clerk to Benjamin Ingram, of No. 38, Beech Street, timber merchant The prisoner has been his foreman two years—it was his duty to effect Bales in the yard, to receive money, and bring it to the counting house to me, or Mr. Ingram—if we were not there,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140058"></xptr>
               <p>it was his duty to put it into the till, and make an entry on a slate at the same time of what he had sold, that I might transfer it to a book—I have my books here—here is no entry of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 4th July, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 16th July, or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 25th July, received from Mr. Taplin.</p>

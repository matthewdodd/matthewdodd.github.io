I went to my Lodgings at Knights-bridge, and found my Daughter was gone, and the Goods too. I went to her, to the Blue-ball and Horse-shoe in St. James's Street: she own'd her Marriage, and said the Goods were neither sold nor pawn'd, but were under her Care, and she would deliver them to me. My Daughter was marry'd on Friday; on Saturday I heard her Husband had got another Wife; and on Sunday I found this first Wife at the 3 Tuns in Bishopsgate-street. I spoke to him about my Goods, for he had padlock'd them up, and had told his new Wife, that he would sell them all, and her Cloaths too, which he had secur'd with the rest of the Things; however, if I would give him 10 l. to enable him to disannul the first Marriage, he said I should have my Goods again. I took him upon the 26th, on the 27th I carried him to Newgate; and as he was going along, he gave the Key of the Padlock to the Constable; so I got my Goods again.</p>
               <p>Constable. We got a search Warrant on Monday, but found a Padlock on the Door, where the Goods were; we took the Prisoner before Justice De Veil, and as we were carrying him to Newgate, he gave me the Key, and said we should find every Thing safe: I took all into my Custody, except the Wearing Apparel, and here they are.</p>

The Prisoner pretended to be a single Man, and so we were married; but I told him these Goods were my Father's, and desired him, when he came, to return them. I knew of the Goods being removed, the Prisoner said he had taken a Lodging for me, and I thought they would be as safe under his Care, as mine; so I deliver'd him the Goods, and told my Father they were in my Husband's Custody: He refused indeed to deliver them, and locked them up against my Consent.</p>

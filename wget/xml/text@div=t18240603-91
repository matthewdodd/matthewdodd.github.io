            , JUN. I am apprentice to the last witness. On the 25th of April, about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, I opened a door of the bath, and the prisoner was coming out at the other door with the glass and carpet - I did not speak to him, but followed him a step or two - he laid the glass against the front of the house and ran away. I saw him taken in about a minute - I had lost sight of him, when he turned the corner, but am sure he is the same man - he was taken about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from our premises. I went to see if the glass and carpet were gone, and they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of him - A. Yes; at the corner, only for an instant - there were three or four other persons pursuing him - my opportunity of seeing his countenance was but short; but I know him by his dress and countenance - he was dressed in a long pepper and salt coloured coat.</p>

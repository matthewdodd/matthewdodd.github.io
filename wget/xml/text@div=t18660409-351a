                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer—on 16th March, about 1 o'clock, I was with Other on Ludgate-hill going westwards, and saw the prisoner and two other men there, going towards St. Paul's—Henry went to the right side of a lady—George was on his right; the other two men were behind—the lady turned to look into a shop window, and the other two men got between her and the window, so as to obstruct her—Henry's overcoat was unbuttoned, and the tail of it partly covered his left hand, which was partly in the folds of the lady's dress—I saw his hand go into her pocket—George was then close behind—the lady shifted about a yard further down the hill, still keeping at the same window—Henry still kept his hand in her pocket, and George shifted as they shifted—at that moment, George struck the back part of his person against Henry, and made a noise with his mouth, I presume as a signal, and Henry immediately withdrew his hand—I seized them, and Ober took hold of them at the same moment and spoke to the lady, who put her hand in her pocket and pulled out her handkerchief—being pressed by Ober she felt again, but had not lost anything—the prisoners gave their names at the station, but refused their addresses—they each said they hoped we should be lenient with them, and let them go, and give them another chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from them at the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost touching them—the hand stayed in the pocket about a minute—I was above the prisoners on the hill, we were almost in a group; we came suddenly on them; we had not been watching them—the lady drew a white handkerchief out of her pocket—I don't think a thief would steal that, but he might if he could not find anything else—I have known them to do so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-Policeman</hi>, 449). I have heard Hancock's evidence, it is quite correct—I spoke to the lady, she put her hand in her pocket and said I have not lost anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear Hancock say that his hand was in her pocket for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when she shifted he shifted, and kept his hand in her pocket; he moved with her.</p>

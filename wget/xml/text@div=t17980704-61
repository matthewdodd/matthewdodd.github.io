            , Nathaniel Lynham, Luke Ball, and John Warwick, and the indictment charges them with a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, on the present occasion, I have the honour to represent a very useful body of respectable gentlemen, master printers, who are induced, in consequence of very great concern for the interest of the public, to bring forward these five men, who are men of very decent appearance, and certainly not men of the lowest understanding, although they are charged with an offence now upon the records of the Court.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the crime of conspiracy has always been looked upon in a very aggravated light indeed, and a more dangerous thing to the public can hardly be stated, than that of a set of men conspiring to obstruct the progress of any one trade; and it is to be lamented, that hardly a year has gone on without a conspiracy having been brought forward by some active men against their masters.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with respect to the present case, the trade of printing, in this metropolis, has been interrupted from time to time by the journeymen printers, in attempting to get their wages raised, which has been resisted, and with a good deal of effect by the master printers, who were obliged, on the occasion, to have recourse to their apprentices; therefore it was thought expedient by these journeymen printers, that their masters should be prevented from taking more than a certain number of apprentices, for which purpose they formed a meeting together, which, from its appearance, certainly bore no reproachable mark upon it, it was called A Friendly Society; but, Gentlemen, by the means of some wicked men among them, this society degenerated into a most adomnable meeting for the purpose of a conspiracy; those of the trade who did not join this society were summoned, and even the apprentices, and were told, unless they conformed to the practice of these journeymen, when they came out of their times they should not be employed.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this kind of proceeding went on for a considerable length of time, till about March last, when the master printers then intimated to each other, if those proceedings went on any longer, it would lead to a very dangerous tendency, as they were under the necessity of performing the work with their apprentices, and their own hands.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the masters then caused public notice to be given, purporting, that unless these men would return to a sense of their duty some prosecutions should be commenced and brought against them; then it was that this conspiracy began; the principal leader of which was not then known, but with held from the knowledge of the master printers.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, on the 10th of March, the master printers, in consequence of information given them by the pressmen met at the York Hotel, and there the five defendants came clothed as delegates, they represented themselves as the head of a parliament, as we may call it. The principal spokesman, and the leader of those five defendants, was the defendant Atkinson, and they proposed to the masters five propositions, as conditions, not that they would individually do such and such an act, but that the whole body of pressmen should not come to work, but under certain conditions.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in what situation are we, if those sort of meetings are permitted to go on, or these five men are suffered to take upon themselves, of their own authority, to guide and direct the work in this manner; however, this was the case, Mr. Atkinson was the spokesman, and delivered the following propositions, which the masters took down in writing.</p>
               <p>The first was, that there should be three apprentices to seven presses, allowing another should be taken when the eldest is in the last year of his time.</p>
               <p>Now I will prove to you what was the policy of this resolution, and then it will appear clearly, that if they are limited, they cannot carry on the work.</p>
               <p>The second was, no boy to be admitted upon poundage, unless he be turned over; this is not so material.</p>
               <p>The third was, no apprentices to be permitted in any house, beyond a reasonable time of trial, without being turned over.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, apprentices not to be allowed equal to journeymen, not less than what will properly support them.</p>
               <p>The fifth was, no apprentices to be taken pending the negociation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, they gave the masters some time to consider of these propositions, and the answer that they returned, was, it could be of no interest for the masters to stop the trade; the interest of the masters, and the interest of the men, must be one and the same, therefore their wish was not for them to do any thing that was prejudicial to the workmen.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, was this a conspiracy or not? Was it not a widely extended conspiracy? Gentlemen, you may judge of that, by what even passed at the meeting of the 10th of March, for no sooner had this meeting broke up, than Mr. Thorn addressed himself to Atkinson, and said, I am in a most disagreeable situation, in consequence of the workmen having left me; I really cannot bring the paper forward, but if Young would assist me, I could bring the paper forward; upon which, Atkinson wrote a note to Young, and actually gave permission for Young to work for him, and he did come forward and work for him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, messengers were addressed to almost every printing-office in London; to the gentlemen of Mr. Barker's office; whether

               <p>"Gentlemen, it is the opinion of your committee, that unless your employer gives you a strong assurance, that he has seceded from the body of the masters, you are to consider your engagement this day as at an end."</p>
               <p>Can there be any doubt of a conspiracy of the most dangerous nature; but, if there should be a doubt, I will shew you, that wherever this message was sent, the men came forward and insisted upon an answer.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I need not state to you, when Mr. Atkin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040050"></xptr>son has stood forward as secretary, that there can be any proof wanted, that this Mr. Atkinson was the author of this message; but if there should be, we have abundant evidence to prove, that this is actually the hand-writing of Atkinson himself.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in consequence of this, these persons all of them struck, and in this situation it is they are obliged to come forward, not merely for the sake of punishing these men, but for the interest of the public; and I am instructed to say, if these men will now give up this conspiracy, and return to their masters, and work as usual, that the masters will stop this proceeding.I do not expect these terms will be acceded to; but, gentlemen, if that is not to be done, if these men will not repent of their wickedness, I hope this Court will have it in its power to inflict a severe punishment upon them, and I trust others will take warning by them. I will prove these facts to you, they lay in a very narrow compass, and when I have proved them to you, there can be no doubt but this conspiracy exists in this metropolis.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope the landlord of the public-house, where this meeting was held, will be taken notice of in another place.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will also prove to you, by a number of witnesses, several of them master printers, that there are a number of journeymen, who are willing to work, but they have been intimidated and told, they shall never get bread if they offer to work; and those, who ar apprentices, are told, when their terms expire, after seven years service, that all their previous labour shall be defeated, and they shall not be employed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson.I am a master printer, I live in Red-lion-court, Fleet-street: There have been very considerable disputes arisen between masters and journeymen printers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the master printers increased the number of their apprentices? - A. Yes, they have.</p>
               <p>Q. Since that increase of apprentices, have the pressmen, to your knowledge, struck? - A. The increase was made upon different houses, but very few; it was in consequence of not obtaining sufficient journeymen that the increase was made, and they struck in my own house, and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any application being made to you, and the other masters, to meet the defendants at the bar? - A. Yes; there was an application made by Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence then of what you had heard, did the masters, or any part of them, meet? - A. They did, at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. I cannot positively say, with respect to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell nearly? - A. It was in the month of April; it was at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the defendants at the bar; were they present? - A. They were all present.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state, as distinctly as you can, what passed when you were there - in what capacity did they come? - A. I understood they came as a committee from the general body of journeymen; they did not say they were a committee, but we met them as I committee, and some as propositions were proposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them made those propositions? - A. Sometimes one, sometimes another; they were not all delivered by one person.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they delivered in words? - A. I took them down myself verbally.</p>
               <p>Q. What character did Atkinson appear in? - A.As secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect which of them made the propositions? - A. I before said, they were made sometimes by one, sometimes another; Mr. Atkinson made one, Mr. Lynham another; and then sometimes two were speaking at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, or not, generally discourse upon the propositions that were made? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that you took down their propositions? - A. I did; this is my handwriting, a great part of it was made at the time, except the two or three lines at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read over to them what you had wrote, as their propositions? - A. Yes; I read it over to them, and asked them if it was their meaning or not, and they said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them state any objection to those propositions when you read them over? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. State what those propositions were? - A. The first says, three apprentices to seven presses, allowing another should be taken when the eldest was in the last year of his time; that was the first proposition. The second, no boy to be admitted upon poundage unless he be turned over. The third, no apprentice to be permitted in any house beyond a reasonable time of trial, without being turned over. The fourth, apprentices not to be allowed equal to journeymen, nor less than what will properly support them. The fifth, no apprentices to be taken pending the negociation. These are the whole of the propositions that were delivered at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what answer the masters gave? - A. The answer given was at some length, and put into their hands for their consideration; they took it into the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time? - A. Yes; they took it into the coffee-room, and some short time after returned; and after some little altercation, and some few objections, they were apparently satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did what you call the negociation conclude at that time, or was there a further time allowed for an answer? - A. Yes, a month; this was, upon recollection, on the 10th of March, at the York Hotel, Bridge-street, Blackfriars.</p>
               <p>Q. A month was to be allowed, for what? - A. To give a final answer to the journeymen, and the trade at large, respecting the propositions made by the journeymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040051"></xptr>Q. And they were to go to work till that answer should be delivered? - A. Yes; they agreed to go to work directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean generally, or till that answer should be delivered? - A. Immediately; Mr. Baldwin was in great necessity, and, I think it was Mr. Atkinson, who said, he would send a man directly; it was one of the persons who had struck, that he should return to business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the masters returned any answer to that? - A. They did return the answer promised, within a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know to whom the answer of the masters was returned? - A. Yes; it was returned to the committee, but to whom I cannot precisely say; it was done by a person that transacts the business, and Mr. Bensley the secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the masters received any reply from Atkinson, in answer to their answer? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen one of them? (Shewing him a paper.) - A. Yes; this is the answer that I understood had been delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen it as his answer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After this reply was given, what was the consequence? - A. They struck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that they struck in one office, or more than one? - A. They struck in several offices after the reply was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your men strike? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did they assign for striking? - Mr. Knapp. His men are not the defendants, and therefore, what they said to him cannot be evidence against these men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I submit to the Court, that this is good evidence; we are first to prove a conspiracy; we then alledge, that in consequence of that conspiracy numerous workmen struck; why then, the the conspiracy being alledged, I take it, the conduct of the persons who did strike, is evidence; the conspiracy being first established, that their conduct arose from that conspiracy; for it is charged as an overt act of the conspiracy that they did strike.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is already in evidence, that the present defendants met the master printers, as a committee; that they made propositions to the masters in the name of the pressmen; that they delivered in those propositions for the pressmen; that at the end of that month they struck a second time, which your Lordship will have most strictly in evidence; and you will find, that instantly after that answer is so given, the pressmen, in the office of Mr. Thorn, struck; and when the answer of the masters is given, they assign that as the reason why they left him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I apprehended they must prove a knowledge in these persons as connected with the conspiracy stated upon the record, or else your Lordship sees the extent to which it will go; for, unless some knowledge is proved in the defendants upon this record, they might as well extend it to what passed at York, or any other part of the kingdom; and I am sure your Lordship would tell me directly, unless these defendants could be proved to have a perfect knowledge of what these men were about, it is utterly impossible to give that evidence which is contended for on the part of the prosecution; it does seem to me, that what passed at Mr. Thorn's office, with respect to his men striking, unless they prove a concert, and a knowledge in the defendants of what had passed, it is impossible that they should give in evidence any thing like that. I therefore hope your Lordship will be of opinion, that they are not entitled to give any such evidence.</p>
               <p>The objection was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did you converse with your men on the subject of striking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the names of the men that you so conversed with? - A.Wm. and Henry Medcraft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send this man, or any of your journeymen, to the committee? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you send them? - A. They went to the committee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How do you know that? - A. They told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That will not do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. What was the purpose for which you sent them? - A. To enquire whether they might be permitted to return to work; they returned in about an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day this was? - A. It was on the Tuesday; they struck on the Saturday immediately preceding the Sunday, this was on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it after the answer was given by the masters that your men struck? - A. The next day, or the next day but one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have stated a meeting in order to enter into a negociation with the journeymen, is that the only meeting you have had in order to settle you differences? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a meeting in the February preceding, at the Globe Tavern? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been letters passed between the journeymen and the masters relative to the dispute even previous to that? - A. I believe there were letters passed between the committee and a Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was communicated to the committee? - A. Yes, occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that meeting, at the Globe, had there been any communication, and correspondence, had between the journeymen and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040052"></xptr>masters? - A.Between the journeymen and Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that correspondence regularly communicated to the committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this communication been going on? - A. I suppose near two months.</p>
               <p>Q. On both sides it was intended to communicate between you, in a friendly way, upon the subject of your dispute? - A. It was always the desire of the masters so to do.</p>
               <p>Q.You attended the meeting at the Globe Tavern? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the instance of the masters, desiring a part of the journeymen to meet them at the Globe Tavern? - A. I cannot precisely say, I believe it was through the representation of Mr. Gosnell.</p>
               <p>Q. A master printer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of your body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And through his representation, you think it was, that a meeting was called at the Globe Tavern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any propositions at that meeting, either from the masters or journeymen? - A. The masters requested, as a preliminary, that the men should return to their work, and give up their opposition.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they submitted no propositions to the committee? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there not a conversation between the masters and journeymen, relative to the dispute of taking too many apprentices out door and in? - A.There was a conversation on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a conversation upon that subject before you broke up - was it not expressed by the masters, that the journeymen had conducted themselves in a fair and candid manner, making known their objections at that time; I mean at the Globe Tavern, on the 14th of February? - A. I do not precisely recollect that there was any thing of that kind passed.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put the question again, I ask you - whether, in the course of that conversation, the masters did not express themselves satisfied at the fair and candid manner in which they had treated the dispute, and urged their requests? - A. No, I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will put you in mind of them - did nothing like this take place, that the journeymen said, we hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute; in answer to which, the masters, all of them, immediately said, no, by no means, we hope you will not think so, God forbid that we should attempt it; do you recollect any thing of that sort? - A. Yes. I recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, after having stated to the Court, that you recollect that, perhaps your memory may be a little refreshed - I ask you again, whether the masters did not express themselves satisfied with the conduct of the journeymen at that time, in having met so reasonable a set of men, telling them at the same time, that they might depend upon it that they would be their friends - do you recollect that? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the men then, in the result of both these instances, were given to understand that they had conducted themselves decently and properly to their masters, in urging their request in the reasonable manner in which they had urged it? - A. Yes, up to that period.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you appeared perfectly satisfied with the conduct and the manner in which the journeymen had conducted themselves, and they went away with the idea? - A. They went away without any particular determination; the matter still hung in suspence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, in order to satisfy every body, submit to shake hands before you parted? - A. There was no kind of animosity, I believe, but there was no shaking hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear there was no shaking hands? - A.There was no such thing as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time, and between the 14th of February and the 10th of March, and the meeting at the York Hotel, did there continue a negociation at all between the masters and journeymen - was there any correspondence kept up? - A. I believe there was with a Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed with Mr. Davis, was made known to the committee of the masters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that a negociation was kept on foot previous to the meeting at the Globe Tavern, at the Globe Tavern, and down to the York Hotel, on the 10th of March - did you, at the York Hotel, join in the wish to negociate the business upon an amicable footing? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. The meeting at the York Hotel was at the desire of the masters convening a part of the journeymen? - A. No, at the request of the journeymen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, at the request of the journeymen, whom you had been negociating with, they, of their accord, desired you, the masters, to meet them again at the York Hotel? - A. They did, by letter.</p>
               <p>Q.And in consequence of that, did they attend the committee? - A. They did, the five defendants.</p>
               <p>Q.And then the propositions were made, that you have stated to my learned friend? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you again, whether, even after these propositions were made, and the negociation had subsisted between you from the beginning to the end of this date, whether you did not even<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040053"></xptr>then part friendly with the journeymen, and promise to be their friends? - A. We parted friendly at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you part almost in the same terms as at the Globe Tavern? - A. We parted with still greater hopes of the matter coming to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those hopes increased from the conduct of the journeymen? - A. Yes; from the manner in which they received us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then, with these hopes, promise to be their friends, and not to take advantage of them? - A. There was no promise made.</p>
               <p>Q. But was it stated by any body at that meeting? - A. I do not thing it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did part with them better friends than before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you institute this prosecution? - A. Better than a month; it was not determined on till after the men had struck.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you institute this prosecution, after the month agreed upon between you, the masters, and the journeymen? - A. It was after the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it two or three days, or was it a week? - A. I believe it might be three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard it stated, that this is a mild prosecution, and that peace is all that the masters want - did you take up these men upon warrants, the moment the indictment was preferred? - A. That I cannot say, I believe they might; I do not know whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Solicitor for the prosecution. They were; two of them were taken up on a warrant; one of these defendants was taken on the Saturday, and continued till Monday; that was Warwick, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. I would just ask you, whether, after the meeting of the committee, at the York Hotel, and after the month had gone by, whether, even on the part of Atkinson, from the committee of journeymen, a negociation was not further urged to the masters? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of it? - A. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Bensley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the secretary to your committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not communicated to him, that the journeymen wished to have a further negociation with the masters? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You belonged to the meeting of the masters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you help to carry on this prosecution - do not you expect to pay your share of the expences? - A. The same as the fund on the other side.</p>
               <p>LUKE HANSARD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the defendant, Atkinson, ever work with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that paper, and tell me if you believe it to be his hand-writing? - A. I do not think the paper is; I believe the signature to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that paper? - A. I believe that also to be his signature.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Atkinson work with you at the time the journeymen struck? - A. No, he did not.</p>

To the master printers, Gentlemen, the pressmen were in hopes, from the length of time you have taken, and the promises you have made, when last they had the honour of meeting, that the business would have been more amicably adjusted; nor can they help saying, that your answer tends to no regulation respecting the apprentices, the origin of the present dispute; and unless your body come to some regulation on that head, the pressmen consider the negociation at an end.

               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Raine. I observed something in that paper respecting regulations of apprentices - I ask you, whether you think it reasonable that masters should take apprentices out of doors, without stint, and without number? - </p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that; it is no part of this question, whether the journeyman's request is reasonable or not, it is the mode and not the thing that we are to enquire into.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I beg your Lordship's pardon; I submit that we are to enquire into the thing as well as the mode.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not; we are not sitting here to arbitrate between the masters and the men; I do not think that it is any part of the question, even in mitigation of punishment, it is only wasting the time of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. I believe you know there is a Friendly Society subsisting among the pressmen? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you know the nature of these societies, that as Friendly Societies they are extremely beneficial? - A. Yes, I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Atkinson worked for you some time? - A. Yes; but it is a long time back.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, you had an opportunity of seeing his general character and conduct? - A.While he worked with me, I respected him as a good, sober workman.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are a master printer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, whether before the meeting on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040054"></xptr>the 10th of March, at the York-hotel, the pressmen in the trade had struck? - A. Yes; my men had struck long before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, whether the trade has been at all obstructed in consequence of that striking? - A. To my knowledge it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak of yourself individually, or others? - A. I speak of myself individually, and others besides.</p>
               <p>Q. After the meeting at the York-hotel, do you know whether, on the 10th of March, the journeymen came to work? - A. They came to work on the Monday following; my men, who had been absent and refused to come to work for some weeks, I believe, did then return; the meeting was on the Saturday preceding; till then, I could get no men to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your men, or any other men, in the employment of any other persons, pressmen, struck, after you had returned the answer to the pressmen? - A. After we had returned our answer, my men left me.</p>
               <p>Q.When did they leave you? - A.Four weeks after the 10th of March; I do not recollect the day, some of them gave me warning, that is the usual course of the trade, the others left me without warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, from that time, been able to get any pressmen to work for you? - A. Two old men, who are, I understand, proscribed, by the rest of the trade, continued to work for me; and one, who came from Scotland, has worked for me for some little time; besides that, I have no men.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in want, and have you been, of more men? - A. Yes; I have been in great distress for more men, and was at the time they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the defendants, or any of them, at the York Hotel? - A. Yes; I recollect seeing them all at that meeting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hovel. Q. You, perhaps, know, of your own knowledge, there does exist a friendly society of journeymen? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never had occasion to know, that any of the defendants belonged to a Friendly Society of journeymen? - A. Not to a Friendly Society.</p>
               <p>Q.How many out-door apprentices did you happen to have, at the origin of this dispute? - A. At the origin of this dispute, I had two.</p>
               <p>Q. Only two? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been the greatest number you ever had from that time to this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more have you got at this time? - A. I have now four, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect the exact number? - A. Yes, four in the whole, and one in doors; I have had five at one time, but one of them ran away upon my desiring him to bring up ano her, because I could not get journeymen.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I understand you to say, that you did not know of this Friendly Society of journeymen? - A. I understand there was a society of pressmen existing, but not a Friendly Society; what I understand by a Friendly Society, is a Benefit society; as such, I do not know, nor do I understand there is any such society existing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of the articles of that society-perhaps it may happen to you to have read them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw these articles, perhaps you read them attentively? - A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in them, at that time, that was repugnant to your feelings, or judgment? - A. I think there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the person so that shewed them to you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, to him, you expressed an approbation of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at them in the presence of the person who brought them? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with that person about them? - A. I don't recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a printed copy of the articles of this Society? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the book again? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the? - A. I believe these are the articles, I do not remember the index.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the title page - do you find the term Friendly in that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have no recollection, or ever heard of a society denominated a Friendly Society? - A. I did not say so; I have heard of such a Society, but I did not believe there was such a society existing.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a copy of the articles binding that Society together? - A. I do not believe these articles do bind that Society together; I take that to be an insnaring question.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe it to be an insnaring question? - A. I do not believe there is any such society existing under these articles, as a Benefit Society; I never heard of any one man being upon that Society.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with Atkinson upon the subject of these articles? - A. I cannot say; if I have, it has escaped my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell atkinson, that you thought the object of the society good, and the regulations proper? - A. I do not remember telling him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? - A. No, I will not swear it; I do not recollect it; if I had ever said so, I am convinced I must have added; If they adhered to those articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have some recollection of it? - A. No, I have not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040055"></xptr>Q. Then how can you put that interpretation upon it? - A. I put no interpretation upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you ever at Hicks's-hall, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion? - A. Attending the trial of some of my own men.</p>
               <p>Q. For a conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it? - A. It was removed by a certiorari.</p>
               <p>Q. Who removed it? - A. My attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prosecute it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you speaking of the present prosecution? - A. No; of a prosecution that I had commenced against my own journeymen, for a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. To do what? - A. To injure me, in preventing my taking apprentices.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that indictment either given up, or prosecuted? - A. You were there, and therefore you know.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not standing in the evidence box, it is my business to ask you questions, and you must answer them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that a prosecution for an offence, making a part of this conspiracy? - A. Yes; I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago, was it a month? - A. No; a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a part of this conspiracy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you have ever been at Hick's Hall? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion have you been there? - A. I have been there to enter into a recognizance.</p>
               <p>Q. To try these very persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever there at any other time? - A I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these were the only times you had been there? - A. Yes; I was there once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion were you there then? - A. On a trial, respecting an apprentice, about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What, your apprentice had indicted you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.For what? - A. For assaulting him.</p>
               <p>Court. That can have nothing to do with this question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. My Lord, I conceive it is competent for me to try the credit of this witness; I submit to your Lordship, that it is the only way we have of trying it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He was convicted of that assault.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I was convicted, and the fine, I think, was fourpence, and the apprentice wanted to return to me after that; and before the trial, he offered to return, if I would give him one shilling a week for wages; at that time he was not my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. Q. It was a tristing switch that you beat him with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as thick as my wrist? - A. No; about as thick as my little finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fine no more than four-pence? - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was not the reason you gave to the Court, last Monday, for withdrawing that prosecution, that you would prosecute the ringleader first? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you one of the masters that resisted the regulations, respecting the apprentices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At one time you had five apprentices? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, should you have had so many apprentices, if you could have got journeymen to work? - A. No, upon my oath, I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovel. Q.Were you driven to take these apprentices, because the journeymen refused to work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How many? - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any one of these taken during the month allowed for negociation? - A. They were all in the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one assigned to you from any other person? - A. I am not quite clear whether the articles of one were signed, but they were all taken before that; my men had struck long before the general conspiracy; the conspiracy began in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any one apprentice after the meeting at the York Hotel, when it was agreed by the masters, that you should take no more apprentices during that month? - A. It was not so agreed that I know of; it was agreed, that we should take no more than we had.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not the articles of this one boy signed during that month? - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.You had received them into the house before the meeting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a master printer, in Union-street, Blackfriars, in partnership with my father: I was at the meeting at the York Hotel, on the 10th of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Had your men struck at that time? - A. My men never struck at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the York Hotel, had you any conversation with Atkinson? - A. Yes; upon coming out of the room I met Atkinson, and I told him the difficulty I should have in working the newspaper that afternoon, for the men were not present; I said, I suppose, in consequence of the agreement that had then been made, the men who had been before in my service would return immediately to it; I said, I wanted a man of the name of Young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040056"></xptr>he said, stay, I had better give you a note; I saw him go into the back coffee room and write it, he delivered it into my hands, and it contained, as nearly as I recollect, the following words -</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the note directed to? - A. I am not confident whether it was directed or not.</p>
               <p>Q.For whom did Atkinson tell you it was intended? - A. Mr. Young, the pressman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send it to Young? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did Young come to work-after? - A.Inconsequence of it, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. That note is not in your possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Young was one of those pressmen who had struck? - A. My men had not struck, I had discharged them; I requested them to work a form for Mr. Davis, whose men had left him, and they all refused, and therefore I told them, if they would not do as I requested them, they should not work for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you one of the committee of master printers? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the Globe Tavern at the meeting of the 14th of February? - A. I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the day on which the masters invited the journeymen to meet them? - A. I did meet the journeymen, and the proposition was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the conclusion perfectly friendly between the masters and journeymen? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the masters, during the negociation, making use of any expressions of this nature, upon the journeymen saying this: we hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us, on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute; in answer to which, the masters, all of them, immediately said, no, by no means, we hope you do not think so; God forbid that we should attempt it? - A. I do recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this likewise: the masters telling the journeymen, at the same time, that they were perfectly satisfied with their conduct, and were happy in having met with so reasonable a set of men; telling them, at the same time, they might depend upon it they would be their friends? - A. Not precisely in those words.</p>
               <p>Q. To the effect then? - A. No, nor to the effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the negociation was not on foot even between the meeting at the Globe Tavern and the meeting at the York Hotel? - A. There was something like a negociation with Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was communicated to the committee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And at the meeting at the York Hotel, some propositions were made? - A. Yes; I know it was generally understood, at the York Hotel, that no criminal notice should be taken of the defendants for what passed at the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether their conduct, at the York Hotel, was not such as induced you to believe that there were better hopes than even at the Globe? - A. By no means; I did not understand it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been, since the meeting at the York Hotel, a negociation fought for? - A. I have never attended any meeting since the meeting at the York Hotel.</p>

               <p>The Court were of opinion, that as the witness had sworn that he always carried it about in his pocket, and lost it, it was to be presumed it was not in existence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Look at that paper, are the contents of that similar to the note you received? - A. I believe it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Clifton one of your men? - A. Yes; he struck with two others; I call it striking, because he left me without notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any note being sent to your office? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your trade suffer any obstruction from it? - A. Yes; very great, for a considerable time since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. This was after the month which had been allowed for negociation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>DEODATUS BYE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a printer: My journeymen pressmen left me on Easter Tuesday last, somewhere about the 10th of April.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did your business continue deserted by your men? - A.Till about a week previous to Whitsun holidays.</p>
               <p>Q. How have you been able to restore to yourself the power of getting men? - A. My business pressed me so much, I was obliged to comply with their requisition.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you comply with their request from a conviction of it's propriety, or from the impossibility of conducting your business without? - A. I could not conduct my business without.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you express any consent to this, till you were in absolute want of men to carry on your business? - A. By no means whatever.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a master printer; my men did not strike till the 7th of April, they left me without notice.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after the answer of the masters had been given? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury. At this late hour of the day, it falls to my lot to address you upon the present occasion, in behalf of those defendants, who are called in this indictment, and who are proved to be, journeymen pressmen.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this cause has been ushered to your notice, with all the zeal and all the ability that this Court could produce; and give me leave to say, the learned Gentleman who opened this cause, has a little outstepped his usual outgoings, in his opening of this case. Gentlemen, I have attended this Court a series of years, and do assure you, upon my honour, I never heard from my learned friend, or any one in his place, a speech more inflated with a zeal borrowed from his clients, than the one with which he introduced the present cause. But I have the happiness to address twelve gentlemen, selected in the usual way, who have lent their attention to every circumstance that has been given in evidence, and given it all the consideration that they were called upon to do; and therefore, upon that circumstance alone it is, that I feel myself confident in the event of the conflict which is now before you, that it will be fortunate to the present defendants.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend set out with stating to you, that he represents a body of useful and respectable gentlemen, whose zeal for the public interest is, perhaps, only exceeded by the riches they possess. Gentlemen, in what character do I appear before you? I represent a body of honourable and useful mechanics, who have a right to a claim of justice at your hands, and I am sure you will give every effect to the evidence that you can, in their favour.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend has not conducted himself as he usually does in other cases, with observing upon the sort of conspiracy stated upon this record; but, I suppose, in order to inflame your minds, to lead you away from the true point in the cause, he has thought fit to state to you that which I confess I never before heard stated in a Court of Justice, that conspiracies of a nature like the present, have been examined over and over again, and sifted to the bottom for twenty years last past, in this Court and others. Gentlemen, do I deal hardly with my learned friend, when I say it is unusual, when I say it is a sort of argument, that he should not have used upon this occasion, he having introduced to your notice, that which does not belong to the cause; because he hopes, from the weakness, I suppose, of the evidence in the cause, with the assistance of the zeal that he has displayed, and observations that do not belong to the cause, to bring you to that conclusion, which I undertake to say you cannot come to after the observations that I shall make.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend sets out with stating to you, that this, which is called a Friendly Society, has other objects in view, and he would insinuate, though he has not proved it, that, from the evidence that he has been given, you must come to the conclusion, that they had no other object, but that of distressing their masters, and obstructing the trade. Gentlemen, is that fair argument against honest and industrious men, who have deserved well of their masters, for that is the character given by his own master of one of them, and which I have no doubt they all possess. Gentlemen, have you lived in this great metropolis long enough to be totally ignorant, or have you lived long enough to know what the objects of a Friendly Society are, and that it is a benefit to a class of poor mechanics, who have lost their bread, and have nothing to depend upon but their brother workmen, who are earning, by the sweat of their brow, a small pittance for their families. Have not you learned, that that is a laudable undertaking, it is for the advantage of the lower order of mechanics, and if it is carried on for the purposes for which it was instituted, most undoubtedly nobody could complain of it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hold in my hand, the articles of this society, and they are entitled, "Articles to be observed by the Society of Journeymen Pressmen, held at the house of Mr. Amory, at the Crown, near St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-street;" and then it proceeds to state, In italicks, what is the purpose of their institution; it says, "A number of pressmen having entered into a society the better to support the trade." - Now look a little, gentlemen, do you think this society, which prosesses to support the trade, can have any idea of doing that which my learned friend would impute to them, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040061"></xptr>of destroying the trade; but here you see their institution was for the purpose of better supporting the trade,"and those that are distressed." - Look at it, gentlemen, is it a wicked, or a criminal thing, to assist the distressed? And I am extremely happy to be able to state the humanity of these persons, that they have the opportunity and the inclination to assist their poor distressed brethren in trade. Then it goes on, that they thought it necessary to bind themselves together under the articles thereto subjoined. Gentlemen, it does not belong to my practice to state, at great length, to you, that which, perhaps, in the end, may not be very material, and therefore, I will not pursue article by article, the contents of this book; not that I could have any objection, but it would be needless to take up your time. Now, Gentlemen, look at the insinuation that is cast out; to support the trade is the original purpose of the institution, and yet my learned friend would have you believe they mean the destruction of that trade upon which they live, upon which they feed, and by which they maintain their families. But, Gentlemen, I think, when you come to draw your conclusions upon the subject, you will be of opinion, that those who wish to live by a trade, will not associate for its destruction.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, my learned friend begins with the meeting at the York Hotel, as if nothing had happened before. Gentlemen, had it its origin there? - Not one question to that point is put by the learned gentlemen, all three of them, anxious enough to call to their assistance both evidence that has been determined to be inadmissible, and that which has been admitted. Zeal, such as I have seen to-day, I never before saw, especially in a case where the punishment of the delinquency is to be so great, for this Court has the power of fine and imprisonment-nay, I believe, has the power of subjecting to the pillory those men who have been proved, by their own masters, to be skilful workmen, and to have conducted themselves honesty and laboriously.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, before we come to the York Hotel,(for I take it up at a date considerably antecedent to the time of that meeting), had there been any dispute in the trade? - Oh, yes, there had. - Had there been any negociation set on foot before that meeting? - Oh, yes, there had, at the Globe. - Had there been any meeting before that? - Oh, yes, there had - Why then let us look a little at the conduct of the masters, and of the journeymen. - Here are letters pass, a correspondence takes place. - The defendant, Atkinson, acted as secretary to this Friendly Society, which was a mere benefit society, and a laudable institution, and they themselves think sit to apply to their masters, and their masters afterwards send to them, giving them reason to expect and hope every thing from them, and desiring that a person from their committee, (which the masters knew had been instituted many years before), might meet themselves to take into consideration-what? - The subject matter of this conspiracy; - Oh, say they, but you call them delegates. -Why, Gentlemen, what magic is there in the word delegates? the masters desiring that a delegation from their journeymen might attend them to take into consideration the dispute between them, and see whether it could be amicably adjusted.</p>
               <p>Now let us look what has been the conduct of these men, and see whether they have been inclined to rip up, by the roots, that trade in which they are engaged. -Why then, at the Globe meeting, you have it come out, that there was an enmity subsisting between the masters and the journeymen; that they went before the Grand Jury at the next Sessions to prefer a bill of indictment for a conspiracy; that they took up one with a warrant and committed him to prison, when there was no chance of his running away, because his family, and every thing that was dear to him, remained here; the negociation was still on foot, another meeting was desired by the masters with the journeymen, which was held at the York Hotel, and there, though not in terms, yet in substance and effect, the same conduct was observed as at the Globe. - Did the negociation cease? It did not. -There were propositions submitted, which the masters must have thought reasonable; because, no other man living, who has attended to the case, can think them unreasonable; a month was given to them to consider, and not till the expiration of that month do we hear of their taking it into consideration, or giving it an answer. During that month the men had returned to their work; and it was understood, between the masters and the men, that at the expiration of that month, there should be an end of the negociation; the masters then conceived that they were, at that moment, at liberty to take up these deluded wretches; I say deluded wretches, because they have deluded them, and made them the objects of prosecution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with what demeanour, and in what terms, did the journeymen conduct themselves in their different meetings during the negociation? - Was it in terms of enmity, or rancour; were they insolent to their masters, or did they conduct themselves as only wishing to have relief from what they conceived to be an injury, and with all the decency belonging to their character? - Why then is this to be called a conspiracy; here are invitations from the masters to settle a dispute that had been long subsisting between them. - Will you not then suppose, that these men were to consider themselves disengaged as at the beginning of the negociation; and that, upon the faith implicitly observed between them, they were not to be brought into a Court of Justice. They had, themselves, promised that no advantage should be taken of them, and that they would be their friends. Gentlemen, Is this being their friends? - Is it thus that they take no advantage of them? - It seems to me, that you will all answer in a chorus with me, that the masters have taken advantage of them; they do not think it to their interest to listen to them, and therefore they institute a prosecution. Would any of you have expected, after what you have heard, that a prosecution would have been instituted after so long a negociation? I know what your answer will be from the attention you have given to the evidence. It appears, upon the evidence, that these men have actually been endeavouring to renew the negociation, after this prosecution was instituted for this dark, this vile, this wicked conspiracy, which had for its origin to root up the trade, and destroy every thing that is valuable in our commerce.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Let us go along with the masters a little further, and see what their conduct is - My learned friends thought it necessary to put them upon their character in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040062"></xptr>the world, and upon their wealth; I am not at all disposed to quarrel with their characters, or with their wealth, but, in my turn, I put my clients upon their characters. - Gentlemen, within four days of the termination of that negociation, they institute a prosecution, after the negociation had been wished to be continued on the part of the journeymen; they would not hear any thing the journeymen had to say upon the subject, but they think fit to find a bill on a Friday and on the Saturday they take up one of his Majesty's peaceful subjects upon a Bench Warrant, and imprison him till the Monday; and would have imprisoned the others, but, I believe, the truth was, that they could not find them when they wanted them; and now they make a merit of letting them be out upon bail - Is peace then all they desire, or is there not a malignant spirit that arises in their minds?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my Lord, in the course of this trail, has hinted to my learned friend and me, that, with respect to the law of this case, there can be no doubt, because he says, which I admit, that, even persons conspiring among themselves to do a lawful act, is an offence that the law is cognizant of; most undoubtedly, I admit the law, as I am bound to do, when it is laid down by so great an authority. - But, Gentlemen, I do not go upon the law of the subject, except as it accompanies the fact; and I say, in order to constitute this a conspiracy, the thing itself in its origin must be unlawful, and, that they must have had an intention to do those overt acts, which it is stated they did; and if you can find that they originally intended to disturb the whole trade, and ruin themselves, it seems to me, you will be doing more injury to plain facts, than any Jury that ever sat in a Court of Justice have yet ventured to do.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it may not be known to you, but it is well known to my learned friend who sits here, that, by the Charters of the City of London, if any money is given to an apprentice to do the work of a journeyman, it will break up the indentures, and both master and apprentice shall be disfranchised. Gentlemen, you will find that in an Act of Common Council, passed the eighth of 
               <persName id="t17980704-61-person463">
                  Henry

                  </persName>
            . Now is that a reasonable sort of ordinance, or is it not? - No money was to be paid to an apprentice - Why? - Because the City of London had for it's object, to protect the trade in general, and it could not protect the journeymen while it allowed the masters to pay the apprentices that which, if it was otherwise applied, would go into the pockets of the journeymen; and therefore it ordained, that they should not have wages, or if they had, it should disfranchise the person apprenticeing, and the person apprenticed. In this case, you find that one of these gentlemen was not content with having four apprentices, but must extend the number to five, one in doors and four out - You will see, Gentlemen, also, that, by this ordinance of the City of London, they had another good object in view, they wished to ordain, that apprentices should always be boarded with their masters, because they should be under the controul of their masters, otherwise, persons of young and tender years would be liable to go astray, they would be liable to get into bad company, and commit those sort of depredations, which would make them liable to the pains of the law.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, let us see whether the mutual interests of the journeymen and masters go hand in hand, because my learned friend says, the master printers have nothing in view but the welfare, the good order, and the interests of the journeymen - their interests are inseparable - Can you say their interests are inseparable, when you see what they do, when the masters are paying to apprentices, who work out of their house, a poundage upon that work, which would otherwise, most undoubtedly, go to the journeymen? - The more out door apprentices they can get, the less journeymen they would want, and the poor class of men that I represent, would be obliged either to starve, or seek another employment; therefore it was, that the journeymen, in a decent manner, thought proper to enter into a negociation with their masters, upon the subject; and that is the crime for which these men, honest in their line of life, are called upon here to answer to day; for you to say, whether you will doom them to the horrors of the place opposite to me, or whether you will restore them to their business, and to their families.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it appears in evidence, that at their meeting, the words, criminal prosecution were mentioned; nothing of a criminal nature was to be pursued against them; we will promise you not to institute any criminal prosecution; and then, like serpents, we will turn round upon you, and, as the Scripture says, out of your own mouths we will convict you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, have I made fit observations upon this case; if I have, for God's sake, restore these men, that they may bring to a sense of justice their masters, and let them be put upon a footing with journeymen of every other trade and description of commerce. - Gentlemen, I wish it to be understood, that I cast no imputation upon them, but we are all liable to mistake; and I say, the masters, as a body, have been mistaken in their conduct. Gentlemen, my learned friend has made this offer, if you will return to your duty as you have hitherto conducted yourselves, and subscribe to the regulations which we have made, we will give up the prosecution. - Now Gentlemen, let us see whether justice calls upon us so to do; for if justice does not call upon us so to do, I am sure you will not. - First of all, is the desire of the journeymen reasonable or not? Is it reasonable to suppose, that journeymen, who have, many of them, perhaps, entered into the holy estate of matrimony, will submit to give up a part of their profits to younger hands, while they look upon their families, and say, we must starve. - Do I look at humane, calm, dispassionate, well-judging, minds? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who have been in a Jury-box, in a Court of Justice, before? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who feel no prejudice on either side? Am I addressing myself to Gentlemen who win, and seek for nought but justice in every verdict they give; if I am doing so,(and I have no reason to doubt it), I am sure you will be of opinion, that if this is what the journeymen ask and desire, they desire nothing more than any subject of his Majesty has a right to petition, even his Majesty himself for; they, having toiled through the most laborious part of their business, at a time of life, when many of them, perhaps, may not have youth on their side, they ask for that pittance which, by law, ought not to be given to an apprentice, and which would otherwise go into their own pockets - Is that reasonable, Gentlemen? I am now appealing to your humanity, is it reasonable, or is it not? - Now, Gentlemen, I will make them an offer - if they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040063"></xptr>will consent to limit the number of apprentices, the men shall return to their work. - It is quite beside the question, whether these men are guilty of a conspiracy or not; but as offeres are the fashion, that offer I give to them.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, it does seem to me, after the observations that I have made, that your verdict, if you give it for the prosecution, must be given upon this ground, that, going to bed with as peaceful slumbers as surround you each night when you do go to bed, you can believe that these men intended to limit the number of apprentices by going throught thick and thin, to make the masters do that which the prosecutors insinuate. Gentlemen, I am sure that every part of this case that has been repeated before you, has been attended to by you, with that attention, that will do honour to you so long as you live; but I will just read to you the language of the masters at the Globe Tavern; the men say, "We hope, gentlemen, you do not mean to take any advantage of us, on account of the part we have taken in the business, with a view to bring about an amicable adjustment of the dispute." In answer to which, the masters say, "No, by no means, we hope you will not think so, God forbid that we should attempt it." -Thus, you see, making an appeal to our Maker, that they would not take any advantage of it, and yet a case of a criminal nature is brought before you for your consideration. - Gentlemen, they do not stop there, but they go on to tell them that they were perfectly satisfied with their conduct, and were very happy in having met with so reasonable a set of men, telling them at the same time, that they might depend upon it they would be their friends; and yet, Gentlemen, they have done what I have described to you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg pardon for having detained you so long - I have made such observations as have occurred to me upon this case, and it seems to me impossible, under the circumstances of this case, for men, acting upon their oaths, to pronounce a verdict of guilty.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. The charge imputed to the present defendants, by the law of this country, is a very heinous crime, and is properly so considered, because the consequences of it must be very fatal to society; nothing can be more injurious to society, than men meeting privately to do injury to large bodies of men, therefore it has at all times been considered, by the law of this country, as a very serious offence. In the present instance, it not only affects the peace of society, but also the commerce of the country, and for that reason is punished by very severe penalties. When, on the one hand therefore, you find the interests of society affected by it, and on the other, severe penalties attached, it becomes a very serious case for the consideration of a Jury.</p>
               <p>The learned Counsel has gone very much into the nature of the propositions made by the men to the masters, and has given you to understand that they are good and wife propositions, and that they could not do wrong upon those propositions. Now, the law is decidedly the reverse of that, for, even if you believe that they united together to do a god and useful act, the mode which they take to execute their purpose, is by a conspiracy, and that, in all the books, is held to be a conspiracy. You have had a speech from the Counsel, as if he had been addressing the House of Commons at the bar of that House upon the merits of the question. I forbear at all to go into the question, whether it is a fair or reasonable proposition; and as to the question, whether it has been an improper prosecution, and brought from improper motives. It has been proved on all hands, that a great part of the journeymen have struck; I therefore, do not think, that the prosecution brought by the masters, is to be reprobated under these circumstances; but I wish you to try this cause with all the temper you can, neither taking a prejudice in favour of the masters or of the men; while they conduct themselves peaceably and with good order in society, they are both valuable; journeymen are as necessary to the public in trade as the masters, and therefore as long as they conduct themselves with propriety on the one side, and on the other they deserve to be respected; if they do not, but go the length of offending the laws, they must take the consequence. The only question is, whether these five men have offended the law in the way that I have stated, namely, that they have conspired to injure and obstruct the trade of their masters.</p>
               <p>In the first Count is contained a special charge, which I must say, the evidence does not prove; but I think the evidence does prove the general Count; and if that is made out to your satisfaction, it will be an offence for which they are answerable.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall state shortly the points to which your attention ought to be directed. I think it appears by the evidence, that after the 7th of April, when the agreement was at an end, and they refused to come to terms, a great part of the men struck; now, if they did strike, that was certainly an act that tended to impoverish the trade; and if so, the next question is, whether, in consequence of any proceeding which took place by Atkinson, or any of the defendants at the bar, that took place which is stated upon the evidence; for, upon this indictment, supposing any one of them to have acted in concert with the other, the crime is made out against them. You have been told that these people have been acting as a benefit club; these men might have a benefit club, but it does not at all follow, that pursuing that benefit club, they might not do the acts stated upon the indictment; they may have taken the advantage of that meeting to apply it to other purposes, which are illegal, therefore it is for you to collect from the whole of the evidence, whether these five persons, who appear to be members of that club, did take that part which is imputed to them; and if you think you can fairly draw that conclusion, you will find them guilty; but if you are not satisfied, that there was that sort of concert, and that in consequence of their recommendation the parties struck, you will acquit them.

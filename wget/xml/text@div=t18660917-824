I am a servant in the service of Mr. Selim, 4, Upper Bedford Place—upon the night of the 23rd August, about half-past ten, I went to bed—I closed the house up before I went, with the exception of the back drawing-room window—I came down the following morning about a quarter-past seven, and found all the bedroom doors open, the drawing-room door, the dining-room door, and the shutters in all the rooms—every shutter was closed before I went to bed—I had barred and bolted the street door—when I came down I found that ajar—it must have been opened from inside; it was impossible to open it from the outside—I found the door in the lower passage leading to the scullery opened; that also must have been opened from inside—I went into Mr. Selim's bedroom and found a quantity of apparel gone—the timepiece out of the drawing-room was in the back drawing-room on the bed, it was not taken out of the house—I, the cook, and a friend of the cook were alone in the house that night—we all slept upstairs.</p>

On the 25th August, about eleven o'clock, accompanied by Constables Foley and Blissett, I went to Castle Street, Long Acre—I saw Perrot come out of the house No. 24, Castle Street, with two parcels under his arm—I watched him to a pawn-broker's in Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square—he returned to 24, Castle Street—I did not see him come out of the pawnbroker's—I returned to Castle Street—he had not the parcels in his hand then—he went into the house, and came out again in about two minutes with Rogers—they both stayed in conversation in the street—I went up to them and took them into custody, with the assistance of the two other officers—Foley spoke to them in French—I took them back to 24, Castle Street, to the second floor back room, which the landlady pointed out as the place where Rogers lived—he opened the door with a key, which he brought from his pocket with my assistance, as he was handcuffed at the time—I found a large sheet on the bed tied up, containing this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a great deal is marked "Henry Selim"—I then took both of them to the station—I afterwards went to 24, Arthur Street, Oxford Street—I found Rousinot living there in the second floor front room—Foley spoke to him in French—I saw a bench fitted up, and on the top of the bench there were a number of files and rasps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found in a drawer of the same bench a number of skeleton keys and other keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found three crucibles—I took him into custody—I then went to 45, London Street, where Perrot lived—in the front parlour, which I was informed of by the landlady, in a box I found the whole of this property, dresses, shawls, and other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found also there this rope ladder (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt that this was used in committing the burglary—I found this under the bed in a bag—there was not a passport or any papers in the bag.</p>

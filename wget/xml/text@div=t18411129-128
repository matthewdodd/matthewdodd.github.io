                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Sutton, a baker, of Well-street, Mile End, New-town. On the 17th of November, the prisoner came to the shop, and I served him with a half-quartern loaf—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad half-crown—I made an excuse to get change, and went to the door, and beckoned Hill, who is a good judge of silver, to look at it—I found it was bad, and told the prisoner I would give him in charge—he said he would give me in charge—he ran out of the shop, and Hill after him—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—I kept the half-crown, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

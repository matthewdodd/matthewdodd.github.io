            , as I was going by out of Mr. Pitts shop. I then said if you will stop a minute or two, you will see something done, and before I had done speaking it to Cox, Keaf took the handkerchiefs down, I saw him take them down; Murray was in company with him, they were both together at the time. I apprehended both the prisoners by the assistance of Cox; I took Keaf, Murray stopped at the door untill I came. Keaf got above twenty yards from the door; I apprehended both the prisoners by the assistance of Cox, I took Keaf; Murruy stopped at the door until I came back; I went up with Cox to him and took him to the watchhouse. I observed the two prisoners talking together before they look the handkerchief down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find the handkerchiefs upon Keaf - A. He dropped them down from under his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I walked from Reading about the 19th or 20th of Aug. About twelve o'clock at night I put my bundle down, and went to sleep in the road on the other side of Hounslow—I met the prisoner—I thought he laid down with me—when 1 awoke I missed my bundle—I laid down, and went to sleep again—a man came by, and said, "Have you lost any thing?"—I said, "Yes, a bundle"—he said, "A man is taken with a bundle in Hounslow"—this is my bundle, and these things were in it—I had some money in my pocket—I did not lose that.</p>

I stopped the prisoner with this bundle in the Bath-road, in the parish of Heston—I asked what he had—he said, "A coat and two or three other artides"—I asked the description of the coat—he said it was a frock coat with pockets in the side—I found it had pockets in the front—I took him into custody.</p>

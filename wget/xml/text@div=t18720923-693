                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 7, John's Place—about 9.30 on the night of September 4th I was in Brick Lane—the prisoner stopped me, and asked me to give him a penny for him and his mate, as they were going reaping in the morning—I told him I had not got one—he caught me by the waistcoat, and put his hand into my right-hand pocket—I told him I had not got a penny in my possession—he struck me, and put his hand in again, and pulled out my tobacco box, knife, and a pipe—I said "You are going too far with that; I will give you six months"—he struck me again, and I was dragged into Flower and Dean Street—I was knocked about and kicked fearfully—the prisoner struck at me all the while—I heard some words pass to have the handkerchief I was wearing on my neck, and that was taken—the prisoner was choking me at the time I was down, and he took the handkerchief from me—he put the tobacco box and the knife in—my pocket again—I was insensible for a few, minutes after—I waited till I saw a constable, and I went then to the police-station—the sergeant told me to go, and if I could see the prisoner, to give him into custody—I met a constable in Brick Lane, and went in search of the prisoner, and gave him into custody—I was not capable of performing daily labour for some time after.</p>

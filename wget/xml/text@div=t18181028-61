            . On the 26th of September I was at the <placeName id="t18181028-61-crimeloc355">Job's Castle, public-house, in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

The deceased, Wakeley, was in another box - He was rather drunk; he had a few words with them, then went to their box, stripped off his jacket, and wanted to fight - They were quarrelling for five or six minutes. After that the prisoner, Fuller, came across the settle, and began fighting. I went to Rayner, and said, "Don't put a big good man against a little good man-it is a pity for them to fight." He got up, and wished Fuller to fight-he is his uncle. He said he should beat my brains out after he had done with the deceased-the deceased fell under. Fuller got up, set-to again, and the deceased fell against the edge of the settle - He got up no more. I went to Rayner, and said," You have made a pretty job of it, here is a dead man for you to look at." He said, "Let him die and be d-d!" Fuller appeared very sorry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I have heard that Wakeley was a good fighter, and had fought many pitched battles. I was three boxes from them.</p>

            . I was in the room. The deceased was wrangling with others, and challenging them to fight. I saw them set-to. The deceased fell against the settle - I cannot say whether it was in consequence of the blow, or by accident.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was challenging others to fight, and was always quarrelling when he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAVEN. I was in the house. Wakeley came into the middle of the room, and said he would fight any Norfolk or Devonshire man of ten stone. He pulled off his clothes, and stood in a fighting attitude for five minutes. Fuller went to him - I left the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-man to Thomas Clayton; he keeps the Coach and Horses, Edge ware-road; the prisoner was his porter and under bar-man. On Monday evening, the 29th of October, I watched the prisoner, and saw him take one shilling from the till—he had just served a customer, who paid him in halfpence, and, as he put them in with his right-hand, he took one shilling out with his left, and kept it in his hand two or three minutes-a customer came in for some beer—he went to draw it, and dropped the shilling into the beer-sink—I still kept my eye on the shil<lb></lb>ling till Mr. Clayton came down—I told him—he went to the sink, and saw the shilling there, and gave him into custody—he said he had taken a shilling of the man that was standing at the bar, to take 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer—the man said it was no such thing—he then said he took it from his pocket to send for his supper—when the policeman came in he said he hoped Mr. Clayton would forgive him, it being the first time.</p>

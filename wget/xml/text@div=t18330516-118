            , of Cotton-gardens, Hackney-road. On the evening of the 8th of May, I left my house in company with my little girl named Eliza, to meet my husband - when I got to <placeName id="t18330516-118-crimeloc610">Shoreditch Church</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Is your husband here? A. No; I have been married eight years, we were married at Aldgate Church - I made a charge of a similar nature to this against a woman who was tried in the Old Court; I swore to her, but she was acquitted - I was robbed of fifteen shillings then; I have been talking about this case - my husband and I were offered ten pounds not to come into court, but my husband said not ten pounds, nor one thousand pounds should prevent it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever say to anybody that you were very sorry you had not seen the prisoner before you found the bill, and you would not have done it? A.Never; I know Mr. Meek, he is the person who offered me ten pounds not to prosecute; he gave me his card to call on him, and I and my husband went together - I said to a woman that I was very sorry that I was obliged to come - I was very sorry the young man had been guilty of what he had, but I never said that if his father had come forward on Monday, and made proposals to me, I would have cleared the boy - I did not say I would instruct my child to say that she did know whether it was the prisoner - I don't know how the woman I swore against came to be acquitted; the jury found her guilty of an assault, and they said they could not find her guilty of that in that court.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I am turned fourteen years of age - I was with her on this night I had seen her put some money into her pocket before she went to Shoreditch Church - I saw the prisoner and three others get round her; I recognize the prisoner as one of them, and while he held her arms one of the others put his hand into her pocket, and took the money; three of them then ran off, but my mother caught hold of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160064"></xptr>prisoner against the church-rails - my mother was struck in the mouth when she lost her money; I called the policeman, who came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You left your mother with the prisoner? A. Yes, against Shoreditch Church; the prisoner was taken in about five minutes; he could not have got away, my mother kept hold of him, and kept her eye on him - it was not my mother who told me to say I was fourteen years old, I am that age - she told me she prosecuted a woman for robbing her of 15s., but I was in the country at the time - I have been at home two years; she told me of it soon after I came home - I did not say that my mother was robbed of four bright shillings on this occasion - I did not see the man take the money out of her pocket; we were going to meet my father; it was about half-past nine o'clock - my father is a <rs id="t18330516-118-viclabel611" type="occupation">wine-porter</rs>

             (police-constable H 49). On the 8th of May, I saw a crowd opposite the church - the prosecutrix came to me, and called me, she was on the curb; she pressed on, and I followed her for about twelve yards; she passed through a number of persons and pointed out the prisoner to me, who was leaning against the rails, she said he was the man who had robbed her - the last witness said, "No, mother, it was a man in a hairy cap"- but the prosecutrix said he was with him; she said yes, he was - I asked her if she was positive he was the man - she said yes, she was; the prisoner seized me, and made no further reply - I then took him to the station; she then stated that he was not the man who robbed her, but that he had held her arms while the other robbed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was there not a great crowd assembled? A. Yes, a bell-ringer was dead, and they were ringing the dead peal over him; I suppose there were fifty or sixty persons there; the prosecutrix came out from the people, and called "Police" - she certainly had not hold of the prisoner at that time; she was going on towards him when she spoke to me - her back was towards me; I don't know whether she had been at a greater distance from the prisoner - her face was rather towards me when she spoke to me; I should think she could not be looking at the prisoner then - there certainly were some persons standing between the prisoner and her; she pointed the prisoner out to me when I came up to him; she had not hold of him in my presence.</p>

            . I am an iron-plate worker. I have known the prisoner eleven years - I live at No. 3, Somerset-place, Hoxton - the prisoner was five years and a half in my employ; he has borne a very good character - I never offered the prosecutrix ten pounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you any interview with the prosecutrix? A. Yes, on Thursday last; I was walking in the Old Bailey-yard, I asked the prisoner's father which was the prosecutrix, and he pointed her out to me - I asked her if she was the prosecutrix of Allen, she said she was; I said I thought she was wrong in the identity of the person - while I was speaking to her an Irishman came up and said "The d - I of bit of necessity is there for this boy to go before the bar at all, come and have a pint of porter" - I went with them, and had a pint of porter; the man took the pot up and drank, and said "Two or three sovereigns will do away with this - you stop here, and I will go out and talk to her" - they went out and said three or four minutes - I then went out and said, "Well, have you any thing to say to me?" the man said, "She will do nothing without her husband, you had better tell her where you live" - I gave her my card, and at about nine o'clock in the evening she, and her husband, and a girl, came to my house - the man said, "What have we come for?" I said, "That is best known to yourselves;" her husband said, "She is not come here to be bribed;" I said, "She will not be bribed by me, I will not give one farthing" - there was a gentleman in my parlour at the time - the prosecutrix said,"I wish I had seen you, if I had, I would never have filed the bill, for by God I spent the last penny I had to do it; we have not a bit of bread, do for God's sake give me a shilling;" I put my hand in my pocket, gave her two shillings, and shut the door.</p>

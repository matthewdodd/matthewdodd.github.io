                  </hi>. I am steward to Mr. Charles Thomas Holcombe, he lives at Barking, the prisoner was his carter. On the 12th of February he was to go for a load of manure with an empty cart—I had frequently missed oats from the granary—on the night of the 11th of February, I smoothed the oats over, and in the morning I found the print of two holes in the oats, and about five bushels gone—Salmon, the other carter, came to me with two handfuls of oats—I compared them with those in the gra<lb></lb>nary, and they exactly corresponded—I believe them to have been part of the same—I afterwards saw the marks of some, feet without shoes, as if they had had worsted stockings on, walking up to a wall, and there was an im<lb></lb>pression, as if a sack had been dropped, with something heavy in it, over a nine-feet wall—the prisoner had no right to go into that granary—it had been locked, and the person who entered must have got in at a window, after getting over the wall.</p>

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there no fastening to the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a common iron latch, which a person outside could open, as there was a broken pane in the window, for cats to go in and catch mice—the window was shut in the morning, as I had left it—I kept the key of the granary—I believe it is a patent key—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner about two years—I never Keard of any dishonesty in him—he is married, and has five children—I missed about two bushels of white oats, and three bushels of black oats, which I suspect were taken that night— the white oats were Scotch oats, and rather a particular sort—they had been cut rather green—the black oats were common—Salmon brought me a handful of oats out of each sack, a little after six o'clock that morning—I got up about six—I live on the premises—when Salmon came to me, I found the prisoner had been gone about a quarter of an hour—Salmon has lived on the same premises five or six years—Mr. Holcombe has been thereabout three years, and Salmon has been in his employ constantly—he has never been discharged—there was a man named Warren in Mr. Hol<lb></lb>combe's employ—I heard that the prisoner had caught Salmon in the stable, opening his bin with a false key; but it was not Warren told me of it—I called Salmon and the prisoner face to face in the stable—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect whether it was stated, on that occasion, that Salmon had gone into the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the object of your calling Salmon to face the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To tell him he had done wrong in opening the bin—each man has a bin for the food for his horses for the week—I did not tell Salmon that he had gone into the stable at night, and opened the prisoner's bin with a false key—the prisoner had charged Salmon with going to his bin in the night; but he did not repeat it before Salmon's face—I heard of it from a great many quarters—the prisoner never told it to me to my recollection—I will not swear he did not—it was stated, on that occasion, that Salmon opened the bin with a key; and I suppose it was a false key.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I not ask you whether the prisoner complained that Salmon had opened his bin with a false key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was so—Salmon did not deny that he had done so—I told him I had a good mind to send him about his business—I might tell him to go—I believe I did tell him to go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you saw the mark of a sack having been thrown down; was it not hard frosty weather? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not a frost that night; it was a thaw—the white oats would weigh about 40lbs. a bushel, and the black about 38lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Holcombe. On the morning of the 12th of February I saw two sacks in the cart—one of them was three parts full, and the other about half full—it was Mr. Hol<lb></lb>combe's cart, and the prisoner was the driver—I examined the sacks, and found there were oats in them—I took some black oats out of one sack, and some white ones out of the other, and took them to Mr. Black—I saw the prisoner drive the cart away—I do not know whether the sacks were in it then—I did not look into the cart any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you go to the stable that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes past five o'clock—the prisoner was then inside, just opening the great gates into the yard—he went away with the cart about a quarter past six, which was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had seen the sacks in it—I was in the stable with him all the morn<lb></lb>ing—I did not say any thing to him about the sacks, as I did not know but that Mr. Black might have ordered them—the cart was about a dozen yards from the stable door—when I took the oats out of the sacks, the prisoner had gone with his horses to the pond to water—I took them to Mr. Black after the prisoner left—I could not take them before, as Mr. Black was not moving—I could have awoke him—his house stands in the garden; but I thought he would soon be out, and I did not like to disturb him—I did not examine the sacks in which the oats were—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—we might have had a few words in contradic<lb></lb>tion—I swear I have not had words with him in anger half a dozen times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember going to his stable one night, when all the men were gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went to do my work, I suppose—I unlocked the prisoner's corn-bin with a key which Mr. Black gave me, because I had a suspicion that there was corn there which ought to have been in my bin—I found more in his bin than there ought to be—I did not take it out—the prisoner came to me there—his hat did not fall into the bin close by me—that I swear—he did not ask what I was doing, nor did I tell him—I sup<lb></lb>pose he could see what I was doing—I did not beg of him to say nothing about it—I swear that—I cannot recollect all I said to him—I did not beg</p>

               <p>of him to have mercy on me, and say nothing about it—he did not threaten to tell my master nor Mr. Black of me—nor any body—I never heard him say any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not say that he had found out why his horses did not look so well as the other men's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said his horses would look as well as others if they had the same victuals—Mr. Black spoke to me about it, and he told me to go about my business—I went home, but I did not leave the service—I went again—Black had not given me any money to go off—he was in a passion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector. I was on duty at Ilford station about half past seven o'clock in the morning on the 12th of February, and received information from Mr. Black—I went up the road, and saw a cart driven by the prisoner—I passed it at Stratford, and got a small distance in front of it—I desired the sergeant to keep in the rear of it—I proceeded to the Bell-and-Mackerel public-house—I saw the cart driven to the door—a man came to the prisoner, and he stopped about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner then drove on, accompanied by the other man, who had fed the horses, into Ducket's field, which is out of the main road—I then saw the man who had fed the horses get into the cart—I saw him take two empty sacks out, and place them on the hind ladder—the sacks were the wrong side outwards, and had oats hanging to them—I then desired the officer to take the prisoner, and to take care of the sacks—the sacks were the prosecutor's—the oats have never been found—the prisoner had got three miles and a half from his master's before I overtook him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he draw up at the Three Pigeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not stop there—from what I had heard I had reason to believe the property would be left at the Bell and Mackerel—I kept in front of him about two miles—when I first saw the sacks they were empty, and they were making preparations to fill the cart with dung—the sacks were merely moved to prepare to load the dung.</p>

On the 22nd of December, between four and five o'clock I went out; my wife came to me - I went home, and saw a man there who had come about some boxes; he was standing at the door - I told him the price; he said he could make them much cheaper himself - he went away; I saw something under his coat, and followed him - I saw him join<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060026"></xptr>two men, between forty and fifty yards off - I never saw them before; the prisoner was one of them - I observed the man take something from under his coat and give it to the prisoner, who put it into his hat; the man looked round, saw me, and ran away - I followed the prisoner and the other man: I searched the other man, but found nothing in his hat - the prisoner had walked on about fifteen yards; I followed him, and said, "What have you in your hat?" he answered, Nothing - I took off his hat, and found a thousand nails; they were in a paper parcel - I had marked the paper, and had left them on the further end of the bench, in the shop; and had seen it there about an hour before - I gave it to the Policeman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you mark the paper? A. They were marked, "6d. fine clasps;" they are marked at the shop - I have others at home marked the same way, but I marked them myself with the letters P D, in pencil, after the robbery; I am certain they are mine - I have more to compare with them; I first saw the prisoner at the top of <placeName id="t18310106-49-crimeloc289">Monmouth-court</placeName>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 22nd of December, between four and five o'clock, a man came to me, and from what he said I went for my husband, leaving the man in the shop, close to the door - I had seen the parcel of nails two minutes before; another parcel was taken; the man went away - my husband followed him; his coat seemed bulky as I saw him go up the court.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I came up just as the prosecutor collared the prisoner - he gave him to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know where the prosecutor lives? A. Yes - it is in the court which comes into Little Earl-street; he lives about the middle of the court, about twenty yards from the end of it - I first saw him about one hundred yards from the court, but I did not come up till he had taken the nails from him; he wanted to get from me.</p>

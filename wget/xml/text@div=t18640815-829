                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 3, Carroll-street, Borough-road—on 17th July, about a quarter-past 10 at night, I was going through Park-street, and saw the prisoner and a man having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> near the Anchor public-house—she said to him,"If I cannot pay you I will pay somebody else"—she knew me very well—she ran after me, and as I got close by the Anchor she stabbed me in the neck with a knife—I saw the knife in her hand, and she instantly ran across and threw it into the Thames—I put my hand to ray neck and found blood—two men helped me to the hospital—I bad my neck dressed, and as I came back it burst out bleeding again—it was a deep wound; it went through my bonnet, cloak, and dress into my neck—here is the hole in my cloak—I was laid up at home for nearly a fortnight—a surgeon attended me, and then I used to go to see him at the hospital—when I came back from the hospital, an hour afterwards, I met a policeman with the prisoner—I had given a description of her; I knew her well—she had been to ray house the early part of the morning and asked me for a drop of tea—I said, "Yes"—I had given her no cause to quarrel with me.</p>

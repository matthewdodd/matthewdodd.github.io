                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the bark <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>, of which the prisoner was chief mate. I joined her on 11th Sept., 1848; she was bound for the North of England first, and then we went to Naples and Malta; from there to Messina, Constantinople, and Odessa, we touched at Gibraltar on our way home, and arrived in England at the beginning of this month—I believe we got into Naples harbour, at the latter part of last Nov.; while there the prisoner ordered me to fill a cistern; while doing so, he came to me and asked why I did not fill it before—I said, "I had something else to do, and he took me by the left ear and swung me down on to the deck, and my ear has been swollen ever since; and I have lost the hearing of that side altogether—whilst at Malta, in March, I was keeping watch, and went to call one of my fellow-apprentices—when I came up, the prisoner said I had been sleeping below—I said, "I had not; I had mistaken the time; I had been to call the other apprentice," and he said, "I have caught you at last, you d—d young fellow," and took a handspike from the windlass, and gave me a blow on the arm with it; my arm fell down powerless, and it left like pins and needles in my arm, and I fell down on the cable chain on my face—my face nose and eyes bled profusely, and my eyes were black for two or three days afterwards—about the middle of Aug. we were at Gibraltar, I was drawing up a bucket of water, the prisoner came and took the bucket from me as my fellow-apprentice was in the act of taking it from me, and he struck me in the back of the neck with it, which knocked me down—I <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> on the deck, and caught my head and face on the edge of a large water-cask, which broke the bridge of my nose—the bucket was made of canvass—there was no medical man on board, and never had been—when we got to London, I had liberty from the captain on 7th Oct. to go on shore—I told the mate I was going, and he said I should not—I remained on board till the 9th, when constable Frazer came and took me to the Thames police-office—I afterwards went to Mr. Ross, and showed him my injuries.</p>

               <p>mentioned it—I helped to put in the stones as well as I could at Constan-tinople, and also at Malta—that was after my arm was broken—they were heavy stones, two feet wide—they were slid down a plank, and sometimes I had to lift them with both hands—the captain looked over us while we were doing it—there were six men helping, besides the apprentices—no one set my arm or put splints to it; it joined together again by itself—I continued working as well as I could—the prisoner often complained to the captain of my being lazy and dirty, and the captain often spoke to me about it—when he took me by the ear at Naples, he was not bringing me to the captain to complain of me—I had to do something else when he ordered me to fill the cistern—I was to receive my orders from him—I never had anything the matter with my ear before—it was as sound as the other is—at the time he hurt my ear, the captain was walking on the quarter-deck, and saw it all, and reprimanded him for doing it—you might say he was pulling me towards the captain, but he said nothing to him—I cried out when I fell down—complaints were made to the captain about my filthiness and laziness every week—the captain did not give me any money or clothes—the clothes I had when I came ashore were given me by the sailors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-policeman</hi>, 73). In consequence of information, about 9th Oct. I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>, and saw the prisoner—I asked him if he had a person named Martin on board—he said, "You mean <hi rend="italic">Nosey"</hi>—I said, "I do not know anything about <hi rend="italic">Nosey"</hi>—he said he would show him to me—he called him up out of the hold, and I asked him, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence, what was the matter with him—I said, "Have you been ill-used?"—he said, "Yes, I have; "and said he had got his nose and arm broken—I said, "Why did not you go to the Magistrate? why did not you go on shore?"—the mate said the master has forbad him going on shore—I took him to the station, and afterwards to the Magistrate, who gave a summons against the prisoner, and I took him—I afterwards took Martin to Mr. Ross, the surgeon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner brought him up to you when you asked for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said the captain had given strict orders that no one was to go <hi rend="smallCaps">OD</hi> shore out of the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL</hi> Ross. I am a surgeon, at Shadwell. I examined Martin, and found the bone of the left arm had been broken, and the bones of the nose, and there was a slight enlargement of the left ear—such treatment as he has spoken of, might be sufficient to cause deafness—he appears to be deaf with the left ear.</p>
               <p>

               <p>attribute the deafness to the treatment he received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I examined the internal part of his ear—the cause of deafness was probably some injury to the drum of the ear, cold, or anything of that kind—a fall from the mast might break the nose—his arm was broken rather higher than the middle—it has firmly united, the higher bone slightly over-lapping—it had been actually broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor; I joined the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> at Malta, and went to Constantinople and Odessa. I know Martin and the defendant—I recollect Martin telling us at Malta of the injury to his arm—I was not present when it was received—I was at work at the stones at Constantinople—I staid with the vessel till she came to London—I recollect Martin sustaining an injury to his face and nose at Gibraltar—that was about 20th Aug.—I saw him about a minute after—I had seen him without the injuries three minutes before—I was on the opposite side of the ship, and could not see where he was—I heard him sing out just after he was knocked down—I had seen the mate about two minutes before, and he went towards where the boys were pumping the ship out.</p>

Martin never told me anything about the injury to his arm till a fortnight before we got to Falmouth—he then said he would have the mate up about it—the mate denied breaking his arm, and said he knew nothing about it—I saw the injury to his ear some time after he was at Naples; the lower part of it looked swelled and rather sore—I asked the mate if he had acted so brutally as to injure him—he said he was <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> him along to his work, and he fell on the chain and hurt his ear—we left Malta about 15th March, and returned on 19th—after we left Gibraltar the mate admitted the injuries to the boy's ear and nose—he said, "The boy aggravated me and dared me to it; that I could not govern my passion"—I gave the boy leave to go ashore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>till about a fortnight before we arrived at Falmouth—I know he had two fells, one of about two feet perpendicular, and the other ten or twelve feet, but do not think his arm could have been broken on either of those occasions, as he never complained to me of it—I did hear him say, about 8th Jan., that the mate struck him with a canvass bucket of water—the mate complained of the trouble he had with the boy, and I said, "Let him do what he can; it is of no use to abuse or beat him, for it will do no good."</p>

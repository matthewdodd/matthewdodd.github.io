             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of April last, the prisoner came in under pretence of buying some ribbon I was in the shop; I am in the Coventry ribbon line, I go round to take orders; while I was there Mrs. Moore was giving me the orders, and when I had taken my orders for the ribbon, I looked at the two women and something causing a suspicion within me, I stood and watched them; Mrs. Moore then went to the drawer to serve them with the ribbon, one of them cheapened a remnant; and the other woman drew Mrs. Moore's attention to look at a ribbon in her cap, telling her to look at it, and the prisoner took the opportunity of taking a piece of ribbon out of the drawer; I saw a piece slipped out of the drawer, in the hollow of her hand, and immediately she put it into her pocket under her apron; Mrs. Moore, and the two women were still talking about the ribbon, and could not agree for it, and they were going out of the shop; I then took hold of the prisoner by the two hands, and said you have got some ribbon, which you never intend to pay for; I would not let her go, they sent for a constable, I desired Mrs. Moore to search her; she threw herself on her back, and endeavoured to kick some thing from her, but Mrs. Moore searched her, and found three pieces of ribbon, all marked with Mrs. Moore's mark.</p>
               <p>(The ribbon deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were they in the drawer at the time you shewed them to the prisoner? - The lad was the first that shewed them to her, I am very confident that she took the two first from him, and one from me; when she was found out, she offered to give me three guineas to let her go, I said, I would not for three times three.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, the gentlewoman told me, she had cast three for this, and she was rather to late last sessions, or else she would have cast another; I leave it to God and to you.</p>
               <p>Court. This is an indictment for privately stealing, which is where the property is taken away feloniously without the observation of any body in the shop; but here is a person that saw her take it, that will save her life.</p>

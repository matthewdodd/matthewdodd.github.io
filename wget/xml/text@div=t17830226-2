               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner that morning? - Yes, he was about the coach to go along with it; he lay in the yard always.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where was the prisoner at the time the coachman had the watch in his hand? - He was about the yard, but he was not in the office.</p>
               <p>How long had he lived with Mr. Mott? I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had he lived with him for any considerable time? - For two years or thereabout.</p>
               <p>So then this man might as easily come into this room as any of the servants? - All the same.</p>

               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner, do you know the person of that man? - I do, on Saturday last between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, the prisoner presented me this watch, (the watch produced and deposed to) he asked me if I could advance him five guineas on it, I examined it, and went aside for a few minutes, in order to look over the warnings that are sent from the publick office, in expectations of finding this watch advertised, but I did not trace it in the hue and cry, or in any other of the bills; I told the prisoner, I could advance him the money upon it, or more if it was required; he answered, that he should be obliged to me so to do, I told him it would be necessary that I should first of all have an interview with the proprietor, because I could not conceive an idea of a man of the department in life that he was in, and the appearance that he made (he was in his post boy's dress, and appeared just to have come off a journey) having such a watch of his own; he said the watch was left him by an uncle, I asked him how long he had had it in his pessession, he said about two months; I then told him, I should be under the necessity of stopping the watch, and taking him before a magistrate, he readily consented, and I took him before Justice Penleaze, in Wellclose-square; I left him in the custody of his men, and immediately waited on Mr. Ellicott; I examined the watch, and saw it was a watch fresh out of the hands of the maker, Mr. Ellicott owned the watch, and we went to Mott and Harris's.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner go inside or outside? - He was upon the roof.</p>

                  </hi>I am smiths' foreman to the London and South Western Railway Company. I do not know that we have lost any iron in particular—this chain, shackle, and bolt are similar to what we use, but I suppose other railroads use the same sort of things—the prisoner was employed by our Company up to the day he was taken.</p>

The prisoner passed me between six and seven o'clock on the 2nd of January at Nine Elms, near the railway turning—I saw he had something very heavy on his shoulder—I followed him to Vauxhall-road, and asked him what he bad got—he said, "A piece of wood"—I said, "I must look at it"—he said, "No, for G—'s sake don't look, " and he tried to get away—I found he had this iron in a basket—I took him—he told me be worked on the railway—I said, "Does this belong to the Railway Company? "—he said it did—I heard him say before the Magistrate, "It does belong to the Company; I am very sorry for what I have done."</p>

Hanson's, and the foreman, at my request, Called up all the men, and Threadgold picked out Haven. Foulkes, and Day—they are the men I had seen go across on the 7th, 8th, and 9th—Craddock afterwards came in, and I identified him—I have known him for years, and 1 am sure he is the man—I said they would be charged with stealing lemons, and taking them to the White Hart—each of them said they knew nothing about it, and had not been to the White Hart—they made the same statement at the police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I was employed to assist in watching at the White Hart, with Threadgold—on the 14th I saw the basket fetched out of the room in which I was, by the tall man, and taken into the next room—I saw Day go in very bulky, and when he came out, his smock was loose—on the 15th I saw Day come in the same state—the basket was again fetched, and taken into the next room, and I heard something rolling into it—it sounded like potatoes or lemons—afterwards Raven and Foulkes came in, and spoke to the tall man at the bar—they were bulky—Day came in a second time—on the 16th, Day was at the bar with the tall man, and I saw the tall man change a florin, and pass a piece of silver to Day, while I was getting a pint of porter—after that the short man went out with the baskets, and Threadgold tried to stop him; but hs got away—the tall man was at the bottom of the passage—I did not see Craddock on these three days.</p>

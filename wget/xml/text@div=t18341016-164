On the 6th of October I had eleven sovereigns in a purse, in my trowsers pocket, which were in a chest - the prisoner's clothes were in the same chest - I missed the money that evening - I went in search of the prisoner, and found him in a public-house - I asked if he had my money - he said he knew nothing about it - I got an officer, and had him searched; 10 sovereigns and 17s. 5d. were found on him, and my purse - he then said he had never done any thing of the kind, and he had done this in a desperate act, on account of his brother, whose conduct was not right, and he did it out of melancholy - he did not state what his brother had done.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on the 6th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening, at the Horse and Dolphin, in Greek-street, Soho - I found in his trowsers pocket this purse, with 10 sovereigns and 17s. in it, and 5 1/2d. loose in his pocket.(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that on his going to the box for his own clothes, the purse fell out of the prosecutor's pocket, and he put the money in his pocket, in order to restore it when he saw him.)(

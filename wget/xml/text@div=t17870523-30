               <p>The first you found was on the father and mother's bed? - Yes, eleven pair and a piece of black sattin; they were examined in Litchfield-street, before Mr. Barnfather; he asked me, if I thought any of them belonged to the first robbery; I told him I was not willing to swear to it, if they did.</p>
               <p>Are any of the shoes your property? - They are all mine, the sattin and all; the oldest boy said, that he assured the Justice upon his word and honour that they were all taken out on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>How do you know they were the print of boys shoes? - By the length of their shoes; I could count the great toe and the little toe through the stocking; the print in the dust.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, I could see the print of the great toe and the little toe in the dust, with stockings on; I came and brought my master and other people up stairs; I have the goods in my possession; they were delivered to me in the office.</p>
               <p>Who did you shew these prints in the dust to? - To Mr. Grieve.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To me; I measured them, and by the measure of the print we knew the size of it to be a boy or girl, and we thought it had been a chimney sweeper; we could tell by the measuring of it; the dust had fallen in and the foot of the stocking had sucked up the dust; I measured two in particular, and I measured the biggest boy when I went into the house, and it answered to the biggest boy; eight inches; I only measured it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Grieve called on me, and I went to search the boys father's house; and in different parts of the house, we found shoes; in the two pair of stairs, on the top of the feather bed, we found some; he said, it was his bed; he was in the room with us; we found some sattin there; we went up in the garret, where the children lay, (as he said) and we found some more in the garret bed, covered with some clothes; then we went to the cock-lost, and found a good many more pair; we brought them to the office in Litchfield-street, and I brought the old man; I found this pistol in the cock-loft, with Mr. Grieve's shoes.</p>
               <p>(A pistol about the length of a finger.)</p>
               <p>I brought the children with us; the big boy was suspected; he wanted to get away; I was present when they was examined, and Mr. Grieve was present, and there was a great many in the office; Mr. Barnfather was there, and the clerk; I believe there was some acquaintance of the prosecutor's; I was in and out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, the office was as full as it could hold; I heard the children examined; one said to the other, you would persuade me to do such a thing.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I should be very happy they should be discharged; I do not want to make the matter worse; the big prisoner at the office, denied knowing any thing of doing it, till we found the shoes; there were two buttons found, and they corresponded with the jacket he had on; he then said, more people wore such buttons; the name of the biggest boy is John; them are the same sort of buttons; but he said, they were larger, and they did appear larger.</p>

               <p>Did your father or mother say anything to you about it? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did they desire you either to come or not to come? - My father said, I was to come to day.</p>

               <p>Do you know what promises were made to these children if they would tell the truth? - I saw Mr. Grieve clap my brothers on the head, and told them to tell the truth, and they should not be hurt; that was at the Cock.</p>
               <p>Did your father ever say any thing to them? - No Sir, they were taken directly to Bridewell, my father never saw them after.</p>
               <p>Court. Swear her to give evidence.</p>
               <p>SWORN IN CHIEF.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to you after, of the evidence you was to give by any body? - Nobody said any thing.</p>
               <p>Has there been any threats to prosecute you if you did not tell the truth? - No Sir, nobody said any thing to me; my father said, I must tell all the truth.</p>
               <p>But did any body at the Justice's tell you, that if you did not give evidence you would be prosecuted? - No, not to my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that nobody told you that if you did not give evidence against these boys, your father and you should be prosecuted? - No Sir, not to my remembrance; I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>It could not well pass without your remembering it; will you swear that no such thing did pass? - I cannot say so unless I was positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did nobody ever say to you, that unless you gave evidence against these boys, you or some of the family would be prosecuted? - No Sir, I cannot positively say, whether they did or no.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not your father threated with a prosecution, unless evidence was given against these boys? - I do not know that, indeed.</p>
               <p>Was not you yourself threatened? - I do not recollect I was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that no such threat was ever made use of to you? - I cannot, because I am not positive; they might, and I not take notice of what they said.</p>
               <p>Was any such thing ever said to you by any body or not? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Yes, you can positively say, if no such thing was never said, it is easy for you to say so? - They might say so, and I never took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Who do you think said so as you recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230054"></xptr>now? - Nobody that I recollect; nobody said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am sure my father did not; there have been a many people to see my father, since my brothers have been gone.</p>
               <p>But I want to know what any body has said to you. - Nobody has said any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Did any body else? - People have spoke to me; but I do not remember their saying any thing of that sort to me.</p>
               <p>You do not say heartily that they did not; you have nothing to fear here; you are under protection here, provided you speak the truth; nothing can hurt you now or hereafter, if you speak the whole truth; and you are liable to be punished, if you do not speak the whole truth; did any body ever persuade you to give evidence against these boys, in order to save either yourself, or any part of your family, from a prosecution? - No, Sir, nobody never did; I am sure nobody did; many people said, be sure you tell the whole truth, and do not go tell a story upon your oath.</p>
               <p>But had you no motive to induce you to come here to give evidence against your three brothers? - No more than that I was ordered; I went up to speak to my brothers, and I saw the shoes in the cockloft.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing how these shoes came into your father's house? - I asked my brother how they came there, and he said my brother William had been playing; he said he had been a top of the leads; and my little brothers some of them, I do not know which, went down into the house, and brought up some of the shoes; and when I saw the shoes, I desired them to take them back again, and my big brother said he would; my little brother had them in a pin-a-fore; then my father called us all down to read; it was on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>How came they a top of your father's bed? - When the constable came with a search-warrant to the house, my mother came up stairs, and I saw Mr. Grieve, and I thought what he came for, and I went into the cock-loft and brought the shoes down, and put them on my mother's bed.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in the house? - On Sunday night, and this was on Monday morning, when I went up I saw them in the cock-loft; my eldest brother told me where they came from; they were all up in the cock-loft; when I came up they were jumping about.</p>
               <p>Did you never see any of them before that Sunday evening? - No, Sir, never before, nor heard any thing of them; I had often been up in the cock-lost; I was up there on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Are the shoes here that were found?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The shoes deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. There was no way in which they could be got out of your shop, but in the way you have described before? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. TIREY, the father, sworn.</p>
               <p>I think, to the best of my knowledge, the eldest is fifteen, and the other is twelve, or in his thirteenth, and the youngest is about nine, or between nine and ten; I cannot say which; I have it down; I did not look at their age; I did not think it would have been asked.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, these three children are indicted for stealing a quantity of shoes, and some other articles, the property of

            ; and the first point that you ought to consider in an indictment of this kind, is the capacity of the parties to commit the crime of which they are charged: the law requires that a person who is charged with a crime, should be in a situation capable of comitting that crime; he should be a moral agent; the law has fixed different ages, to enable persons to do different acts; at the age of twenty-one a party is completely master of himself, in point of law, and capable of doing every act that any other freeman can do; at the age of seventeen a person is capable of being an executor, and of acting in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230055"></xptr>affairs belonging to that, provided the trust is reposed in them by other people; the age of fourteen is what is usually called in law the age of discretion; and anciently, before the laws that were made in restraint of marriage, at that age children were capable of consenting, so as to contract themselves in marriage; below the age of fourteen they are considered, in point of law, as not within the age of discretion; the law, however, has fixed no precise time at which a child shall begin to be responsible for its actions; and anciently, doubts have been entertained with respect to all ages; for ideots, lunaticks, and persons non compos mentis, are not answerable for crimes that they commit; in the same way, a child that is of so tender years as to be alike incapable of distinguishing good from evil, and of knowing the moral consequence of its actions, is not capable, in point of law, of committing a crime; and a variety of doubts have been from time to time entertained, with respect to the capacity of children to commit crimes, when under the age of discretion; for after the age of discretion, which is fourteen, the law presumes capacity to make them accountable, but not before that age, unless some act is shewn, or unless it appears that the party charged with the crime, from their actions, or from their committing the fact itself, had that degree of understanding and discretion sufficient to make them accountable for their actions, and conscious of the nature and consequences of them; and on that principle it is, that sometimes children of very tender years have been condemned and executed for very atrocious offences; there was one instance of a child of between nine and ten years of age condemned and executed for murder; and the judges were of opinion, that the circumstances of the case being attended with a considerable degree of cunning, and with endeavours, on the part of the child, to conceal the fact which it had committed; they were of opinion, that these circumstances evidenced a degree of capacity in the child, beyond its years, and a consciousness of what it had done, and that it was answerable; in the same manner, in other instances, the judges have admitted that principle, that a degree of cunning, and of that malicious mind which the law requires in the perpetration of crimes, will supply the defect of years, and make the party responsible for their actions; but in general, something should appear to induce a jury to think that the child is conscious of the consequences of its actions, in order to induce them, on any evidence, however clear, to convict such child of a felonious action, because they must not only be satisfied that the fact was committed, but that it was committed from a felonious intention; now a felonious intention can never exist in any person who, from years, or other circumstances, are not acquainted with the consequences of what they do; I therefore think it very clear that the younger boy ought to be acquitted; for if he had been in point of fact guilty, there is no evidence, either from the circumstances of the case, or the previous conduct of the child, to shew any degree of art or cunning beyond his years, or to fix him with a moral consciousness of his actions; and unless it appears from the circumstances of the case, or from the conduct of the child, that there was a degree of art and discretion in him, that made him accountable, he is not a person capable of being acquainted with the nature of the case, and he should therefore be acquitted, as a person not capable of knowing the nature and tendency of his actions; but it would be dangerous to fix any rule, and it is left to the discretion of the Court and Jury to judge from the circumstances of the case, whether these circumstances are such as to supply the defect of years; and certainly there is no evidence of that sort in the case of the younger child; so far with respect to him, therefore, I think clearly, whatever your opinion may be, you ought to acquit him; the next is so near what the law calls the age of discretion, that it would be too much to acquit him on account of his years alone; I will therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230056"></xptr>state the evidence as it respects the two older boys.</p>

               <p>Caesar Augustus West. I am a carpenter, I work for Mr. Atterbury; I have seen the prisoner come into his yard the latter end of August, in our dinner hours, he had no business there; I desired him to go out; he said, as I was a stranger to him he would go out; but before that, there was a great deal of stuff missing out of the yard; I was informed there was a new partition put up at the house of Mrs. Anson, about four doors from my master's yard; I went and looked at it, and found it was some of my master's stuff; there was a part of the sash-door left in the yard; I knew them to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who put them up?</p>
               <p>West. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steed. I am a servant to Mr. Atterbury; I was employed to take care of this stuff; I put it up in a lost, to be kept to be used again; when it was missing, I made enquiry in the neighbourhood, and found the prisoner had done a job for half a guinea, which my master would not have done for 50 s.</p>

I am a labourer; the prisoner hired me for 2 s a day, to labour under him; he handed me some of the partition from out of a lost, and some from under the gateway, in Mr. Atterbury's yard; as to the sash door, I cannot say where that was taken from; that I put up where the partition is, at the same time he gave it me to bring away.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer; I hired two rooms at Mrs. Anson's in Chick-lane; I asked her whether she would be at the charge of putting up a partition, she would not; she recommended the prisoner, and I agreed with him to put it up; I gave him 1 s. earnest, and was to give him half a guinea; the next day, when I came home, I found it up, it was a sash-door and a wainscot partition; after that, some of Mr. Atterbury's men found out this stuff, and ordered me not to pay the prisoner, and I have not paid him.</p>

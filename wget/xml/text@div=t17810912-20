I went out at five in the afternoon: I left no person in the house. I locked the door; and the windows were shut down. I came back about six, unlocked the door, and went in. There was a large box in the corner of the house, which I had left a candle upon; but it was taken off. I was told by some children, that a woman had been in at the window, and come out again. It was a sash-window; any person may get in by lifting it up. The window-sash was shut when I returned. I looked at the box, and found it broke open: I missed 8 l. 14 s. which was in a green silk purse in the box; the gold was in that purse, and the silver in a leather purse, in which the silk purse was likewise put. I was told which way the woman went, and supposed she would go to Monmouth-street, to buy cloaths; as she was almost naked. I went to enquire. I heard a woman in a red cloak had been to bargain for cloaths at several shops. At last I found her at a pawnbroker's door, in Russel-court, all in new cloaths. A woman, who saw her come out of the window, and knew her, had told me who she was. I laid hold of her, and brought her to my own door. That neighbour came to my assistance, and laid hold of her. The prisoner d - ned me and the money too, and said she did not think she should ever go to gaol for my money. I asked her where the purses were? She said, I might go seek, if I was cunning enough to find them. She said, If I would let her alone, she would give me the money back; that she did not mean to keep it, but return it. When the justice asked her what became of the red gown she had on when she came out of the window, she said she had thrown it away in Drury-lane.</p>

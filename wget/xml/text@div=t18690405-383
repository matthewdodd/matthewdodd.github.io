I am an ostrich-feather manufacturer, of 49, Lower Whitecross Street—about 8.30 on Friday night, 19th February, I left my warehouse door locked and padlocked—there is a skylight at the back—that was perfectly safe at the time I left—I returned to the warehouse about 9.20 next morning—I found the skylight was broken, and feathers hanging from the glass—an opening was made large enough for a person to get in—one of the policemen got through it—I found that 178 boxes of feathers had been taken from the shelves and emptied, and were standing on the floor—the value of them was 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we have recovered about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth.</p>

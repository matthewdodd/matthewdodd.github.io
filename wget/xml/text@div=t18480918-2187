                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, at Forest-gate. The prisoners was in my service nearly three weeks—on the 8th Sept. I came down stairs before the prisoner, at twenty minutes past six o'clock—I went to the till, and there were then two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, four 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of copper—it was not locked—I went up stairs for about two minutes to get the key, and then went to the till to lock it—no other person had come down—I missed a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece—I called my wife down—she counted the copper in my presence, and there was 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. missing—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she denied it, and said if I wanted to make her a thief I might, but she was not—I said I had detected her before, and could not be robbed any longer—she said she did not care how many policemen I fetched, she was no thief.</p>

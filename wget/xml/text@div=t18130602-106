The prisoner was my servant; he was to carry out my goods and to bring me the money. On the 20th of April he took two cheeses out of my shop for Edward Brown, of Sydney-street, City-road; my son went with him, and at the end of the street he gave the cheeses to my son, and my son delivered them to Mr. Brown; I have never received the money for them.</p>
               <p>JOHN POWELL. JUNIOR. I was sent by my father with the cheeses; I was to deliver them; I did not know whether I was to receive the money or no; I delivered the cheeses; I did not ask for the money. The money was sixteen shillings and ten pence; I was merely to deliver them.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BROWN. I keep a chandler's shop, 17, Sydney-street, City-road. The prisoner offered me some cheeses. He called on me after that with the bill, sixteen and ten pence he owed me a shop bill of six shillings and eight pence; I deducted that off, and gave him ten shillings and two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You did not know Mr. Brown before this, did you - A. No; the prisoner said he had an order from Mr. Brown; he took the cheeses, and the bill of parcels was made out; I never knew Mr. Brown. I trusted upon the prisoner's recommendation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BRANNAN</hi>. On Friday morning, 19th July, at 8 o'clock, I received information, and proceeded to a house in the New-cut, accompanied by other officers, where we conoealed ourselves—the house commanded a view of Windmill-street—at 9 o'clock I saw the prisoner James come up Windmill-street from the direction of Little Windmill-street, and join four or five men that were standing there—they all remained together for some time, and then two of them departed—he prisoner James went back in the same direction, and when he had been gone about five minutes he returned—there were then some additional men there, and he joined them—he then went away a second time in the same direction that he had come, and came back again—then he went down a third time, and on his return, at the bend of the street, by my direction he was seized by Sergeant Elliott—there is a bend in the street, so that we could not see Little Windmill-street from where we were placed—Elliott seized him, and I immediately went to his assistance—after Elliott had his hands in his pocket, he said, "Come on, sir, I have got him"—at that time all the other officers were there—they seized him, and Elliott and I ran to Little Windmill-street where I saw the prisoner John Campbell with another man run out of the house—he had neither coat, waistcoat, nor neck-handkerchief on—Elliott attempted to seize him, and he struck at him, and also at me—I said, "If you hit me I will knock you down"—Elliott hung to his neck, having no other mode of seizing him, and he said to me, "He has got it in his left hand"—I saw this black bag in his left hand, which he had closed like this, hitting at us with—he then said, "Here it is, Mr. Brannan, take it, that's all I have got"—we then pushed him into the house, and at that time James Campbell was brought up by the other officers—when the two prisoners were together, I said, "Mr. Campbell, I have received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you, and endeavour to put a stop to your mischievous practice in dealing so largely in counterfeitcoin"—he said, "I have not been long at it, Mr. Brannan; my brother has been very ill; he is but just gone out; he knows nothing about it"; pointing to the prisoner James—he</p>

            . My sister winds silk; I live with her; she sent me to a silk-man in Wood-street, in order to bring some silk for her to weave ribbands with; this was on a Saturday about a month ago. I was to bring them from Wood-street to my sister's house, which is in Cock-lane, Shoreditch; this happened about eleven o'clock in the forenoon. I was bringing it, and walking by myself along Aldersgate-street, which is my way from Wood-street to Cock-lane, Shoreditch; the two prisoners and another woman followed me there; they began to talk to me, by asking how my sister and my mammy did. After talking some time with me, they asked whether I would go with them to a place called the Bull-in-the-pound, near <placeName id="t17781021-38-crimeloc200">Bagnigge-wells</placeName>

I agreed to go with them; they took me across the fields. When they were in the fields they asked me for my bundle; I told them I had rather carry it myself; they said I was not able to carry it; that I could not, and should not carry it. It was about fifteen ounces of silk wound upon bobbins; upon my refusing to give it to them they took it away by force and ran away; I was left alone; I did not know my way home; I fell a crying; a gentleman came up and asked me what was the matter; I told him some women had taken away my things and left me there; I told him where I belonged to, he carried me home to my sister's house. I saw the prisoners afterwards in Charterhouse-street, near Charterhouse-square; I was along with my sister; the moment I saw them I knew them again; I said then that I was positive these two were the two women, and I challenged them, and I am very positive the two prisoners were the persons that robbed me in the fields. It was white silk wound upon bobbins, and a long end row with all sorts of colours upon it.</p>

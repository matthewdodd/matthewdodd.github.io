I have seen Reardon, Sullivan, and Flynn on the works at that immense building in St. Paul's Churchyard, opposite the south door of St. Paul's Church—on the evening of 20th Dec. I saw three men go up and down the ladders between 6 and 8 o'clock at night, and they crossed some boards, and pulled some lead off a house belonging to Mr. William Cook—in consequence of what I saw I set Joyce and another man to watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Cook and Co. In consequence of what was told me by the last witness, I watched the premises—I saw Sullivan go up the ladder—he stopped between five and ten minutes, cutting the lead—I do not know whether it was with a knife or what—Sullivan came down across the plank and down the ladder—Flynn then went up, and when he came down Sullivan went up again, and was cutting the lead again—he put a piece under each arm and brought it down—Reardon was standing at the foot of the ladder—he took the lead of them—I watched them, and never lost sight of them till they carried the lead into the marine store shop—Reardon is the man that carried it—both he and Sullivan went into the shop—Flynn followed them in—the shop is ten or twelve yards from the building—I had the policeman waiting in Swan-passage—I beckoned him, and said that all three were in the house—before he got dose to the house Flynn came out, and he caught him by the collar, and took him into the house—the other two prisoners were there—the officer said to the marine store dealer, "I demand that lead that these men have sold"—he stooped down behind the counter, and picked it up, and said, "Here is the lead; I have asked them where they got it from, and they told me they found it in the rubbish, and Flynn came in and said, 'It is all right, master'"—the policemen took these three men to the station—Flynn lives next door to the marine store dealer's—this is the lead which the three men had—it weight 15 lbs.—I cannot say how long Flynn has lived next door.</p>

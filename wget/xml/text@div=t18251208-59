            . I am servant to Mr. Burgis. He directed me to look out, on the 4th of November, and in the evening I saw the prisoner come into the shop, but he did not see me; he went to the counter, and looked about some time, then tok up the parcel once, and laid it down again; he took it up a second time, and as he was taking it towards the door, I stopped him; he might have got about two yards from the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The shop is not two yards in length altogether? Witness. Yes, it is about ten feet.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to purchase a black-lead pencil; I knocked on the counter and called - there was no one there; I looked at some of the pictures for about a minute and a half, and on turning round I saw this parcel near the edge of the counter - I removed it further on, and leaned my elbow on the counter, and immediately the witness came and took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LUCAS re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in his assertion that he knocked and called? A. Not the least; I saw all he did, as I was behind the door.</p>

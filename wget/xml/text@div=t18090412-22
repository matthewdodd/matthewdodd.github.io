            . Q. Did you at any time in last month meet either of the prisoners any where - A. I did, on the 17th of March. I had dined in the neighbourhood of the Strand, I quitted my party about twelve at night, I went to see a gentleman home that had lodged with me to Northumberland street. I live at Kennington.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you - A. An <rs id="t18090412-22-viclabel133" type="occupation">Italian</rs>

I turned from Northumberland street into the Strand, I was in liquor, I missed my way, I thought to go over Westminster bridge; I turned, I believe, the other way. I met the woman

            , I believe in the Strand, I asked her if she would tell me the shortest way to Kennington, or to Westminster bridge, to put me in the right road; I told her I was a married man, I could have nothing to do with her; there was no carriage in the road, or else I would have taken it. Instead of putting me right, she led me up Catherine street; I thought she was leading me right. I got shoved into a court, I afterwards found, I did not know it at the instant; I was shoved into a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shoved you into the house - A. I cannot tell; the woman had hold of my arm; I got into the parlour in a minute, I said where is this, I said get me some one that will shew me the way; there was a candle in the parlour, the candle was put out, and I either got a shove or a push; I got a blow upon the nose, I bled desparately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in she room - A. I believe she was, it was all done in a moment; my coat was taken off, and this watch taken from my pocket; when I felt the blood it brought me to my recollection. I made to the door, I called the watch, the watch came immediately, and afterwards three or four Bow street officers came; a light was had; they searched, and nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When a light was got was any person in the room - A. No, the prisoner was gone; there was nobody but the officers and me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man at that time - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether any body pushed you, or whether the woman pulled you in - A. I cannot tell, the woman had hold of my arm; I cannot say whether any body assisted in getting me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to take notice of her, so as to say that she is the woman - A. No, I will not swear that she is the woman.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martin in the Fields. I and two men of the name of Limbrick were out on duty at half past twelve o'clock at night; we went about the streets; about a quarter past one o'clock, as we were coming down Catherine street, I heard the cry of Watch; upon which the watchman came over from Exeter street; he went up the court, and we followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cry of Watch from - A. From Bedford court; it leads into Little Catherine street, going into Drury lane; it is on the left hand. We followed the watchman up to No. 2 in this court, where the gentleman was standing at the door without his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the gentleman - A. Mr. Williams, the last witness. We then went in to see if the coat was about the place, or the persons in the parlour; we found nobody there. We searched the house all over, and when I came to the two pair of stairs I found the witness, who is here. I got information; I went down to a night house in Burleigh street, the Horseshoe and Magpie; when we got in I looked in the bar; I saw the woman prisoner in the bar.</p>

             - A. Yes. I opened the door of the bar and went in, and close to where she stood I saw a watch lying, I said to the landlord is this your watch; he said no; the prisoner dropped it; the prisoner was sitting close to him; I took the watch and kept it till I went before the magistrate, then by the order of the magistrate I gave it to the gentleman, and marked it first. This is the watch that I took up close to the woman, and the watch that I gave to Mr. Williams; I marked it with the letter D, and here the letter D is.</p>

               <p>Q. What evening do you speak of - you say that evening - A. Yes; I saw him there the same evening when this gentleman was robbed; I lodged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120017"></xptr>in the house then; I do not now. There are two rooms on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. In which room did you see Chisholme - A. He was in no room, he was in the passage. It was between twelve and one before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman there at the time - A. I heard a noise below, I did not see the woman there then, she might be in the apartment, I did not see her. I heard a gentleman call out Watch; that was after I saw Chisholme; I was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you saw Chisholme was it that you heard the gentleman call out Watch - A. It might be half an hour. The woman lodges in the house in the parlour. Chisholme did not lodge in the house as I know of.</p>

               <p>Chisholme was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>Curtis's Defence. I never saw the gentleman before I saw him at Bow street. I went out the same afternoon, and coming home between one and two o'clock, I put my foot against the watch; other young women lodged in the same rooms, and were in the habit of receiving company there; there were different men and women drinking at the public house. When I went in I asked the publican to keep the watch till the next day; he said stop till I draw a pint of beer. These gentlemen then came in, and took the watch and me to the watchhouse; I did not know who the watch belonged to, nor did I know what to do with it, I meaned to give it to the publican to keep till the next day, to see if there was any owner to it.</p>

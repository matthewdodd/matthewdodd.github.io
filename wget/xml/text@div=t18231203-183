On the 26th of November, in the morning, I was in the work-shop; he said there was a knock at the door - he went and opened it. I said I did not hear a knock; he said somebody wanted to speak to him round the corner. I went to the door, but could see nobody; he went home soon after, telling me he had to meet a young woman to go to his sister's in Chandos-street. I followed him, missed him suddenly, and on returning met him in Broadway, Westminster, and followed him to No. 8, Grenville-street, Somer's-town, having learnt that Bolton, a brush-maker, lived there; I went home, and missed three gross and a dozen brush handles. I went to Bolton that night - the prisoner did not come to work afterwards, and on Friday, I took him at his lodging - he denied the charge. I afterwards found six dozen and four handles, which I believe to be mine; he had made part of them himself. They cost me 18 s. a gross.</p>

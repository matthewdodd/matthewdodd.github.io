                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 8th Oct., abont a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was going down Victoria-street, Mitchell spoke to me, and I went with her to a public-house—we had a quartern of gin—I had then three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns wrapped in a North-Western time-paper, it being ray intention on Sunday morning to go to Liverpool by the soven-o'clock train—I went to that paper to pay for the gin, and put the paper in ray left-hand trowsers pocket, and buttoned it up—I then went with Mitchell to a house in a court in Field-lane—I agreed to give her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. For the night's lodging—I went to bed with her—when I went in, there was a candle in the room, and a child in the bed—I then undid the paper, and gave Mitchell 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was then 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left in the paper, and I put it in my pocket again—while I was there Burns came in, and asked for the money for the room—Mitchell said she would pay for that, and Burns left, taking the child with her—soon after I laid down with Mitchell, I found her hand in my pocket, grasping the paper—I said I would have none of that, and she made towards the door, dragging me with her—there was a great struggle—I called loudly for the police—Burns came to Mitchell's assistance, and the money was thrown to her—it fell on the ground, and one or more sovereigns fell out—Burns took it up, and made off with it, and escaped—I held Mitchell till the policeman arrived, and she was taken into custody—I returned to the house to find Burns, but there was no one in the house but a child—I went again between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I found Burns and another woman and the child in the bed—I told Burns I wanted her—she made no remark—I told the officer to pick up the time-table in which my money had been, which was in the room.</p>

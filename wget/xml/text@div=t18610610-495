                  </hi>. I live with my father, at 12, Gower-street, North—about 9 o'clock on the evening of Friday, 3d May, the prisoner came for a penny sheet of paper—I gave him one—he gave me a shilling—I looked at it, said I thought it. looked had, and asked him if he had got a sixpence—he said that he had not—I called my father, who took that same shilling up off the counter and took it into the parlour.</p>

I am the father of the last witness, and am a stationer, at 12, Gower-street, North—my daughter called me, and I went into the shop and found the prisoner there—my daughter asked me if I had got change for a shilling—I said I had not—she said, "Have you got a sixpence?"—I said, "No, not for that shilling"—I took it up, just turned it round, and showed it to my wife, saying, "This is a bad shilling,—I took up a pair of scissors and cut it in half—I said to the prisoner, "This is a Bad shilling, and you know it"—he said that he did not know it—a person in the shop seeing a policeman outside, called him in—I dropped one half of the shilling, and then picked it up, and gave the policeman the two halves—there is a step out of my shop into the parlour.</p>

As I was going home I called in at the prose cutor's shop and called for a sheet of paper. The girl was there. I put the shilling on the counter; it lay there two minutes, and if I was a smasher I should never have let the father come and take it off the counter. He took it into the parlour. I did not know, when I was asked, whether I had a sixpence or not.</p>

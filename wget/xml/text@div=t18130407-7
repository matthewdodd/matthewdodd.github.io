She offered a pair of leather breeches for sale. I told her I did not deal in such articles. She left the shop, and in about a minute she returned again. She asked me if I could tell her where she could sell them. I told her I thought Rosemary-lane was a likely place. She turned rather sideways from me, and held up the skirt of her gown to prevent me seeing what she took. I saw her make a grasp of something then on the shelves. She took two shirts; they are in Court. I rised from my seat instantly. I was in the back room. My son, a little boy of seven years of age, met me, and told me that she had stolen something, which I was sensible of myself. He rather interrupted me from going out of the house. I went out of the house as fast as I could. I pursued her, and took her in Rosemary-lane, near the Hampshire Hog, a public-house called by that name. I told her, that she had got two shirts of mine. I found them upon her. She acknowledged that she had been guilty of the crime, and begged me to forgive her. I told her I had been so often robbed, I was determined to punish her. I value the shirts at six shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. MOSES. I am an headborough. I live near Mr. Wells, Mr. Wells gave me the prisoner. I took her in custody. I saw the shirts under her arm when I came up. I asked her how she came by the shirts. She fell upon her knees and begged for mercy. Mr. Wells gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband let me have them things. He told me he would meet me in the course of an hour; he has never come near me since. I thought I had a right to make money of them. I came to London on the 13th of January, from Dublin. He left me the shirts and the smallclothes. I never took the shirts out of the shop. I wanted to make money of them to go home to Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. Are you sure you had these shirts in your shop on the 20th of March - A. Yes. I had them in my shop on that very day. I am sure they are my property.</p>

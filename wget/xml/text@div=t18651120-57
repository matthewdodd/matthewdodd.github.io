                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi>, 237). On Saturday evening, 18th November, about half-past 5, I was on duty in King Street, Deptford, and saw Willborn enter a shop—I followed him, he addressed Pym who was in the shop and asked her if she had got that hoop ready for him—she said, no, it was not ready—she then turned round to go away—I went up to her and said "Mrs. Pym what have you got there?" she turned round and produced 2 of these castings out of her left hand—I then told her I should charge her with receiving them, knowing them to be stolen—she made no reply—I then said to Willborn "I shall charge you with stealing them,"—he said, "I found them,"—I took him down to the factory, which was a short distance off, searched him, and in the waistband of his trousers I found 2 other castings—he said he found those also.</p>

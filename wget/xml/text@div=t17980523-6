             sworn. - I am an officer; I stopped him on Monday night, the 7th of May, at near 12 o'clock, with this bag, a saw, four hens and a cock, at Whitechapel, very near a mile from the prosecutor's house; I stopped him, asked him what he had got there, he said, he had nothing but his own property; and I took him to the watch-house. The fowls appeared as if they had been just killed, they were warm. The next morning the property was advertised, and on Friday, the prosecutor came forward, and swore to them before the Magistrate.(Produces the bag and the saw).</p>
               <p>Walker. I knew the fowls to be mine by the marks; there were two white hens, two speckled hens, and a pye coloured cock. This saw is mine, I know it by wanting a screw in the handle; and the bag is marked W.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Romford, about twelve o'clock at night, past Mr. Walker's house, and the fowls, the bag, and the saw, were thrown at me by somebody, I do not know who.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames-police-constable at the West India docks. On Saturday morning, the 19th of September, it was my duty to open two of the export dock gates, at six o'clock, one on the north side, and the other on the south—I opened the south gate, came across the flosting bridge to the north, and on looking down the dock, saw the prisoner coming from towards the dock, intending to go out, which excited my suspicion, and I observed his hat was rather heavy, and rolling on his head—I went across to him and met him, and asked what he had got in his hat—he said, "Nothing"—You have, and I must see"—he then took off his hat and took out a bladder—I was then about taking hold of it—he sprang two paces, threw it down, and jumped on it—he stooped down, as I thought, to tie his garter, but he took from under his garter this syphon—he took the two up together, and flung them towards the dock, but they did not reach the water—he broke the bladder and spilt the contents—what appeared to me to be a light pale liquid came from the bladder—I have no hesitation in saying it was wine—I smelt it, and tasted it with my tongue—I believed it to be sherry—he ran back again towards the lock where he came from—I then called for assistance, and I and one of the dock servants secured him—I took him over to the dock office, secured him there, and then returned to make further search for the things which he threw away—the syphon and bladder were picked up and handed to me—the blader would hold about six or seven quarts—I found the officer of Customs had got into a light craft, the <hi rend="italic">Caroline,</hi> and he had got out the twenty-fourth bladder when I came up from between the limber boards of the lighter—twenty-four bladders were found in the craft <hi rend="italic">Caroline,</hi> concealed in the limber board, full of the same sort of wine—it appeared the same in colour and taste—here is a sample, from one of the bladders, and there is another sample in Court, from the butt—as far as I could taste and see, it was the same kind of wine as was in the bladder the prisoner had—I licked the bladder and smelt it, and as he held it up it seemed a pale liquid—it was spilt on stone, but there was a puddle of water close by it, and it sunk into that—as I walhed to the dock-office, the prisoner said, "You can't hurt me for it; it is beer"—after he broke the bladder he said he was a poor fellow, and he hoped I would not hurt him—the bladders contained fifteen gallons—the one I took from him was of a middling size—not so large as some of the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Joseph Jackson, a shoemaker, in Brill-row, St. Pancras. On the 16th of September I was in the shop—between half-past one and two o'clock the prisoner came in—I asked what she was looking for—she said, "For a pair of boots"—I said we had not got a pair to fit her—she said, "I see you have not," and went out—I watched her, and saw her take a pair of men's shoes from a frame outside, put them under her shawl, and walk away with them—I went after her, and said, "You have stolen a pair of shoes"—I pulled her shawl on one side, and she gave me the shoes, saying, "I did not want to steal them, only to know the price of them"—I gave her into custody—she had gone past the shop, and past the next door—I brought her back—the shoes are my master's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge by Rivers—she said she had only taken the shoes to ask the price of them—three farthings were found on her—when I came up she was eight or nine yards from the house—she first gave her address No, 5, Gray's-inn-lane—she afterwards said it was No. 12, but she did not know the name of the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I thought the shoes would suit me, and was going in to ask the price, when he ran out, and caught hold of me—I had them openly in my hand—I certainly had passed the door, but not the window.</p>

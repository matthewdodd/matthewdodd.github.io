            . I am clerk to the prosecutor's. On the 8th of June, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise below stairs, I immediately ran down, and saw a young man at the bottom of the stairs; he said there had been thieves in the house, and begged I would pursue after them; I did so, and ran into Aldermanbury, through Church-court, and when I got by the side of the Axe-coffee-house, there was a piece of cloth laying down in the court, which I had seen in the warehouse the night before. When I went up to breakfast at eight o'clock, I shut the door, but two servants had been to the door afterwards, and might have left it open; persons might get into the warehouse without making a noise; the young man ran to the end of the court with the cloth, the prisoner had been stopped, and they were bringing him back; the cloth measures nineteen yards and a quarter, and cost 16 s. per yard. It is worth above 10 l.</p>
               <p>JOB JESSOP. I am porter to Mr. Smith, who lives next door to the prosecutors', the house is in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw. On the 8th of June, the prisoner came in, and asked me for a person named Fell, in the bombazeen way, I said no such person lived there, and I knew no such person, I did not like his appearance, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280034"></xptr>watched him; he went into the prosecutors', I stopped, and saw him come out with a piece of cloth on his shoulder. I immediately locked my door, went into the prosecutors', and alarmed Mr. Hill, and told him to follow with me, the prisoner was out of sight then, I caught sight of him in Three Nunn-court, Aldermanbury, with the cloth on his shoulder, and called out stop him; I immediately saw him drop the cloth and run. I picked it up, and went to the end of the court, and saw him brought back two or three minutes after. I am sure he is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Basinghall-street, enquiring for Mr. Fell, as I heard he wanted somebody; I came out of the gentleman's house, and saw a man with this cloth on his shoulder, I asked him where Fell lived, he said he knew no such person, and asked me to hold the cloth; a man called stop thief, and he ran away, and called me to run too; but as to going into the warehouse I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>JOB JESSOP re-examined. There were two persons on the opposite side to the prosecutors'. When he came out of the warehouse, and I saw him beckon to them; when I was going towards the court these two went down the street; I saw him come out with the cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Gower-street Commercial-road, and am a seaman. On the 24th of June I went to Astley's Theatre—after that, about Westminster-bridge, I met a young man who I believe to be the prisoner by his dross and appearance, but I cannot swear to him—he talked about the theater—I had my hands in my pockets, and my watch in my waistcoat pocket—put his arm into mine, we walked along a few hundred yards, and he said he wanted to go round the corner—I waited a few minutes—he did not make his appearance—I looked round, and saw no one, and proceeded—a short time after that I wanted to see what time it was, and found my watch was gone—there was nothing but the guard left—I had seen the watch not five minutes before the prisoner came up to me—this is the watch I lost—I gave information.</p>

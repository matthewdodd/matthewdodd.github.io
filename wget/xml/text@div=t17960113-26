               <p>THOMAS LONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cooper belonging to the Victualing-office: The prisoner was a <rs id="t17960113-26-deflabel146" type="occupation">labourer and watchman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960113-26-defend305 t17960113-26-deflabel146"></join> in rotation; on the 25th of December, he was watchman at St. Catharine's; about half past eleven o'clock that evening, I met the prisoner in East-Smithfield, he had a bag along side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the Victualing-office? - A. I cannot rightly calculate the length of it, it might be a couple of hundred yards; I heard him speak, and I asked him if that was James, he made me no reply; the second time I asked him, he made me no reply; I passed him and asked again, is that James? Yes, Sir, says he; what have you got here, says I, James? a little corn, Sir, says he; it looks to be comical sort of corn, says I, James; and I put my hand in and took out a piece of beef; I put it in again and desired the prisoner to take it from whence he brought it, which he did with a little reluctance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he put it? - A. He carried it inside the stores; I had the prisoner apprehended, and put him in possession of Mr. Lomas; he is the inspector and resident on the premises, and has the charge of the store-house, in Mr. Rose's absence.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed in Mr. Lomas's presence? - A. Mr. Lomas asked him, and he said first, he found it outside the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to the prisoner, that it would be better for him to tell the truth, or was any sort of expression made use of to lead him to confess any thing? - A. No, not that I recollect; Mr. Lomas came in and asked the prisoner where he got it from.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any threat made use of to induce him to confess? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Not to my recollection; he came without any reluctance, and shewed Mr. Lomas and me the cask where he took it from.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the King's store-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was in liquor, and did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he in liquor? - A. He might be drunk for ought I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I suppose this man had a good character? - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Court. His employment proves he had a good character. Gentlemen, this matter seems so clear, that I think, if you are satisfied, it is unnecessary to call any more witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to hear another witness.</p>
               <p>- LOMAS sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the last witness brought the prisoner to the store-house? - A. No; I was in bed, one of the labourers called me up; when I came down, there was a sack with some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130044"></xptr>beef, but what quantity I don't know; I went to the lobby, where the watchman usually stands, and asked the prisoner how he came to be guilty of such an offence; I could not get a direct answer from him, but he cried and wished me to let him go; I immediately went into the store-house to see if any thing had been plundered, any pickle, or any thing of that kind, that might lead to the plunderer; I searched in vain, with a person of the name of Grove; I went to him at the gate, and told him to come and shew me which cask he had robbed, he pointed it out; I found a cask with one side stripped up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise if he confessed? - A. No; I was rather harsh with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You threatened him with the consequences if he did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being harsh? - A. I spoke sharply to him, and said, come along, and shew me which cask is plundered.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are satisfied, my Lord.</p>

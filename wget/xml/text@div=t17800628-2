               <p>A nursery or private ground? - A private ground. There were threescore carnation plants taken away. I employed a watchman on Friday night the 6th, and on the 10th he took the prisoner in the garden. I was ill in bed; the watchman brought him to me about ten at night. As soon as the prisoner came into the room, he said Mr. Robertson, I have been guilty of a great fault, and I acknowledge it; if you will let me go I will give you fifty pounds, and he went down upon his knees on the carpet; I told him it he would give me a hundred pounds I would not let him go. I asked him who he was and what he was; he would not tell me. I then sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>What was he charged with when he made that confession? - With robbing the garden; the property was found upon him.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I was employed by Mr. Robertson. I was in the summer-house on the 10th of May in the evening; at more than half after nine I saw the prisoner come and look over the sence; it is a sence of lath and boards. He then got over and went to the stage on the right hand, and plucked up the carnation plants by the roots till he got a bundle, then he put them under his left arm, and was coming away with them. I seised him by the collar. I asked him whether he had got what he came after; he begged for mercy. I told him I must take him before my master who employed me to look after him. As we were going along he offered me his watch and all his money to let him go. I told him I did not want his watch or money.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How far was you off when he peeped over the fence? - About two yards.</p>
               <p>Was there a moon? - Yes, about four or five days old; it gave but little light.</p>
               <p>Was there enough of the light of the evening to distinguish his face when you came to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure there was light enough of the evening to distinguish his face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You said it was a little before ten I think? - About half after nine.</p>
               <p>On the tenth of May? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough from the evening to distinguish the man, or was it moon-light? - The twilight and moon made a shadow.</p>
               <p>Without the moon could you have distinguished his face? - I do not know, I believe the moon helped me out.</p>
               <p>(To constitute the offence, of which the prisoner was indicted, it is essential to prove that it was committed in the night. The court being of opinion that the same rule relative to day and night should prevail in this case, as is established in case of burglary, the prisoner therefore was found <rs id="t17800628-2-verdict12" type="verdictDescription">

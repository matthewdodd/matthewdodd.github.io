                  </hi>. I live at 5, Barking-churchyard—a little after 3 in the afternoon of 7th November, I was in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner go up to a carriage which was standing by the kerb, put his arm in at the window, and take a leather bag out—he then walked slowly away—I told the coachman, and he instantly got down and went after him—the prisoner ran then—I stopped till he was brought back, and then the coachman and the policeman asked me if that was the man who took it, and I said, "Yes"—he had dropped the bag, I believe—I did not see him drop it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier—I was just turning down Nicholas-lane, when I saw the prisoner coming along, running very fast, with a leather bag in his hand—there was nobody after him—I made way to let him pass—I thought he was trying to catch a bus or something—I am sure it was the prisoner—that was about 4 o'clock, or half-past, I should think—he was running from Cannon-street to King William-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You said at the Mansion-house that when I was running by you, a gentleman was calling, "Stop thief?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no cry of "Stop thief!"—I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" after you passed me, or I should have stopped you—directly I heard the cry, I turned round and gave chase, followed close behind you, down King William-street to Lombard-street, and you were stopped by some persons just by the post-office—you threw the bag away on your passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. Henry de Lezeu, the owner of the bag, was called on his recognizance; but he did not appear to identify the property stolen, and the Court directed the Jury to acquit the prisoner on that ground.</hi>

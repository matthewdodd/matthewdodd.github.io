                  </hi>. I am master of the boys' school in Marsh-street, Walthamstow. On the 28th of Aug., between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I went to a chapel there—I opened the gate of the chapel-yard, which was locked—I left it open, and went into the chapel—I heard a noise like a person knocking at a door—on hearing it repeated, I went into the girls' school, which is on the other side of the yard—there is a door from the girls' school into the yard—I found that door broken open, and the prisoner was coming from it—he had no right there whatever—I asked what business he had there making that noise—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have been breaking the door open"—he said, "No, I found it so"—I then let him go I observed a piece of slate in his right hand—I went up into the girls' school, and saw a desk which had been broken open—I have seen this bit of slate produced fitted to the marks on the desk, and in my judgment the marks are such as it would have made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Walthamstow. On the 28th of Aug., a little before nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into the chapel-yard—that would lead to the school, but I could not see the school door where I was—he came out of the yard in seven or eight minutes with a piece of slate in his hand—he was running, and threw the slate down—he went in a direction away from his own house—I picked up the slate—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I fitted it to some marks on the desk, and it corresponds with them—the door of the lobby, and of the school room, were both broken open, but there were no marks on them—I think they were opened by his feet—both the locks were disordered, as if the doors had been forced.</p>

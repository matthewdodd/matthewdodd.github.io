                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner being called upon to say whether he had any reason to give, why judgment of Death should not be passed upon him, said,</hi> "My Lord, I came into London on Friday evening and Mr. Gardiner came into the ship and asked me where I was going to board; I told him I had a boarding-house where I was stopping before, named Jacobs; he said that she had left the place altogether; we came up to London in the morning and that man came on board the ship, it was a wet day on Saturday and he stopped all day waiting for the crew and he said "You must come with me for the woman has left the place. I went with him and was four days on shore. I came down and was four days in his house, when I was paid off I went to the office, he had a bit of paper in his hand and said "Are you going to remit your money to me?" I said "I can keep my money myself;" he said "There are a great many robberies about here and it may be picked from you" and I gave it to him. I was paid off the <hi rend="italic">Dunbar</hi> and I went to a man named Davis where I bought some clothes. I waited till 3 o'clock and saw him in his own house and asked him if he was going to settle; he said "There is plenty of time the night is long. I went up to his house and then met him in the public-house and said "Are you going to settle with me, Mr. Gardiner; I want to go to ny mother and father in the morn<lb></lb>ing." I was sitting down in his house about an hour, and I came down to the public-house again and asked him "Are you coming to settle with me or I shall lose the steam-boat in the morning?" He came up and came into his house and said "This <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> is always offending me and he put his back against the door like this. Some of my shipmates were there but they have all gone away. He said, "You owe five days board," wanting to charge me for Saturday, when I only arrived on Saturday night and he said "There is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for putting the heels on your boots." I said that I would not pay it I could get it done for a shilling. He said "There is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the pair of boots you have got on your feet" and he said "You are in my debt." I said "I cannot be for only four days board." He would not settle with me and I went to a policeman and told him of it, in St. George's Highway; he said "You must wait till morning." "I said "I want to have my money before the morning" and the policeman said he could do nothing further. I asked him to come into the house with me and settle for me but he would not, and I went to the public-house; he was there drinking and one of my shipmates was there: I asked him to give me my clothes and I would go home with what money I had in my pocket, he said "Go away you scamp or I will kick your a—" he struck me three times. I said if he kicked me I would summons him in the morning. I am not getting justice, that man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Cohen</hi>) can give me justice if he likes but he wo'nt. He kicked me and turned me out. I went into the public-house, and was drinking, and this man with him, and one of my shipmates and two girls. My shipmates called me in to give me a glass of rum but I would not take it, I was crying. He would not give me my clothes and he</p>

               <p>came outside the door. I asked him if he was going to give me my clothes and he struck me in the pit of the stomach. I went in this manner (<hi rend="italic">stoping</hi>) and two girls said "Are you stabbed?" I could not speak, and they said, "The boy is stabbed." When I came to my senses I said, "I am not stabbed." I heard no more till I was taken by the police. That is all I have to say, I beg for mercy and I know I shall get justice. Have mercy upon me my Lord, have mercy; don't hang me; my father is an old man and I have no one to help my mother and my little brothers and sisters and what am I to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Ryder. The prisoner was in his employ on the 27th of June, to take out tares and sell them in London—he was not to give any credit—he took out 30 bundles, and was to return with 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when he returned I was present, and he brought back only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—my husband asked him where the remainder of the money was—he said he did not know—my husband said then he ought to know, and he must learn him better—the prisoner said my husband might get the money how he could—we have no witness to show that he sold the tares—my husband saw them loaded on the cart—he used to be trusted to sell them, and bring the money home—he has regular customers to sell them to—they are not here—he never said he sold the tares—he produced 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said it was all we should have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody, I apprehended him at Hounslow, and told him he was my prisoner—he said he was glad I had come after him, and he would give himself up, and owned he was wrong, and owned to embezzling the money—he said, "I own I am wrong, and owned to embezzle the money; I am myself in fault"—those were the words—he wished to compromise it; if he could see the prosecutor he would make good the money—I did not ask him if he had sold them—I asked him no questions—I cannot exactly say his words.</p>

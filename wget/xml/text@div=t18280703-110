The two prisoners came to his shop on the 17th of June, between four and five o'clock, to look at some bonnets - Miss Elliott called me down, and Mrs. Elliott told them to go out, as she had nothing to suit them; they hesitated about going - but did go, and then I missed the ribbon; Mr. Elliott went after them - Boyce had been nearest to where the ribbon was; the box was open on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When they came in, did they not point out a bonnet? A. They did not speak to me first, but to Mrs. Elliott; she said, she had nothing to suit them - I had seen the ribbon safe about an hour before; there had been but one person in the shop, but not at that end of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What quantity of ribbon did you lose? A. Four yards; I should think one of them could not have taken it without the others knowledge - they both stood near the counter; they spoke to Miss Elliott about a Leghorn-bonnet.</p>

               <p>Did he run? - No, he was rather too heavy to run after her; I stopped her till Powell came up, then I took her to the watch-house; I saw she wanted to put her hand in her pocket, but I would not let her till I got her to the watch house, and Mr. Henley, the constable, searched her; I saw him take the two rings out of her pocket; she fell on her knees and said, may God send the Devil to come out of hell to fly away with me, if I have the rings! and when the rings were found upon her, I thought we should all have gone.</p>

I first saw him one day at the latter end of August, he brought a bottle, and asked for half a pint of rum - I drew it; he said he must have change for a 1 l. note, or he could not pay me. He gave me quite a new note, as if it had just come from the Bank. I gave him 18 s. 6 d. and 4 d. in halfpence. He took the silver and rum, and went away as quick as possible, leaving the 4 d. on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask who he was - A. Yes, before I changed the note I asked his name and residence? he said his name was Johnson, and he lived at No. 12, Pitt-street, which is by Charlotte-street, about 200 yards from my house. He said,</p>
               <p>"Pitt-street, close by" - I wrote it on the front of the note, in his presence. This is the note - (looking at it). - His going away in that manner, and leaving the 4 d. behind, gave me a suspicion that the note was a bad one, and I wrote the name and address again on the back of it, to be sure of it. It was paid away, and afterwards returned to me from the Bank, stamped forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again - A. On the 30th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, he came again, and called for half a pint of rum, he had a bottle. I began to draw it, and he observed to me that he could not pay for it unless I gave him change for a 1 l. note, I told him I could not, and on looking at him, I recognized him to be the man who brought me the first note I just spoke of - it had been returned then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then do - A. I put my hand in my pocket, pulled out some silver, and said I could give him change. I asked him for the note, he produced and gave it to me - I looked at it, and saw it was one of the same sort he gave me before - it was quite new. I asked him his name and address? he told me it was Jones, No. 4, Charlotte-court; I gave him a pen and ink, laid the note on my book, and asked him to write his name and address on it, he did so, this is it - (looking at it) - it has</p>
               <p>"R. Jones, 4, Charlotte-court;" he wrote it. There is such a place about a hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. This note looks newer than the other - A. They were both alike with regard to newness when I took them. The first went into circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. On his writing his name and address what happened - A. I told him it was a forged note - he said I need not take it without I liked. I sent my brother-in-law,

            , to inquire if there was such a person at No. 4, Charlotte-court; the prisoner said he would go with him, and shew him the house; I said</p>
               <p>"No, I shall detain you until my brother-in-law returns." My brother went, came back, and said in his presence, there was no such person. It was dark; I had lit the gas. I sent my brother for a watchman, the watch was not on. I sent him for a constable, he could not find one; we then agreed to take him ourselves to the watch-house. I went out first, the prisoner followed; I laid hold of his left arm, some others followed behind. He had not got many paces before he threw his arm up, got away, and ran away. I followed, calling Stop thief! the others followed; he ran as far as Newman-street, and ran into the arms of the watchman, who stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bottle - A. I heard it break.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. More than a month elapsed between his first and second coming - A. It might be a little more than a month. I do not do a great deal of business; I see many persons. I observed his countenance the first time. I gave the note to my wife.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. When he came on the 30th of September did you not ask him to write on the note the person's name whom he took it of - A. No such thing; I asked him to write his own name and address.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no part of the name of Stubbs wrote on it - A. There is an S. which is scratched out. It appears as if he began to write Charlotte with an S.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - Never having been in so awful a situation before, I am incapable of making such a defence as the nature of my case requires. I request you will hear the following statement of the fact: - On this evening I admit being at the prosecutor's and tendering the note, but as to the guilty knowledge of its being forged, I solemnly deny. I took it in the regular way of business of a person who gave me his address -</p>
               <p>"R. Jones, No. 4, Charlotte-court;" for making a coat. This, I trust, will account for my calling at the prosecutor's house, so far from home, as I knew they might send for Jones if the note was not genuine. I had met the man in Holborn on the Friday before I went to Smith's, and appointed to meet him this night, at his lodgings. I did not intend to defraud Smith, although I am arraigned on this scandalous charge. Looking at the back of the note, and preceding the C you will find S. I had began to write my own name, but it occurred to me that the person had not endorsed it, but he told me to put that name on it. The hasty conduct of the landlord prevented my putting my own name on it, for when he took it from me, he held it before the candle, and asked me to write on it. I asked if I was to write my own name, or the person's whom I took it of; he gave me a pen, and I wrote the name of the person I had it of, and intended also to write my own. I asked him for some ink, but he took the note and pen up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Jones! this note is bad!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Then do not take it." He sent to see if the address was correct; I told him it was the person I took it of, and that I would go and see if the man was there, he detained me. The man returned, and said there was no such person. While the man was gone for the watchman and constable, the prosecutor told me he had taken two notes of me before, had passed them, and that one was come back. I must leave it to the Jury to say if they think me a man who supports himself in this way. I am wrongfully brought here. The prosecutor says he refused the second note, why did he not detain me then? He gave a statement on a piece of paper, and the attorney, or somebody, has corrected him when they thought him wrong - I hope you will conclude that his statement is groundless. He has said nothing about the middle note here, but it will be found in his deposition. As to my attempting to escape, I must appeal to you, who are husband and fathers as well as me, when a man is charged with what he is certain is false, would you not attempt to escape? I would sooner lose 10 l. than lay in prison one night. I have a wife and four children, and endeavoured to live honestly. I am a tailor, and work being slack, I tried to get jobs for myself. I made no false pretences with the note, nor did I intend to defraud the prosecutor. I know nothing of the first note, and was never in his house before. To see a man's life sworn away is shocking. He never asked me to write my own name, but I intended so to do.</p>

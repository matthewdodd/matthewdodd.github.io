                  </hi>. I live in Gray's-inn-lane, and keep a coffee-shop; the prisoner was in my service about four months. On Tuesday, the 9th of Feb., I delivered to him six sovereigns and one half-sovereign, to take to my baker, Mr. Gadsden, in Leather-lane, to pay my bill—he was to bring back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent him between five and six o'clock in the evening—he did not come back—I did not see him again till the policeman brought him back on the Sunday.</p>

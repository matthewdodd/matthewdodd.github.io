                  </hi>. I am a seaman—between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 22nd of Feb., I was going Into Back-lane, Whitechapel—the prisoner came and took me by my arm, put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and drew out my purse—I saw it in her hand—there was one half<lb></lb>crown in it, I know—I took hold of her hand and held it—she called for ano<lb></lb>ther young woman, who came, and there came up three young men with caps on—they closed round us—the policeman came up, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I have not found my purse.</p>

On that morning I heard, a noise in the Back-road, St. George's—I saw the prosecutor holding the pri<lb></lb>soner by the hand—he said she stole a purse from him, with half-a-crown in it—she said she did not—he had been drinking, but was quite sensible, and sober enough to know what he was about.</p>

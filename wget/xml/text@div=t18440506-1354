On the 22nd of April I apprehended the prisoners, and on the 24th, in consequence of information, I went to a house where I knew they were lodging, and in the garden found this sack buried, containing this quantity of bacon—I had searched the house on the 23rd, and in a cupboard in a front room on the ground-floor, which the landlady pointed out, I found a quantity of bacon—some wheat-chaff was adhering both to the bacon in the sack and that in the cupboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Ashford. I was going home about twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April, and met the prisoners—they went towards Mr. Merrick's premises—at five o'clock the same morning I saw Rose over in Mr. Sherman's field against the pales, and Wig<lb></lb>gins in Mrs. Austin's garden—Rose was about thirty or forty yards from where the bacon was afterwards found, and Wiggins was about twenty yards from Rose, or not so far.</p>

I was at work on Mr. Merrick's premises, at Ashford, on the 8th of April, and about nine o'clock I saw Rose and a female servant put two sides or flitches of bacon into a trough, with some chaff, and leave it—I was there on the evening of the 10th, and it was all right then—on the morning of the 15th it was gone, and the chaff was scattered along the room it was taken from—I directly went, and gave notice to Wheeler, the constable—the chaff now sticking to this bacon is the same sort that the bacon was covered with.</p>

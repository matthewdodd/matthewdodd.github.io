                  </hi>. I live at Geneva Villa, Tulse-hill, and am a photographer—I have known the defendant about three years; he was intro<lb></lb>duced to me by a most respectable gentleman, who I have known for seven years, and who held a responsible situation—the defendant was in the habit of visiting at my house, and I was in the habit of visiting him at his house—he is a married man—there was some disagreement between us with regard to a bill that I sent him in for some photographs—I brought an action against him in the Lord Mayor's Court, and obtained a verdict—the amount I recovered must have been between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen the defendant write—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked A is in his writing—it is slightly disguised—this letter marked B is in his usual writing—the letter marked C, directed to me, is in his writing, and likewise the writing on the photo<lb></lb>graph, which is disguised—on all the envelopes there is an S in the corner and a dash at the side—the postmarks are also alike—after my wife had received letter B, she made a communication to me, and it was while I was considering what steps to take that I received letter C—there is a picture on the back of the paper, of my wife in the garden—I remember taking that picture—I only printed one of that particular view—this would be the one—shortly after receiving this photograph, I applied for a warrant against the defendant, and about three weeks afterwards he was taken into custody—I did not receive any letter from the defendant, except this with the photograph, from the time of the action in the Mayor's Court up to the time the defendant was given into custody—(<hi rend="italic">Letter A, read</hi>) "Mrs. Chappuis, Geneva Villa, Tulse-hill, 7/2/65.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you an Englishman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the prisoner is not a fellow-countryman of mine, I am happy to say—we were on very intimate terms with him for some time—the dispute arose about some photo<lb></lb>graphs after I had shut my door on him; I made a demand of money on him, and he refused to pay it, and I brought an action against him—the dispute commenced when I demanded the money—I found out things about the defendant which showed me that it was better that I should dispense with his acquaintance—the photographs were of his sister and his nieces on horseback—they were not taken at my house—they were taken in the open air, some near his house, and some in another place—he has his niece taken on horseback, it was his suggestion—the defendant paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into court, and said he was not indebted for the remainder—I succeeded in recovering the balance—counsel appeared for both sides—I might have taken six or seven dozen photographs for him—this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the first date here is July 3d, 1863—I took some before that, which were paid for—I delivered the order on 16th May, 1864, with this bill—I was not taking photographs for him all that time—there was only a trifle in July, 1863—I did not send the bill in—the last were taken in April, 1864, and I sent them in in May with the bill—I have seen him write three or four times—I saw him write in his house and in my house—I know his writing as well as I know my own—I believe I saw him write an address in Fleet-street, where I was to write to him in the country—I could not tell you what he wrote in my house—I have received letters from him repeatedly—I saw him after the action was settled—I consulted Mr. Beard, my solicitor, about preferring this charge, and I spoke to Mr. Montague Williams about it, and he told me to wait—I afterwards went to a solicitor—Mr. Beard has not been employed by me before—I knew him by reputation.</p>

               <p>after the action—I saw him while it was pending—he never said then that it was not a fair charge, or anything—I asked him to settle the matter, as it was very unpleasant—I have never received any money from him at any time, neither in the shape of a loan, nor in any way whatever—I could not tell you the date that this photograph was taken from me—I think it was in June, last year—I was either in Norwood, or in Coxhead-lane, at the back of our house—I had several photographs in my purse, unmounted, and the prisoner selected this one and another from amongst them—it was the end of May, or June—I think it was after the action was brought—after my husband had forbidden him the house—I do not think the reason my husband forbade him the house was because he fancied we were too good friends—he said there were many things he had seen which he did not like—my husband never had a suspicion of me, nor has he since—he said there were certain conversations he had had with the prisoner that he did not like, and that he did not think he was a fit man to come to our house—I saw him very many times after that, because he was constantly about there—I did not complain to my husband of his having walked with me.</p>

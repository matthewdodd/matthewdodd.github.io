            . I keep a Shop in Smithfield. On the 5th of Jan. between 7 and 8 o'Clock in in the Morning, the Prisoner offer'd to sell me this Saddle and Bridle, for 3 s. 6 d. I asked him how he came by it, and he said he was employ'd by a Gentleman at the George in Leather-Lane to sell it for him; I stopped it, and went to the George to enquire, and found that what the Prisoner said was entirely false. While I was there the Ostler of the Black-Lion came in, and said he had been robb'd, and I inform'd him that such Goods were offered to me for Sale. On the Friday following the Prisoner came again for the Money and he was taken, and he said then he bought them of a Man the Monday before.</p>

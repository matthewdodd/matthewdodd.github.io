                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Withers, a confectioner, 35, Long-acre—on Sunday evening, 18th September, I was serving in the shop—the prisoner came for a pennyworth of cough drops—he gave me in payment a shilling—I did not observe that it was bad I gave him change, and put the shilling in the till—which was occupied by myself—there was no other shilling in the till—I was the only person serving in the shop that night—I don't know of any way in which any other shilling could have got in that till—on the following morning I received a shilling from my master—I put it in my purse and kept it separate from all other money—I kept it there till Thursday, 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. September—on that day the prisoner came again to the shop; he asked for twopenny worth of horehound drops—he gave me in payment a half-crown—I knew him, and in consequence of that, I gave the half-crown to my master; it was a bad one—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given in custody—I gave the shilling to the constable.</p>

               <p>I am constable of Mury-le-bone Parish; an information came of a robery in Cavendish-square, against both the prisoners, at the latter end of last month; we went to their lodging, and staid till two o'clock in the morning for their coming home; then we let them go up stairs, and followed them into the back garret; there we found these boots on the bed. I saw a pair of new shoes; they said we need not trouble ourselves about the shoes, for they bought them; I said then, I suppose you stole the boots: Thomas made answer, d - n your eyes, that you may find out if you can. I told him I fancied we should find it out; accordingly they were advertised and owned by Mr. Robson on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Question from Thomas. Did I say d - n your eyes, as you said to his Lordship? - Yes. - Did not you take two other men into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150015"></xptr> custody? - Yes, they were going up to see the prisoners; we let them go, and waited till the prisoners came home.</p>

I live at 19, Wellington Street—I am secretary to the Oxford Lodge of the Friendly Society of Stonemasons, the defendant was the former secretary about three months before the 23rd December—on the 23rd December he ceased to be secretary, and left Oxford on that day—he, as secretary, would have cards similar to this in his possession—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Friendly Society of Stonemasons: Received at Oxford. This is to certify that Brother Henry Minton is a legal member of our Friendly Society of Stonemasons. G.U. As witness our hands, 3rd March, 1873.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is customary for the secretary to write the president's and vice-president's names on the cards—I have done it myself—it would give us a deal of trouble to find the president and vice-president when we had to make a card out; and the secretary is also allowed to put the seal to the card when he draws it—I am not aware that secretaries have stamped several cards at the same time—When the prisoner was leaving Oxford, and applied for his card, he was going up to London to work, and I made the card up to 23rd December—I don't recollect his commencing to make a card out for himself—at the time I furnished him with the card on 23rd December, I attached the president's and vice-president's names to it—if the prisoner lost his card, I think he would get another by applying to the Oxford Lodge, where he took it from—there are two descriptions of cards, there is a trade card find a sick card—I made out a sick card for the prisoner first, but I put my pen through "sick, "and made it a trade card—that card would have expired in fourteen weeks from the date the 23rd December.</p>

Yes, they must have unbolted the doors; the only entrance to the cellar from the street would have been through a door and a flap; the door was open, and the flap down; the flap was unbolted at that time. I had been in the cellar five or six times in the morning. I cannot say whether the flap was bolted or not in the morning. We have stairs from the cellar that leads into the shop, and at the front there is another way to get into the cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. What articles in the whole did you lose - A. I lost three suits of clothes, a great coat, four or five shirts, some neck handkerchiefs, and a ring; I had seen them all safe at eleven in the evening in the two pair I had been up stairs; and when I came back at twelve they were gone. The coats were worth about seven pounds; there was one suit of clothes was entirely new that I had never worn. The spoons are here.</p>

I told her to wait till he came in' and when he came in, he said he had got the money at home, that he had received it, but had received none for any other account—this was on the 25th of February—he had not told me that he had received it before, and he said it was the only one he had received—I used to make out a list every Monday morning for him—he always brought me the others—I was astonished that these people were charged him with it, in my presence.</p>

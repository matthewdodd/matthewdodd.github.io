               <p>6. That he was not guilty of the Fact charged in the Said Appeal.</p>
               <p>The Defendant failed in the Proof of his Plea: For it appeared, as to the First, by the Records of the Court, that the former Appeal was quash'd, and so not depending, as the Defendant had pleaded.</p>
               <p>To the Second, It was prov'd by the Prisoner's own Hand-writing, that he had used to write his Name Lewis, as set forth in the Appeal. And further it appeared by the Records of the Court, that he had owned that Name, and had before pleaded, in two former Indictments, the same for Murder, and the other for Bigamy. And besides that he had usually answered to that Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That as to the additional Title of Labourer, he had also pleaded to that Title or Addition, in two former Indictments. To this the Prisoner call'd two Evidences, the one of which depos'd, That he work'd as a Journey-man or Servant, to our Mr. Fradden, and did not carry on the Trade as a Master. The other depos'd, That he was bound Apprentice to him not long before last Christmas: By which is appear'd he was now no other than a Servant and Labourer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As to that Article, That there were no such Persons in natura return, or now existing, as John Doe and Richard Roe, one Evidence depos'd in Court, That there were two such Persons now existing, and living in Middlesex, the one a Weaver, the other a Soldier.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To the fifth Issue, That Solomon Rondeau was not the true Appellant. Mrs. Rondean depos'd, That she had no Children but

That he reply'd,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172410140009"></xptr> Yes: That then he ask'd him, If he knew one Mrs. Rondeau? To which he reply'd, No. That the Prisoner told him, he would show him the House; and would give him a Penny to go thither, and tell Mrs. Rondeau that a Gentleman wanted to speak with her immediately, at the Black Dog Alehonse, in Bishopsgate street. That the Prisoner went with him into Swan Alley, within one Door of Mrs. Rondeau's, and bid him go down the Steps, and ask for her, and do the Message. That he did so, and Mrs. Rondeau said, She would come presently. That when he came out of the House, the Prisoner seem'd to be doing his Needs, and he gave him a Penny, and asked which Way she went, and he telling him towards the Street, he bid him go about his Business. Being interrogated by the Prisoner's Counsel, How he could see him at that Time of Night, so as to know him again? He reply'd, That he saw him plainly by a Lamp, meaning, as he afterwards explain'd it, a Glass light, or Lanthorn, hung up at a Butcher's Stop, near the End of Swan Alley, where the Prisoner talk'd with him: That he had on at that Time whitish Clothes. And being several Times interrogated about it, be constantly affirmed, He was the very Man that had sent him to Mrs. Rondeau's House, that Night and Time the Murder was committed; and that Mrs. Rondeau was the Woman that he did the Message to. And she likewise depos'd, that he was the very Boy that did bring that Message to her. He added, That he knew him again in Newgate, and singled him out at the first Sight, from all the rest, without the least Hint or Intimations given him.</p>

That after the Vomiting was over, she lay motionless and sensless, so that she thought she had been dead, for several Hours after it, and that she was always complaining after that. Being asked concerning her Daughter's Wound in the Throat, if it was haggled, or seem'd to be done with a Sharp Instrument?

               <p>That after he was taken up he sent to her, and she fetch'd a Man to him, he being then in the condemned Hold; and he sent them to pawn a Suit of Clothes, which they did, and gave him 2 Guineas, one of which she changed into Silver; and that when the Man was gone, he desir'd her not to say that he was at her House the Night the Fact was committed. That she went to him another Time, and said to him, Mr. Hussar, I wish you had been sick in your Bed when this happened, because it has caus'd so much Trouble to you, and every Body. That he reply'd, he was not sorry for it; for if it had not happened now, it would have happened at another Time. And this was after he had had his first Trial.</p>

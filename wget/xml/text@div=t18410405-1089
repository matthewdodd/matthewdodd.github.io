                  </hi>. I am eight years old; the prisoner is my mother. In February last I lived with her at No. 8, Molyneux-street—a man named Addis used to live with her—on Saturday, the 27th of February, about by bed-time, I was standing in the room, and she took up the tongs and beat my head—I do not know why she did it—I had not done any thing to her</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jones, and rent this house. The prisoner was a lodger of mine for upwards of twelve months—she lived with a man named Addis—she had two children when she first took my place, as a widow—this little girl came with her originally—I saw the child when Simmonds was about to take it away—its head was cut very much indeed—I have often heard the child cry—I do not know any thing about the Saturday evening in question—I was not in the room—I did not see the cut on the child's head till the Friday when she was taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the child at Marylebone workhouse, on Friday, the 5th of March—there was a wound on the head in the process of healing, and on the left side a smaller wound, which I afterwards saw when the head was shaved—I think the wound in the process of heal<lb></lb>ing might have been inflicted with a pair of tongs—the child has been in the infirmary ever since.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. About half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday, the 19th of January, I saw Newbury go down Mr. Cox's area steps, the other two prisoners stood a few yards from the area talking together; I knew Stevens and Chidley before - I watched them; saw them running after Newbury, who had come out of the area, and was walking fast towards Five-fields, they got up to him, and all went together across Five-fields; Newbury crossed a ditch, and Stevens threw a small bundle after him, he and Chidley then crossed; I followed them into the Old King's-road - I then went down the New King's-road, still having them in sight, except for a moment. I got them in view again, and in the Old King's-road, Chidley looked towards me; then I saw them all three engaged in putting something under some dirt; I saw Newbury put something white under an old tree, and Chidley kicked some dirt over it, to hide it; I got Wilson to assist, and took Chidley and Newbury - I got hold of Stevens, but he made his escape; I took them back to the tree, under which I found the lid of the teapot.</p>

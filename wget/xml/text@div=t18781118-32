Lovibond, brewers—on 29th January last I was at Princes Gate with the dray, and saw the prisoner—he asked if I had a price-list with me, and when I gave him one he ordered a cask of beer to go to Mrs. Manning, 15, Princes Gardens—he handed me a small card with the name "Montrose" on it, as butler—I delivered the cask, and the prisoner signed this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I thought I was supplying the beer to Mr. Manning—I would have supplied it to the prisoner by paying on delivery—I would not have supplied him, coming to me in that way, unless it was for Mr. Manning—it was under the belief that the beer was for Mr. Manning that I parted with it—on the 4th February following I delivered another nine gallon cask—I debited that to Mr. Manning.</p>

Lovibond were much surprised that he had been making use of his employer's name, and wanted an explanation of it—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and had he not been dismissed summarily he intended to pay for it—he promised to come the next day and explain it, but did not</p>

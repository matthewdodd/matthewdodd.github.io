            . I am a wine-merchant, and live in the Haymarket. Lord Colerain requested that a horse might be put up at Tattersall's in my name; it was put there for sale on the 17th of November-the next day the prisoner called on me and asked the price of it. After some conversation, I agreed to take 28l. for it-the prisoner desired it might be sent to his stables, in Landsdown-mews, Guildford-street-he was to pay for it on delivery. I sent it by Lord Colerain's servant, and ordered him not to leave it without the money. About five o'clock in the evening the prisoner and servant came to me; the prisoner produced a cheque to settle for the horse. I told him it was not dated-he said the bankers were not open that day, and it would not be paid that day. He went away with the servant, saying he would get the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not at your house at one o'clock - A. I am not sure. He only came once.</p>

            . I am servant to Lord Colerain. On the 17th of November, as I was bringing the horse from Tattersall's, the prisoner stopped me, and said he should like to purchase it - I referred him to Mr. Thomas. After that, Mr. Thomas told me to take it to Mr. Wilson's, in Landsdown-mews, and not to deliver it without the money. I took it on the Wednesday, which was the day the Princess Charlotte was buried, about eleven o'clock. The prisoner said he had not enough money, but had sent his servant to the Bank of England with a cheque - I was to stay till he returned - He returned in about a quarter of an hour after he went out; I saw him go out as I took the horse in. He told the prisoner that the Bank was shut up, and he could not get it. The prisoner said he had not got money enough, but would go to Mr. Thomas with me, which he did, and told him he had sent to the Bank of England with a cheque, and could not get it paid. Mr. Thomas looked at it, and said it was no wonder, as it was not dated. He said, he saw his error, why it was not paid, and would go and rectify it. I went as far as Coventry-street with him; when we got to the corner of Rupert-street, he said, "this is my way, for I have got to be at a place by eleven o'clock," and went away. I set off to Landsdown-mews as fast as possible, found the horse was gone, and have never seen it since. When the officer took the prisoner, he said his name was not Wilson. We went to the Mevy six or seven days before we could find him - We took him on a Sunday. I had not agreed with the prisoner to bring the horse at all - I did not hear him send his servant to the Bank.</p>

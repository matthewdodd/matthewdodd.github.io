On the evening of the 10th, or the morning of the 11th of November, we lost 4 cwt. of loaf sugar from the lump-room, in the sugar-house. Our servants sleep in the dwelling-house, communicating with that room, it is not under the same roof - we have two ways into the sugar-house, one from the street, one from the yard, and a third from the men's apartments. I cannot say when I saw the sugar safe. The persons had entered at the garret windows of the sugar-house; nobody slept there, I saw the sugar on Sunday morning at Lambeth-street office, and knew it by marks on it.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutors. I saw the sugar safe between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of November - I saw Mr. Dempsey's brother fasten the warehouse up about five o'clock; it was not dark then, the garret windows were shut and fastened with a button inside. Between six and seven o'clock the next morning, I heard the sugar was stolen; I went to the garret window, and found it open and some things in disorder<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050007"></xptr>- I missed, I thought about forty loaves; they weigh from nine to eleven pounds each, they had been taken out through the garret window - I saw them that day at Lambeth-street office, and knew them by the marks; they got them out at the window, they must have carried them through Mr. Herbert's empty warehouse, they could then get down stairs into the street - half a square of glass was taken out at the garret window, there was then room to put a hand inside to undo the button - the window was quite taken out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 11th of November, at a little past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoners very near the prisoner Newman's house; I went into that house, they were then a little way from the door; I went into the front room and up stairs, seeing the stairs were very dirty, and found a quantity of sugar there, neither of the prisoners came in - I came down and called Freeman, my brother officer in; they were then in a little place close by, standing by some harness. He bought them in, neither of them had their hats on, Newman had neither waistcoat or handkerchief. I told him to put his things on to accompany me; I handcuffed the other prisoner, and asked where his hat was, he said he had none, I said "You must have a hat," he then said it was up stairs; Freeman went up and brought one down, he said that was not his; I asked where it was, he said up in the bed or on the bed, I do not know which - Freeman brought another down from the room the sugar was in, which he said was his, and put it on. Newman's clothes were in the lower room on the ground floor; there was a bed in the room, I do not know who lived in it. The sugar could not be carried by one man, nor two, all at once; this place was about 150 yards from the prosecutor's. I examined the premises, but cannot say how many persons had been there; there were footmarks on the lead, but I cannot say whether it was from one or more persons. The prisoners said they knew nothing about it; the room it was in was open, I believe there was a lock on the door and the key was in the lock.</p>

            . I am an officer. Foster's account is correct; I went up stairs for the hat, Wiggins at first said he had no hat, Foster said "You must have a hat," he then said it was up stairs. I did not know that either of them lived there till that morning; I have seen them in the same room at a public-house together, I cannot say they were in company. The first hat I brought down he said was not his; I found his own among the bedclothes - Newman occupied the ground floor; there are only three rooms, the other room was empty. I think one person could not have carried the sugar away, as it must be deposited in two or three places before it could be got away; they must have drawn a ladder from the sugar-house up to the garret windows, the garret is on a level with the windows; it must have been carried along the leads and through the tiles into Herbert's warehouse, and down by a loose ladder to the first floor; then the ladder must have been shifted and carried down to the bottom floor of the warehouse, which is where they first entered, and from that to Newman's, is 150 or 200 yards off. I think it is impossible for them to be carried into Newman's house without his hearing it; if it was carried when it was light, they must be liable to be seen by people - Newman's bed-room is on the right of the ground floor passage.</p>

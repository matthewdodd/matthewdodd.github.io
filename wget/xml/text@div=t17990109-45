I cannot say which, and offered me a pinch of snuff, saying, she was always afflicted with a head-ach; then she went out of the shop, and had not been gone above two minutes, before I asked my nephew whether he knew these ladies or not, and, in consequence of some conversation with him, I went out to see if I could see them; the laces were then missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them before you went out, or was it after you came back that you made the discovery? - A. Before I went out. On the 7th of December she came again with another lady, who is housekeeper to a Mr. Gayter, and then we detained her.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss? - A.Twenty-seven yards and a quarter, to the value of 12l. 12s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen the lace since? - A. No; I am convinced it was taken by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they converse together? - A. One of them went out a little before the other; the prisoner went out first.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for this lace? - A. That is the neat value of it in my stock book; I had taken stock but four days before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is any body else concerned in business with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are a silk-mercer and a linen-draper; is it common for a linen-draper to sell these kind of articles? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not you, but your nephew, that served them with the articles they required? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, while he was in conversation with them, go up stairs? - A. I did not, I was in the shop all the time they were there.</p>
               <p>Q.Between the time you suppose she took the lace, and the time she was apprehended, had she not been in your shop? - A. I had not seen her.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not heard that she was? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that she was apprehended, you took her up upon suspicion of another charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She underwent three examinations before she was committed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge exhibited against her then was for stealing muslin, which turned out afterwards not to be stolen? - A. My nephew shewed her some muslin; he shewed her four pieces to the best of his recollection, and he could find but three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the woman whom you charged to have stolen a piece of muslin, as the companion of the prisoner, discharged by the Magistrate? - A. She was; this was the woman that took the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was also dismissed from that complaint - that is, she was only committed for stealing the lace? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was she not committed for stealing the lace, and not for the muslin? - A. I do not know that; they were not both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate tell you, in my presence, and in my hearing, that there was no pretence for charging a felony as to the muslin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not both you and your nephew swear, that, to the best of your recollection, there was not a piece of muslin stolen? - A. He swore, that, to the best of his recollection there was a piece of muslin stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that it was in consequence of your not being able to substantiate the offence respecting the muslin, and that there was no such offence committed; that you went upon the lace? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding they were dismissed of that complaint at Bow-street, did you not go before the Grand Jury, and there, upon your oath, found an indictment for that muslin, which was to affect the life of this woman? - A. There it stands upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention one word of the lace at Bow-street till the second examination? - A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath will you undertake to swear, that at the first examination you charged her with stealing any thing except the muslin? - A. The first examination was for the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q.Then was it not after you found that you were unable to substantiate the charge for the muslin, that you brought forward this charge of stealing the lace, as long ago as October? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you missed twenty-seven yards and a quarter of lace - do you say that from a knowledge of the fact from your own mind, or from your book? - A.From both.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have undertaken to swear you had lost that identical quantity, unless you had looked at your book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090047"></xptr>Q. Did you go before a Magistrate to give any information till two months after the offence? - A. I went to Bow-street the next day to give information.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any Magistrate there? - A. No; only the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Your nephew was the person who served them? - A. Yes; but I took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might have been in year shop between the time of their coming and your missing the lace? - A. No person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that there was another woman came to inquire for some nankeen, before you missed the lace? - A. No; I have not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, when you were taking that woman, and the other woman, to Bow-street, any thing particular that you said to your nephew? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to your nephew, when he said he could not swear to the loss of this lace, that he must be a stupid fool? - A.Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet your nephew was the man that served in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your nephew then say, as he was determined to say nothing but the truth, he would not swear to it for you or any body else? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when they were taken for the muslin, you would be d-d, if it cost you three hundred pounds, if you would not hang them? - A. It was not in my power to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, at Bow-street, that at the time the people were in the shop, purchasing the lace, you were up stairs, and were called down by a private signal? - A. No; that was at the time we were serving the muslin.</p>
               <p>JOHN HART sworn. - I am nephew to the prosecutor: On the 12th of October; the prisoner at the bar, with some other lady, came in to buy some muslin, and I sold them half a yard, and they paid me for it four shillings, to the best of my recollection; and as they were going out of the shop, there laid some white laces upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they in their reach at that time? - A. They were; they bought two yards of it; and she put her purse in her pocket again, and the other woman paid for it; then the prisoner said, they were nice laces, she should like some too; she agreed for two yards of it, and when she had so done, she took out her purse to pay for it, but she did not pay for it, the other woman paid for it; as she was putting her purse in her pocket, there laid a piece of white lace doubled upon the counter; I observed that the drew it with her purse, as if she was going to put it in her pocket; I put my hand upon the lace, and looked her hard in the face, but when I took it from her I had no idea she had done it with an intention of stealing the lace; there were two particular broad laces lay very near the rest, which I missed about five minutes after they were gone, or less; both together made twenty-seven yards and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time this woman came into your shop, was there any other person in the shop besides you and your uncle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are perfectly sure of? - A. That I am very clear of.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was in five minutes that you missed the lace - did any body come in during that five minutes? - A. No soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went after the woman, you or your uncle? - A. My uncle; and, in the mean time, I was folding up the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you perfectly sure that nobody could have taken any lace from that counter but them? - A. I am sure they could not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Does the parlour adjoin your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your uncle in the parlour while they were there? - A. I rather think he might.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you could not tell the number of pieces that you had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you taken stock? - A. About a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not carry in your head the particular quantity of lace in each piece of lace? - A. That is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what quantity of lace was missing you could not tell, but by referring to your books? - A. As to these laces I can answer, because they were particularly broad laces.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you heard your uncle examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, when you went to Bow-street, you did not say a word about this lace till the second examination? - A. I believe it was mentioned the first time; when she came into our shop the second time, I told my uncle I suspected she was the person that had taken the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected her - now do you mean by that, to say more than this, that you suspected she was the person? - A. I only suspected her to be the person.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor.) Q.Look at the prisoner, are you satisfied, or not, that she was the person that came in? - A. I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am totally innocent of the charge that is alledged against me.</p>

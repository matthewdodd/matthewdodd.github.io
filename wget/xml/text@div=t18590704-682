                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 226). I have endeavoured to get Fanny Bates here, but cannot—she was not before the grand jury—I was sent to the hospital for her on the night of 28th—she was in the hospital—I saw a wound upon her; it was a cut on the right side of the cheek—I brought her to the police-station, where the prisoner was—in his pretence she said, "That is the man that <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it;" and he said, "Yes, I stabbed her with a shoemaker's knife, and I threw the knife away after I had done it"—I am sure he said that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You were not the man that took me into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No;—another constable did—you said to me when I came into the station on the 28th about 11 o'clock, "Is she hurt"—I said, "Not much, I think;" and you said, "I stabbed her with a knife, and then threw the knife away."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How deep was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The surgeon said it was about an inch in length, and the knife had gone through the cheek and touched the tongue, but it was not dangerous—I could not find the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Tuesday, 28th, I was working till half-past 8. I used to live in Clerkenwell; but I removed from there to get out of the way of my wife. I got fresh work. On this night I had to go to Clerken-well; I called at my wife's sister's house—I rang the bell—a man came up and said, "If you come to my house again, I will give you in charge". I went there on Sunday again, and asked the landlady if Mrs. Bates lived there—she said, "Yes." The man then came up and asked me what I wanted, and said if I came there again he would give me in charge. My wife, as I was going away, blackguarded me. I felt very exasperated. I have a letter here which I wrote to my cousin about her. I did not strike her with a knife; it was a nail which had been sharpened. My wife has been living with another man from the time I left her.</p>

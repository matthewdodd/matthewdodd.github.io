I know that your Royal Highness cannot suppose that I intended any grievous bodily harm. My services in the field will, I hope, plead in my behalf against anything unbecoming the conduct of an officer and a gentleman. But for years I have been brooding over my wrongs until they had produced in me uncontrollable morbid imaginings. In this state of mind and feeling I came upon your Royal Highness, when I thought the moment had arrived for bringing my case before the public. Goaded on to the verge of madness, I committed the rash act; not to injure your Royal Highness, but to seek occasion of ventilating my wrongs. I do not seek by this letter to mitigate my offence, but simply to perform an act which, as a gentleman, I feel myself bound to do, regardless of all consequences. I regret deeply to have caused your Royal Highness the slightest inconvenience, and from my heart I deeply deplore it, not because of the punishment I so justly deserve, but for having given any annoyance to your Royal Highness. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES S.

His Royal Highness has said,—'He ran at me and struck me as hard as he could on the chest with his clenched fist' I did step back one or two paces as His Royal Highness was advancing, and then struck his Royal Highness a harder blow than I at all intended, but certainly not with my full force. With regard to Colonel Armstrong's evidence, I will only say that he is entirely wrong in stating that I struck the Commander-in-Chief on the back. That is disproved by the Com<lb></lb>mander-in-Chief himself and by the evidence of the police-constable. I never struck His Royal Highness on the back. I shall endeavour now to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020022"></xptr>
               <p>deal with the evidence of the Assistant Military Secretary. Colonel Hawley commences his statement by showing that I served sixteen and a half years as a subaltern, thirteen and a half years abroad. The memorandum then shows that in October, 1871, I applied to realise the value of my commission. This is the case. I was offered an exchange into a regiment of the Line, with a view to the lieutenant purchasing succeeding me, the captain exchanging coming on the half-pay list in my place. I submitted this exchange for approval, but was informed by direction of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, that it could not be allowed as there was a supernumerary captain in the regiment. I wrote again, venturing to point out that the number of captains would not be influenced by the exchange, and stating, further, that the captain desirous of exchanging with me had been but recently appointed, to the Staff—an appointment he was likely, in the usual course, to hold for five years, rendering him unavailable for regimental duty for that period, while the lieutenant purchasing the step, and succeeding me, would be available. I was not well off—having no means beyond, what my profession afforded, and it was an object to me to sell before the Army Bill came into force. I applied often that my retirement might be allowed in the manner I describe, bringing forward past services and every claim I possessed in support of my request; but my appeals were not listened to. I then applied to sell my half-pay commission; but it is a long story, and I would rather not go into it. Colonel Hawley's memorandum next states: 'In the interval he wrote numerous letters asking for a step of rank on retirement.' On the 24th of July, 1871, he says it was too late then to do anything for me, for I was no longer in the service; nevertheless, as the memorandum states, 'after he had left the army'—speaking of me—'he reiterated his claims to a step of rank, and to be brought back into the Army to obtain it.' This is the truth, for up to my retirement I did not cease to ask for a step of brevet or honorary rank, bringing forward every claim I possessed in support of my request, and it was after receiving the value of my commission I wrote the letter from which the Military Secretary quotes. But after writing that letter I received a communication from the Military Secretary, written a few days previous to my retirement, from which I concluded that the honorary rank would be conferred, although I saw clearly that the brevet rank would not. But this letter I did not receive for weeks after it had been written, owing to my having left London, and it was after receiving it I renewed my application, the rank not appearing on my retirement being gazetted. Without following Colonel Hawley through many portions of his memorandum, and which, if I were to take them separately, would occupy the Court longer than I desire, I will state that from the time of receiving the Military Secretary's letter referred to I renewed my application for a step of rank, and to be brought back into the Army in view of being gazetted out with it, bringing forward cases of men having been restored, mentioning one case in particular, where an officer of superior rank, who had resigned his commission to avoid trial by court-martial for behaving badly before the enemy at Cawnpore, was brought back into the Army to be gazetted out with a benefit conferred which he could not otherwise have obtained. I submitted that, if this man who did not do his duty were brought back to have a favour conferred on him, I, who was recognised as having done my duty, might at least with equal justice be brought back for a similar purpose; and I further submitted that although no longer in the service my claims were still as strong as before I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020023"></xptr>
               <p>was gazetted out. About this period (and here is the secret of part of the injustice I so often and so long complained of) I received a communication, dated the 26th of August, 1872, and signed <hi rend="italic">"J.</hi> B. Johnstone," written by direction of the Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief; its chief purport being His Royal Highness, although consenting to your application of the 2nd and 18th of May being considered as cancelled, in no way admitted your claim to receiving a step of Brevet or honorary rank, which were fully considered on your being promoted in 1869." Now, in the first place, the Commander-in-Chief must have been misinformed about these applications, as I have never requested they might be considered as cancelled; nor did I at any time, previously or subsequently, ask that I might be allowed to withdraw my application for a step of brevet rank on retiring. But one of my greatest causes of complaint was that while the Commander-in-Chief should, time after time, tell me he was fully sensible of the good service I rendered at Cawnpore, he should never have shown me any substantial appreciation of those services. I am told, but I can never admit it, that when promoted to a half-pay company, my services were rewarded. It is a hard and ungenerous thing to tell me this. I shall not again go into those services, but I can say that if I had never been commended for conspicuous conduct in the field; if I had never seen a shot fired in action; if I had never served 13 1/2 years abroad; if my health had never given way through many a severe illness during a long service in India, obliging me to return home on sick leave with an impaired constitution,—in fine, had I never served a day out of England, and had I simply gone to the Commander-in-Chief and said, 'I have served 16 1/2 years as a subaltern, give me a half-pay company,' His Royal Highness could not, without doing great injustice, and without promoting a junior over my head, on the next half-pay company being filled up, refuse my request, on the grounds of long service alone, and it was to my field services, in addition to these, I looked for some little recognition, in the shape of a step of rank on retiring from the Army. It was hard to go on half-pay after being four years the senior lieutenant of my regiment, and with one exception, of the whole Army; and with such long subaltern service as I possessed—giving up all hope of promotion, and becoming a poorer man than I was before. But my health was broken, and finding I could no longer perform subaltern's duty, I renewed my application for a half-pay company, which I had previously withdrawn. But I am told in a leading paper that my failing to obtain the rank of major seems to have been the sole cause, as it states, of my 'bitterness.' It is true I asked for this rank, and was greatly disappointed that my request was not granted, but I had other causes of complaint greater than this: I had long complained of a rule of the service having been broken through. When on the death of a captain of my regiment a junior officer was promoted by purchase to the death vacancy, and afterwards when a captain of the regiment was pro<lb></lb>moted without purchase, the vacancy thus created was sold to an officer fifth on the list of lieutenants. I complained of these wrongs till I found myself drifting into expressing my feelings in language stronger perhaps than I ought to have used, telling the Commander-in-Chief that I had been twice robbed of promotion that I should in fairness and in justice have succeeded to. I hoped that an inquiry would be made, that the Com<lb></lb>mandor-in-Chief would, in fairness to me, direct an inquiry, and cause the result to be made known to me. This was never done, and I left the Army feeling that the step of rank I sought, which was refused me, was but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020024"></xptr>
               <p>another act of wrong and injustice added to the many already inflicted on <hi rend="italic">inc.</hi> I searched in my mind for a reason for all this; I had performed my duty honestly and devotedly in quarters and in the field; and 1 was at a loss to know why so much injustice should have been done me, and my thoughts dwelt on these things, driving me at last into an act which I could not believe it were possible I could ever have committed. I tried every means I could think of to bring my case before the public, but all my efforts were unavailing. It is needless for me to say that I bore no malice towards the Commander-in-Chief. In my last letter to His Royal Highness this feeling is expressed. That short letter is included in Colonel Hawley's memorandum; only he has omitted the last few words; but I will ask permission to read them, for it is unfair to hold back any portion of that short letter. The memorandum says:—' The following answer was received, and it is his last communication, "I have no longer hope of justice from your Royal Highness, you have wronged me to the utmost limits of your power;" the memorandum omitting the remaining words, 'but I bear your Royal Highness no malice.'" These latter words were and are still the words of my heart. I plead for no mitigated sentence. I ask only that it may not be believed that any malicious feeling prompted the act for which I stand here. No man in England would hurt the Duke of Cambridge. I myself would cheerfully shed my blood for any member of the Royal Family, and this has ever been my feeling. I cannot recall the past; I can only say that I am deeply sorry for what has happened. The object of the assault was to oblige the Commander-in-Chief to direct my arrest, my last, and the only, hope left to me of bringing my wrongs before the public. I am punished, and shall be further punished for the act I have committed, but some day the Duke of Cambridge will forgive me freely from his heart."</p>

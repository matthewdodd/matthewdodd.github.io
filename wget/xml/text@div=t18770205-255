                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jeffery, and live at 1, Wellington Place, Old Woolwich Road—I did not know the prisoner before Thursday evening, the 9th November last, when she brought a child to me—she said she had brought the baby to me to nurse—she did not say it was her own, but my daughter had previously told me so—she did not say how long I was to have it, she was to come every Sunday evening to see it, she came the following Sunday evening—she appeared to be very fond of the child—I found I could not manage the baby with my family, and on Sunday, 10th December, I told her to take it away as soon as she could—she said she would come on the" Thursday, the 14th, if she could—she did come and took it away, she said she had got two persons who were going to adopt it, she did not tell me who they were; I asked if it was far off, she said "No, not far off"—she said she was not to see it very often—I did not ask their names—I put on the child's outside clothing, it had been dressed all day—I had dressed it myself except its frock which I put on that night; it had on a chemise, flannel stays, a flannel petticoat with a body to it, a white petticoat, a red cotton frock with a body to it, and a pelisse; it had no roller; the flannel stays were of a double thickness—the child was six weeks old when I had it—it was very well when it was' taken away; it had been very well all day; ft seemed easy—I had not used any needle in dressing it, it was all hooks and buttons, and ties—the prisoner went away with it, just before 7 o'clock—she brought it back again just before 10 o'clock, the child was then screaming and crying very much; she knocked at the door and said "There is something the matter with this child"—I said "I don't know what can be the matter, perhaps the night air has made it ill"—my husband was—in the back-room and hearing the child scream, so he called out to me to take it to the doctor's—the prisoner said she had got some medicine to give it, a teaspoonful every four hours—I saw the medicine in a bottle in her hand, but I did not give it any, none was given to it in my house, the bottle was full, I don't think any had been given—she gave it to me to give to the baby—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she said she had it from Dr. Cavanagh's, at Deptford—I told the prisoner she had better come with me with the baby to the doctor's, and we both went to Mr. Howell's, he was not in, I waited for him, but the prisoner went home and left me there with the baby—I knew she was in service; she had to go home—I waited till Mr. Howell came in, and he gave me a powder; I then took the child home and began to undress it; it was crying and screaming all his time—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187702050084"></xptr>
               <p>it was an irritable child—the prisoner carried it to the doctor's, when she left I brought it home—I had no needle sticking in my dress, I had not used one that day—when I undressed the child I found something at the side; I thought it was a bone; that its ribs were broken—I felt it through the clothes; I did not see anything till the doctor came—I unfastened its clothes, I sent for Mr. Howell directly, he came and in my presence be took a needle from the body of the child at the spot where I had felt a lump; there was some bleeding, it was fresh done, it was not dry—after the needle was drawn out, I poulticed the side and she was quiet—it was a little drowsy when it came into the house, but it woke directly and screamed very much—on the following Saturday, I was fetched to go to the prisoner with the doctor; I heard her say that she did not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the child under my charge about six weeks—during that time the prisoner gave me some nursery pins in order to pre<lb></lb>vent the pins running into the child; that was when she first brought the child—needles are used to mend a child's clothes, but I never mended them, they were all mended before they came to me; they were nearly all new; they did not want mending—it had on a new frock that night; it was brought with the other things, but it had not been used—I had not used a needle on this night to sew up the roller band—the stays were tied—the child was often cross; I thought it was ill by the screaming—I did not know Dr. Cavanagh—I never saw him before—I don't know anything about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had put the new frock on myself with the other things—I did not notice any needle sticking in it.</p>

When the prisoner took away the child, I did not ex-peot her to come back again—she did not take any clothes with it; she said another time would do for them, she would see me and settle with me another time—when she came back, she said she was too late to meet the persons she was to meet at the station, and she said she would come on the Friday or Saturday evening for it—I had never opened the new frock before it was put on that night—it was folded up with the rest of the cloth<lb></lb>ing in a bag.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am practising as a surgeon at Lewisham and Deptford—in September I was called to see the prisoner at St. Donnett's Road, where she was in service—I discovered that she was in the family way, and advised her removal to the infirmary—T was sent for by her mistress; she gave her a very good character, and said she would take her back after the affair was over—that was the first occasion on which I was called to the house—I attended the family next door, where Eliza Jeffery lives—after she came out of the infirmary I think I met her in the street, or she came to my surgery—I can't remember where I saw her—I had a few moments' conversation with her—she told me she was all right; nothing was said about the child—on Thursday, 14th December, she brought the child in her arms to my surgery about 9 o'clock—she said it was suffering from convulsion fits—it was screaming, and its screams were uncontrollable—it was not Screaming then; it was quiet—I examined it, and prescribed some medicine for it, and told her to bring it again—she had it in her arms—I did not take it from her—the medicine was made up in my surgery, and she tendered half a sovereign to pay for it—it was chloral and bromide, a mere sedative, supposing the child was suffering from irritation of the spinal cord and brain—my dispenser made it up—I did not notice whether it was full—I have seen the bottle since and tasted it—I have no reason to think that it is anything else than the prescription—it tastes exactly as it would taste—I should think none had been given; there might have been a dose—it might evaporate if the bottle was frequently uncorked, or it might not have been full when it was made up—I told her to give it every four hours, and to begin directly she went home—she did not give it any in my surgery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Matilda Place, East Greenwich—on Thursday, 14th December, I was sent for to the house of Mrs. Jeffery—I had seen her at my surgery previously about 10 o'clock, with the child—it was suffering from some pain that I could not at all discover—it was screaming—I gave her a composing powder to take away—the powder gave it no relief, and I was sent for about 10 o'clock the same evening; it was then screaming—I could account in no way for the violent screaming—finding no appreciable cause, I ordered it to be stripped—it was in Mrs. Jeffery's arms—I then examined it, and found between its ribs a small projection, at least a small spot, as if something had been inserted—I placed my finger over it, and while the child screamed the needle pressed against my finger; it was on the left side, between the sixth and seventh ribs—I then made an incision, and the violence of the scream forced the needle out about half an inch; the other part was held very tenaciously indeed by the integuments beneath, and I extracted it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187702050086"></xptr>
               <p>with some little difficulty, comparatively speaking, with my fingers—the needle was about an inch and a half long—it was not immediately in the region of the heart; if it had been an inch longer it must have gone directly into the heart—it had entered perfectly straight, as if it had been thrust in, at right angles with the body—I did not feel anything of the needle before the child was completely stripped—I did not make any minute examination of any of the clothes, except when it was stripped, I saw some fresh blood—that would come from the aperture; the needle was closely embedded in the skin; it must have been forced in with considerable violence—I could not have seen any hole, that would not have been possible—I cannot conceive how it could be possible for the needle to be pushed in through the clothes; it would have gone in the direction of the ribs, and gone in a slanting direction into the integuments—that was the opinion I formed at the time, having extracted a number of needles in my practice, and I never met with one passing in that direction; it has always been in a sloping direction in accidental cases—in my opinion this could not have been an accident; if the needle had been pushed through the clothes I cannot account for its being embedded right to the head in the skin—I feel certain it never could have entered so deeply if it had gone through the clothes first, because the point of the needle must have entered the dia<lb></lb>phragm, or it never could have been held so tenaciously, and the screaming of the child would have prevented the needle passing so deeply, because the moment it was released it sprang out to the extent of half an inch—I do not think the needle could have been pushed through all the clothes and been in the position in which I found it—the clothes must have been raised up and the needle put in underneath—it had on a roller tied with tapes, the usual band that children wear—the needle was underneath that—the band could be raised sufficiently high to put the needle in; the clothes were so loose that before I had to strip it they could be raised half the width of the band; they were loosely tied; the only thing in the shape of a pin was a brown pin in the napkin—I examined carefully to see if there was any other needle about the clothes, and there was nothing of the kind—I communicated with the police within half an hour, the conviction on my mind was so clear—I heard at the police-court the expression of opinion from Dr. Cavanagh, but I still hold my own opinion.</p>

               <p>course of my great experience I have never known of a needle entering into a child's heart and not causing death—I do not know that on many occasions such a thing has happened—I never heard of a needle being extracted from the heart, and if I did, I should not believe it; I heard Dr. Cavanagh make the statement, but not upon his own experience, it is the experience of another that he states—I never read of it, and I have read as many medical works as any medical man ever read—I never heard of a case where a needle has entered the heart and had been extracts d—great force must have been employed here, it must have been a strong thrust with the hand, because a needle will not enter so readily into the integuments as people imagine—I could push it in with my finger and thumb so that it would be covered by the skin—you could do it easier with a thimble on—I should not like to attempt to do it with my bare thumb—I will venture to swear that more force could be applied with the finger and thumb than by the child being pressed against the mother's breast, and a child's bowels would not be likely to be against a woman's breast.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have heard Mr. Howell's evidence, in my opinion this is perfectly consistent with accident—if the needle was in the clothes of the mother or nurse; if it was in the shawl of the mother I can understand it being driven in by the arm of the mother in fondling the child, and if it once entered the skin I can fancy it being driven to very readily by the mother's arm; or if the needle was between the mother and the child it might be driven in by the stay bone of the mother—it would run through the dress and right into the body of the child, they are very common accidents; there are no more common accidents—they have come under my experience scores of times during my practice—why on earth should not a needle run in at an obtuse as well as at an acute angle?—supposing the needle was in the mother's shawl pointing inwards or outwards, what is to prevent it going in at a right angle or at an obtuse angle—I suppose it to be pointing towards the child, but in the matter of an accident it might be any way—in the course of my experience I have seen a needle sticking into the dress of a mother, head first; I have seen needles in every position looking inwards or outwards—a needle may get into a woman's dress without being put there at all, it may get there accidentally—about a month ago I took a needle out of a woman's belly pointing inwards, it was head outwards—I brought Mr. Colt to the Magistrate to give evidence, but his evidence was refused by the Magistrate, I don't know why; he is not here now—a month or six weeks ago I took a needle out of a woman's body which was driven up home with</p>

I took the prisoner at St. Donnett's Road, New Cross, where she was in service, about 10 o'clock p.m. on Satur<lb></lb>day, 16th December—I told her I would charge her with running a needle into the left side of her child and also with procuring a mixture, which was supposed to contain poison, for the purpose of destroying its life—I had received information from Dr. Howell and had seen this mixture—it is alleged to contain poison (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was brought to me at the police-station by Dr. Howell, on the 16th; that was the first time I saw him—the prisoner said "I did not hear it, its clothes were new"—I had not said a word about the clothes—I told her that the doctor had told me that on it being taken to his surgery the child was full of intoxicating spirit—she said "The child was crying in the street and a lady opened a door and asked me to come in and she gave it some whiskey"—I asked her where the lady lived—s he said "Near New Cross Station"—on the way to the station I gave her the opportunity of finding the house—she pointed it out, and I took her there, and in her presence the lady stated that she gave her a bottle with a quantity of whiskey in it, and a spoon, but how much whiskey the prisoner gave to the child she did not know—the prisoner did not take the whiskey away with her—I said "The nurse informed me that you had taken the child away on Thursday evening for good, where were you going to take it to?"—she said "I was going to take it to some friends at Peckham"—I asked their names and addresses—she said that she did not know—at the station, when the charge was read over, she said that she was going to take it to a lady who asked her for it before she was confined, and that she was not to tell her name by any means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A lady has written to the Magistrate from reading the case in the papers wishing to adopt the child—before I questioned her at her mistress' house I cautioned her that whatever answers she gave would be used in evidence against her—the answer about the clothing was in the mistress' presence, the others were on the way to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The offer made by a lady was since the committal, within the last fortnight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I said to the prisoner "There is some<lb></lb>thing deleterious in this medicine"—I did not use the word "poison"—from it having so strong a taste of medicine which is deleterious, I consider that if the child had taken it, it would in all probability have destroyed its life, if it had taken the whole of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. If it had taken a teaspoonful at a time in those tea<lb></lb>spoons which they possessed, which were small dessert-spoons, and it had been followed up every four hours as directed, it would have destroyed the child—there are 54 grains of chloral hydrate in the prescription—those large spoons will hold two teaspoonsful, if not more—I say that a table<lb></lb>spoon filled up would have killed the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. The fact of the spoons being so large induced me to furnish the information to the inspector—I immediately forbade it being</p>

               <p>given; I said "If you follow that up with those spoons the child will sleep itself away"—I had no knowledge where it came from when I made those remarks, and I did not know that she had been to Dr. Cavanagh—I suggest the same thing now, for if it was given according to that measure the child would gradually have slept itself away; the first dose would have sent it to sleep, and the next would have increased it—the ordinary teaspoons would not be safe—the ordinary dose is 1 grain for a child a month old—the child was scarcely two months old, and it would get 5 grains in each dose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> the Court. If they had given a teaspoonful, as directed, every four hours, there would have been 4 grains in each dose, and that would send the child into such a sleep from which it would never awake—I think a tea-spoonful every four hours would cause the child's death, but I do not mean an ordinary sized teaspoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> An ordinary teaspoon will contain one-twelfth part of this bottle, but the spoon I saw in the room Was the only one they had, and they would have used that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had seen a soup-ladle, I suppose you would have thought they would have used that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; perhaps you might think so, but I should not this is one of the most uncertain and the most dangerous medicines that can be given; it is given in convulsions, but this child had no convulsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> the Jury. I came to the conclusion that there was enough to poison the child, not if given as prescribed, but according to their measure—I read the label on the bottle, but I did not know where it came from. (<hi rend="italic">The label did not state any chemist's name.</hi>) Dr. Cavanagh never looked at the child, he knew nothing about it only from the mother's testimony; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the child had been in convulsions I should have said by all means give that medicine.</p>

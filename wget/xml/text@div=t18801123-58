                  </hi>. I am a money-lender, of 8, Store Street, Totten<lb></lb>ham Court Road—in August last Mr. Burns, the prisoner, applied to me to lend him 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I should like to see his furniture, as that was to be the sole security for the advance—I went to Sabella Row, Clapham, and saw both the prisoners—Burns told me that the furniture was his absolute property—I said, "Have you any marriage settlement?"—he said, "Go upstairs and get me that settlement"—she went up and brought it down, and gave it to me—it was dated 7th January, 1880, I believe—it was dated before the settlement of 22nd March, 1880—I looked through it; there was no reference whatever to furniture, and I believed his statement about it being his absolute property—I asked him particularly if there was any settlement on that property, and he said, "No"—I was proposing to take a bill of sale, and a declaration before a Commissioner by Mr. and Mrs. Burns was made out, which states that "no part of the furniture is settled, charged, or encumbered, and it is free and clear from settlement, mortgage, or encumbrance"—I believed that, and advanced the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two years, for which I was to receive 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is 25 per cent.—I afterwards received information, and went down to Kennington—he had made default in his payments, which gave me the right to seize—I saw Mrs. Burns and another woman, and found that part of the furniture had been removed—I afterwards saw Mr. Burns, and said, "You have obtained money from me on furniture which does not belong to you"—Mrs. Burns had told me that—he said, "I will see you to-morrow about it"—I then went to Ely Place and saw Mr. James, a solicitor—I did not see Burns again, but a day or two afterwards I was served with a writ in an action of Edward Atkins and George Solomon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188011230107"></xptr>
               <p>Bell against me, claiming an injunction to restrain me from letting any of the furniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a money-lender about eighteen months—the business has been established thirty years, but the office has been there twelve months—we carry on the "West of England Loan and Dis<lb></lb>count Company," which has offices all over England, and the name is in our window—we have offices at Cardift Newport, Portsmouth, and other places—we are all connected—"we" means my father and myself—he is still alive; he is not the sole proprietor of the business, I am one, and there are others who I am not going to mention—my father is not here because he has nothing to do with my office, he carries on the business at Cardiff—Mr. Eyles is our manager at Reading—we do sot advertise there in the same name as in London, because in every town we are bound to give the manager's name when people come to the office: they ask for the name which they see advertised—my name is Benjamin; my father's name is Solomon Benjamin, and he advertises in that name in Cardiff—this advertisement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) says, "Apply to B. Blyberg, 8, Store Street. Established 50 years"—my brother may have, put that in—his name is Joseph, and this is "B"—each party advertises. when they are of age, but Joseph is only eighteen—he may have put in the advertisement in my name—we turn over, I dare say, 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if that turn-over was on the same terms as the bill of sale, we should have nothing left, because it would all go—our terms are from, 10 per cent, up to 30, and we have only charged 25—I am in the habit, of taking the wife's signature when I lend money to a married man—I mean that I take a statutory declaration by husband and wife occasionally—I did so in this case because there were two children there aged 8 and 9, and Mrs. Burns said that she had only lately been married—I thought there, was some doubt about the marriage, so we took both—I saw the marriage settle<lb></lb>ment—I had a doubt whether they were lawfully married, and other doubts—I doubted whether he was the householder or she—they produced no rent receipts—I might have had a doubt to which of them the fur<lb></lb>niture belonged if they were not married, so I thought I would have a joint declaration and a joint bill of sale—I included Mr. Burns's business address simply because a bill of sale is a registered deed, and we are bound to give a full description. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of sale also included the stock-in-trade and furniture at</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">Paternoster Row.</hi>) If I had found a couple of hundred pounds' worth of stock at Paternoster Bow I should not have seized it without consulting my solicitor, but I should have if he advised me to do so—Mr. Burns was to begin with an instalment of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd September—I did not see him on that day or at all until I found that the goods did not belong to him—I found that he had removed his furniture, but did not see him till after he had made default; that was about four days after the second instalment was due—I have no recollection of seeing him on 25th September—he paid the first instalment when it was due, and when the second was due on 23rd October he did not pay it, nor on the 26th, and I told the clerk to go and see why he had not paid it—I swear he never tendered me the second instalment—when I saw him he said that he would come and see me in the morning, but he did not say with the instalment—I would not have taken it after I found that out, if he had offered it—I did not offer to take the instalment if he gave me other security—I did not say a word about further security to Mr. or Mrs. Burns—they</p>

               <p>said that Mrs. Burns's father knew all about the bill of sale, and was coming to see me about it—I gave them a 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—you will see "cash" written on it—it is payable to Burns and James—that is the name over the office in Paternoster Row—I said, "Here, I want you, Mr. James, to come up with me and draw the bill up"—that was a promissory note admitting the amount, and I made out the cheque to Messrs. Burns and James—I have the promissory note; it is made by Mr. and Mrs. Burns and Mr. James; I will sell it to you for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took Mr. James's security in addition to theirs, and still hold it—I did not say a word about that at the police-court, because I was not asked; I was going to tell you about it and you stopped me—I had taken a mortgage on all there might be in the house, and on all that there was at Paternoster Row—I did not require Mr. James, the partner, to become security for the loan—when Burns took me there I saw "Burns and James" over the door, and I said, "You tell Mr. James I shall require him also"—it was not because I had a doubt as to whom the furniture belonged that I required Mr. James to join in the matter—I would have lent him the money whether James's name was given or no—I did not say, "I will not advance the money till I have James's name"—he came to the office with James and a man named Wollelt, who got a commission out of it—he is not a friend of mine—he introduced these parties to me—it was a commission business, and if I carried it out I gave him a commission—I did not put Mr. James's name in for safety, but for protection—besides the crossed cheque I gave them 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold; they may have handed that back again, but not a halfpenny more—I charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going down to his house three times—I gave them the cash because it was after banking hours, and they wanted some cash that evening—they did not ask for money which I refused—they even came back next morning and begged for more cash—I swear that they did not give me back 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I keep books and enter every transaction—I have not entered the guinea I received back because that is what I was out of pocket—I swear to the best of my knowledge that they did not return me six guineas; it did not exceed a guinea—I said at the police-court, "I advanced my money solely on the assertions made to me by them, and the statement in the declaration"—it was only upon that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I agreed to lend the money before I knew of James—the Paternoster Row goods were not worth more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or £2—I had no reason to believe that goods worth £160 were coming there—it was ouly au office, not a warehouse—the only security I hud was the furniture at Clapham.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I do not remember having a transaction previously through Woollett—I swear I have not had cozens and scores through him—we took our office of the Central Loan and Discount Company, manager S. Fogg, but that had nothing to do with me—we had no con<lb></lb>nection with that office—my father and I bought the business of Fogg—not the business but the futures—our business had existed 50 years iu Cardiff—Messrs. Waterlow and Son were our London agents, but not to lend money, we had no London office to lend money—they are our agents and stamp bills of sale and register them, which business we now do for ourselves—we had no money-lending business in London till my brother Joseph started it 18 months ago; he was 18 when he opened it—he traded in my name till I came to London.</p>

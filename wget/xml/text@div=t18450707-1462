                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, and live at No. 8, Goswell-street. Dunn was in my service—I purchased a ring of him on the 30th of May for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced by Brannan</hi>)is it—I asked where he got it from—he said he found it in Cornhill.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-Constable G</hi> 136.) I apprehended Collins—I told him what he was charged with—he said he knew nothing about it—I asked him whether he knew a person of the name of Tiggell—he said he did—I saw Mrs. Tiggell apprehended—she was dressed and in bed—as I was taking her to the station she said she did not care a d—if she was transported, that the children belonged to Clerkenwell, and they would be obliged to keep them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Charlotte Chaplyn, a widow, who keeps the house, No. 17, Vincent-terrace, City-road. On Thursday, the 29th of May, the day on which the dressing-case was lost, Mrs. Tiggell was at work during that day—she came about twelve o'clock and went about ten—Bridget Richardson came to the house twice that day—the first time I saw her was about two or three o'clock, and Mrs. Tiggell sent down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a key to her—she had no opportunity of going into the room where the dressing-case was at that time—the second time I saw her was about ten o'clock, a few minutes before Mrs. Tiggell left—I am quite certain that she came that evening—I do not think she came further than the commencement of the passage on the second occasion—I do not know whether she went up into the bed-room, for I left her—I did not leave her in company with Tiggell—Tiggell was in the kitchen—I went down to her to tell her her sister was there, and she went up immediately.</p>

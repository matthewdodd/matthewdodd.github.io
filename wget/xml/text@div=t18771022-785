                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective C Division</hi>). About twenty minutes to one a.m. on 9th October I was in Jermyn Street—when I got about the second house past Wood's Hotel, which is No. 102, I saw the two prisoners and another man not in custody standing all three together—I went down York Street, and returned in four or five minutes, when I saw they had all shifted—Poulton was against the railings by himself, perhaps thirty-five yards from Wood's Hotel—I watched him for ten minutes, when Cain, another detective officer, came up—Poulton stood facing us on the opposite side, and gave a shrill whistle, loud enough for any one to hear fifty yards off—almost immediately after two men jumped over the rails from Wood's Hotel—Wilcox was one, and the other I have never seen since—there was an area on the other. side of the railings ten or eleven feet deep—Wilcox and the other man walked quietly along Jermya Street, turned up Eagle Place, and when they turned the corner Cain and I ran after them—we lost sight of them—we went into Piccadilly, and could not see them anywhere—Poulton then passed</p>

               <p>us into Piccadilly, and we turned and followed him—he turned round Great Windmill Street, and after that we took him into custody—it was perhaps five minutes from the time they left the area railings that we apprehended Poulton—I told him he would be charged with, two others for coming out of Wood's Hotel, Jermyn Street—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station—I then went back to Jermyn Street, and saw Wilcox standing against a post in York Street, about thirty-five yards from Wood's Hotel—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner is the man I previously saw get over the railings—he had a peculiar scarf on, and I noticed him particularly—I asked Wilcox what he was waiting there for—he said he was waiting for a friend—I said "Your friend is at the station in Vine Street"—I then took him to the station, and told him what he would be charged with—I then re<lb></lb>turned to Wood's Hotel and examined the premises—I rang the bell, and the housekeeper came down, and we went into the area—she un<lb></lb>done the inside door with a key and bolts—the chain had been undone—and I then saw the outer door standing open about four inches—a glass had been broken, through which anybody could get at the chain from outside—there was a pair of wooden steps in the area, made on purpose for the area steps—I ascertained they had been laid down in the area, but they were then in their usual place leading up out of the area, so that anybody getting over the railings could slide down, and then put the steps against the wall and get up—I examined the area, and could see somebody had been over the rails and slid down.</p>

Poulton gave me his address, and I went to it and found it right—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> made inquiries about him—he would not tell me where he worked—the other did—I saw Poulton's mother—she said she did not know where he worked at the present time—I do not know that he worked at the Horse Shoe Hotel as copper<lb></lb>man under the cook—it was about forty yards from Jermyn Street, along Piccadilly, that I met Poulton—he whistled; not a tune, I am quite sure—it was not one of the other men that whistled—I thought it was to give the other men notice—when I went down York Street and came back Poulton was standing alone—he had passed me so close that I could not fail to recog<lb></lb>nise him as the one I had seen in Jermyn Street—he did not run away—Poulton's mother told me before I asked her that he did not leave there till something after 12 o'clock, and thought he had been drinking—she might have said that he had been out and came in after 12 o'clock—she did not say she had blowed him up for coming in late, and that was why he went out again, but that he had been there after 12, been drinking, and gone out again.</p>

The prisoners denied all knowledge of each other when brought together—Wilcox gave me a correct address, and the name of his employer, which was also correct—I did not mention about a scarf before the police magistrate—it was a worsted scarf, with two or three colours in it, blue and white, I think, and violet, and the same pin in it as he is wearing now—there was a street-lamp standing close to where we were—the houses are mostly shops there—there were two private houses where Wood's Hotel is and then a box manufacturer's, and then a newspaper shop—I should say I was twenty-five or thirty yards off when Wilcox came over the area railings—the lamp I refer to is attached to the next house to Wood's Hotel, and is, I should say, four</p>

               <p>or five yards from where the men leaped over—Regent Street would be crowded at that time of the morning, and the Haymarket, no doubt—they were a long way from the Haymarket—I said before the magistrate we vent after them—I did not see them run—I have never made a mis<lb></lb>take as to identity—I never had a case in which a man named Bell was charged with sheep-stealing—I made some inquiry as to Wilcox's family—he was not living with his family, but with people he has lived with since he was a boy—they were very respectable—Poulton's address was Edward Street, Wardour Street, Oxford Street—on the very night of this affair I went up to the address of Wilcox—I found no sign of any house-breaking implements either in the house or on his person.</p>

At about 1 o'clock on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 9th October I saw Butcher in Jermyn Street, at the corner of York Street—in consequence of what he told me I stood there with him for a few minutes—I saw Poulton on the opposite side of the way just against the rails of St. James's Church—after staying there a few minutes he gave a shrill whistle, not very loud—then he crossed over to the corner of York Street, and a few minutes after I saw two men jump out of the area from "Wood's Hotel over the rails—I have no doubt that "Wilcox was one—I followed Wilcox and the other man not in custody, and then lost sight of them up Eagle Place—I returned with Butcher and saw Poulton in Piccadilly—we followed him up Piccadilly—he was about 100 yards from the hotel—Sergeant Butcher stopped him and took Mm to the station.</p>

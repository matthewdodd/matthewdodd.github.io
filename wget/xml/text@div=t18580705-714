                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Eastern Counties Railway Com<lb></lb>pany, at Stratford. On Friday evening, 11th June, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I received a parcel from Mr. Scott, with directions; I went to the parcels' office, where it is the prisoner's duty to be, but did not find him there—I gave the parcel to Mancer, the boy under him, who signed a receipt in a book for it—the parcel was directed, "Station master, Somer Layton, value, O.

                  </hi>. I am parcels' lad at Stratford, under Dales. I have been in the company's service nearly five years—it is the prisoner's duty to be at the parcels' office, and mine also—it was my duty to receive parcels in his absence, and on his return, I gave the value parcels to him; I do not know where it was his duty to place them—he had the key of the desk, which he still kept when he was absent—on Friday evening, 11th June, I received a value parcel from Keebles; Dales was not then at his office—he returned in about an hour, and I followed him into his office, took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him, and he took the key out of his pocket, and put it into the desk, which he locked up, and said, "All right"—it had on it, "Value parcel, Somer Layton"—I signed a book when I received it from Keeble—I have seen this book in the prisoner's possession; the entries in it are for the most part his; I know his writing well—he sometimes kept it on his desk, and sometimes locked up in his desk—when he received a parcel, it was his duty to enter it in this book—these four entries, on 11th June, are his writing—here are some entries of mine in the book; about one in twenty are mine, and the other nineteen are all the prisoner's—no one but he and I had any right to make entries in this book—on Tuesday, 15th June, I heard them say in Dales' presence, at Mr. Brook's office, the locomotive department, that there was a value parcel missing; there was a conversation about it, and Dale said that I might have given it to him, he did not recollect—I am quite sure I did give it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not that book sometimes kept in the window of the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, anybody could see it—the office door is usually open to the clerks and porters—there are a great many porters at Stratford, they would sometimes go into Dales' office to make inquiries—it is my duty to make an entry in this book when I get a value parcel—I did not make any entry when I got this parcel—I had received orders from Dales to enter them as soon as I received them—I did not do that on this occasion, but put the parcel in my pocket, it was there about an hour—I was walking about, some<lb></lb>times in the station, and sometimes in the office; the office is sometimes left without either of us, but the door is shut and locked—it is sometimes left open</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050054"></xptr>
               <p>when I am employed on my other work; it was my duty to forward this par<lb></lb>cel by the next train—Dales was absent about an hour—the 6. 20 and 7. 40 trains convey parcels to Somer Layton—there would be none before 6. 20, after I received the parcel. I come to work at 9 o'clock in the morning, and remain till half-past 9 o'clock; my wages are 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. When we are both away, the key of the desk hangs in the ticket office—the night inspector and the porter are there at night, and six or seven more in the day time—the key hangs against the desk, I hang it up there, and Dales who is there first, gets it in the morning—I am never there before him, he comes to meet the Parliamentary train at a quarter to 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What key are you talking about, the key of the desk, or the key of the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The key of the office; the desk key was always kept by Dales—I cannot recollect whether the key was in the desk when I received the parcel from Keeble; in ordinary business, when I saw the book, I should make the entry; if I had seen the book I should have made it then.</p>

In the course of my business, I ought to have received a parcel with money, to pay the men's wages on 11th June; I did not receive it; it was the duty of the guard of the train to deliver it to me—the train would arrive at Somer Layton at a quarter before 6 o'clock—it would take from four to six hours to get there from Stratford—if it had been sent there that night, I could not have received it till next morning—if a train left Stratford at twenty minutes past 6 o'clock, it would arrive, in the ordinary course, at half past 10 o'clock next morning—there is no train by which I could receive it between half past 6 o'clock and the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there a good many people employed about the ticket office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; during the day time, but all the ticket clerks leave at a quarter to 10 o'clock, when the last train comes—other people than the ticket clerks go into that office in the day; some of the public find their way in sometimes to make inquiries—the station is sometimes very much crowded in the day, but not often after 10 o'clock at night—I never missed any parcels, but two years ago, two boxes were taken off the platform—Dales leaves his work at a quarter to 10 o'clock, generally, and comes at a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning, but not always—his wages are 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he came to his work as usual, and I saw no change in his manner after this; he is sober and attends to his duties—I never heard any complaint of losing any parcel before—he is not married.</p>

I should have—I took them to this shop and said a boy had given them to me to sell, and that they belonged to his father, who was a carpenter—I took the boy in, and he said the same, and that he would fetch his father—I thought he would—I did not know it was a lie—they came to me on Friday night and asked if I knew where the boy lived—I said I did not, and then they came on Sunday and took me.</p>

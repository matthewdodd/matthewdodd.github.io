On the 5th of June, I went to Covent-garden Theatre; I left there about twelve and went from there to Johnson's alamode beef shop, in a court in Drury-lane - I staid there about an hour and had a pint of porter; I went from there into the Strand to a watering-house, and had a glass of porter - from there I went down the Strand as far as Bride-lane; I had another glass of porter and might have stopped about a quarter of an hour at each place - from there I went to Fleet-market and rested myself on the settles of the market for near an hour, as I had been walking about all day on business; I went from there to a watering-house in Holborn, and had another glass of porter - I stopped there about ten minutes; I left there about three o'clock and then came back through Smithfield towards home - I went through Bridgewater-square; three women of the town accosted me in Whitecross-street - they asked me to treat them with some gin; Shaw and Smith are two of them - I made them no reply: Shaw then left the other two, caught hold of my arm and said I should come home with her, and see where she lived - I told her to go to h - I and he d-d, and tried to get away from her; with that the other two came and swore I should go and see where they lived, if I did not stop - I was then about passing a gateway; two of them got behind me and held my arms down, while the other got behind - they shoved me down the gateway into the first house we came to; Smith and Shaw came into the room - the other one who was behind, left after delivering me into the room, and I saw no more of her - they began to ask me for money, for gin, and so on; there were two girls in bed in the room - they jumped out of bed, caught hold of me and swore I should come in between them; perceiving their intention was nothing but robbery, I tried all possible means I could to get out of doors, but was prevented by the four women - in a very short time the two who had been in bed huddled on their clothes, and one of them swore I should stand some gin as I was preventing her from going to Billingsgate; I gave her 4d. to get some and as she was going out I tried to rush out with her, but was prevented by the three prisoners - Thompson was one of those in bed - the door was shut; I told them they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030015"></xptr>welcome to the gin if they would let me go - they said"Stop, she will not be long, you may as well have part of it;" I said I wanted none, and tried several times to rush out at the door, but was prevented by them - they then said I should go if I paid 1s. and after struggling a long time I proposed to give them the 1s. if they would let me here my hat and let me go; they then said it was all d-d stuff, that I had got no shilling and they were used to such characters as me - I put my hand into my pocket and showed them a shilling; they then threw me back on the bed and swore they would have the shilling from my hand - I held it tight, and after a very severe struggle on the bed, either Thompson or Smith, by the advice of Shaw, bit my hand - she said "Bite the b-r's hand;" I then opened my hand and they took they shilling out, and during the struggle on the bed they took some halfpence from my trousers pocket; after they had got the shilling, I managed to get from the bed and endeavoured to get out, but was prevented by their well guarding the door - they then said they knew I had more money, they would stand none of my nonsense, and gave me a great deal of abuse; they threw me a third time on the bed, (for they had thrown me on when I first went in;) they began a severe search of my person, to see what I had - I hallooed out Murder! and Help! but no one came to my assistance; they swore if I made an alarm they would murder me, and several times put their hands before my mouth to prevent my being heard - all of them did so; Shaw was at the head of them - she sung out most to me, and used more violence and oaths than the others; after struggling for near an hour, they pinioned me back on the bed - Thompson and Smith held my arms extended back; Shaw knelt on my stomach and swore she would pull every bit of clothes off my back, but what she would get the money, and called to them to hold the - tight - my strength was exhausted; Shaw tore my clothes and took from my fob three sovereigns and a half; I saw the three sovereigns and a half in her hand, while she was on the bed - she opened her hand and exposed them; she then said "Hold the b-r tight while I go;" she jumped off the bed and was out of the room in a second - I struggled and got from the bed; I struck one of them, broke from the others and got outside the door to follow Shaw, but could see nobody but a man in a smock frock: I ran to the watch-house and gave an alarm - the constable of the night and two watchmen came to the place with me; I knocked at the door and asked for my hat which was knocked off in the scuffle: an Irishman came down from the upper part of the house and produced my hat; I asked for the girls - he said he knew nothing of them; we went to several public-houses, and in one at the corner of Old-street, I recognized the three prisoners and gave them in charge - I am quite certain of their persons; there was not above 3s. 6d. found on them all - we went and searched the room, but nothing was found; I was quite sober - I might have had a glass of spirits, or two glasses in the course of the day, before I went to the Theatre, and a pint of beer - I am certain I did not have more; a finger-stall, which had been on my finger, was found in the passage of the house - it was pulled off in the struggle; I had seen my sovereigns safe at the eating-house, and put them into my fob there - my silver was in my waistcoat pocket; I had a pocket-book, which they did not take - there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON. Q. When you came into the public-house, did you not say, I was not one of those who stopped? A. She was attempting to escape - the watchman said "Is that one?" I was confused at seeing the three together, and said No, but with the same breath said"Stop her!" I could not recognize her at the distance - I had but a glimpse of her at that time; she went out at the door; I thought she was one but could not recognize her at the moment - I was at the time going in at one door and she was coming out at the other, and the other prisoners were trying to escape at the back part of the house; I am positive she is the person - I said at the place I was robbed at that if I did not get my money, I would hang them, as I was irritated; that was immediately after being robbed - I did not say so at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHAW. You met me at half-past eleven o'clock the preceding evening, and went with me to the Bull's Head public-house, Smithfield, gave me three glasses of gin and peppermint and after that wanted to gamble with a gentleman at the bar, but the landlord would not let you - you took me to a house of accommodation in West-street. Witness. I did not see her at any house, or ask her to take anything, or take her to any house - I was at the Theatre at half-past eleven o'clock; I was not intoxicated.</p>

            . I lodge in Scotch-yard, Whitecross-street, on the first floor; Thompson has occupied a room on the ground floor for about two months. I was ill with a bad leg on this night, and could not get rest; I went to sleep about four o'clock and was awoke by a noise and quarrelling; I heard a woman, who I thought was Thompson, call out, "Don't break all my things!" I heard, as I thought, a man's voice swearing bitterly half a dozen times,"I will do it;" when all was silent I got up and came down stairs, and opposite the street door was a butcher's chaise cart, in which I found a hat - I took it up stairs, and afterwards delivered it to Thomas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner THOMPSON. Q. Did you hear the man cry Murder! A. No - I heard a good deal which I could not understand; when he came for his hat he said he had lost 3l. 11s., and if he did not get it he would hang them.</p>

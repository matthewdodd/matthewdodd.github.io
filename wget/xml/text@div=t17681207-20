The three prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070025"></xptr> in company with another, were on the inside near a dunghill consulting together; just as I came about a yard past them, one of them knocked me down; when I fell, two of them laid hold of my arms and kept me down, while the other two rifled my pockets; they took all I had out, and turned my pockets wrong side out. I had a guinea in gold, and 6 s. in silver, in one pocket, and half a guinea and 9 s. in silver in the other; I had borrowed a 27 s. piece in the morning and had changed it. Then they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapons?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I saw none they had, I believe it was with a fist; I am lame of one leg, and I am soon knocked down. They did not speak a word to me, nor I to them. Only one of them, said, when they were rifling me, Knock the old dog on the head. I got up and had an iron needle in my hand, which we use in casing of rabits; I flung it after them, but it touched none of them. I met Fennell the next morning about eight o'clock in Cow-Cross, and laid hold of him. I got assistance, and took him before Justice Girdler; there he confessed the fact. Provided the Justice would give him a little time to inform him where the others were, the other two should be taken in five or six days. He told where they were, and they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before?</p>
               <p>Kelly. No, I did not, but it being day light, I saw them and knew them. I lay on my back, and saw them while they were robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the other two?</p>
               <p>Kelly. The keeper of New-Prison did, I believe, on the information of Fennell. I never got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I called out as loud as I could, but nobody came to my assistance, there was nobody near, there were no houses near, but Cow-Houses.</p>
               <p>Fennell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming along, this man was much in liquor, he sat down to ease himself and fell backwards; the money fell out of his pocket, I picked it up and gave it him, and he gave me a shilling; I had a child with me, he gave that two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you fuddled or sober?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was as sober as I am now, my pocket was tight, my money could not fall out.</p>
               <p>Towell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it, I was not there.</p>
               <p>Crew's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses, that the man was drunk, up and down Black-Boy Alley, with the whores for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Rosanna Martin. I live facing the ruins near Chick-Lane, I take in washing and needlework; I was looking out of my own room window and saw the prosecutor sitting to ease himself I suppose, and the money fell out of his pocket. I saw some silver, I cannot say how much, the lad picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gold?</p>
               <p>Rosanna Martin. No, I saw no gold; he said to the lad, if he would return it again, he would give him a shilling; he returned it, and the man gave him a shilling; the lad went from the ruins with a child. The man was very fuddled, he was up and down the place better than an hour after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Fennell going?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. I believe he was going to carry a child to his master. He is a neighbour's child. I should not know the others that were with him; there were several boys there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. I believe there might be ten or a dozen; but I know none of them. I cannot say, I saw the other two lads. I saw the prosecutor fall all along.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Fennell?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. His mother takes in scowering. My window faces the place; it is not half a stone's cast distance.</p>

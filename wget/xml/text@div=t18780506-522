                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 892). I have been seven years in the force—on Saturday night, 20th April, I had received directions to watch the shop of Spiers and Pond in Water Lane—I did not know Barratt, but his description was supplied to me and I saw him about 4.30 that afternoon in the Blue Last public-house, near Spiers and Pond's—he Corresponded with the description—I waited till he came out and followed him to Spiers and Pond's, where I saw Chapman on the foot<lb></lb>way in front of a slab where the meat was—he stood by Chapman's side a few minutes speaking to him—Chapman then picked up a piece of beef, held it up, placed it on the slab again, and drew it to the edge of the slab—Barratt held his hands under the slab and Chapman put the meat into them—Barratt put it under his coat and walked on without going into the shop—the beef was not given to the scale man to weigh, nor was any paper wrapped round it—I went alter Barratt and took the beef from him—he was searched and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, was found on him—I went back and charged Chapman with stealing a piece of beef, and said that a man already in custody would be charged with receiving it knowing it to be stolen—he said "I have given no man any meat," and at the station he said in answer to Mr. Maxtead, the manager, "If the man took it he stole it"—I searched him and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to his lodging, 4, Printing House Lane, near Spiers and Pond's shop, and in a box at the side of the bed I found this purse containing 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—when I watched Barratt I stood within 10 yards of the shop—two women customers were in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Spiers and Pond are large butchers, and they have a fish shop a little lower down—carts were outside both shops—I was opposite the shop when Barratt went up, and the street is only 11 yards wide—I was looking for about a minute—I took Barratt about 20 yards from the Blue Last, took him to the station and went back to take Chap<lb></lb>man about 10 minutes afterwards—I had been watching the shop for three weeks, but only on Saturdays—two or three women were outside the shop speaking to Chapman after Barrett left—I say to-day that Chapman pushed the meat along the slab, I said at the police-court "Chapman took It from the slab and handed it to Barratt"—I saw no money pass when I arrested Barratt, he said that he bought it at the Meat Market—Barratt said at the police-court that he had never seen Chapman before; Chapman asked him—I had no conversation with Barratt at Guildhall police-court; I saw him in the cell—he spoke to me in the dock—I did not say "Be sure you tell the Magistrate that you gave Chapman 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the meat."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I said at the Court that I was 10 or 12 yards off, but I had not then measured the street—I explained to the Magistrate, Sir Andrew Lusk, that the meat was slipped along—writing down "handed it to Barratt," was not my doing but the clerk's—I had watched on the 6th and 13th, but did not see Burratt—Chapman was only outside on Saturdays</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060105"></xptr>
               <p>—the fish shop is divided from the butcher's by number of arches and is a long way down the street; a cart in front of it would not prevent my see<lb></lb>ing what was going on—no cart intervened between me and the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">This Prisoner</hi>). I was in the employ of the West<lb></lb>minster Civil Service Association, almost opposite Ludgate Hill station—before I knew Chapman I bought meat at Spiers and Pond's; it was weighed and I invariably paid for it at the desk in the shop—you must go into the shop before you can get to the desk, which is about six feet from the outside—on a Saturday some weeks before I was in custody I went and asked Chapman the price of several pieces of meat; he told me and I said that it was more than I could afford—he said you can buy a piece outside if you like—I said "What do you mean?" he said "Give me what I ask and you can have the meat"—I asked him what he wanted for a piece of pork—he said "A couple of <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>," meaning 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he gave me the meat—that was the first time I had any dealings with him—I did not enter the shop or go to the counter—the meat was not weighed—on Saturday, 20th April, I was at the Blue Last—I was not aware that I was followed and watched—I went to Spiers and Pond's about 6.30., and placed myself on Chapman's right hand, who was outside attend<lb></lb>ing to the slab—I said "Good afternoon"—he said "Halloa"—I said "What is the price of that piece of meat against your arm?"—he said "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which I gave him—he gave me the meat and I put it under my coat—I did not go into the shop—I was followed and taken into custody—I tendered a statement voluntarily at the police-court—no influence was used to induce me to do so—no hope or promise was held out to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I told the officer that I got the meat at the Meat Market, that was a lie—Chapman asked me at Guildhall "Do you know me?"—I said "No"—I did not know his name till the charge was brought—to the best of my recollection I did not say "I have never seen you before"—when I pleaded guilty here I said that I received the meat from the man, but I paid him for it—I did not say "I got the meat but I don't know how I got it"—I said that I thought it was not altogether right—I am a porter and had been at work seven months at this Association, before that I worked at Herbert's, 54, Ludgate Hill, and before that at Norman and Redmon's, Old Compton Street, Soho, for six months, and at Clements and Co., St. James's Square, from 12th July, 1875, to May, 1876—these are my testimonials.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I am 24 years old—there has never been any charge of felony against me—Mr. Herbert does not give me a character because I have left him twelve months—he has nothing to say against me—I have never been guilty of any dishonesty.</p>

                  </hi>, I am manager to Spiers and Pond, of Water Lane—Chapman has been in their employ seven months, at 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he lived out—I had paid him his wages on the Saturday previous—he had no right to pass meat to a customer—he served outside on Saturdays only, and it was his duty to sell the meat outside, to induce people to buy it, and then to pass it in to the scale man to weigh it, and the customer comes into the shop, pays for it at the desk, and takes it away—all money should be taken inside—Chapman had no right to take money at all—this meat weighed 61b. and the value of it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. We had a very good character with Chapman—I know nothing else against him—we employ 17 or 18 hands—he throws or pushes</p>

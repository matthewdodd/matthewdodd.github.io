                  </hi>. My mother was in the garden, and asked the younger prisoner whose dog it was—he said, "Not yours," and said that we had better come and put it out ourselves—he whistled, and I went outside the gate to see who he was whistling to—he called me a b----r, and put one foot inside the gate, and he struck, me on my chest—he took his foot out, and I closed the gate in his face—he went round where he had been before, and threw stones at me—he got over the fence—my father and younger brother came up and he went back again—my brother and I went out and followed the prisoners to Sharman's field; my brother had this cane—I was felled to the ground, but did not see who by, as I was not looking at the time—it struck me on the back of my head—I was stunned for a few seconds, and then found the elder prisoner on top of me beating me about the face and head with his fists—I told him he was a coward—I heard my brother call "Peace," and the younger prisoner came and pulled the elder prisoner off me—I got up, and found my head bleeding and my nose also, and I was injured about the eyes—these are my clothes and shirt, they are stained with my blood, and this is my hat; the brim was broken by the blow and the crown was knocked in—these are my waistcoat and collar (<hi rend="italic">both stained with blood</hi>)—the prisoners went away—we heard a man calling to us behind, but found it was a friend, and turned round and went after the prisoners again—I went to the Spaniards and washed, and Dr. Rose attended me—I was kept in the house for a week—I had told the younger prisoner at the gate that I would give him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My brother said to me "I know one of them;" that was, I should think, in the prisoners' hearing—my brother said, "That is all right"—I did not see that the prisoners' clothes were covered with mud from top to bottom; I went off as fast as I could—my brother went into the house to fetch the stick before we started—I did not see a stick in the hands of either of the prisoners—I was struck on the back of my head and turned right round, and fell on my back—there was a gate by—I will swear I did not strike my head against the gate, or I should have felt it—I was about 6 yards from the gate when I got up—I did not see my brother use his stick when he called out "Peace"—I do not know that he used his stick; I did not see him interfere in any way—the friend who called to us was a man my brother knew, I think his name is Goldsmith—he used to be a coachman—he came as a friend to us to assist us after the assault—he is not here—my mother sent him after us to bring us back—he lives at Golder's Green—my mother and father did not approve of our going.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old—I saw one of the prisoners in the garden—we agreed to go after them, and I went into the house and changed my hat, and got a stick—my brother had no stick—we followed the prisoners to Mr. Sharman's field, where there are</p>

               <p>two gate-posts, and it is very thick in mud—I said I knew one of them, and the big one said, "What are you coming after us for?" and he took about two strides forward, and struck my brother on the head with a stick, and he fell—I hit the elder prisoner with my stick, and then I don't know what happened, for in a moment I found myself on the ground, and the younger prisoner on top of me; he caught me round the neck, and squeezed me very tight, and left two marks, which were there when I was before the Magistrate—when he was on me he beat me, and I had a black eye, and he struck me on the head—I struggled with him, and got on top of him, and then I asked him if he would <hi rend="italic">shut up</hi>—he let me get up, and then he knocked me down again and sat on me, and knocked me about—I cried, "Peace, peace," and he let me get up—I then saw the elder prisoner sitting on my brother's chest, hitting him hard—I asked him if he would get off, but he did not seem to hear me; the younger prisoner then pulled his brother off, and said, "Now then, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, you must come on now"—I never saw a stick in James Draper's hands after the first blow, but I dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw it then—it was like a briar with the root on, but I could not see it distinctly—the younger one picked up my stick and gave it to me, and I saw my brother bleeding from the head and nose—I heard somebody calling behind—I did not know the man before, but he is the husband of a woman who washed for my mother—another man came up afterwards—I bled from my nose and neck—my brother went to a public-house and was washed; we then went to the police-station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Goldsmith was sent instead of the gardener, who was not in—they live in the same house—my brother fell a yard from the gate<lb></lb>posts—I cannot tell if he fell more than once—when I said, "Will you shut up?" I had had a good deal more than enough—it was not until I struck his brother with a stick that he touched me at all—I fetched my stick because I generally carry it, and I had a little foreboding that some<lb></lb>thing might happen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The assault was all over when Goldsmith came up; he took no part in it whatever—one of my eyes was quite black, and I had a bruise over the other, and on my eyebrow and neck.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practise at Hampstead—on 13th January I examined Walter Trevelyan, my assistant having seen him the day before—I found a contused wound on the right side of his forehead and over his right ear; he seemed to be suffering from the shock, and was feeble either from the shock or from loss of blood—the wound went down to the membrane covering the brain—a fist could not have caused the wounds, but it might have caused the bruises which were on his face—the injuries might have been inflicted with any blunt instrument—he was not able to leave the house for some days—there may have been two or three grazing wounds of the skin, but only one positive wound—he is all right now.</p>

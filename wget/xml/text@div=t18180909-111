I took the prisoner with me to Hull as a witness in a lawsuit I had there; I used to give him watches to sell. On the 22d of May, I put this money in a letter, and directed it to Mr. Levy. I never authorised him to receive the money back.</p>

On the 24th of May I received a letter from the prisoner enclosing a one 10l., one 5l., and one 1l. notes, it was in prisoner's handwriting, requesting me to send nine watches; after receiving the letter, the prisoner came to town, called on me, and asked how I came not to send the watches. I told him they were ready. He said he should feel obliged by my returning the money, as he was going out of business; I returned to him the same notes I had received. I thought it was his as he signed the letter-he gave me a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I and the prosecutor were in partnership together. I received the money from Levy; the money was my own. Articles of partnership were drawn up between us.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM CARCOUS re-examined. No such writing ever existed. He wrote the letter for me, and read it as though it directed the watches to be sent to me.</p>
               <p>PROSPER ABOTT. I live in St. Mary Axe. I knew the prisoner and prosecutor were in partnership. Carcous shewed me the agreement; it stated, that the prisoner was to have a share in watches only.</p>

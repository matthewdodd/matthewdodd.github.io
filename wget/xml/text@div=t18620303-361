                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 122). I was on duty on Friday evening, 14th February, in the Blackheath-road, about half-past 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoners there, one on each side of the road—I saw Saunders first, they were each carrying a parcel in a handkerchief, apparently very heavy—I followed them down Blackheath-road for some distance, till they came opposite Mr. Adams', a marine-store dealers shop; he is Saunders' father-in-law—Saunders crossed the road smartly, and Rice went into the shop close behind him—Saunders went to the end of the counter and put down his parcel—Rice also put his parcel down by the side—I was looking in at the window, and I saw all three apparently in conversation; some words passed between them, but I could not hear what—Rice was the last one in the shop and the first one coming out—they were coming out and I met them coming out without the bags—Saunders stepped up to Rice at the door, when I met him, and said, "That is the little engine I was speaking to you about," pointing to a small engine that was standing against the door—just as he said that, I said to Rice, "What do those bags and parcels contain that you bronght into the shop?" neither of them made any reply—I then took hold of Rice and pushed him back into the shop to where the bags were lying—Saunders was behind him—I said to Adams, "Do you know what the bags contain"—he looked at the two prisoners and looked at me, and then said, "No"—I said, "Untie this first bag, let us see what it contains"—Adams untied it, and I saw that it contained brass—I then said, "Untie the other bag, let us see what is in that;" and then he untied the second bag, which also con<lb></lb>tained brass—both the bags are here—I then asked the prisoners where they worked—Rice said, "I work at Mr. Soames' soap-works, East Greenwich"—Saunders also said, "I work there"—they said they had brought the metal from Mr. Soames—I asked them if Mr. Soames authorised them to dispose of that property—Rice said, "No, but if you go to Mr. Perrier, the foreman, he will tell you all about it"—nothing more was said then—I sent to the police-station for an officer—a police-constable came and took Rice and one bag containing the brass, to the station—I took Saunders and the other bag to the station—I told them I should make some inquiry about it before I let them go—instead of going to Mr. Perrier I went to Mr. Soames—neither of the prisoners said anything more as to why they sold the metal—I did not lock them up at the time—I left them at the station, and went to Mr. Soames, who came and charged them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the bags—the two weigh about 72lbs.—I cannot say which prisoner carried the bag con<lb></lb>taining these brass bushes and bearings—they were lying close together—the other is old metal, some of it has been in the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Soames, and have been in his service between seven and eight years—Rice was his head engineer—he has been in Mr. Soames' service about ten years, and Saunders about nine months—I did not give the prisoners authority to sell any of the property in those bags, or to take it out of the premises—I did not know that any portion of it had been taken from the premises—a portion of it is old metal—the brass things would not be considered old metal, without they were passed as such by Rice; if they were made too large, and would not corns in use, if he passed them for old metal they would go for old metal—I do not know what is the value of all the metal—there was a fire at Mr. Soames' on 17th May last—I sold some old metal about a mouth before that was damaged in the fire—no metal ought to be sold without being brought to me to he weighed and entered in a book—I sold the old metal to Messrs. Jackson and Watkins—they would pay for it at the counting-house—I never saw Adams, the marine store-dealer, till I saw him at the police-court—I gave no authority for any metal to be sold to him—these men left their work on 14th February at half-past 5—I do not know where Saunders lives—Rice lives at Greenwich, a mile and a half, I should think, from Adams.</p>

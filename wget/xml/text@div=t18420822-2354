                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother, and live in Little Tun-court, Whitechapel—he married his cousin—she was about twenty-three, and he was twenty-two—they agreed well together sometimes—the prisoner is a journeyman dyer—he has been out of work a long time—I never saw any blows pass between him and his wife, only disagreements—on the Tuesday fortnight before she died the prisoner came home tipsy about four o'clock in the morning—he asked her to give the child to him—she would not—they had some words, then he turned from her, and went down stairs to the public-house to drink again—I was absent all day—when I came home I met the wife in the street speaking to one of my daughters—I saw a little mark on her nose—it was rather darkish—I could hardly notice it—it looked like a bruise—it was a mark as if they had quarrelled—it was rather red—I went to bed when I went home—the next morning I went out, and when I came home they were very sociable</p>

               <p>—she complained on the Saturday morning before she died of a sore mouth—I gave her a cup of tea—she said she could not drink it, she bad a sore mouth—she said, "Look at it"—I looked at it, and found it was screwed up a good deal—she could not swallow—I told her to go to the doctor's as soon as possible—she went directly—he gave her some pills and medicine—I held her head back, and made her swallow the two pills—she took no food all daylong—I saw her again that evening—she was worse—she came out in the street to the prisoner, and told him she was going to leave him, and wished him good bye for ever—she came to me at the same time, and wished me the same—I came home with her, and put her to bed—she re<lb></lb>mained very bad all night, but still she had a good sleep in the course of the night—on Sunday morning I thought she was much better, but towards evening she got very bad again—the prisoner paid every attention to her all day long—on Sunday night she got much worse—I went for the parish doctor, and he came directly—the prisoner was in the bed-room with her when the doctor came—I asked what was the matter with her—he said she was lock jawed, and I had better send her to the hospital directly—she walked to the hospital between me and her husband quite heartily—she said she did not ail anything all over her body, only her throat and mouth—she remained at the hospital, and died on the Tuesday after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a parish surgeon. About the 7th of July the de<lb></lb>ceased came to me about a contusion on the none—I gave her some medi<lb></lb>cine, and she called again in a day or two afterwards—I did not see her again till Sunday, the 17th, when I saw her at her own house—she was suf<lb></lb>fering from lock jaw at the time—I recommended her to go to the London Hospital directly—I examined the wound on the nose to see whether that was sufficient to cause lockjaw, when she came to me at first, and it was sufficient.</p>

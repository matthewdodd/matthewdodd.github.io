                  </hi>. I am in the service of Price and Co., candle manufacturers—there is a savings bank established on their premises for the use of the men—the deposits in the year exceed, or are about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am the clerk receiving the deposits—I furnish books of this description (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) and write down the amount I receive, and my initials opposite the amount—this book was furnished to William Lovett, and he deposited from time to time small amounts up to June—on 19th Aug. the amount was repaid to him—I made the addition, balanced the account, and wrote off "Repaid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." and the date—that was the balance of the account—I did not write it, I put it in figures—since I wrote that, the "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>" appears to have been scratched out in each case, the figure "2" being left—the word, "Repaid," has also been scratched out, and the words "two shillings" sub<lb></lb>stituted—here are sixteen other items, making altogether 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they have been added since I returned the book to Lovett—on 11th Dec. the prisoner presented the book to me in its present altered state, I noticed the writing directly, and asked him his name—he said, "William Lovett—I asked him who he brought the money to—he said that he brought it to me himself—I spoke to the officials in the counting house, and the prisoner was told to leave the book and call again, but we sent for him before the time that he was told to come—he was asked how he came by the book—he said that he found it—he was given into custody—none of these items are written by me, or by my authority—the initials on the margin are not mine, I have written nothing since Aug.—this alteration from 1854 to 1855 is not by me.</p>

               <p>me—when I spoke of the officials I meant the general cashiers of the concern—the savings bank department is entirely under my control, nobody helps me in that department—this "H.

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at New-court, Duck-lane, West<lb></lb>minster—the prisoner lived in the same house. On the 15th of Nov., about ten o'clock at night, I went into the Castle public-house with a young man, a friend of mine, and a girl—the prisoner and I were both in liquor—we had had a few words before—I do not know what about—it was not about the man—we fought, and fell down—when I got up my left cheek was cut—I do not know how it was done—the people there said the prisoner did it—it bled—I was not ill—I was taken to the hospital, and had it dressed—I cannot tell how it was done, or who did it—my memory is bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I was drinking at the Castle, on Sunday evening—the prisoner came in before M'Cave—when M'Cave came she accused her of keeping a child—they had a few words, and closed with one another—both fell, and I saw the prisoner stab M'Cave in the cheek with a knife—it bled very severely—she took the knife from her bosom—it was a short black-handled table-knife—I think this produced is it—a man, who I think is her husband, had this iron bolt in his hand—he went to the prisoner and asked her for the knife—she gave it him—I said he should not pass out of the house till I got it—I am certain I saw the prisoner stab M'Cave.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist at the Phenix public-house in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On the 18th or 19th April the prisoner came about a quarter-past eleven o'clock at night—he asked for half a pint of porter—I served him—it came to a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me in payment a shilling—I tried it with the trier, and it bent—I went into my master, and gave him the shilling—he was in the skittle-ground—I came with him to the bar of the public-house—the prisoner was then gone—I had not given him his change. On 28th April he came between three and four o'clock, and asked for half a pint of porter—he gave me a sixpence—I examined it—it was bad—I called my master, Mr. Hawkes, and said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "That is the man that gave me the shilling before"—the prisoner did not say any<lb></lb>thing to that—I gave the sixpence to my master—he sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner into custody—I recognised the prisoner when he came on Thursday the 28th—he had been three times to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Phenix public-house—I remember the prisoner coming first to my house three weeks previous to the time when he gave the sixpence on the 28th April—I served him with half a pint of beer—he gave me a sixpence—I tried it, and told him it was bad, and if he came again I would lock him up—he said he did not know it—I let him go, and he went away, not paying for the beer—when he was gone I broke a piece out of the sixpence, and laid it on a shelf—I put the piece on the fire, and it melted—I gave the other part to the constable—on 18th or 19th April my lad gave me a shilling in the skittle-ground—I came to the bar, and I found the man was gone—I broke a piece out of the shilling, put it on the fire, and gave the other piece to the constable—on 28th April I was in the bar, and the prisoner came in and gave the sixpence to the lad—when the prisoner saw me he turned, but I watched him, and saw him give the sixpence to the lad—the lad bent it, and I went round the counter, and laid hold of the prisoners collar—the lad said, "This is the man that gave me the shilling the other night"—the prisoner said, "No, it is quite wrong"—I had hold of his collar—he said, "Don't lock me up; I will give you a shilling for the half pint of beer if you will allow me to go"—"No," I said; "now I will lock you up—three times you have been to our house and passed bad money here."</p>

Q.</hi> Have you any reason to remember the day of the month when the shilling was uttered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say the day, but I believe it was the 18th or 19th—the first time he gave me a sixpence, I found that was bad, and told him of it—he said he did not know it—I asked him if he had any more money, and he said "No"—I told him I would let him go that time, but if he came again I would lock him up—I am sure he is the same person—I left the pieces lying on the shelf till I gave them to the constable—it was a little shelf not locked up—anybody could get to it—the boy tried the sixpence in the detector, and as he was coming to me I went out of the bar parlour—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> open the door—I was inside the bar par<lb></lb>lour—I went out and round the counter, and the prisoner was standing there—I was present at the station when the prisoner was searched—a shilling and a farthing were found on him—he had offered the shilling to let him go.</p>

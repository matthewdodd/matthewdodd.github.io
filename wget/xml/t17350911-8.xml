               <p>Court. How old is she?</p>
               <p>John Easton. She is Ten next February; she had lived with us thirteen or fourteen Months. My Wife and I went out in the Afternoon; I returned first about six in the Evening, and the Girl was gone. I did not search the Drawers till my Wife came home; she had run away once before, but did not steal any thing then. We found the Drawers broken open and mist the Money.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Easton. There was twenty nine Pounds in a Spice Box in my Drawers in Mr. Foxley's House. I went out and left only the Girl in my Room, when I returned the Girl was gone, my Drawers broke open, and the Money taken away. She was found in Rag-Fair, she owned she took the Money, and said at first, that she put it in her Bosom, and sat all Night in Moor-lane, and there a Man came and took it from her - Then she said a Woman took it out of her Apron, and at another time she told me that she gave it to a Girl who was to go out of Town with her.</p>

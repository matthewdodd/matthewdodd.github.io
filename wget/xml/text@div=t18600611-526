Gray and Bucannahan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; by the first letter—I called on them in consequeuce of that to know what they knew of the firm, and Mr. Bucannahan gave me the substance of a letter which he had received from Mr. Brown—the London Directory is circulated in Glasgow; I did not look into it—we have agents in London, Duncan and Co.; we did not give them instructions on the subject—I never heard of his having been a partner in a firm at Glasgow—I had never heard of him before—we bought the coals of, I think, Messrs. Murray and Langham—I am not certain—there were fifty hogsheads, which came to somewhere about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have received money for freights on that vessel since the supply of these goods—as brokers we always collect the freight for the ship—we have received from 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight under this charter, which we shall keep until the case is over; but we have paid the charter party 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we have put it to the debit of the freight—I do not know anything of a bill of exchange for the 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we judge from our correspondence that we have not received one—we have letters from fche owner stating that he has never received any security for the hire of the vessel, but we never put the question to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you agents to the owners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the ship is put into our hands by Messrs. Duncan, our correspondents in London, and as soon as we heard that there was no Messrs. Gilkison and Brown, we wrote to the owners, taking upon ourselves the whole responsibility of the ship—if that bill is not paid we can pay ourselves—we are liable for the whole; we cannot tell what we shall lose—350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the whole amount—the loss on the ship is likely to be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not supplied the goods as well—we can secure ourselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know that he was expected to come out of Whitecross-street very shortly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard my husband say so, and I expected him out daily for some time—I know that arrangements were being made for the payment of his debts—we made no secret of our move to Ely-place from South-street; we put a ticket on the house—a great many letters were sent to Mr. Brown, both at South-street and Ely-place—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the printed address was sent to both places—I heard my husoand say that Mr. Brown was one of the firm of Gilkison and Co.—things came from Liverpool direct to our house—I had seen him before the things came; my husband had known him for a little while before—he had not been acting for him; only selling a little on commission—he has taken orders for him—a circular was shown me, but I never saw it before.</p>

I am a butcher of Tottenham—on 20th December, about 4 o'clock, Cox came to me in the street near my shop, and said, "Your shop is very bad and very empty for Christmas, you want two or three sheep, a couple of pigs, and a side of beef"—I said that is what I do want, and I wish somebody would send them in at a month's credit—he said, "Hold your d—d noise, you can have them as well as anybody else," and about 5 o'clock in the afternoon he came and said, "I am going to bring a sheep to your place"—I then went to the station and gave in<lb></lb>formation to the police—when I returned the prisoner was at the back of my house, but I did not see him—he came about 8 o'clock, or a little later, and said, "Now then, have you got that b----y skin off?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I could have forty skins off by that time"—he and I then went to the wash-house, and there was a sheep there, which was brought in by Cox and Lewis—it was stiff, and appeared to have been dead some hours—that was the first time I saw it—the police were outside, and I spoke to them—I then went into the wash-house, and partly skinned the sheep, by the instruction of the police, on purpose to keep the prisoners—while I was doing so the police came in and took them.</p>

We saw this man, he said, "Never mind taking it to the station-house, I will give you 30 bob for it;" his wife brought out a knife and said, "Hark at it halloaing; kill it." We drove it to the dust-hole and I stuck it. Lewis then said that two policemen in disguise had been there, and that Mr. Wren had gone to the station to give information to try and get out of it. If we had not met him, we should not have taken the sheep to his house—I stopped there till he came back—he said that he would buy the sheep and anything else 1 liked to bring him.</p>

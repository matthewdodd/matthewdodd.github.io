                  </hi>. I am a hosier and outfitter—I have known the prisoner six years, and have seen him write—in my opinion the signature, "George Potter, "to these Fleet Street orders is not his writing, nor is this request, nor this letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have some of the prisoner's writing in my pocket—it is the book of a society which it is his duty to keep—I have never compared it, because I have never seen these papers till this moment—I attended on Monday to give the prisoner a character, and I attended the examination at Guildhall, but I did not see the documents—I knew on Monday that I was to give evidence as to his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live at 11, King Street, Camden Town—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years and have seen him write many times—the name "George Potter" to these Fleet Street orders, is not the prisoner's writing, in my opinion—the transfer is in the same writing and is certainly not his—I do not see a letter resembling his in this letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him write the first Monday in last month—I see him write at least once a month and sometimes more frequently—I have some of his writing in my pocket—I have never seen the forged documents before—I did not go to Guildhall—I attended here <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Monday at the request of the prisoner's attorney—I knew that I was expected on behalf of the prisoner to speak to handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I wanted to see it before I was able to speak to it—I give it as my deliberate opinion that these are not the prisoner's writing—I can see no resemblance whatever—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter in the prisoner's writing, to the best of my belief, but it is not to me but to his wife—it is signed "John" only, and dated June 7, 1871.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a post-office clerk of 36, Catherine Street—I have known the prisoner six or seven years and have been in the habit of seeing his writing—in my opinion the "George Potter "on these Fleet Street orders is net his writings—this order for the transfer does not appear to be anything like his writing—in my opinion it is not his writing disguised—I do not believe the prisoner ever put pen to this paper (<hi rend="italic">The letter</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is some similarity between this paper (<hi rend="italic">Handed to the witness</hi>), and the prisoner's writing, but I don't think it is his.' I do not</p>

               <p>believe these two words "oblige" on this paper and in the Broadhurst letter are written by the prisoner, or that they are written by the same person; but one is more like his than the other—I have seen him write on many occasions but I do not know that I have preserved any of his writing—I was here on Monday—I have not seen any of these documents before now—I was asked to come here by a friend of his, not by the solicitor—I mean to say that when I stepped into the witness box I did not know that I was going to be asked as to writing; I came to give him a character.</p>

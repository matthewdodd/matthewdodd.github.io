               <p>Q. Do you remember on Saturday the 19th of November having any snuff sent to you - A. Yes; my brother sent me thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that - A. I have placed it in the indictment under the duty alone; the duty is two shillings and three pence; the snuff is worth from three shillings and six pence to four shillings a pound. The snuff was in a cartridge paper bag, cased over with sheets of brown paper, and corded; it was a snuff in imitation of Dutch rappee; I received it about five o'clock in the evening; I received several other parcels at the same time; I had occasion to go out; I placed it on a cask at the farther end of my shop; I missed it on Monday morning. On Wednesday morning I saw the snuff again in the possession of Mr. Hancock the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your own - A. I could not swear to it, but my brother could.</p>

             I am a tobacconist, and brother to the last witness. On the evening of the 19th of November I sent thirty pounds of Dutch rappee snuff to my brother, I manufactured it, and sent him some other parcels; but I am not accurate what the other goods were.</p>
               <p>Q. Who packed the thirty pounds of snuff - A. I fancy my porter; I merely shewed him the cask; I saw it when it was packed up, there was no directions on it; it is customary for us to put the weight on it; I am not certain whether the weight was on it or not; the porter set off with it between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the snuff again if you were to see it - A. I am perfectly persuaded that is the identical snuff that I sent; I saw it again on the Thursday following at Hatton Garden office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You gave orders at your manufactory that this Dutch rappee snuff should he made up in a parcel and sent to your brother - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How your servant made up the parcel you do not know - A. I shewed him the cask and he went with me to the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him make up the parcel - A. No; I saw the contents of the parcel after it was packed.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say whether the parcel that you saw packed answered to this snuff or not - A. I cannot say but there may be other snuff at the bottom of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sent out several parcels of this snuff - A. No; there was never any of that operation sent out above five pound, except that thirty pound then; and I have only sent one thirty since, and that was to my brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you was at the office did you examine your snuff - A. I examined it and smelt it; I firmly believe it to be my snuff.</p>

            . Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him - A. Yes. On the 19th of November I saw him at the Butcher's Arms, Clare market; the prisoner and one that made his escape was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a shoe maker.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the parlour situated with respect to the tap room - A. There is one door goes into the tap room, and another door goes into the passage; we were in the passage where the parlour lays to the right of the passage; it is the back room to the tap, only a partition between; I observed a large bag, I did not know what it was then, it was laying on a table on the right hand when I entered the room, and a ham on another table.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the room but these two men - A. No person whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room light or dark - A. Only a fire light and a borrowed light from the tap room; I entered the tap room before I went into the parlour; I saw some suspicious people in the tap room; I said to Ekelsoe, we had better stop here and keep the door; Ekelsoe and Hancock were with me; we all went into the parlour. The prisoner made his escape from Hancock, and got into the tap room; Hancock called for assistance; we went into the tap room and Hancock was in the act of taking the prisoner from under the tap room table.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man - A. He made his escape. When the prisoner was taken he said he knew nothing about the ham or the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. You have told my lord that you are a shoemaker - are you in a large way of business - A. I live at No. 9, Ormond place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop - A. I had a stall then and I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only way you have of getting your livelihood - A. I have a situation in Queen square church of bell ringing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not get any thing by hunting out people, and giving information - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not employ yourself in that sort of business - A. No, I do not.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You were left alone in the parlour - A. Yes, next the stair case; the prisoner stood by a round table near the middle of the parlour, and on a table laid a ham; the snuff was on a table by the side of the room tied up in this paper, and this is the string, the top of it was open, as if it had been examined; and near it on the table sat another man, that I supposed was in company with the prisoner; no candle in the room, nor no liquor that they called for; there was a fire in the parlour. As soon as I saw the snuff I asked them what game they had been after, and smelled the snuff; one of them said nothing. I then told them I should take them in custody on suspicion of having stolen these articles. After Deer and my brother officer went out of the room I attempted to fasten the door, I was not able to fasten it. When I had secured the one that got away, I was going to search him; immediately the prisoner at the bar ran out of the parlour behind me and made his escape into the tap room; finding that, I left the other man and ran after him; in the mean time the other man escaped; which way he got out I know not. The prisoner ran out of the parlour into the tap room, and shut the door in order to shut me in; but I was too quick upon him, he had scarce time to throw himself under the table, between the legs of the other company. I seized him by the collar, drew my cutlass and drew him out: I threatened the rest of the company if they rescued him; I took him into the parlour and handcuffed him; my brother officer took him to New prison; I took the ham and the snuff; it has never been out of my custody. Carrying the snuff under my arm, the bottom of the packet fell out; I put it into this bag; that is the paper and the strings. I can swear it is the same snuff that was in the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You say the man that made his escape was the man that sat nearest the snuff - A. He was the nearest.</p>

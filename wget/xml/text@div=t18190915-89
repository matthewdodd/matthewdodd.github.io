On the 8th of July, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the money and notes safe in a desk in my counting-house, which was not locked - the prisoner was a stranger to me. I did not miss the money until Saturday, the 10th, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning. I went immediately to the Bank, and stopped the payment, giving them the numbers of the two 10 l. notes, which were 5569, 5570, dated June, 1819. I had scarcely returned before I was fetched to the Bank, and found a person detained for offering No. 5569. He was bound over to give evidence, but we have not been able to find him - his name was Hearne. I accompanied him with an officer to a public-house in Golden-lane, where he said the man who gave him the note was waiting, but I did not see him; I saw the prisoner in a court near Goswell-street, and Hearne stated that the officer had came to him about that 10 l. note which he had from him - the prisoner said he knew where he got it - this was about eleven o'clock in the morning. In endeavouring to get out of the crowd, we were assailed by a gang of about fifty; the officer was knocked down - I let Hearne go, and secured the prisoner with the assistance of some other officers. Although it was day-time, the shopkeepers were obliged to shut up their shops, through the interference of the gang. Hearne attended at the Mansion-House, and was bound over to appear here, and the prisoner was committed. Hearne declared in his presence, that he had it from him, and he acknowledged it. I had never seen him about the premises. The note is mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Goswell-street, with Hearne, and the prosecutor. Hearne pointed the prisoner out in an alley, and said to him,</p>
               <p>"You must go with me before the Lord Mayor about this 10 l. note." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I know whom I took it of." Hearne said, before the prisoner's face,</p>
               <p>"That is the man I had the 10 l. note of." The prisoner said he had it from him; we went to the bottom of the alley. The prisoner was then seized by a gang, who swore he should not go, and knocked me down - I extricated myself from them. The prosecutor and the prisoner were in the kennel; the prisoner would then go no further. A man came to assist me, and another came up, gave him a blow and cut his lip. I got the prisoner into a shop, and handcuffed him.</p>

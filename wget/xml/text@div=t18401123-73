                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Buttesland-street, Hoxton; I keep the house. On the 18th of October, when I came down stairs, be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I found the back-kitchen window open, and a pail and bundle put there to keep it open—it was fastened the night before with an iron button—a square of glass had been broken before, and mended with a piece of white paper—they had broken the paper, put a hand in, and unfastened the button—there was a hole in the paper large enough for a man's hand—the window looks into the yard, which is walled round—I missed from the kitchen a shirt of my son's, James Peter Blake Simmonds, and the other articles stated—they were all in the house when I went to bed on Saturday night at twelve o'clock—I had heard no noise in the night—the policeman brought me a handkerchief one Sunday, about a fortnight after, and I identified it as my son's property—I went with him to the station-house, and saw my son's shirt on the prisoner's back, and a pair of drawers which the policeman produced were mine—I found in my kitchen; in the morning, a shirt, an apron, a handkerchief, and a cap, which did not belong to me.</p>

On the 3d of October, 1822, the prisoner came to me as the house-keeper of Lady Erskine - I was on the second-floor, this shawl was laying in the room when I opened the door to her - she pretended to faint, and said she had given a coachman a sovereign and a shilling instead of two shillings, and he had abused her, and made her ill - I asked her to sit down - I did not know her before. I gave her some brandy, and when she recovered, she said she came from Dr. Tweedy, of Ely-place, that she was housekeeper to Lady Erskine, and wanted me to make mourning for six female servants. I got her a pen, and she wrote down what was wanted, and I was to go to Thompson's, No. 125, Leadenhall-street, for the materials for the dress, and to go next morning to No. 20, Jermyn-street, St. James's, to see her ladyship, and receive further orders - she was about an hour with me. I let her down stairs, and the moment I returned, I missed my shawl, which I had pulled off not twenty minutes before she came in. It was about half-past eight o'clock when I let her out - she ran up Holborn, which arose my suspicions. I did not see her again for a twelvemonth, but am quite certain of her person. I have not found the shawl, nobody but her had been in the room, except a man, who brought a bedstead - I never suspected him. I have the order she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220032"></xptr>wrote. I did not go to Lady Erskine, but went to Leadenhall-street - there was no No. 125, nor any Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not a man and woman in the room - A. They brought the bed, and a little girl six years old was there - I was moving at the time; she said she had been to the lodging I had left, and that Lady Erskine had sent her footman there, who could not find me.</p>

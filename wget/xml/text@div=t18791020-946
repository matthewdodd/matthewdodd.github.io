                  </hi>. I keep the White Rose, Castle Street, Leicester Square—on Saturday, 27th September, I had some boxes of cigars in the bar-parlour window, which looks out into the yard, in which there is a urinal, and between that window and the yard is an area and a space of about 3 feet—it is a very deep area, with a drop of about 15 feet—on that night about 10 o'clock the barman called my attention to the bar-parlour window, and I saw the window sliding down—I ran at once into the yard, and saw the prisoner getting down from the window-ledge—he had one foot on a wooden bar over the front of the area, and the other foot on the window-ledge—the window is about 6 inches higher than the rail—if he missed his footing he would fall down the area below—I said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I saw another man crouching down, with his back to me, at the bottom of the area—the area window was barred—I fetched a police-man, but when he came both the men were gone—the next morning, about 8 o'clock, I went into the yard, and found eight cigars near where the prisoner had been standing, and I missed from the window-ledge a box con<lb></lb>taining 100 cigars, which had been there about two months—those I picked up in the yard were of the same quality and make as those I had lost—I am quite sure they were there on the 27th, and the box had not been opened—the prisoner came in my house again on the Monday about 11 or 12, and while I went out of one door to fetch a policeman, he went out of the other and ran down the street—the police at that time had had information—the prisoner came in again a day or two after, but I was alone and could not leave the bar—the last time he came in was Wednesday, October 8th, and he said, "Mr. Bull, I am very sorry I stole your cigars; I was induced to do it by Fred, the polisher, the one that fell down the area"—that was the first</p>

               <p>intimation I had of any one falling—he said, "I defy you to charge me"—I went to the door and called a policeman, and gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

I saw the prisoner and the other man go through the house into the yard about 10 o'clock on 27th September, and afterwards saw the bar parlour window sliding up—I at once called Mr. Bull's attention to it—I did not see the prisoner afterwards—we were very busy.</p>

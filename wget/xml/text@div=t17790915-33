            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see what happened between them on the 8th of July? - I did not see any of the blows. I was gone to the other end of the inn. I was told the deceased was knocked down. I went and saw him on the ground, and helped to lift him up; he had no strength to stand; he had no sense at all; he never spoke after.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - The 8th of July about six in the evening.</p>
               <p>What place was it at? - Fullwood's-rents. He died about a quarter before ten that night.</p>
               <p>Did you see any marks of injury? - There was a mark on his forehead, and a blow in his throat, under his right ear; that I suppose clenched his teeth that he could never open them afterwards. There was a little blood on the child that went home with him in the chair.</p>

               <p>Did you know the deceased? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I remember it is the man. I did not know much of him before. I live at the County-court-office. Fullwood's-rents. I belong to the Register. I was going home about six in the evening, as near as I can recollect on the 8th of July.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150033"></xptr>Where was you? - I was at the County-court-office door. I had ascended the steps; there are four steps; I was on the uppermost step. I heard some words, in Gray's-inn, between the prisoner and the deceased, which I could not distinguish; there is a high brickwall between the place where I was, and where the parties were.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the effect of the words? - I could not distinguish what the words were; they seemed to be quarrelling. The deceased came out of Field-court, and the prisoner very close to him, following of him to the door of a Mr. Dancer, which is directly opposite where I live. The prisoner asked the deceased if he would fight him then. The deceased replied, I will not fight you now, I will fight you to-morrow morning. The prisoner gave the deceased a push, or tap, with his hand, just to touch him.</p>
               <p>Immediately? - There were a few words, but it was very short the whole of it.</p>
               <p>What part did he touch? - About the breast, and repeated his question will you fight me now. The deceased replied no, I will fight you to-morrow. There were more words passed, which I do not recollect. The prisoner then snatched a stick which the deceased had in his hand from him, and attempted to break it upon his knee, and then struck him with his fist.</p>
               <p>On what part did the blow fall? - About the head; the deceased fell, but was, not entirely down; I believe he was almost down. As he attempted to rise again, and was partly up, the prisoner struck him a second blow, which laid him flat entirely at his length on the ground. I afterwards called to some officers that belonged to the County-court who were near, to remove the man. I perceived he was incapable to help himself at all. That is the whole that I know of it.</p>
               <p>After the deceased was knocked quite down on the ground what became of the prisoner? - He went away.</p>
               <p>Immediately? - Not immediately; there was a soldier laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the second blow that the soldier laid hold of him? - I believe not two minutes; I cannot be exact as to the time. The prisoner then went his way; the soldier, as he told me, did not apprehend the consequences.</p>
               <p>Did you know these parties before? - I knew the deceased, as he was a runner to the officers of the County-court, to assist them in doing their business.</p>

               <p>You did not know any thing of the prisoner? - I did not know that he belonged to Gray's-inn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner snatched the stick out of the deceased's hand, and attempted to break it on his own knee? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the meaning of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it that the prisoner wanted to provoke the deceased to fight, and wanted him to be on equal terms? - I do not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>He did not break it? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of the stick? - I do not know how that came out of his hand. It came afterwards into mine, and I produced it before the coroner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the deceased offer to strike the prisoner? - Not that I saw; many things might pass that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>A great many things might happen that you did not observe? - There might.</p>
               <p>There were a great many people present? - A great number.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What did you see of this affair? - I saw the deceased go out of a publick-house, the sign of the Duke of York, at Fullwood's-rents, at about six o'clock in the evening. Mr. Wilkinson was standing on the Court of Conscience steps. He called the deceased to him; he came out of the Duke of York, shaking his stick at Ann Green. Mr. Wilkinson bid him not beat the woman. Ann Green is the person that lived with the deceased. He said to Mr. Wilkinson what must I do with her; I cannot tell what to do.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner? - Yes; I did not see any thing of him till after the woman went into Field-court. This woman came up to Mr. Wilkinson at the Fountain-steps, and he bid her go home. She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150034"></xptr> want into the court and turned herself round and called Mr. Talboys and the deceased rogues and villains; the prisoner came up and told her she was not to make a riot there. The prisoner was the porter of Gray's-Inn. she told him she would go or stay, which she pleased; the deceased hearing him speak to the woman, went up to him and told him not to use his wife ill, for if he himself used her ill nobody else should; the porter desired them both to go; this was in Field-court; the deceased said he would go or stay which he pleased, that they had no business to interrupt him and his wife; the porter said to him, you would look simple if I was to give you a slap in the face; the deceased said if he did he should be very apt to return it; the prisoner said if he would go into the Rents he would fight him for a guinea; then they both came out and went into the rents.</p>
               <p>How far are the rents from Field-court? - They go directly out of the rents into Field-court. The prisoner said to the deceased will you fight me now?</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Wilkinson at that time? - He was standing upon the steps; the deceased said he would not fight him, he would defer it till the morrow; then the prisoner took the stick out of his hand, put it over his knee and attempted to break it; it did not break in two, it split; then the deceased went to put his hand to take the stick from him, and the prisoner struck him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember where the blow fell? - I cannot justly say, it was some part of the head; the deceased fell, and as he was rising again the prisoner gave him another blow which laid him flat on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did you see him after he was dead? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when they were in the inn together the first interference of the prisoner, who was the porter of Gray's-Inn, was for the purpose of bidding the woman get out of the inn, who was making a noise there? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Then the deceased came up and said, if he had a right to use his wife ill nobody else should; do you recollect the deceased challenging the prisoner to fight, and taking out money for that purpose? - I never saw any money, nor did not hear him say any thing to challenge him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him swear or use any imprecations that he would beat him or thrash him if he would come out of the Inn? - No, I did not hear any such expression.</p>
               <p>When they came out of the inn did you see any attempt on the part of the deceased to strike the prisoner? - I did not see any.</p>

               <p>I was coming past the Court of Conscience steps at the time the deceased was talking to Mr. Wilkinson, who advised him to let his wife alone; the deceased said what can I do. At that time the woman was making a noise in Field-court. The prisoner attempted to put her out there and told her he would have no noise; I went into Field-court, and stood at a distance; I heard more words pass. The prisoner was aggravated by the the deceased to return back twice.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - There were words, but I cannot pretend to say what the words were; the prisoner was coming away from him in Field-court; they went then into Fullwood's Rents; I followed at a distance; when I came into the Rents, I saw the deceased give the prisoner a sort of a shove; then the prisoner attempted to break his stick.</p>
               <p>Did he take it from him? - I believe he took it from him, I saw him attempt to break it, upon which the deceased gave the prisoner a blow on the side of the head, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mistake this matter do you; you say the deceased gave the prisoner a blow on the side of the head? - Yes; then the prisoner gave him a blow and knocked him down; in rising again, before he was quite up, the prisoner gave him another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150035"></xptr> blow and laid him down upon the ground again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You said the prisoner was twice about to leave this man and go away from him peaceably, but he was brought back by the deceased aggravating in, as you call it, what do you mean by that aggravation? - Abuse. He twice turned round to come away.</p>

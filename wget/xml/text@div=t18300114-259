On the 9th of January the prisoner took this paper of candles off the counter in our shop, while I turned round behind the other counter; he dropped them in the shop near the door - he had come in for a halfpenny worth of saitpetre, and I served him - two other boys then came in, and the prisoner stopped while they were served; they then made way to go out, and the prisoner turned and dropped the candles; a watchman came in, and asked it I had lost any thing - I said he had dropped this paper of candles - the prisoner ran across the road and up a court; the watchman pursued and brought him back - he said the boys who came in after him had dropped the candles, but I am certain he dropped them; the other were close to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the evening of the 9th of January I had been watching the prisoner and two others for some time - I missed them, and thought they had gone up White Lion-street; I turned, and met my partner - a person touched me on the shoulder and said,"Do you see what is going forward here?" I looked into the prosecutor's shop, and saw the three lads there - the prisoner and another went to the further end of the shop, and then two of them went to the counter - the shopman served them; I saw a brown paper bundle on the counter - the other two lads then went to the door, and the prisoner dropped this bundle from under his coat; I came round, and the other person had let the prisoner slip by him - I told my partner the prisoner had gone across the road; he went and brought him instantly - I had seen him go across the road and run down an alley; I am quite sure he is the person the parcel fell from.</p>

Inquiring how he came by my property, he looked at me, and replied, your property! and violently struck at me with his fist; I then raised a hue and cry of stop him, or stop thief; I then got on my feet and ran and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost sight from the time that he run till you took him? - A. No, I am sure that he is the person that had the pot and struck me. I produce the pot. I can only swear to the pot by a certain inscription that is upon the cover: No. 10. and

               <p>Q. Can you tell where No. 10 was deposited? - A. It was deposited, with four or five more, on the outside of the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you been at the outside of the house before you received any alarm? - A. Within half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pot that you had opened before? - A. No, it had never been opened nor sold out of; I missed the pot from the door; there being a pile of three at the bottom and two on the top, when I came out of the door I missed one from the top; I may say I am confident it is my pot; I know the hand-writing of Mr. Read.</p>

I was going home, and coming along I saw something lie in the road; I saw a man going from it; I went and picked it up; I had hardly got it in my hand, when that gentleman came and told me it was his; I said, if it is your's, take it; immediately I gave it to him, he collared me, and tore my shirt; I have a wife and three children.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I became first acquainted with the prisoner at an inn, the sign of the Providence, the 12th of May. We came from Paris to London the 25th, at four o'clock, at Charing-cross, we dined together there, and he took me from there to a Mrs. Smithers, in <placeName id="t17910720-12-crimeloc63">Downing-street</placeName>

Minett's and Fector, in London; I always went to the Bank, to change the notes in gold, always by the advice of the prisoner; we went together besides to Mr. Hammersley's, we received the notes on Monday morning from Mess. Minett and Fector, and on the Tuesday following, went to get the money in cash from Mess. Hammersley; but as it had a month to run, I did not get but half, all in gold. I put all my money in a trunk at Mrs. Smithers's, my bank notes in my pocket-book in the trunk, on Tuesday the 31st of May.</p>
               <p>Where did you spend the day? - On Tuesday I put the money in about eleven o'clock, and went out walking, and afterwards dined near the theatre, about half past four; then we went to the play, and almost immediately after we went in, the prisoner left me in the pit; he begged my pardon, and would be back immediately, and I never saw him till he was taken. I went home about eleven o'clock, conducted by a young man, and found my trunk locked with a key; I opened the trunk in the presence of three people, and found every thing gone. I had the whole amount of the remittance that I brought from abroad, the prisoner counted it for me, I do not know myself. I lost a diamond ring, seventy double louis d'ors, they were all in the trunk; I had part of it in a little bag by itself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. When you was in Paris together, did not you live as friends? - We did; he told me he was a Scotchman, and would interpret for me.</p>
               <p>Then you came from Paris together as friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you arrived in London, you looked upon him as your friend? - On my arrival in London he offered me his lodgings, for he said where he lodged there was always a spare bed.</p>
               <p>When you was at the lodgings at Mrs. Smithers's, there you always treated him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200019"></xptr>as your friend, for he went as your son? - We always eat together.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the people of the lodgings, Mrs. Smithers, and every body there, looked upon you as related? - I never saw the mistress till Monday.</p>
               <p>When you went to Minett and Fector's did you carry a bill there? - I carried a draft.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body that spoke French there? - Nobody spoke French there.</p>
               <p>Then all the business that was done at Minett and Fector's, was done by the prisoner for you? - It was.</p>
               <p>When the money was received at Minett and Fector's, did not the prisoner receive the money into his custody? - Minett and Fector gave him some Bank of England notes, and I went with the prisoner to get them changed.</p>
               <p>Were they given to the prisoner? - They were, and then we went to the banker's.</p>
               <p>Did he change them at the Bank? - He did.</p>
               <p>Whom did you trust to receive and count the notes? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money, or you? - I gave it him in a little bag.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go to the Bank? - To change the bank-notes into money, because the next morning the prisoner was to put me in a situation with the cash to advantage, and he said it was easier to place out cash than bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then he changed those bank-notes into gold for the purpose of placing out your money more easily? - I got all into gold for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, or did he not, keep the custody of the money, after he had got it at the bank? - I put it into my own trunk before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When you went to Mr. Hammersley's, the business there was conducted by the prisoner the same as on the day before? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was it taken by you into your possession? - It was.</p>
               <p>When you were on the road together to England, had you any conversation together about merchandise? - No, never had.</p>
               <p>When you were at your lodgings, did you trust entirely to that man? - I did, he gave me to understand he was a captain of a vessel.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your way of life in your own country? - I am a French <rs id="t17910720-12-viclabel64" type="occupation">gentleman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17910720-12-victim190 t17910720-12-viclabel64"></join>, I fell a victim to the revolution, I never was in trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How many apartments had you and the prisoner at Mrs. Smithers's? - I occupied an apartment of his, he having made me an offer of a bed; there were two apartments, one where the prisoner slept, and one where I slept.</p>
               <p>In fact then it was the prisoner's lodgings, and you had an apartment through the prisoner's courtesy; which room was it you left your trunk in? - In the room where I slept.</p>
               <p>When you came home, after having been at the play, you found your trunk locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had this trunk ever been used by him and you in common, to put the things in? - I locked it for the greater caution, to preserve my cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where had the prisoner proposed to spend the evening after the play was over? - He said he was going to sup with Mr. Rose, Mr. Pitt's Secretary.</p>
               <p>For what end was he to sup there? - He was to obtain his protection for me, and to employ my money to advantage.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by employing your money to advantage. He said Mr. Rose had been with Mr. Pitt for thirty years, and he would put me in a way how to employ this cash.</p>

            , she lives in Downing-street, Westminster; Mr. Delarade and the prisoner came to her house on the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Who took the lodgings? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had he ever lodged there before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200020"></xptr>Who did he describe he took it for? - He said he took it for his father and himself.</p>
               <p>How soon after he had taken it did Mr. Delerade come there? - In the course of half an hour, in an hackney-coach.</p>
               <p>What did he bring with him? - They brought two trunks and a portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Which of the apartments were these trunks put into? - The largest trunk and portmanteau were put into Mr. Delerade's room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, on Tuesday, what time they went out? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did they return together? - No; only one of them returned in the evening, which was the prisoner; he came there about half an hour or three quarters past seven.</p>


               <p>What passed between you and him that evening? - When he came, he asked me to fetch him two sheets of paper, which I did, and carried them up to him, and delivered them to him with the change of the shilling he gave me to buy them; about ten minutes after, he paid me the lodging, two guineas for the week he had just been there, and half-a-guinea for myself, and desired me to get a porter; I told him I did not know readily where to get one, but I would get him a coach; I got him a coach, and he went away, and carried the trunk which was in his room with him.</p>
               <p>What was to become of his father, did he tell you? - He told me that his father would be home in the evening, and that he should return on the Saturday for the farthest: I asked him particularly how long he should stay; he said he could not leave his father any longer than Saturday, and therefore at the farthest he should return then.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did Mr. Delerade return? - About eleven in the evening.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you see the prisoner? - Not till after he was brought up from Bristol.</p>
               <p>I believe you received every thing for what was wanted of the prisoner? - I received every thing from the prisoner, I never saw a halfpennyworth of the prosecutor's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You seemed to have been with the prisoner all the time that evening almost, you only left him while you went out for two sheets of paper? - Yes, I went out for the coach besides.</p>
               <p>Where was he all this time? - In the dining-room.</p>
               <p>With his trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he paid you for the lodging? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>And told you he would return again on Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore there could not be many minutes that he could be in this room by himself? - The whole from his coming in to his going out was not above a quarter of an hour in all.</p>
               <p>And then he went away in that coach? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then whether he had got any thing of the prosecutor's you do not know of a certainty? - That is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From the time that Mr. Delerade went out, did any body go in, that could have taken Mr. Delerade's property, besides the prisoner? - Nobody went in but himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He told you Mr. Delerade would return that evening? - He did; and he told me there would be an interpreter come with his father, that would tell us what he would want, and what he would have done; but that the interpreter was not to stay in the house.</p>
               <p>You understood that they were father and son all the time? - I did.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200021"></xptr>On his being apprehended, what conversation had you? - I went up to him with a brother officer; I told him he must go along with us; he did not make any reply to that, but said, call a coach: I said there was no stand near, but the place we were going to was as near as a coach-stand: we went to the council-house, and the mayor soon came, and he was examined.</p>
               <p>I believe he refused telling his name? - He said he never slept in Bristol; but afterwards I found that was not true; and I went to a place where he had lodged, and there being some drawers in the room locked, I applied to him for a key; he said, at first, he had no key; at last he gave it me, and I opened the drawers, and found nine hundred guineas, now deposited in the Bank, and some double louis-d'ors (I cannot positively say whether there were twenty-five or fifty-five now), and twenty-nine single louis-d'ors: here is a pocket-book (produced) in which I found eight Bank-notes, including two Dover-bank bills; a purse, containing twenty-three guineas and a half (produced); here is a false watch (produced); here are two rings (produced), the one is an hair-worked ring, and the other is a diamond ring; a pair of knee-buckles, and a pair of shoe-buckles (produced); and I found this watch on his person (produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What kind of a coat had he on? - The same as now; only there was a Prince of Wales's feather painted on the buttons, which are now rubbed off.</p>

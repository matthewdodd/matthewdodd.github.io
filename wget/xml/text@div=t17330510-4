             stood at a little Distance. + Welton is now in Newgate, and Bunker is an Evidence. I had seen them several Times, for a Month or two past, loitering with the Prisoner about Rosemary-Lane. I had some Suspicion on that Account, and what encreas'd my Suspicion was, that I saw some Blood upon the Hats. So I took the Prisoner over to an Alehouse, and Bunker followed. I ask'd the Prisoner how he came by the Hats? He said he had them of Bunker, and Bunker own'd the Hats to be his own. 'That he bought them in Rag-Fair for 3 s. but when they came before the Justice, Bunker own'd that they had stole the Hats aboard a Ship, and charged the Prisoner with being concern'd with him in several Robberies. But we could find none of the Prosecutors but Mr Bank, and he being sent for, he was then positive to the Prisoner, but afterwards he did not seem willing to prosecute.</p>

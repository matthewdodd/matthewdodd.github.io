On the 15th of June, on coming down stairs, I saw the prisoner going out of the street door, from the front parlour, with a bundle; I followed about two hundred yards, and then I lost sight of him - I called Stop thief! Crouch and Bagley went after him - I had seen him on the back premises about a quarter of an hour before - he worked for a gentleman there once; I returned home and missed the articles stated - the gown and handkerchief hung behind the front-room door.</p>

I think he is the man who dropped them by the jacket he has got on; I did not see his face - I saw Mrs. Camplin behind me, but she could not catch him.</p>

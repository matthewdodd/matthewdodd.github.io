Upon the 31st of July; the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to see some silver buckles. I shewed him some. He chose a pair which came to four guineas. Then he asked to see some paste knee buckles. I shewed him some. He chose a pair which came to 38 s. and he had a little gold shirt-pin, for his shirt, at 4 s. Then pulling out his purse, as if he was going to pay for them, he said, I believe I have not cash enough about me; but here is a draught on a banker, which is the same thing as money; it will be paid when presented. I looked at the draught. I took it; the sum being so small, and knowing the house. He asked for a pair of silver spurs. I shewed him some. He said they were not the sort he wanted. I told him I had some in hand, which would be ready in a few days. He said, You must send me a pair. I took a little memorandum book, to take his directions. The draught lay upon the counter. I supposed his to be the same name as the signature to the draught, H. Turner. I wrote in the book, H. Turner, Esq. He looked over me at the same time. He desired me to add, jun. Noah's-row, Hampton-court. This was the direction where I was to have sent the spurs. He made some words about the price of the knee-buckles: I agreed to give him 2 s. out of it. He did not take the 2 s. He said, he would settle that when the spurs were sent to him. He went away. The next day, I sent the draught to the banker's, for the money. It was not paid, but was returned. I went to enquire at Green-street, from whence the bill was dated; but I could find no such name as H. Turner, in Green-street. The next day, I sent to Hampton-court; but there was no such name to be found there, nor such place as Noah's-row. Then I advertised the things, with a description of the person.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner. Is that the young man? - Yes; he was taken the next day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120063"></xptr> after it was inserted in the paper. I saw him at the Office in Bow-street. He said very little there.</p>
               <p>You are sure he is the same person? - Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>About six weeks before I went to Mr. Elliot's house, I went to Barnfield, for the recovery of my health, and boarded with one West, at the Salutation tavern. We used often to go to Kew-green, to a reputable house there, where was a billiard-table. I used frequently to play there. One morning a gentleman addressed me, and asked me to play a game at billiards for a gill of wine. I said I had no objection. When we were in the room, he proposed to play for half-a-crown. We played till I won 9 l. of him. He said, he supposed I should have no objection to take a draught on his banker. I looked at it, and saw it was on Brown and Collinson. I made no scruple to take it. I afterwards tendered it to Mr. Elliott, and he readily accepted it. I saw the advertisement tended to my person. I was at the Salutation. I said to a person, here is a note seems to tend to my person. I was invited to go down and see a gentleman, who said his name was Turner, at Noah's-row, Hampton-court; that he had a brother just come from Cambridge; that I must enquire for Mr. Turner, jun. I had a pair of spurs on, which he admired, and desired me to bring them with me when I came down to him. There was a marker present, at the time we played together. I have made enquiry after the marker, but could not discover any such person.</p>

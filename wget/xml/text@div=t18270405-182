I took it out, and found it was a print of Ely chapel, which I missed from a book I had to bind; I thought he might have taken it to shew his father, who lives near Ely chapel - I said nothing till he returned - it was not put back as I expected - and on Tuesday I got an officer. I took up the book and said, "Richard, I suppose you know what I want?" he said No; I said, "The print of Ely chapel;" he said,"It is not there - I took it, and beg pardon" - that it was a print he thought he should like; he said he had not got the key of his box; the officer said he must break it open - he then produced the key, and said, "Now I am a lost lad;" we then went to his mother's, and he gave us the key of a box there, in which we found the print of Ely chapel, and in another box some paper and plates; he said he meant to have formed a book for his own amusement with them; he was three years and a half with me; I had half the premium from the parish, when he was bound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not some quarrels with him? A. Yes - I have struck him, and called him names; we were at Clerkenwell together; I believe his father goes to Ely chapel.</p>

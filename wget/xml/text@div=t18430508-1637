                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Mordecai, a fruiterer—the prisoner was our carman. In consequence of something that happened, I called in Sergeant Jackson, on Wednesday evening—he marked some cop<lb></lb>per money, and some shillings, in my presence, and put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of marked copper, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of copper not marked, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in silver marked, into the till, which was locked, and I put the key into my pocket—early in the morning of the 11th I heard the gingling of some halfpence—I rushed into the shop and saw the prisoner coming from the direction of the till—the moment he saw me, his hand dropped from his waistcoat-pocket—I said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, what are you after?"—he seemed very much flurried, and said, "What do you suppose I am after?"—I shut the parlour door, and called Jackson—I went to the till and found it locked—I still had the key—I counted the money, and found fifteen halfpence were gone, and six pennies, which were marked the night before—no silver was gone.</p>

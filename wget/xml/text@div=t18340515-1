               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. How old is the prisoner? A. I believe about sixteen - he has been with us about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of striking the men or boys on the premises? A. Many times - I have not punished the boys severely - I never punished the prisoner except at the time I have stated - the only occasion on which I corrected the prisoner was five or six weeks before; he was cutting labels at the table, he spoiled some, and I pulled his ears - I was in a very great passion on the occasion in question - I am not aware that my passion increased while I was striking him - when I attempted to seize him, it is possible I might have struck him - I cannot say whether I did or not - seeing his hand raised, I thought he had something to throw, and went to stop him - at the time I received the blow, my arm was lifted up to seize him - it was extended away from my body, not down by my side - I seized him with my left arm, and received the wound in that arm.</p>
               <p>Q. The first blow you gave him was on his face? A. No; I attempted to strike him in the face, but I did not touch him - that was with the back of my open hand - it was not a violent blow - I struck him afterwards on the back - that was not a very violent blow, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150004"></xptr>swear - I do not know that any of the other boys were in the habit of carrying any thing like this dagger with them - I have since heard one boy had two fencing swords.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Day and Martin. On the 3rd of April, in consequence of Weston coming to me, I went to his assistance - he desired me to secure Quick - I said, "Quick, what have you been doing? - how came you to do this?" - he said, "Never mind, that is nothing to nobody; I have owed him a grudge a good while" - he had the dagger in his hand as I went down the room, and as I advanced towards him he threw it on the floor - there was a little blood on the dagger - the point of it stuck in the boards - I delivered it to one of the clerks - the officer has got it - I took the prisoner down stairs; and while we were standing in the lower part of the warehouse, a boy, named Joel, came up to him - I told him to go and mind his work; and, as he went away, the prisoner said, "Now, Joel, you may give them those papers" Joel had got some papers - I was not present when he gave them up - I saw the papers afterwards - I asked the prisoner what it was Joel had got - he said, "It is only some papers for the boys" - he did not explain what he meant.</p>

            . I was at work at Day and Martin's at this time - I was with the prisoner when he purchased the dagger, about six weeks before this happened - he gave 4s. for it - he did not say what he wanted it for - I think it was bought in Russell-court; it was at the back of Drury-lane theatre - the prisoner had given me a paper parcel on the morning of the 3rd of April, before this matter happened, about seven o'clock - he gave it me and said, "Do not open this till I tell you" - after this had happened he said, "Now, Joel, you may open that" - I gave it to Moel, one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know what he bought the dagger for? A. No; I think it was to play with; because we used to play with such things.</p>
               <p>Q. With daggers? A. With knives, made like daggers - I and another boy and the prisoner used to play with them - we used to open them at one another - we used to play theatrically - I had a ground knife - I only had it one night, and I took it home - I put it in my breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the knife open and shut? A. No; there was tin case made to it - I do not know that it would be dangerous to put it where I did, without a sheath - I put it inside my breeches - it was not sharp - it had not a very sharp point - it was not quite a point - if I had struck any body with it, I do not know whether it would have stabbed them - one other boy had a knife which, I believe, he used to carry up his sleeve - two of the boys had swords.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner sharpen the dagger? A. Yes; I do not know how long it was before the accident - he sharpened it on a grindstone.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did he sharpen it where you sharpened yours? A. Mine was not sharpened - I do not know whether the other boys sharpened theirs - I have seen the papers - I recollect that the prisoner once gave me some papers, three or four months before this took place - there was something written on it - it was not an authority to receive part of his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a custom among the boys to pass these papers from one to another occasionally? A. I have known it - I never saw a boy with a pistol nor a horn.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Was it customary for the boys to make the papers into parcels, and give them into the custody of another boy to keep? A. I do not know about that.</p>

Yes; I do not know where they wore them - they used to play with them - Mr. Weston struck the prisoner on the back once, and he stooped down up against the cork bag - he struck him the second time on the side of the head - as he struck him on the back, he stooped down - Quick got up, turned round, and Weston struck him on the side of the head - Mr. Weston was very angry.</p>

             JONES. I am a surgeon. On the 3d of April, I was called in to attend the prosecutor - he had a punctured wound in the arm, about two inches above the elbow, passing through the fleshy part of the arm, it passed obliquely upward, quite through the fleshy part - it was a punctured wound or stab.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am placed before you charged with a crime of a very serious nature; I will state nothing but the truth. I do most solemnly declare the act was not premeditated, neither did I buy the instrument for any purpose, only to play with. I never owed Mr. Weston any malice in my life, though he has struck me before. There is no person can say that I ever threatened Mr. Weston or any one else to do them any injury. The other boys were in the habit of carrying weapons of a similar nature, and I got one likewise, as we were in the habit of playing at robbers and banditti. Those papers that I gave to John Joel were in case I got discharged, for I fully expected it. I did not expect Mr. Weston would strike me; when he struck me, I tried to get out of the way, but he followed me, and kept striking me, which so irritated me, that I struck the blow for which I am arraigned at the bar, and which I have since most sincerely repented of.</p>

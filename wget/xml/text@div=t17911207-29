On the 14th of November last, I went up to Piccadilly about four in the afternoon; I had occasion to go to receive 152 l. of the father of the prisoner; his father kept a public-house opposite St. James's Church; the 152 l. was for the debt and costs of a judgment in an action in which I was concerned; I saw the father; he asked me to walk into a parlour; I staid with him some time; he told me he expected to receive the money by six o'clock, to pay me between six and seven; I had been previously to Westminster, and had not dined; and drinking some rum and water, I found myself exceedingly intoxicated, and desired a coach might be got; a coach was got; it might be about seven or eight o'clock; I directed the coachman to drive me to my own house; I am not certain, but pretty sure, nobody was with me in the coach; I found, instead of driving me home, they drove me to a house in the Strand; I was alone in the coach; I do not know whether I told the coachman to stop in the Strand, but he said I ordered him to do so; the coach stopped at a public-house near St. Clement's Church; as far as I can recollect, I was angry with the coachman for stopping; words ensued between me and the coachman; I went into the public-house; the coachman was there; I came out afterwards to get into the coach, between <placeName id="t17911207-29-crimeloc159">Piccadilly</placeName>

               <p>On the 14th of November, about six o'clock, I called at the George in Piccadilly; the boy said, your father is in the parlour; going into the parlour, I saw Mr. James coming out; I said, how do you do, Mr. James? he said, are not you Mr. Barnes's son? I said, yes; I called him on one side, and asked him to lend me a shilling or two; upon this he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out his money, and gave me half a guinea and four shillings; I said, I do not want so much; he said, poh, poh, keep it; I am going to receive a sum of money of your father; nothing more occurred for two hours; Mr. James came out of the parlour again, and was going into the street into the coach; he was put into the coach, and the coachman asked him where he was to drive him to? he was so drunk he could not tell him; I said, he lives on the other side of Black-friar's-bridge; my father was in liquor, and could not tell the coachman where to drive Mr. James to; the man that keeps the public-house, said to me, Ned, get upon the coach-box, and see him home; I said, I do not rightly know where he lives; I got upon the coach-box, along with the coachman, about one hundred yards; Mr. James called me then, and said, Barnes, come in the coach, it rains; I told the coachman not to mind him; he then called out, God damn you, stop; the coachman got down, and let him out; he made me get in before him; we went to the sign of the Sun, near St. Clement's; there we both got out; as soon as I got into the house, he, without any provocation, struck me in the mouth, and knocked out one of my teeth; I struck him on the nose, and he fell behind the grate; the coachman asked what all that was about, and asked for his fare, which was seven or eight shillings; he refused to pay it, and said he did not hire the coach; then we shook hands; but afterwards the coachman and I gave charge of him for assaulting us; they took me down a court to the watch-house; they put me up stairs; I had a bed, for which I paid a shilling; Mr. James was brought in soon after; and he had a bed in the next room; he broke the pannel of the door, and I crept under the bed for fear, as he said he would be the death of me.</p>

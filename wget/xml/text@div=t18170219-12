On the 23d of January last, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my back parlour talking to a gentleman, with my wife, my two servants were in the back workshop. Hearing the sound of glass breaking, I went into my front shop and saw the window was broken, and a vacancy between my watches. I went out, and heard the cry of stop thief! and seeing people running, I followed and saw the prisoner running. Mr. Hall took him before I came up to him. I missed a watch, which was safe a short time before.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. North. On the 23d of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down, nearly opposite Mr. North's, and saw the prisoner looking at his window, where the watches hung, in a stooping position. I am sure he is the man. I looked a second time and saw him raise his hand, I them saw him strike it into the window and catch at something, he missed the first catch; I then saw him make a second attempt and run off. I did not see him take it. I was within fifteen yards of him. I pursued him for about three or four hundred yards, and took him. I lost sight of him as he turned the corner. I saw him again in a minute, he appeared to be stopping for want of breath. I did not see any thing in his hand, nor did I see him throw any thing away. I am sure he is the boy that I saw make a snatch at the window and run off. I have not the least doubt of it. A person told me that the watch was thrown over a wall.</p>

I saw the prisoner put up his hand and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190010"></xptr>knock it into Mr. North's window. I was the first that gave the alarm. I am sure it was the prisoner.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into the house to ask for a letter for the hospital; I told him, I hoped he would excuse the liberty I took of coming into the house; he d-d me, and said I came to steal something; I said, I had not, but for a letter which I had had before; he took me up for stealing his boots, which I had not seen; I have failed in the four quarters of the world with Lord Howe, Lord St. Vincent, and Lord Duncan, and never was charged with any offence before.</p>

I said he need not have abused me so much, as I only wanted a few halfpence; I said I should only charge him 4 s. 6 d. - this was on Saturday night, the 3 d.

               <p>"Tom, if you are going to settle with me I will play;" he said he be b - g - d if he would pay me if he had a pocket full of money - I went and sat down on the settle, without saying a word, and the moment I sat down he ran at me, and said he would cut my bl - y head off; he caught hold of me with his left hand, and lifted up his right to hit me - I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't cut me Tom" - he said again,</p>
               <p>"I will cut your bl - y head off," and struck at me directly in the left cheek, and the blood flew all manner of ways; he appeared to have a small pen-knife in the middle of his hand - I saw the point of a blade as he struck me, but not afterwards. The landlady ran out, gave me 1 s., and sent me to the doctor's to have it dressed. I then went to the Thames Police; he was taken that evening. I had not quarrelled with him, or struck him that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. Had you come from a public-house - A. I came from the Wellington, public-house. Davis had been there with me - I do not suppose that I had drank above three pints of beer between three of us. When he threatened to cut my head off I laid hold of a piece of wood, which lay on the ground, but did not raise it from the ground; I did not strike him at all, or propose to fight him; I only asked him civilly for my money. I might have said he ought to pay me, but nothing more. I saw the knife when he put his hand up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't cut me;" he was jawing me, saying I had not done my work right. No knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not say before that you snatched up a piece of wood, what sort of wood was it - A. A piece of pailing; I did not take it up, but only attempted. I took hold of it to defend myself, but did not raise it off the ground - he saw me stooping to get it, and then came up and cut at me.</p>

            . I was at the Bluegate with Wilson, I did not see him drink anything, but he was the worse for liquor. He and the prisoner were wrangling; there was high words between them. Wilson asked for his money; he said he would not pay him just then, but would when he could - several words passed, and then the prisoner struck him; I did not see the blow given, but saw Wilson bleeding; I had seen him attempt to take up a piece of wood to strike the prisoner, but he did not take it up, as the prisoner collared him - he was bleeding at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was great heat of blood between them - A. Yes. They were both in a passion. It was a sudden quarrel - one was in as great a passion as the other.</p>

            . I am a student at the London Hospital. Wilson came there on the 5th of July; he had a wound on the right cheek, about two inches long, and not above half an inch deep; it must have been made by a sharp instrument - it is now quite well. There was no danger from it; it was not a grevious bodily wound.</p>

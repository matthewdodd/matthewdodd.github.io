I live at 8, Caesar-terrace, Spring-grove, Wandsworth-road, and am a railway-porter—about a quarter past 11 o'clock, on 17th December, I was coming down a street near the Vauxhall-walk—I saw the prisoner Stevens standing on the edge of the kerb—as I came to him, he pushed me in the road and grabbed at my watch, which was in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket—I fell—he did not get it—I caught it as it was coming from my pocket—I did not see it in his hand; he had not got it—he had got the chain; I saw that in his hand—Jones was with Stevens—they were both together—Jones was doing nothing at this time—he was standing on the pathway all the time—they were both together when I came to them—I did not see Jones doing anything all the time—they both ran away then, about a minute after—the policeman brought them back a very short time afterwards—I said to Stevens, "You have not got it yet"—I then had the watch in my hand—I did not call out—the affair took about two or three minutes—I did not go after them when they ran away—I did not make an alarm—the policeman brought them back to me almost before I could recover myself—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch.</p>

On the night of 16th December, I was at the end of Lambeth-walk, about half-past 11 o'clock—I heard I a noise of some one running, at about twenty yards distance—I went there and saw Jones running, not very fast—when he saw me he stopped and walked at a sharp pace round Lambeth-walk—I saw another party running down the street something about his size—I followed Jones and took him into custody—I asked him what Was the matter, that I was sure something was wrong—he said he had just been round the corner to make water—I said, "What were you running for?"—he said he did not know—I brought him back to the corner of that street, where I saw the prosecutor with his watch in his hand—he was standing there speaking to the sergeant. who is in attendance now—he said, "I have been knocked down, and some one attempted to steal my watch"—I said, "Is this the lad?" meaning Jones—he said he was not positive whether it was he—he said there were one or two more; that Jones was in company with those who knocked him down, he did not positively know whether it was he that <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> at his watch—sergeant Coxhead pursued the others—during his absence, Stevens came along Doughty-street, where I was—the inspector came up just I previous, and I handed Jones to him—when I took Stevens, I told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?"—I said, "If you come back to the corner you will see"—he came back, and I said to the prosecutor, "Do you know this man?"—the prosecutor said, "That is the man that knocked me down"—the charge was then stated to Stevens, and I conveyed him to the station—the prisoners there said that they knew nothing of the affair whatever.</p>

I live at 4, Lyall-street, Leicester-square, and am a carver and gilder—I was in Doughty-street, near Lambeth-walk, on this night, about half-past 11—I saw the prosecutor there—two men had hold of him, and Stevens pushed him, snatched at his watch, and ran round the corner—I cannot swear to Jones as being one of them, but one was shorter than the other—they ran in separate directions—I followed Stevens round I the corner as quickly as I could, and saw him meet a girl and another lad, half-way down the street—they crossed the road all three together and stood under the lamp, and I had a full view of the taller one—the three were speaking together—I had a good view of them—they were then out of the prosecutor's sight—Stevens turned back again and went towards where the prosecutor was—I turned down the next street, went up Lambeth-walk, and met Hornsby with him in custody—I lost sight of the other prisoner—I did not see anything more of him till the policeman had got him in custody—I swear to Stevens being the man who did what I saw done—Jones is about the height of the other one, but I cannot say positively that it was he—I found both of them in custody—I did not see the watch at the time—I believe the prosecutor had been drinking—he was not drunk.</p>

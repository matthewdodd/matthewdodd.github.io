                  </hi>. I am a cane and fibre merchant, in partnership with Mr. Solomons, at 61, Sun Street, Bishopsgate Street—In October, 1865, I met Smart, and after some conversation he came to my place of business, and I ultimately supplied him with some goods—he gave me a bill for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., there was about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from him for the goods, and I gave him the rest of the bill in cash—he afterwards bought more goods and paid in cash—some little time afterwardshe bought more goods, and showed me a bill for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I thought was too large, but after some conversation I was induced to take it—I gave him some cash, I forget how much, and the rest in goods—the bills were afterwards presented and returned to me with<lb></lb>out my getting any cash—I then went in search of Smart's establishment, in Hoxton, and found it shut up—Turpin has dealt at our place, but I did not see him in this transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Smart's daughter—his real name is Sidney Giles—I remember his having a shop at 101, High Street, Hoxton, a brush, manufactory—Turpin came there occasionally—my mother married his brother before she married Giles—I have seen Turpin with these bills—I think the whole of these two is in his writing—he very frequently did writing for my father—my father sometimes went by the name of Stevens—Turpin knew him as Smart as well—I believe Turpin sold some of the fibre that came in from Jacobs and Solomons', to Mr. Griffin—he told my father so—the endorsement, "George Stevens" on the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bill, is my father's writing, and the body of the bill is Turpin's writing, and the same on the other bill.</p>

I did the best I could to sell his brooms, out of which I got a trifle for myself. He absconded, but I did not. I remained there for two years. I saw him sometimes, and he always knew where to find me. I wish the jury to compare the signatures, and if they find that they are in my writing they may find me guilty; but I can see no resemblance. I never forged a name across a bill in my life. The body of a bill is an unfinished document, of no use till the signature is put to it; and it is yet to be proved that I know anything of these bills at all.</p>

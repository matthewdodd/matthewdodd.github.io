                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at 19, Wimpole-street. On the 22nd of April, I advertised in the newspaper, and received a letter next day, which induced me to go to the Peacock, at Islington, on Tues<lb></lb>day, the 23rd—I got there a little after two o'clock in the afternoon—I was shown into the parlour—I said I had come to see a gentleman named Clarke, and in a short time the prisoner came into the parlour—he asked the waiter if anybody had been inquiring for him—I said yes, I was the person who had come to inquire for him—he said, "Oh, sit down"—I had the letter in my hand, and said, "Is this your hand<lb></lb>writing?"—he said it was, that he wanted me as a porter to himself and father, to deliver light parcels and messages—I showed him two written recom<lb></lb>mendations—he seemed very well pleased with them—he said he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to start, and if I suited him and liked the place he would ad<lb></lb>vance me considerably in two months—I had some drink at my own expense, and he had brandy and water—we parted, he said he would write for my character, and let me know as quick as possible—he was dressed in dark trow<lb></lb>sers, a cloak, and blue spectacles, with glass sides and front—I was about ten minutes with him—I left him there—on Tuesday the 30th of April, I received another letter, signed Clarke, in consequence of which, I went to the long-room in the Custom-house, on Wednesday, at eleven o'clock, and after some time saw the prisoner there—he came into the middle of the room to me—I had waited about a quarter of an hour—I followed him to the door—he said he had</p>

               <p>written for my character, and he and his father were very well satisfied with it, as is mentioned in the letter, that he had nothing particular for me to do that day, but on going down the steps he gave me a blank letter to take to the Bank of England hotel, by the Great Western Railway office, this is it—I was then to meet him at the Gloucester coffee-house, Piccadilly, at half-past one—I went and left the letter, and afterwards to the Gloucester coffee-house—I met him on the pavement—he asked if I had taken the note—I said I had, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get my dinner—he then said he had business to do with a wine merchant by Leadenhall-street—I was to meet him at half-past three o'clock at the East India-house (this was on the 1st of May)—I went to the East India-house, and found him on the steps about half-past three o'clock—he said he wanted me to go to the bank in Old Bond-street—he pulled a bag out of his pocket, and took out a check for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., this is it—I was to bring him 70 sovereigns and ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to the King's Arms, opposite the East India-house—I went to Old Bond-street with the check, got there in about forty minutes, and presented the check—I was detained, told it was forged, and was taken into custody—I told how I became possessed of it, and was afterwards taken to the King's Arms, Leadenhall-street, but did not find the prisoner there—I could hear nothing of him—I was discharged that day—when I saw him at the India-house, he wore a brown coat and dark trowsers, but no cloak or spectacles—on the 18th of May, I saw him looking in at a picture-shop window in Great Portland-street, about two o'clock in the day, and recognised him—I stood by him a short time, passed and noticed him—he at last moved on into Oxford-street—I followed him into Hyde-park, saw a policeman there, and gave him in charge—I said I gave him in charge for giving me a forged check to take to the bank—he gave his name as George Reginald Whitaker, No. 3, Quickset-row, New-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the Ann lying at Limehouse-wharf, Ratcliffe—about 1 o'clock, on the morning of 11th Jane, I was walking down a street in Ratcliffe, towards my ship, and met the prisoners—Robin<lb></lb>son asked me to treat them—I said I had got no money to treat them—I turned myself round and was walking away, and I got a severe blow from a fist, and was knocked down—I felt them take my watch from my pocket—the chain broke—I seized one by the arm and one by the shawl, and she got away and left her shawl in my hand—a policeman came up, and asked me to look in my waistcoat-pocket—I did so, and found my watch had been put back—it was rather dark where I was knocked down.</p>

(This stated, "The watch was taken by the little one.") I can't say for a truth which took it, for I was half-stunned with the blow, and was bleeding terribly.</p>

On the morning of 11th June, a little past 1, I saw the prosecutor in the Broad-street, Ratcliffe—he was just rising on his legs, holding the prisoner Robinson, and she had hold of him, and I saw her put the watch into his waistcoat-pocket—he had a shawl in his hand.</p>

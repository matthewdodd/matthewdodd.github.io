On the 26th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going through George-street, St. Giles's-some people were collected together, and two women were quarrelling - I stood there to hear what passed. Three men were standing round them-the prisoner was one, and Fitzgerald was another. In about two minutes I went on my way home. Fitzgerald followed me very close, hustled me off the stones, and knocked my hat off. I caught my hat in my hand. The prisoner and the other man came to my right-hand side, and took my watch from my pocket-it was gone in an instant; I felt it going-it was a silver jewelled watch. They ran away as fast as possible. I called the watchman, who took Fitzgerald to the watch-house. Next day, the prisoner was taken at the Black Horse, public-house, in George-street - I am positive he is the man. I had seen him and the other close to Fitzgerald. I understood by their conversation that Fitzgerald had been fighting the day before; the prisoner was sparring with Fitzgerald.</p>

            . My sister keeps the Black Horse, in George-street - the prisoner was in her employ. My sister sent him out for some pump-water - He returned in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. My sister asked him where he had been so long? he said he had been looking at a fight, and had picked up the case of a watch, which he produced. I asked him if he knew who had lost it? he said he did not. He had lived a fortnight with my sister. It was a silver case.</p>

             re-examined. I am not quite certain which of them took my watch. It was a new one-the case was not loose. I only had it made about two years ago, and paid seven guineas for it-there were three gold seals and a ring to it. I never got them again. The prisoner said he sold the case the next day to a man in the street.</p>

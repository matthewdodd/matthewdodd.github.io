                  </hi>. On Monday, 24th February, I was renting three rooms at 29, Poppin's-court, Fleet-street—the prisoner is my wife—I have been married to her about sixteen years—I have one son about thirteen years' old—I cannot say whether he was at Poppin's-court or not on 24th February—I have now got employment at Mr. Penn's, at Greenwich, and have had for the last twelve months—I was desirous of moving my furniture to Green<lb></lb>wich, and on Saturday I came from Greenwich, intending to move the furniture on the Monday—I began to more the things about half-past 2—I had got several things into the van, and she struck me on the head with a broom—she said nothing—she was not willing for me to take the things—after that I went up on the second-floor to move some things out—I passed her on the second-floor landing, with a chopper in her hand, breaking up a bird-cage, and a box belonging to me, destroying them, and throwing them over the banisters—she followed me into the second-floor with the chopper in her hand, and struck me on the shoulder with the blunt part of it—after that I was putting a bed out at the second-floor window into the van, and I was struck a blow on the back port of my head—I fell upon the window-sill and sang out, "Police! police!"—I could not say who struck me, but my wife was close behind me when I was struck—blood flowed from me—the police came and took her away—she said, "I did it; I did it"—my head in bad now: I can hardly recollect—my head was hurt very much—I was taken to Mr. Dempsey, a surgeon, and am still under his care—I am very ill now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 97, Fleet-street—on Monday afternoon, 24th February, about 3 o'clock, the prosecutor was brought to me bleeding from the side of the crown of the head—I examined his hand, and found an incised wound about an inch and three-quarters long, and a quarter of an inch deep—I did not probe it, as I thought I would not interfere with it, the skill not being at all depressed—it had gone through the integuments—it had been inflicted by a sharp instrument—this hatches would certainly do it, but it must have been with the sharp side—there was concussion of the brain—he apparently could not stand when he came in, and he has not recovered it yet.</p>

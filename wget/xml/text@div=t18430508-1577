                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant K</hi> 8.) I searched Ellen eynolds's boxes—I found this print, which was not claimed by Mr. Toyne—I ascertained that she had a brother in the employ of Nathaniel Nathan, in Great Garden-street. I went there, and the prisoner Thomas was called into the room up stairs—I said to him, "Do you know anything of this?"—he said, "Yes, I know that perfectly well, my sister bought it at our shop, with some others, some time ago"—Mr. Nathan said it was no such a thing, he was satisfied he was robbed to a considerable extent, and sent for two or three shopmen to know if they had sold anything of the kind—they said they had not—Mr. Nathan said, "I am sure you have been robbing me, take him away, policeman"—he then began crying, and said, "Pray forgive me, I will tell you all about it, it never was sold, I took it to my sister Ellen, and she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, this is the only thing I ever took."</p>

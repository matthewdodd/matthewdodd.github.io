                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 376). On Thursday evening, 17th April, I saw the prisoner in Fleet-street—I saw something bulky in his coat<lb></lb>pocket—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I told him I was an officer, and I took him into Crane-court—I said I must see what he had, and he pulled out this paper parcel—he said it was some brushes he brought from his father's, in Waterloo-road—I told him I was not satisfied, and took him to the station—he there said he brought them from his master's, Mr. Davies, in Houndsditch, and was going to take them to his father's, in the Strand, for his father to pick out some of them, and what his father did not approve he would take back—I opened the parcel, and it contained these two half-dozens of hair-brushes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Houndsditch; I have two partners; we sell brushes. The prisoner was in our employ—to the best of my belief, these are our brushes, from their general appearance, the paper in which they are,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120067"></xptr>
               <p>and the manner they are wrapped up; and the prisoner said they were ours—he had no permission to take these, or any other brushes—be was most decidedly forbidden—it is a regulation of our establishment that they are not to remove anything—I do not know the prisoner's father.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do your other two partners take a share in the management of the business? <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> Yes; none of our young men are allowed to take goods out—they may require some goods for themselves, and we give them permission to have a few at the wholesale price; but on the day these were taken no business was transacted—our Christian assistants were there—it is an express regulation that nothing shall be removed on days when the warehouse is closed—I was not in the warehouse that day—I had not spoken to the prisoner in reference to that day, but when I saw him at the station he told me he knew the regulation—I do not know of his having a clock and a picture-frame that he took out and paid for, but it is possible—we pay our men on Saturday evening—if they have had anything, we are not very stringent, they may pay in a day or two afterwards—one of my partners, my brother, might have been at the warehouse that day; Mr. Hyam was not—we possibly have forty or fifty assistants—the prisoner would have been back there on the Friday, and would receive his wages on Saturday—the wholesale price of these brushes is 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—it is not usual for our assistants to have a dozen articles—they might have one for themselves—they are infants' hair-brushes—if the prisoner could have sold them, I do not know that we should have refused his having them, but we should not have approved of it—I do not know what his wages were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors; it is my duty to make an entry of any goods that are given out to the young men. I did not make any entry of these brushes—I did not know anything about them—I was at the warehouse that Thursday—the prisoner did not apply to me for any goods; if he had I should have refused it, because no goods are to go out on days that we are closed—if the prisoner took these, it was quite with<lb></lb>out my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that the young men take things, and have them entered afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of it; it used to be done at one time, but it has not fur some months—the prisoner once had a picture-frame, but it was booked at the time—I do not recollect his having a clock—there is a young man who enters goods, if I am not in the warehouse—if I am there it would be my duty to do so.</p>

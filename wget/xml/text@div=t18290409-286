On Sunday night, or Monday morning, the 30th of March, between one and two o'clock, I was going home, and O'Donnell spoke to me, at the end of Fleet-street; he asked me where I was going - I never saw him before; I am certain he is the man; I told him I was going home; he said he would give me half-a-crown if I would take a walk along with him - I said I knew no place on this side the water, and he said he did; I turned, and went with him; he took me to <placeName id="t18290409-286-crimeloc1621">Lion and Lamb-court, Golden-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of O'Donnell doing what you have mentioned? - A. Yes; there were two besides him - I could not swear to either of them; I cannot say which of them pulled my things off: they were holding me on the ground while my things were being pulled off - O'Donnell held me on the ground while my things were pulled off; they were all three nearly together; while I was on the ground, O'Donnell struck me several times on my head, while I was being thrown down, and while I was down, and he put his hand over my mouth and nose - the other two men seemed to be in the place opposite when they began to pull me: I had a shilling and sixpence tied up in the corner of the handkerchief, which they took from me- I should not know either of the other two men: they all went into No. 8; the watchman came up - I was then on my hands and knees, trying to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090127"></xptr>get up; I told him what had happened; he looked about for my things, but nothing was to be found; I also looked about for them - the watchman had a lantern, and there was a gas-light in the middle of the court; the watchman then went into No. 8, and I saw the prisoner Daley standing at the window of the first-floor, with his coat off - the house is only one story high; O'Donnell was lying in bed, with all the clothes covered over him; the watchman pulled the clothes down, but he could not make any sense of O'Donnell; he pretended to be very much intoxicated - I said, directly I saw him, that he was the man; they took Daley to the watch-house, and me also; they went back, and brought O'Donnell -Cooper, the officer, the watchman, the patrol, and Finch, were there; they all went into the house; Wood was also in the house. I believe, when Daley and I came down stairs with the watchman, my things laid opposite the door - I saw my bonnet, handkerchief, shawl, and pattens there.</p>


               <p>Cross-examained by MR. BARRY. Q. With whom do you live? A. With my brother and sister - they lodge there; they lived at first in Brunswick-street: I had moved with them from there to this house, a week before -I board and lodge with them: I am an unfortunate girl; I have lived at St. Luke's workhouse since this; the Magistrate thought proper to send me there - my brother and sister know where I am; I had left home about eight o' clock that evening, or between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you asked at the office at what time you left home, and said, at twelve at night? A. No, I was never asked at what time I left home; there was a second hearing; I was not then asked at what time I left home -I do not recollect your asking me the question; twelve o' clock is generally the time I return - I had the shilling and sixpence in my handkerchief; I had not received that out of doors that night - I dined and had tea at home: I had been in company with a person before, on the other side of the water; I had only been in company with one; it was a young man; I cannot say what time I spent with him - I did not drink with him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how many hours you were in his company? A. I was not "hours" at all, nor yet an hour; I cannot say how long I was with him - O'Donnell was a perfect stranger to me; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the man who spoke to you in Fleet-street, a person named Burke? A. No, O'Donnell is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When the patrol spoke to you, what was the reason you went away without waiting for your half-crown? A. The patrol said I had better go home, and I took his advice - I had not got the half-crown; I turned away, and the patrol saw me below the brewhouse; when O'Donnell followed me, I refused to return at first, and then went, as he said he would give me another shilling - I did not at first object to go for the half-crown; that I recollect - I will say nothing but the truth; I do not know that I objected at first to have half a crown; there is one gas-light in the court; I do not know whether there is more - I had never been there before; I spoke to no woman on the road; O'Donnell spoke to no woman but myself - O'Donnell put his hand on my shoulder, and tried to push me into a place; I was not pushed in, as I put my hand to the side of the door, and hindered them from getting me in - it is a public privy; I saw nobody about till I felt two men pulling me - I cannot swear to those men; Daley is as near the height of one of them as possible - he is a common-sized man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are we to understand you were pushed by one, and pulled by two inside, and yet they could not get you in? A. I am not certain the two were inside: they did not get me in, for O'Donnell knocked me down in the court - I called out, when I found there was more than one - that was before a hand was put before my mouth, and O'Donnell after that cried out, "Stop the b-y b-cb's mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand that was to stop your calling? A. I thought it might be so, till he put his hand over my mouth and nose; I heard nothing about a lark - no liberties had been taken with my person that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate the persons you could not identify were pulling your legs and shoulders while you were on the ground? A. Yes, I did; the watchman and others searched for my things before I went into the house, and when we came out, they were found on the ground; the patten laid at a little distance, but the other things were thrown in a heap together, not tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had assembled at that time? A. I did not see any; I did not notice a woman looking out of her window; I think there are houses only on one side of the court; when I went into the house, I said I thought Daley looked like one of the men; I did not say Sheridan, the landlord, was one - I spoke to nobody but O'Dounell; I said Daley looked like one, but I could not swear to him; when O'Donnell came into the watch-house I said I knew his voice, and he was the man; I did not say I knew Daley's voice; I did not speak to one Kenney.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 30th of March, at a quarter before two o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Playhouse-yard: I heard some foot-steps at the end of Lion and Lamb-court, which is in St. Luke's,and in Middlesex; I called the wathchman to bring his light - he came with his light, and three or four men and one woman were in the entry; I asked the woman what she was doing there, she said she was brought there by one of the men; I told her she had better go home, and she walked away; I immediately asked the men if they lived there - they said they did live in that court; I told them it was time they should be at home and when I came down to the end of the yard, the girl was standing by a post, and asked me to direct her to Blackfriars-road; I knew three of the men - that was Daley, O'Donnell, and Burke; I knew them by seeing them come out of their place to go to work of a morning; I went a little way down the lane, with the prosecutrix, pointed to the bottom of the lane, and directed her home; I crossed over to the other side of the way, and while standing there I saw O'Donnell come out of Playhouse-yard, and go in the same direction as the girl had gone, and in two or three minutes I saw her and him returning up the lane again - walking arm-in arm; they came up to Playhouse-yard, and turned the corner again; and after turning the corner, there were three or four of the same party standing talking to the watchman on the opposite side of the way; and in the course of half a minute, they left him and proceeded up the court after the man and woman; I im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090128"></xptr>mediately proceeded over to another watchman, who was coming down the lane; I and two watchman went from the other side of the way to the corner of the yard, and heard a person screaming; we ran up Lion and Lamb-court, and saw the prosecutrix rising from the ground, apparently very much dejected, her hair very much disordered, and all over mud and wet, she told me something, and made her complaint to me; we went to search if we could find any of the property she had lost but found none - she pointed to a house, we went in, and while looking below (there was a man and his wife in bed) we heard a window pulled up, and footsteps up stairs; we immediately went up stairs and met Daley coming from towards the window - the prosecutrix then came up stairs and said that was one of them, that was Daley, and on looking round there were some more men asleep in a bed; she did not point out any of them, but on the third bed, on coming towards the door, we saw a heap on the bed, and on pulling the coverlid down we found O'Donnell underneath, with his clothes on; we tried to awake him, to get sense into him, but he appeared quite speechless, we could not get a word from him - the man and woman who were below came up stairs, and said he had not been out of bed since nine o'clock that morning; on taking hold of his hand to look at it, the sleeve of his jacket was all over wet mud - we took Daley into custody, and brought him out at the door, and on coming out of the door of the house the watchman pointed to the things that laid in the court; (there were three beds in the room, the prosecutrix did not recognise any body on the second bed); the watchman picked the things up and took them to the watch-house with Daley, and as we turned to come on I saw a handkerchief lying down, which I picked up, and told the girl to tie it round her neck, which was quite bare; and when we came just to the bottom of the court I met Cooper, the inspector; I delivered the girl to him, and remained close in sight of the premises till he returned again with the watchman - they went into the house and brought O'Donnell down, and took him to the watch-house - I remained behind; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the prosecutrix she had better go home? A. I did; she stood with O'Donnell close at the corner; the others were at a distance from them, at the turn of the court - she said one of the men had brought her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course she gave you to understand there were other men there? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were her words? A She said she had been brought there by one of the men: those were her words; that was not the first time, but when we went to her assistance - when I first went to her she said nothing about any men.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. She pointed out O'Donnell in bed? A. We turned the clothes down, and she said she could swear that was one of the men; we could not make him understand, speak, or move - she said Daley was one of the men, that was before we saw O'Donnell - the man and woman who came up were both undressed; there were seven inmates altogether - I do not know their names; I knew Sheridan by sight, as I had his brother in custody a little while ago; I did not know him by name till then - I have ascertained that he keeps the house; I have been a patrol these five years - I believe there are twelve houses in the court, several of them had their windows up and people looking out; I saw none of the inhabitants of the court down below except the people of that house; a window next door but one to the house was open, and a person looking out at No. 10 - the next house to that is empty; there is a small gutter in the court - I found the handkerchief close to the end of the gutter, it was a pocket handkerchief - I found one patten lying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She pointed out Daley as one of the men? A. Yes; he was coming from the window, with his coat off - he was the first we saw on going into the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 30th of March, about a quarter before two o'clock, the patrol called me for a light - I was opposite Playhouse-yard; I went up to Lion and Lamb-court with him, and saw O'Donnell, Daley and Burke, all three standing there together - I knew Burke before, but not the other two; I am certain of the prisoners - the patrol told the prosecutrix to go home; she went away -O'Donnell went after her in a few minutes, and I saw him come back with her; Burke came down Playhouse-yard over to me, and spoke to me - then Daley and two or three more, who were standing there, went up Playhouse-yard; I had spoken to them before that - I heard a scream of Watch! called out; I went up Lion and Lamb-court, where the scream came from, and the prosecutrix was just getting up; she pointed to No. 8 - I went in there with the patrol and another watchman; I saw Daley, who had just got his coat off, going to bed - several more were in bed there; I saw O'Donnell in bed with the clothes covered all over him - Coombs said Daley was one of them; we took him to the watch-house with her; as we went along Daley said it was not him, and said, "Here is a shilling for you to drink, it was not me, and I nudged you when you were there; it was O'Donnell;" O'Donnell was in bed covered with the clothes, and appeared to be very much in liquor; Coombs said at the watch-house that she could swear to him by his voice - she had pointed him out when he was in bed; when we came down, Finch picked up a shawl, bonnet, pair of pattens, and a handkerchief, and gave it to me to take to the watch-house - they were all rolled up together.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to Lion and Lamb-court on Monday morning, the 30th of March, about ten minutes before two o'clock; the patrol came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090129"></xptr>me - I went into No. 8, and saw Daley standing by the window with his coat off; the girl gave charge of him, and I took him to the watch-house - I pulled the bedclothes down, and saw O'Donnell there dressed; I tried to rouse him - he pretended to be so intoxicated, no sense could be beat into him; the girl saw me pull the clothes down; I felt wet mud on his nose - the girl charged Daley first; I came back after taking him, and took O'Donnell to the watch-house; the girl pointed him out in the bed, but he seemed so drunk we could do nothing with him till after I took the other to the watch-house; I picked up the shawl in the court, and gave it to the patrol; I saw the bonnet lying in the gutter, but nothing else; I did not see the handkerchief - they were right opposite the door of No. 8.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the gutter from the house? A. A very little distance - the court is very narrow; I found the shawl very near the gutter, the bonnet lying in the gutter, and a patten was found in the gutter, but I did not see it - I went to the watch-house; Coombs said nothing in my presence of knowing any body's voice.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. On the morning of the 30th of March, about two o'clock, I was in Playhouse-yard, and met Daley in the custody of Finch and Woods: I took the girl to the watch-house - I afterwards went to No. 8, Lion and Lamb-court, and saw O'Donnell in bed, with all his clothes on except his flannel jacket, and covered over with the bed clothes; I shook him, and told him it was of no use to play tricks, and if he did not come out of bed I would pull him out; he got out of bed, and put his flannel jacket on - he then put one of his boots on up stairs, and the other down; I took him to the watch-house - the minute he entered the watch-house he began to speak; the prosecutrix said,"That is one of them, I can swear to him by his voice" - she had not seen his face then; one of the arms of his jacket was wet, and the other was wet round the cuff; the prosecutrix's things were delivered to me at the watch-house- the bonnet and shawl were delivered to me by Brown, the watch-house keeper; the handkerchief was given to me by the prosecutrix - she had it round her neck when I took her to the watch-house; Brown is not here; I received them in the watch-house - the patrol gave me one patten in Playhouse-yard, and Brown the other; I have had them ever since - I found no money in the handkerchief; there was no knot in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there the slightest appearance of there having been a knot in it? A. It was as she gave it to me in the morning when she was going away to the office, just before eleven o'clock; Brown was not bound over to come here.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Playhouse-yard, which is five houses from Lion and Lamb-court - I know No. 8 there. On the morning of the 30th of March, after two o'clock, I saw the prosecutrix going into No. 8 with the watchman, and as soon as she entered the lower room I saw the one pair of stairs window open, and saw a bundle chucked out of the window, but what was in it I cannot tell - Daley chucked it out; I knew him before - I have often seen him in the court, and at the door; there was a candle on the window-ledge, so that I could see him; I am certain it was him - he had no coat on; it was a small sized bundle; I cannot say how large, because I only saw it by the light of the candle - I could not see where it fell, because there is a privy between my window and the house, so that I could not see the bottom of the court - I had to look sideways; my house is on the opposite side, four or five yards from No. 8; No. 7 is directly opposite to me - only one side of the court is called Playhouse-yard, and the other Lion and Lamb-court; I have not to turn a corner to go to the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first give an account of this? A. On Tuesday I went to Cooper's house; I did not call out that a bundle was thrown out, because I did not know the girl had been robbed - I heard a scream; there was a stir in the court - I am a shoe-binder, and single; I have lived there nearly four years - I was in bed, but heard screams, and got up; I am an English woman - a great many Irish live in the court; I saw the prosecutrix in the watehman's hands, and could have called over to them if I had liked; they were not above five yards from me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you saw the bundle thrown out, was the patrol outside or inside? A. Inside; I remained at the window till he and the prosecutrix came out - I spoke of this on Monday; but did not tell Cooper till Tuesday.</p>

               <p>DALEY'S Defence.

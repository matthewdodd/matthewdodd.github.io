               <p>in Leather Lane. On 10th Nov., about 10 o'clock in the morning, I was in Wooding Street, Lambeth; I saw the two prisoners there—I went, playing my organ, down a court where there is a house where they some<lb></lb>times give me a penny—I went down, and the shop was shut up—the two prisoners followed me, and Lee caught hold of me round the waist, and tried to get my pocket—I thought he was in joke—I had in my pocket a half crown, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a sixpence, and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Burns was in the court at that time—when Lee caught hold of me and caught hold of my pocket, I went into the middle of the court, and then both the prisoners caught me—one caught hold of my shoulder, and the other round my waist; they threw me down, and both got on me—they took my money away—Lee put his hand in my pocket first—I cannot swear which had my money—they only left one farthing in my pocket—they kicked me, and went away—I told a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Eagle Street. On the morning of 10th Nov. I saw the prosecutor with his organ in Little Windmill Street about 11 o'clock—shortly afterwards I saw the two prisoners following him; he went down Jane Place, they offered him a halfpenny to go down, and they followed him—I followed behind; as soon as they got down, one got on one side of the prosecutor and the other on the other—he was coming back, and Burns jumped on his back; he could hardly stand—then Burns got off, and Lee caught him round the waist and threw him down—while he was on the ground, the prisoners were on the top of him—I saw Lee put his hand in his right hand waistcoat pocket, and he shook something up in his hand which sounded like silver—the prosecutor cried out, "Stop thief!" and tried to get hold of their legs, and they both gave him several kicks while he was on the ground—Lee afterwards opened his hand, and I saw a half crown and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in it—the prosecutor got up and said something which I could not understand, and the prisoners both said, "If you don't go we will smash you"—I can swear the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did they both say, "If you don't go, we will smash you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they said it together—one part of Jane Court is in Wood<lb></lb>ing Street—I was about two yards from Lee when he opened his hand—I can swear it was not two half crowns he had—I can swear I saw a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, it looked so bright—he did not show it to me; he showed it to the other prisoner—I do not believe they saw me—only bad girls live in that court; there was no one going down it—the prisoners went on towards Wooding Street—I left them, came out with the prosecutor to the policeman, and the two prisoners were in the other end of the court—there is a public house there, the White Horse—I heard some persons say that they had turned out of there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burns.</hi> This witness says that we offered the prosecutor a halfpenny; the prosecutor did not say that. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said that you would give him a halfpenny, and you shook your pocket, and said it was the last half-penny that you had got.</p>

               <p>prosecutor came to me, and complained of being robbed of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and being ill used in Jane Place—I went with him, he pointed the prisoners out, and I took them—I found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Burns—I told them what I wanted them for—they both said they knew nothing about it, in a <hi rend="italic">staggering</hi> sort of manner—they were both a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter before 11 o'clock—I did not see Andrews till he came to the station—he did not point out the prisoners—they both appeared as if they had been up all night—since then I have made a little inquiry; I find Lee is a respectable working man—he gave a true statement of where he lived.</p>

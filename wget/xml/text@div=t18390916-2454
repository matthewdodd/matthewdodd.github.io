                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl. I live in John's-buildings, St. Ann-street, Westminster—the prisoner occupied the first floor front room in the house—It is let out in lodgings—on the 16th of August I went home at half-past twelve o'clock at night—I found my room door burst open, and the padlock and staple on the floor-nothing was done to the outer door of the house—I had left my door padlocked when I went out about half-past nine o'clock—I called a policeman, and examined my room, and missed a sheet which I had left on the back of a chair before the fire—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the house when I went out-a boy lodges with him—I went up stairs with the police<lb></lb>man, and asked the prisoner if he had heard anybody at my door—he said he had heard somebody burst it open, and he came to the top of the stairs to see who it was, but they were gone, he could not see any one-we went into his room, and found my sheet locked in his drawer—I am sure it was the same I had left on the chair when I went away—I missed nothing else—there was no other property of any value—he laid the sheet was his own—I know it by its being torn, and I joined it the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the house—I saw the prisoner standing at the door about half-past eleven o'clock, and spoke to him—I returned again in about two minutes, and he shut the door—about half-past twelve o'clock the prosecutrix came, and complained that her door was broken open—I went with her, and found the padlock and staple on the floor—I searched the prisoner's drawers—he opened all but a very wall drawer—I made him open that, and found the sheet—he said it was his, but at the station-house he said he did not know how it came there—before the Magistrate he said he was drunk, and by banging the door-post the staple came out.</p>

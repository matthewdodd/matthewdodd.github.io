                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday morning, the 24th of April, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the Mile End-road, coming towards town, carrying a great-coat, a body-coat, and a waistcoat on his arm—I asked him what he had got there—he said his clothes—I asked him to let me look at them, and said, "They are much too large for you, and that don't satisfy me; you must come to the station"—he said, "If I do, you shall carry the things"—I asked him to give them to me, which he did, and immediately ran away—I followed—a per<lb></lb>son in the road stopped him—I took him to the station, and said, "Now perhaps you will account for how you came in possession of these things"—he said, "It is no good my telling lies about it now, I stole them from the Black Swan, where I formerly lived"—I met him about two miles from the Black Swan.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Black Swan, at Bow. The prisoner was my waiter, and left on the Monday before this, the 19th of April—he came into the tap-room on Tuesday, and I ordered him out—I did not see him again till Sunday morning, at the station, where I found him with these coats, which are mine—I had the body coat on on the Saturday, and the waistcoat, and hung it up in the back-parlour at seven o'clock—that was the last time I saw them—I did not miss them till the policeman came—I saw the great-coat hanging there when I hang the other up—it was in the same place—at the station I asked the prisoner what he had done with a letter which was in the pocket—he said he had put it into the great-coat pocket—I found it was not there—he then said he had left it on the table—I went to the house, and found it in another coat-pocket—I did not hold out either threat or promise to him—I said, "You slept in the house all night, and got in the back way"—he said he got in at the par<lb></lb>lour-window at four o'clock in the morning—I believe the parlour-window was fast at half-past eleven, for I went round the house, as I generally do—there are outside shutters to it—when I was in the room at seven o'clock, the shutters were open, but the window closed down—there is no fastening to it, it is a sash—a person could get from the skittle-ground into our house—six or seven houses open into the skittle-ground, and they can come into my house by the doors—there is a staircase from the door through the washhouse to a bed-room which is not occupied—a person could come down through the washhouse again, and get to the parlour—I saw the back-door fast about half-past eleven—it is generally open all day till after ten—the bed appeared to have had somebody in it—it had been made the day before—I found no marks of violence on the doors or windows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the Black Swan. On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 24th of April, I came down at seven o'clock, and found the two passage doors open, and one of the parlour shutters—a policeman came about five minutes after seven—I afterwards went up to the back bed-room—the bed had marks of somebody having slept between the sheets—none of the family had slept there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My reason for asking the witness to let me through was, that I might get 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the pot-boy to pay my lodgings; not succeeding, I walked the streets all night; about four o'clock in the morning, seeing the back-room, called the cave, open, I did get into the house for shelter till the morning; I went into the room where the bed was rumpled and slept there; at six o'clock I went out; walking up Mile End-road, I was stopped; if I had burglariously entered the house at ten o'clock at night, should I have slept there all night? or should I have come away at six o'clock in the morning with the bundle of things? There were silver spoons in the room, and the bar contained money; there was a hatchet I could have used, got the door open, and got the money and silver spoons; I certainly did take the coats when I came down at six o'clock, but it is entirely the prosecutor's fault; it is his duty to see whe<lb></lb>ther his windows are shut or not.

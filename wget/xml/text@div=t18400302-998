Bank notes, and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, all in a purse—there were some sovereigns, and some halves—I had received the notes from my wife on the 30th—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and money were gone, but the Hitchin note was left in the room by the window—the person must have got in at the window, which was pulled down again as before—the room is on the first floor—a ladder must have been used, or he must have climbed up by some palings—there were some black finger-marks on one door-post, and marks of shoes on the brick-work near the window—I had no other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes except what I received from my wife—the prisoner lived opposite my window—I had only taken the house four days, and knew, him only that time—I have seen him in the house about six times—he is a lamp-lighter, I believe.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of October I was up stairs: a little girl came into my shop, and called me, and as I came down I saw through a small window on the stairs a young man standing by the counter: he caught up a bundle of twelve pairs of stockings, and ran to the door, but, instantly returned, seeing Mr. Murray looking at him, through the window. I had got into the shop when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280029"></xptr>came back, and he asked me what I would make him some shirts for. Mr. Murray came in, and said he had taken some stockings out of the window; he then ran out, but was pursued and brought back.</p>

            . I was in Rupert-street on the 25th of October, and saw the prisoner enter this shop, pass his hand round the window, and take the stockings - he came out, and I met him, and stared him full in the face: he returned into the shop, and laid them on the counter; I saw him turn up his coat sleeves and show his wrist-band, and ask Miss Agnew some question - I then went into the shop, and said he ought to be taken up; he pushed by me and knocked off my hat, which Miss Agnew picked up. I pursued him, but lost sight of him; he was soon afterward brought back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you passing the shop - A. Yes; it was seven o'clock in the evening; I did not see any other person there.</p>

            . I received the prisoner in charge from Sweet; he said he had done nothing but taken up the stockings and brought them to the door, and then put them down again on the counter. He asked forgiveness - he turned to an elderly gentleman who appeared to be a friend of the prosecutrix's and said he hoped he would look it over - he replied,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was in company with a young man - A. Yes, and that he took up the stockings and went to the door to bid him good night, then returned, and put them down.</p>

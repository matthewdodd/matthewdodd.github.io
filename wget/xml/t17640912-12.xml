I was not clear in that, and so I stopt him; some gentlemen came up that knew me, and insisted upon my holding him last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked him if it was his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mills. He did, but that was after I turned round, and had seen it in his hand.</p>

               <p>My father and mother live in Kent-street on the other side of the water; my mother was gone to get some Samphire, and my father was at harvest work in the country; I was going to see if my mother was gone in a Gravesend boat; coming back, I saw a lad going after the gentleman; he took the handkerchief and throwed it down; I took it up, and said t o the gentleman, Sir, a lad took the handkerchief from your pocket, and he is gone down at that corner.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see another lad?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The boy told me so; he said there was a boy ran round the corner, but I did not see any boy.</p>

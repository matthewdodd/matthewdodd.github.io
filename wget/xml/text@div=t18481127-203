                  </hi>. I carry on business in the Borough-market and in Rochester-street. The prisoners were in my service and my father's for many years—John Green was the foreman of my place at Rochester-street, and David had to take a cart round to the butchers to bring in fat which was to be melted—on the morning of the 14th Nov. I made arrang<lb></lb>ements as if I were going out of tovvn, and placed myself in a loft which com<lb></lb>manded a view of my premises—I saw Joseph hold a sack open and a man named Puibrook filled it—it was then taken in the yard, but before it was taken they asked David Green if he was ready—(he was at that time harness<lb></lb>ing his horse to go out)—Puibrook then carried out the sack towards the cart—I did not sec him put it in, but I saw the cart come out with the sack in it, and David Green was driving it—I came down and stopped it—David</p>

               <p>said he knew nothing about it—I took him and the cart to the station—Joseph was taken in about an hour afterwards—Pulbrook ran away, and I have not seen him since—the sack contained rather more than a hundred weight of fat—it was removed from the boiling-house—it was David Green's business to go out with his cart empty to fetch in goods, but not to take anything out—this fat was in a state in which it never goes from my premises.</p>

I beg for mercy; I saw nothing of the transaction till I got out of the yard; I was asked if I was all ready; I said, "Yes;" I got ready and drew out; as soon as I got out, my master came and jumped in the cart, and said, "What is that?" I said I did not know; he ordered me to drive to the station.</p>

I said "Do," and he did so; I put the window down and looked through the glass, and saw some soldiers beating a man, there were ten or twelve soldiers, our passage door was shut. The man they were beating under the window happened to be one of my lodgers, whom I did not know. I saw this man bend his back (he was very tall) and turn in at the door; the soldiers all followed the poor man in, and my husband and I got up, and the first thing they did was to knock me down. I was so stunned, that I saw no more till I saw my husband laying down on the floor with his hands stretched out, he was bleeding from his head - he could not say a word. I went for a doctor, he was taken away to the hospital. I was with him when he died - he died in four days.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What lodgers had you in your house - A. I cannot say. I take in poor people - match makers and that sort. I had seven or eight lodgers; the man they beat had lived two years with us, backward and forward - he is now absent: he was one of Mr. Saunders's shewmen. One of the lodgers had opened the door to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. You was knocked down by the rush of the door against you - A. No; my room door always stands open. I was knocked down in the parlour, with my head against the fire-place. My husband was in another room, facing the parlour, on the other side of the passage - we call that the kitchen, or travellers' room, where the nightly lodgers go. There are three wooden steps which lead up to the street door.</p>

I saw a quantity of people going down to the Almonry, about seven o'clock in the evening, I cannot say how many, but there was a great quantity. I knew none of them. Some had red jackets on and some white; there was a drummer in full regimentals - it was the prisoner M'Carthy; I was looking out of my window, they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180027"></xptr>in the Almonry, running all manner of ways.

            . I am a private in the 18th regiment of Hussars. On the 18th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Dean-street, above fifty people were collected (inhabitants and soldiers together). I could not observe what they were about till they got into the Almonry. I saw the soldiers and the inhabitants quarrelling and fighting together. Some of the inhabitants, met the soldiers on the top of the New-way, a great disturbance took place between them at the time they were moving towards Orchard-street, which is between the top of the New-way and St. Ann's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they have to pass Cagle's house from the New-way to St. Ann's-lane - A. Yes; I went as far as the top of Orchard-street, and stopped just by the public-house there, three or four doors from Cogle's house, but not in sight of it, and saw several of the Queen-square police officers bringing some soldiers back - they were very much cut about the head - they brought them down to the watch-house, and remained there some little time. and then there was another riot between the soldiers and inhabitants, and some of the soldiers were put in the watch-house, they then dispersed, in different directions, peaceably, and I went to my quarters. About half an hour after the people were in a bustle in the street. My quarters are the Hoop and Grapes, Queen-square. I stopped in the Broadway, and remained there during the evening. I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first of what you saw, until the officers taking the men into custody, did you see any one you knew - A. I saw M'Carthy among the rest, he was in his full dress, with his side-arms hanging by his side, and he had his sword across his two thighs, sheathed - it hung in his belt in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was M'Carthy in the midst of them, or how - A. He was in different parts with the soldiers; I did not see that he was more officious than any of the others. When I saw him last he came out of Tothill-street, down through the Almonry; there was a number of soldiers and inhabitants with him - he was going in front, and I suppose a hundred soldiers and inhabitants following him. I believe none of the soldiers had side-arms. I saw two or three of the mob with sticks, one with a brown stick, another with a piece of paling; they were carrying them in their hands, going through the mob together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the hands of the soldiers, or the inhabitants - A. Both; but the inhabitants dispersed as quick as they could when the riot began again. Sometimes the inhabitants followed the soldiers, and sometimes the soldiers followed the inhabitants. I saw one man struck by a soldier, but I do not know who the soldier was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the five prisoners in the course of that evening, while the disturbance was going on - A. I saw M'Carthy; I do not recollect any of the others. He was in full dress, with the soldiers - sometimes with the mob, and sometimes not. I heard him speak in Tothill-street, when he was walking in front of the mob, but what he said I could not tell - he appeared to me to be rather intoxicated. He was walking on, with his sword across his thigh. I saw one inhabitant struck by a soldier, on his head, in the New-way - I do not know his name. I do not think I should know the soldier again, he was so disfigured and bloody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BROADRICK. Q. How long do you suppose all this occupied - A. About two hours; a great deal of it was after some of the soldiers were put in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.M'Carthy held his sword in his hand sheathed, was it not the best posture he could put it in to prevent any one snatching it from the sheath - A. I should think so.</p>

            . On the 18th of June, I lived in Orchard-street; Cogle lived at No. 62, in the same street, on the same side of the way; about eight in the evening I was at my door, I heard a noise and went into the middle of the road, and saw a mob of soldiers come up the New-way towards Cogle's, there were eight or nine of them, they were running up the New-way - a man named Rowbottom, in a white jacket, was the first that entered Cogle's house, he had a piece of paling in his hand, that is the man, (pointing him out) I am positive - the others all followed into Cogle's house - I went on the step of my door to move some things which I had there, and went into the middle of the road - in five or ten minutes, in view of Cogle's house, a few people had then collected about the house, some of them were soldiers - I then saw Rowbottom come out of Cogle's house with a piece of paling in his hand - there was a poor man running along the street, and Rowbottom ran after him; the rest of the soldiers came out of Cogle's - I cannot say that I took such notice of any one so much as Rowbottom, because he had a black eye - I know M'Carthy, I saw him standing on the step of Cogle's door, with one foot on the step; this was before Rowbottom came out, he stood on the step with a sword drawn in his hand, waving it backwards and forwards over his head - I do not know what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him standing on the step of the door after you removed your things or before - A. Before, and afterwards the soldiers had entered the house, when I returned, he was gone - I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were absent five or ten minutes from when you saw the soldiers enter till you returned - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you - A. A butcher; my shop is not far from Cogle's and on the opposite side - I think I saw Timbrell at her door - there was a considerable number of persons collected at the top of New-way, the people were all as quiet as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. No fighting or expressions against the soldiers - A. Not the least; they were blaming the soldiers among themselves for the manner they acted - I was in the middle of the people at the top of New-way, none of them had any thing in their hands - a young man ran into my shop with something in his hand, he was not a soldier - I was not in my shop half a minute before the soldiers came down Orchard-street - when the soldiers came up we all gave way; the man that was knocked down got up and ran into Cogle's, (I believe he lodged there), and the soldiers followed him - M'Carthy just made a stand at the door, when he came out, but when he went up, he went straight in - I did not see him move his sword over his head, I saw it across his thighs, and he went straight in.</p>

            . I live in Orchard-street, just opposite Cogle's; I heard a noise in the Almonry, about five o'clock, it lasted till about eight - I was looking out of my one pair of stairs window at a quarter before eight o'clock, and saw the soldiers enter from the corner of New-way, (which is three doors off) into the street with great fury, with sticks and pieces of paling - I saw a drummer with a sword at Mrs. Cogle's door, but I lost sight of him by the others coming up and beating one of Cogle's lodgers - I saw the soldier go in and come out.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the drummer when you last saw him. - A. On the step of the door - I did not have him in sight a moment, he had a sword drawn in his hand, and was holding it over his head, some of the soldiers ran in and a great many ran another way, that is all I know - I saw all the prisoners there, I know them by their looking up at me while they were in action - the left side of Rowbottom's face was very much beat; I saw them all five before my house, and saw them next morning in custody, and did not know them there exactly in the flurry, but when I went before the jury, I knew them better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Besides the soldiers, did you not see a great many loose characters with shovels, pickaxes and different instruments - A. Yes; they went down into the Almonry, but I did not know what they were at; it was about the same time as I saw the soldiers.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not see Cogle at his door - A. No; I heard him reading the death of Abel, as he read loud - there was very great confusion; every one was obliged to close their houses.</p>

            . I lived in the same house with Cogle. I was in Orchard-street about eight o'clock, and saw the soldiers coming down the New-way, towards Orchard-street, with sticks and staves in their hands - the people were running before them, and they were running in a brutish manner; I made my way from Cogle's, to get home, and when I got there, some of them had got up to Cogle's house before I got there; a man in a drummer's dress stood in the centre of the lobby, over against the door leading to the kitchen, inside the passage. I went forward, he made a cut at me, but missed me, and cut Mr. Cogle on the side of the head, Cogle fell down by the side of the drawers. I went through the kitchen door into the yard, I got over a railing and got away. I do not know what became of the drummer, I left the door open when I ran in. M'Carthy must have entered before me. I cannot say how many went in before me, nor do I know whether any one but M'Carthy entered before me. I cannot swear to them - I do not know who the drummer was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been mentioning M'Carthy by name, why did you call him so - A. I heard people calling him M'Carthy. I should not know him again, they called the drummer M'Carthy - I cannot point him out.</p>

            . I am a private in the West Midlesex Militia, and lived at the deceased's house. I was standing at the door between seven and eight in the evening, and saw a great mob come up the street out of the New-way. I observed Rowbottom and M'Carthy among them - I am sure of them, they were about the centre of the mob; they came down towards where I stood. When they came to the door, I heard some of the soldiers, whom I do not know, say,</p>
               <p>"These are the very ****, we will let them know this is Waterloo day."</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, did you hear any thing else said - A. No, not to my knowledge. I know M'Carthy and Rowbottom by sight, but was never acquainted with them. I believe Rowbottom said something, but I forget what it was. I saw Rowbottom enter the house, he had a piece of railing with two sharp edges to it, and I believe, one or two followed him. M'Carthy was in his drummers dress, and had a sword - most of the soldiers had sticks. M'Carthy followed into the house with his sword drawn. The kitchen is on the right, and the parlour on the left. I saw Ashton standing in the kitchen, near the door, and saw M'Carthy cut right over his shoulder with his sword, it missed him and cut Cogle on the head. Ashton got out of the way, but M'Carthy made a second blow at the deceased, but whether that blow struck him I cannot say. The first cut produced blood, and as he was falling, M'Carthy struck at him a second time. The soldiers kept rushing in, and I made the best of my way up stairs, and fainted away on the bed. I was cut on the head, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180029"></xptr>ten days under the doctor's hands. I produce the hat I had on - it is cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate all you have now said - A. No, I was not asked to state it. I had been out of Cogle's three or four minutes when the crowd came towards there. I saw none of the disturbance before they came up. I did not state about M'Carthy before the Magistrate, because he was not brought up. I did not mention about Cogle being wounded. I was ordered to attend in the evening, and M'Carthy was not then taken, so I went away. Rowbottom had a black eye and some scratches - he was not much bruised.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you were examined, was the man dead - A. No, I was obliged to go to Uxbridge with the Militia for twenty-one days, or I should have been taken for a deserter, so I could not attend the next examination. I attended at Queen-square when I returned, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cogle was dead when you returned - A. Yes.</p>

            , we live in Orchard-street, on the same side as Cogle. I first saw them coming into the street about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; there was a great many persons indeed, they came with sticks in their hands, beating a man up the narrow part of the street - I did not observe any of their faces, the man they were beating, ran across towards Cogle's; he went up the steps, and the soldiers followed him. I saw him go into the house, three soldiers followed him up the steps, and went in - I went away. I do not know how many more went in - I did not know them. I was in Well's the butcher's shop. I returned to Cogle's in about three minutes - I know none of them but M'Carthy, I have known him many years, but do not know him to be one. I saw a drummer, but did not know it was him, I was so agitated.</p>

            . I live in St. Ann's-lane, some distance from the Almonry. I lived at the deceased's house twenty-two months. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening I was standing looking at the soldiers fighting down the Almonry; they came out of the Almonry right up the New-way, into Orchard-street. I told Mrs. Cogle she had better shut her door - it was not shut; I had hardly spoke the words to her, before several soldiers came up; I saw

             then, they followed a man into Cogle's house, and beat him about the head, and Lee had a stone in his hand, which he held up to heave at me - I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, don't knock my brains out as you are knocking the rest out;" he then dropped the stone out of his hand. Mrs. Cogle said,</p>

             shoved her down and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d infernal old ****, what do you know about it," and pushed her down with both his hands; a man about five feet eight or nine inches high stood there, in the centre of the passage, beating a man over the head; the deceased stood there, with his hands extended up, he never spoke a word to any person whatever; the tall man, after beating the man, whipped his hands round from that man, and struck the deceased, and down he fell; he had a white jacket on, with a blue cape and blue cuffs, and had a stave in his hand. I will not say whether it was the stave of a cask, or part of a fence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cogle in the kitchen while he was being struck - A. He stood against the kitchen door; they were beating Patterson on the arm, it so stunned him, he ran up and down stairs, and into the street. I escaped also, and saw nothing further pass in the house; I jumped over a fence, and over two walls into another street, and saw Cooper take a man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. How long had you been in the streets - A. Not long, three quarters of an hour, I went from my lodging in St. Ann's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you drank much to day - A. Not much, about a pint and a half pint of porter, nothing else. I had not a light long coat on, I was dressed as I am now. I had nothing in my hand. I had come out to walk in the Park, came down Queen-street, up Tothill-street, and saw three or four soldiers fighting, I then went into Orchard-street - I was not in the Almonry. I got into Orchard-street, about half-past seven or eight o'clock, and was there about ten minutes. I saw a crowd down in the Almonry, and soldiers fighting there - I was not nearer than seventy fathoms to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure Cogle was knocked down by a stave or stick - A. That I cannot say, for he fell almost at the same instant as his wife - there was nine or ten people in the house, and five in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your way of life - A. I am a porter in the Haymarket - I have been a British seaman.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw Cogle knocked down with a piece of wood - A. I did not see it.</p>

Mr. Cogle came into my room on the right side of the kitchen where I was, the soldiers were in the room, and he came in after them, to ask what was the matter - I do not know how many there were. Cogle asked what was the matter, but a man in drummer's clothes, with his sword backhanded, in his hand, he knocked me backwards in drawing it - I fell, and he hit Mr. Cogle on the head with the sword, and he fell with the blow, but I cannot tell on what part of the head he hit him - I was not sensible from the blow I received.

On the 18th of June, about seven in the evening, I was in company with Rowbottom, at the Marquis of Granby public-house; as we were going away towards Tothill-street, we saw some boys playing at marbles - about twenty or thirty people were looking on. Rowbottom was tipsy, he went through the ring of marbles, and happened to kick one of them - one of them called after him,</p>
               <p>"What did you kick my marbles for? you b - y lobster, or s - d" - I do not know which, I was three or four yards before Rowbottom - one of the men struck him, I turned back to try to get him away - a man said,</p>

               <p>"Yes;" he struck me on my face directly - I fought him in my own defence, and there was four or five on me at once; they got me down, the man who struck me was in front, and the others behind and on my side - they struck me, and knocked me down four or five times - I fainted away, and do not know what became of me - I was struck by fists, and kicked on my forehead, when I was down; the mark is left now - I do not know what became of Rowbottom, somebody took me away to wash myself.</p>

            . My husband is a labourer, and lives in Jeffery's-buildings, near the Almonry. On the evening of the 18th of June, I was at home, and could see into the Almonry, some persons were there playing at marbles, and ten or twelve others looking at them - I saw two soldiers coming from the bottom of the Almonry, from the Marquis of Granby public-house - I know one of them, it was Rowbottom - I saw him kick the marbles accidentally, and immediately a young man, named Jem Cummings said</p>
               <p>"You b - dy lobster, what did you kick them for?" he gave some answer to Cummings, I do not know what it was; Cummings rose off his knee, and struck the soldier violently on the mouth, the soldier tried to strike him again, but was so much in liquor, that he could not, every time he offered to strike him, he fell - a great many people were collected, which caused a confusion, and some of the girls of the Almonry carried the soldier away; he bled very much, and went to the pump to wash himself, as many as thirty persons came up, he was stopping washing his face - Cummings struck him violently on the head, the people said they would murder the b - s; several struck him violently - some kicked him with their feet, and some struck him with their fists - he was knocked into a cellar, I and my nephew dragged him out and took him into my parlour, we found him very much bruised and bleeding; he was in liquor - after being some time with me, he went away - Cumming's friends live in the neighbourhood now, but I have not seen him since that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what made Rowbottom go from your house - A. A crowd of people ran by crying murder, and saying, a man was murdered in Orchard-street; he threw up the window, and out he jumped - I never saw him before that day, he is the man who was in my house - I washed the blood from his face, and saw him for an hour and twenty minutes, and can swear he is the man; he was treated in a very brutal manner, and would have lost his life if I had not interfered.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life are you in - A. I wash and iron; I am married, I did not know the deceased - Rowbottom was at my house from seven o'clock till twenty minutes past eight - I can see the Almonry from my lodging - I have no clock or watch, but my neighbour Davis, has a clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into his house to see the time - A. Yes; because Rowbottom said he was for guard; he jumped out of the window immediately as I told him what o'clock it was, he had asked me the time - he jumped out on hearing the cries of the people - several people were in the room, none of them had watches but Mrs. Davis, and she lives down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How nigh is your window from the ground - A. It is the ground floor, I had fastened the door that he should not go out to the mob - when I first saw him, he was so drunk he could not return a blow; he was an hour and twenty minutes at my house - I did not attend before the Magistrate, I did not know when the examination took place.</p>
               <p>MR. BROADRICK. Q. Did you give him any tea - A. Two cups; he had recovered a great deal with that, and being washed - he was unknown to me before.</p>

            . I am a private in the second battalion of Coldstream Guards. On the evening of Waterloo day, I went through Wright's passage into the Almonry, and saw Dolben and Rowbottom, and several inhabitants fighting; several people were on each of them, perhaps four, five or six on each - another soldier came up and got fighting with another man, the soldier got rather the best of it, and a great many of the inhabitants who stood there said, what a shame it was, and d - n their eyes, the bl - dy lobsters, they would kill them if they did not leave the Almonry; several of them struck the soldiers with their fists, and then more fell on; they said they would go and get some sticks and kill them - they went away and came again in a few minutes with sticks and stones, some of them were broomsticks, some faggots, and some thicker - there were very few soldiers there, I think about five or six; they cut in among the soldiers as hard as they could with these sticks - some of the soldiers ran through Wright's passage, I went out before them; the last two or three that came out, came into Tothill-street; their heads were cut - when the passage was clear, they returned into the Almonry, and the inhabitants threw some sticks out of window to them.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose some inhabitants are friendly to the soldiers, and some not - A. Yes; the mob then ran away, and the soldiers after them, up the Narrow Way, they turned to the left and I to the right - I saw M'Carthy go down Wright's passage with his sword by his side; some soldier, who had received a blow in the eye, came running across to him and wanted to draw the sword out of its sheath, he would not let him have it; he pulled it to himself, and said he should not have it - he drew it out of the sheath and kept it in his hand, saying, that would not do, and he should not have it - the man went away, and M'Carthy sheathed his sword again - I afterwards saw a great many soldiers running up the New-way, and M'Carthy was behind them, running towards the crowd of soldiers; the other people were before him - I suppose the soldiers were running after the chaps who had been kicking up the row - I did not see M'Carthy strike any one or interfere; he was behind the rest of his comrades - I went home and saw no more.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At first Rowbottom and another soldier were fighting with some more people - A. Yes; five or six people at each of them; I suppose he gave as many blows as he could, he did his best - I do not know whether he was drunk.</p>

            . I live in Peter-street. I have been a soldier, but am discharged. I am a pensioner in the Coldstream Guards. On the 18th of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in the Almonry; I observed a quantity of people scattered about there; I saw no soldiers among them. In five minutes time a set of men collected themselves together in a body, with sticks and staves; I heard one man say</p>
               <p>"Here goes one, go it!" I looked round and saw the whole mob rush up Jeffrey's-buildings. I pushed on to see what they were at, and saw a soldier knocked down; he was doing nothing; when he was down they beat him with their sticks; they then returned by me and saw another soldier, and knocked him down, and beat him with their sticks; he did nothing, he was only looking on, the same as me; they left him, and ran across the Almonry, and there caught another soldier coming across from Wright's passage, and beat him likewise. He had given them no provocation. A party of soldiers hearing the noise were making into the Almonry, and were met in Wright's passage by the mob, and there they had a severe attack. I suppose there were three or four soldiers. More soldiers came from Dean-street - they had nothing in their hands; the mob had sticks and staves. There was a skirmish between them right through the Almonry - a great mob collected: there was double the number more than the soldiers. I saw the officers come into the Almonry to disperse them. They were fighting at that time. I considered the soldiers in great danger of their lives.</p>

On the 18th of June, from six till past eight o'clock, I was in the Almonry, and saw a great crowd of persons collected, soldiers and inhabitants, fighting together - the soldiers were without arms and the inhabitants without sticks, at first; I afterwards saw them with sticks, like the backs of chairs. I saw a man come out of a house with a stick, which he took up in both his hands, and knocked one of the men down. A person named Andrews hit a soldier over the left eye. I saw a great many soldiers knocked down - I cannot mention their names.

Some women were in the mob, with sticks; a woman pushed me in the passage. There were about six soldiers, or more, there. I saw a drummer in Tothill-street, and in the Almonry afterwards, but did not know who he was, or whether he was the same that I saw in Tothill-street.

I was in my own room, about two hundred and fifty yards from the Marquis of Granby, Some men were playing at marbles close under my window; two soldiers were passing - whether they kicked the marbles or not I cannot say, but the men said something to the soldiers which I did not hear - the soldiers did not answer. In a short time they spoke again, and one of the soldiers turned back, and asked if they were talking to him - they called him a b - y-backed ******, up with their fists, and knocked him down. He was in liquor, his comrade went to pick him up, and they knocked him down. The men kept kicking and beating the soldiers on the ground - more soldiers same up, and a fight began; the mob increased, and the soldiers drove them out (the soldiers were not armed); they were away about ten minutes, then returned with sticks and staves of casks. I believe there was then only two soldiers in the Almonry - when the mob saw them, They said</p>
               <p>"Here is two of the *******, let us start them." One of them ran up the buildings, the other remained. I could not see what the mob did to him, as they were out of my sight. I saw the prisoner Jones afterwards, when they returned from pursuing the one into the buildings - he came through the passage; he was doing nothing. One of the mob struck him with a stick. I saw M'Carthy with the rest of the soldiers, not doing any thing.</p>

            . I was in the Almonry on the 18th of June, and saw some persons playing at marbles. I saw M'Carthy stripped of his clothes, to fight. I held his sword, cap, and jacket, while he fought; and then went away.</p>

            . I am a private in the Coldstream Guards, and live at No. 60, Orchard-street, within five doors of Cogle's. I was in the Almonry, and saw the people fighting with the soldiers; I stood there about five minutes, and got knocked over the eye and chin; they knocked me down in the mud. I went towards the watch-house, and saw a parcel of people running; they surrounded M'Carthy with great sticks; he drew his sword, or I thought he would have been murdered. I was so frightened I returned home; my house faces down the New-way towards the Almonry; I went up stairs to wash the blood off my face, then went down to a barber's to get my hair cut (he lives just below Cogle's on the opposite side), when my hair was cut I came to the door and saw a parcel of inhabitants running from the New-way along Orchard-street into Cogle's, four or five of the inhabitants ran into Cogle's, and four soldiers after them, none of them had regimentals; if a drummer had ran in I must have seen him. The soldiers came out in about a minute and a half, and were going towards the New-way, and a soldier in a red jacket said</p>
               <p>"Right about," then one of the inhabitants went out of Cogle's and went towards Dean-street, the soldier pursued him and knocked him down, the drummer never went, even on the cill of Cogle's door, I went home. I did not see the drummer in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What time were you at the barber's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180033"></xptr>- A. It might be half-past seven o'clock, when I came away, the constables were then taking Jones to the watch-house. I then went up stairs, came down in about five minutes, and saw a parcel of inhabitants and some soldiers about the watch-house. Some inhabitants were about Cogle's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any drummer that afternoon - A. Yes, I saw M'Carthy in the Almonry, the last time I saw him was at a baker's shop, next door to Cogle's, about half-past seven o'clock. I could not see what happened there while I was in the barber's.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you speak of time as you guess - A. Yes, I cannot speak to a minute or two. I saw the people go into Cogle's after I was shaved; M'Carthy was not among them at all. I stood at the barber's door, and saw them go in and come out.</p>

            . On the 18th of June I was at the Three Tuns, public-house, (which is some distance from Ann-street) from half-past six to five minutes before eight o'clock, Hardy was there all the time, drinking with me, we came out together, and stood at the door till five minutes past eight o'clock, he then went into the house again, and I came away; he was perfectly sober.</p>

            . On the 18th of June I was at the top of Union-court, Orchard-street, and saw a crowd of people and soldiers among them - the crowd were among the soldiers with a great many sticks - the soldiers had nothing in their hands - one of the crowd had a pitchfork, he struck a soldier of the 3d regiment, in full regimentals, across the shoulder, and knocked him down, the man ran into Mrs. Cogle's house, I could see plainly what passed at Cogle's - M'Carthy stood in the street, and I had hold of his arm all the time, when his comrade was struck he rose his sword above his head, but did not strike any one, the crowd then rushed towards Mrs. Cogle's house - M'Carthy did not go in at any time - a crowd of people went in before any soldiers - I had hold of M'Carthy's arm from the time he came up the New-way till he ran down St. Ann's-lane, which was before the soldiers went into Cogle's, I did not see him strike any one, I saw a constable strike him - when the crowd came out, I heard a cry that Cogle was murdered. M'Carthy did not return before they came out.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the time you have been speaking of - A. I cannot say the time, it was between seven and nine o'clock, I had been home, and came out to get something for supper, that must be about eight o'clock - I first saw M'Carthy come up the New-way, there was a great many soldiers among the crowd, when I first saw him his side arms hung in his belt, my husband is in his regiment - I went up to him in Orchard-street - the rest of the soldiers were in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of his arm, had any one gone into Cogle's house - A. There was a man in a long tailed coat and smock-frock came out of Cogle's with a stick in his hand, ran down the steps, and began fighting, it was Jenkins. I held M'Carthy at that time, wanting him to come away from the crowd to keep him from them - he left me and ran down St. Ann's-lane, a crowd of people ran down before him - there was a great many people round Cogle's - I stood there till he was taken to the hospital - M'Carthy never returned.</p>

            . My husband is in the second regiment of Guards. On Waterloo-day I had been to wash at the Black Horse, public-house. I live in New Peter-street, as I came home I was in Orchard-street a few minutes before eight o'clock, and saw a great many jackass boys, costermongers, and prigs, as the call them; I went to the White Horse, public-house, and saw a woman holding a soldier indoors. When I was in Orchard-street I saw Cooper taking some soldiers - I saw Suggen with a poker, they were running after the soldiers. I saw M'Carthy come up the New-way, and in Orchard-street, but not near the pavement at all; he was in the middle of the street, and not near Cogle's door. Mrs. Bullen had hold of his arm - I went across - he pulled his hand from her, and ran across St. Ann's-lane, and down Pike-alley. I saw a man come out of Cogle's, with a whitish coat and a stick about the length of his arm - he ran in among the soldiers and struck them; one fell, I believe he was a light infantry man - his foraging cap fell off - the man picked it up, and either put it under his arm, or in his bosom, and ran into Cogle's - he was one of Cogle's lodgers - they have twopenny and threepenny lodgers. Two or three of the soldiers ran towards the door, and into the passage, I believe; and these costermongers ran in after them with sticks, the soldiers had nothing but their fists; the mob were laying on to the soldiers with their sticks, they came out in two or three minutes. M'Carthy had passed the door, and ran down St. Ann's-lane seven minutes before that, and never came into Orchard-street again.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Be cautious, did you attend before the Magistrate - A. They would not suffer the soldiers' witnesses to attend - I did not attend. I had finished work about quarter past seven o'clock, went home, my husband was out, I went to look for him to get the key; I found him in the Almonry about nine o'clock. I have known M'Carthy from the breast, there are two brothers in the same regiment, the prisoner is the man I speak of. I am positive not one soldier had a weapon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the drummer his cutlass - A. He had his sword, he is not a soldier; I only saw one man in a white jacket, and that was Jones. I know none of the prisoners, except the drummer.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the man here who ran out with the stick - A. That is the man (the witness Jenkins).</p>

            . I am drum-major of the third battalion of the first regiment of Guards. On the evening of the 18th of June I saw M'Carthy when the drum-beat was called over at quarter before nine - he was present, and was calm, collected and sober.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where is the roll-call - A. In front of the barrack gate, at Knightsbridge, opposite the Park-wall. I call over the drum-roll, there are two drummers named M'Carthy, I cannot say whether both were there, they belong to the same battalion, but are not alike in person. I always count the men and inspect them, to see if they are sober and capable of duty. I do not call over their names, the barrack is a mile, or a mile and a half from the Almonry.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly inspector of the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> division of police, and am now employed by the Mint authorities—on 13th of this month, in consequence of information I received, I went to Friar-street with other officers; we concealed ourselves in premises opposite the Friar public-house, and after some time, in consequence of what I saw, I sent Serjeant Elliott in to seize the prisoner—I had seen the prisoner go in there several times that day—I afterwards went in with Inspector Bryant and other officers, and Elliot said to me, "There it is; pick it up; he has just dropped it;" nodding hid head to a paper parcel which the prisoner was stamping on—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up, and opened it before the prisoner—it contained six counterfeit shillings wrapped separately in paper—he broke the paper while stamping upon them—the prisoner said, "If my mother was to rise out of the grave, I never had them"—I then left him in the custody of Elliott, and saw the landlord of the public-house go into the privy at the back—I there found this bag, containing nine half-crowns, two florins, and eight shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the top part between the tiles and the rafters—I then went back to where the prisoner was, and showed him what I had found, and told him where I had found them—he said, "I hope I may be struck dead if I ever saw them."</p>

I was in company with Brannan on the night of 13th November, near the Friar public-house, and from what he said to me, I went in—I there saw the prisoner in front of the bar—I laid hold of him; I caught him round both arms and the waist, so that he should not put his hands in his pockets—he then dropped a paper packet out of his right hand on the floor, and kicked about and tried to kick it away—Mr. Brannan and the other officers then came in, and I beckoned to Mr. Branuan with my head, and said, "There it is, Mr. Brannan, he has just dropped it; pick it up—Brannan picked it up—I could not see the packet in the prisoner's hand, but I saw it drop from his right hand; he had a fourpenny-piece, six<lb></lb>pence, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers in his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been living as potman at the Friar, and had left about a fortnight. I never went outside the house only once all that day and that was to get my tea; I went to sleep in front of the tap-room fire, and afterwards went to the bar When Serjeant Elliott came in I offered to let him search me. I am quite innocent of it.</p>

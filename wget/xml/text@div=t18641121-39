                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer—on November 9th, Lord Mayor's-day, about 11, I saw Richards and Harrison in Queen-street, close to Cheapside, just as the procession left Guildhall—from my previous knowledge of them, I watched them—they made an effort to get through the crowd—they could not, and they turned round, and went down Queen-street, Harrison taking off an Inverness cape, which he was wearing; and carrying it on his arm—they ran up Watling-street into St. Paul's Church-yard—I pursued them—they came into St. Martin's-le-Grand, near Sir Robert Peel's statue, and there headed the procession—they crossed over on to the east side of St. Martin's-le-Grand in front of the General Post-office—there the prisoner Brown joined them—when he did so he hit Richards on the back, as if he knew him well—they went in company a short distance up Aldersgate-street, when Brown placed himself by the side of a lady, not the prosecutrix, the other two pressed closely up against him, and Brown put his hand in the lady's pocket—they then left the lady, and continued in company and conversation until they got near to Falcon-street—at the window of No. 13, Alderegate-street the prosecutrix was standing—I saw Brown go and place himself against her right side, and put his left hand into her dress-pocket—the other two pressed their backs against him and the lady</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186411210037"></xptr>
               <p>—I stood and watched them for a second or two, and I saw Brown draw his hand from the lady's pocket, and some money fall from his hand on to the cement; a shilling and a sixpence, I believe—I saw it picked up, and also a white handkerchief—the prisoner escaped at that time—I took the lady's tress, and about twenty minutes afterwards I saw the prisoners in Fore-set—I first saw Harrison forcing his way through the crowd, and Brown behind him—I caught hold of Brown, and told him I was about to him into custody for taking a sovereign from a lady's pocket—on the way to the station, he said, "I will give you half a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>," meaning half a sovereign, "if you will let me go"—I found on him a sovereign, four shillings, and a penny.</p>

I am a widow, and reside at 79, James-road, Holloway—I was in Aldersgate-street on 9th November, when the procession was sing, standing on a doorstep—I had a sovereign tied in the corner of pocket-handkerchief, and pinned in my pocket—my attention was called by the pin being dragged out of my pocket, and I found that I had the sovereign and the handkerchief—I bad two handkerchiefs in my pocket—one was afterwards picked up, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I have not seen other handkerchief since—I only had one sovereign—it was a very old—that is all I know of it.</p>

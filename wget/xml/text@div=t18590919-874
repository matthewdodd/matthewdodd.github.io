                  </hi>. I am captain of the brig <hi rend="italic">Wakefield,</hi> of Sunderland—on 26th August I was in London, and met the female prisoner near Green<lb></lb>wich College—she said, "Is your name Mr.—?"—I said, "No"—a policeman went by, and she said that it was a pity to see decent people molested in the streets—I walked on down the road—she appeared by her conversation to be a decent respectable woman, and said that her husband was a shoemaker—I asked her if she could recommend me to a decent lodging for the night, as I had a good way to go to my vessel—she said, if I would go with her there was only she and her husband at home, and I could lodge there—I went with her to the Little Crown public-house, and we had some rum—I then went with her, and she spoke to some one who I understood was her husband—I laid down on the bed up stairs with my clothes on, and 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket in a leather bag, and a brass whistle and tobacco-pouch—I desired her to call me at 6 o'clock if I was not up—I went</p>

               <p>to sleep, and was awoke between 3 and 4 o'clock by something pulling at my trousers—I found my trousers down and cut—my hand was still in my pocket, which was pulled outside, and my money was gone—the prisoners were there—the female prisoner said, "The door is open, you can go out "—I said, "I do not want to go out, I want the police"—she was dressed, and had her hat on—the male prisoner had no coat on—he said that he would go and fetch a policeman—I said, "You will not leave the house till I have it searched"—they were both in a confused state—when the door opened he went along the passage into the back yard and over the walls—I gave the woman into custody—she was searched and nothing found on her but a pen-knife—part of my pocket was found on the bed—this is my whistle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William French.</hi> I went out to ease myself. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There is a con<lb></lb>venience in the yard, but you were not in there—I saw you go into the yard, and then I looked again and you were gone—there was no way out except over the wall.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth French. Q.</hi> What money did you change for the drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That money was in another pocket, in a purse—I had a glass or two of ale, but was not drunk—I did not call for two quarterns of rum—I did not say when I came out of the public-house, "I have no money—I have had a serious loss, and what I have lost I do not know till I get sober,"—I did not say, "I have lost 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a handkerchief, and an umbrella," or that I had been in doors with a female and had a bundle with me—there was not a struggle between us for a blue handkerchief when the whistle fell.</p>

I live at 83, Great Titchfield-street—the male prisoner unfortunately married my daughter; that is not the female prisoner—on Friday evening, 26th August, he came to me tipsy—he pulled out his purse and wanted to leave some money, but I said that I would have nothing to do with it—he put down two sovereigns first and then two more—he said "I have got some friends outside here, and you may as well keep it and give it to my eldest daughter"—(I have brought up his children; the eldest daughter is 19 years old)—I said, "Rather than you should lose it you may leave it here," and I wrapped it up in paper.</p>

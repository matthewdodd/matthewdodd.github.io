On the 9th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I was locked out of my lodging, and walked the streets till about five o'clock in the morning; my landlady was ill, and I did not like to disturb her. I was walking up George-street, St. Giles's, between five and six o'clock, and a man shoved me off the pavement into the street, he was behind me; I asked why he did so, and he immediately struck me a violent blow over the eye, and knocked me down - I got up and wanted to defend myself; I fell under him on his striking me a second time. The prisoner and another man then came up and supported me, as though they were my friends. I asked them, for their civility in parting us, to come to the Two Brewers, public-house, and I would give them half-a-gallon of beer. I told them I had been locked out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240064"></xptr>lodging, and was drowsy; we went to the public-house, and had two pots of beer, the prisoner said I could go to his house, which was a small distance off, and lay down a little to rest - I went with him to the house, and saw a woman; he ordered her to get a bed ready, and he would have breakfast ready by the time I awoke. The two men stood up, and took off my coat, I put it on a chair and my hat and shoes at the foot of the bed - I then laid down with the rest of my things on; only the two men and the woman were in the room. In about an hour and a half, I found Sullivan (the other man) at my left hand waistcoat pocket, which I had on; I asked why he did so, he said he was only putting the clothes on me - I do not know whether the prisoner was then there. When I got up I missed my coat, hat, and shoes, I found the slider of my watch on the bed, the watch was taken from my fob. I gave the alarm. The prisoner was taken afterwards - I have found none of the property.</p>

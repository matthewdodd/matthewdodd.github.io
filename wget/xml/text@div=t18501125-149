                  </hi>. I am matron of the Infant Orphan Asylum. On 16th Oct. I returned to the Asylum, having been absent, and in consequence of what I was told, I missed a silver teaspoon with "I. O. A." on the front and "8" on the back of it—I believe these pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be part of that spoon—there are the letters "I. O. A." on one piece and "8" on another—I only missed one spoon then, I have missed one since—by the counting of the spoons there are two missing—they are the property of the Trustees of the Infant Orphan Asylum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith at Stratford. On 5th Nov. the female prisoner and another woman came to my shop and asked if I purchased old silver—I said, "Yes;" and the prisoner produced these pieces of silver spoons—I examined them, and told her I had no doubt they had been stolen—she said her husband had found them in some wash—I took the pieces and told them I must inquire further about them, and they must call the next day—the part with the initials was so bent that I could not see them—I bent it right, went after them, and gave them into custody, and gave the pieces to Benton, who I had sent for—the female prisoner gave the name of "Jury, of Chingford."</p>

I was sent for to Mr. Wayland's and found the female prisoner and another female there—they were given into my custody, and I received the pieces of silver from Mr. Wayland—the female prisoner said her husband had found them in some dung wash—they were taken to the station and searched, and the female searcher gave me a silver knife found on the other woman—I afterwards went to the Infant Orphan Asylum, saw the matron, and produced the pieces to her—I afterwards apprehended James Manby, and told him it was on suspicion of stealing two silver spoons—he said he found them in turning some dung over in the Forest—I asked him whether they were whole or broken up—he said, "Whole"—I produce the Act of Parliament, which I got from the secretary, Mr. Buckler.</p>

Last Sunday morning between three and four, I heard a great knocking at the door, and I got out of my bed; my master's bell rung before I could get out of my room, I went first to his room door and opened it, he asked me what was the matter at the door; I went to the door and asked who was there, and the watchman answered me; I immediately opened the door, and he told me there were thieves in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040047"></xptr> house; I went down with him, and left another watchman at the door on the outside with his candle and lanthorn, having shut the door; we went down immediately to the kitchen, and the window near the sink was thrown up, and the inside shutters were very much broken, and the outside shutters were open; as soon as we saw that, we went and opened the area door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see this window shut at night? - Yes, I look at every place before I go to bed, I saw them very fast, I did not fasten them myself, the cook fastened them: we went and opened the area door; and the small beer cellar door faced us almost, and the watchman being before me, said, there they are; I just took a fight, I saw two men in the cellar; we both tried to shut the small beer cellar door, they burst it open, knocked out the watchman's light, got from us, and rushed out at the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of the people to know who they were? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>How do you imagine these people got into the area? - Over the rails I imagine my Lord.</p>
               <p>Is it a deep area? - It is about eight or nine feet deep.</p>
               <p>Not too deep for a man to drop? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the watchman that watched in that beat that night: I was informed by a woman on the other side of the way, that she saw thieves about, and she believed they were in this gentleman's house; accordingly I poked at the shutters and found one of them open; this was at three in the morning; I called to my brother watchman to assist; I knocked at the door, and the footman came and asked who was there, I said it is the watchman, there are thieves in your master's house; I went down with the man, and we saw the window broke, and we opened the door, and I was the first man that went in; and when I saw them in the vault, I spoke with a loud voice, and said, there they are; and I was fully resolved to throw them down if possibly I could; and they knocked my lanthorn out of my hand, and overpowered me, and I took particular notice of them, as much as I could; and I can swear that the prisoner at the bar is one of them.</p>
               <p>What became of you when they knocked the lanthorn out of your hand? - I was obliged to stay there.</p>
               <p>They did not stay with you? - They knocked out my candle, and went into the house directly; I found this crow in the cellar after.</p>
               <p>What sort of a morning was it? - It was a darkish morning, but I had the light in my lanthorn to observe their faces; if I was to see the other man I believe I would know him; I looked full in their faces; they were a matter of three or four minutes with me, fronting me in the area.</p>

               <p>Your candle was knocked out? - In three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>What, was you struggling with them three or four minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is, you was on one side of the door, and they were on the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could not see them then? - No.</p>
               <p>Your struggle was to keep them in the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they were withinside the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you stand with your back to the kitchen door? - Yes, they stood for a matter of three or four minutes in the area.</p>
               <p>Court. After they had got out of the vault as you call it, how long was it before they got into the house? - It was three or four minutes, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>And in what part of this three or four minutes was it that your lanthorn was knocked out? - My lanthorn was a-light during that time.</p>
               <p>When was your lanthorn knocked out? - At the last.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - In a black waistcoat and whitish coat, and a three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040048"></xptr> cocked hat, that is the man; the other was dressed in a blueish coat, and a bit of a round hat with a lace to it; I saw him at the round house about half an hour after, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the officers that was the man?</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>My Lord he said he knew nothing of me.</p>
               <p>I was not asked, I knew in my mind that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing at the time? - I did not say any thing, I was not asked any questions; the other watchman pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he took him to the round house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>The man laid no charge against me at the watch-house till the Monday following; he owned at the watch-house that he had a doubt of me; at the watch-house he did not then think me the person.</p>
               <p>Court to David. Remember you are upon your oath, did you say you knew nothing about him? - No, I was not asked any questions.</p>

               <p>Could you see what passed in the area? - No, I heard them dispute, but I could not see any one in the area.</p>
               <p>How long might they be disputing in the area? - About three or four minutes; then I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of the door, I thought he belonged to the house; he asked me where they were, I said they were withinside; he rushed against me, and with his shoulder he attempted to throw me into the kennel, I saw nobody come out with him; he was the first man that came out, he ran hard into Farmer's rents, he returned in less than five minutes, there being no thoroughfare; he was then in custody of St. Giles's watchman.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might this be that he was taken by the watchman, after he ran past you; - I suppose it had not been above ten minutes; he made all the best haste he could.</p>
               <p>Had you your lanthorn? - I looked as serious in his face as I would in yours.</p>
               <p>When he opened the door, he did not give you much time for examination I suppose? - I thought him to be one of the family.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunity sufficient to see his face so as to distinguish him? - Yes I had, I swear he was the man.</p>
               <p>You must be very quick sighted. - He stood and asked me where are they, and I said they are within side; then he pushed against me, and then I took him to be one of the thieves.</p>
               <p>Did you hold your lanthorn up to his face? - When he came to the door, he pretended to belong to the house; I had time enough to look at his face; I am full sure of him.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - Much such a coat as that he wears now, it may be the same; he had a three cocked hat full of cobwebs, and his back full of brick-dust.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>

               <p>What space is it down these rents? - I dare say it is 150 yards; my partner Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040049"></xptr> Carty, and I went down together, and there we found the prisoner immediately, and laid hold of him by the collar; he said, what have I done? what have I done?</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the rents did you find him? - At the bottom of the rents, where he could not run any further: I said I do not know what you have done, there is an oration of Stop thief! and I seize you; when I brought him up to the top of the court, this Marybone watchman, Sillway, said that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he look at him first, before he said that is the man? - No, he did not, he immediately said so, when he got sight of him: I had a light, and my partner had a light; then we took him to the watch-house.</p>

I was no higher up Oxford-road, than the top of Hog-lane: this man gave no charge of me; the footman was as capable of knowing whether I was the person, as this man was. There is another thing I had forgot; at the time I was taken up the watchmen differed, some wanted to carry me to one watch-house, and some to the other; in the interim a very genteel looking man came up, and said, that in Oxford Road he saw a man come up, and that I was not the man; I have had so little notice, but I believe he is here; they ill used the man, and turned him neck and heels out of the watch-house; the man came in and tendered himself a second time to serve me, and they then detained him, and kept him till the Monday following.</p>

               <p>What is he? - On board the Belleisle.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I saw him last Sunday morning at half past two o'clock, at the top of Hog-lane; I asked him to give me something to drink, I said I was a poor unfortunate woman, and was a long way from home, and my husband was on board the Belleisle; he said he had a wife at home, he had no business with any woman, but he would give me something to drink; we staid talking there the value of ten minutes, and while we staid talking at the top of Hog-lane, at Wright's Rents, I believe they call it, the watchman came by half past two; he gave me some halfpence, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Court to the St. Giles's watchman. Do you know this place, Wright's Rents? - I know Farmer's Rents, that is at the top of Hog-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040050"></xptr>Is there such a place as Wright's Rents?</p>
               <p>Russell. I am but a stranger to the place, I understood it was Wright's Rents.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - In a drab-coloured coat and black sattin waistcoat, and a lightish pair of breeches; I never saw him before in my life only then, and now I see him at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court to Clench. You hear what he says, that there was a well dressed man came to the watch-house? - He was in the watch-house when I got there, I saw no such person; after they had taken this man, the watchman came to let my master know, and I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to David. You was in the watch-house? - Not before the servant went there, but I saw a gentleman in black, he gave them very ill language, and abused the beadles very much; he looked like a tradesman or a gentleman, he made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing like the prisoner's not being the man? - Upon my oath, my Lord, I never heard a word about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Silway. Did you hear that gentleman say any thing about it? - He was asked what he was, and he said he was a painter; he came in with the prisoner, he said, he believed he was not the man: says I, Do you know that man? No, says he, I know nothing about him; then the watch-house keeper and the constable of the night turned him out; then he rushed in again, and they suspected that he belonged to the prisoner; he said the man wore a slouched hat, and he saw him run; he said he was late in a public house, and was just come out; he said he was not a master painter, and lived at lodgings, and worked at piece-work, or such work as he could get.</p>
               <p>Court to Hardcastle. Did you hear this man say any thing? - When we got the prisoner at the top of Hog-lane he came up, and said, What are you doing to the man? I said, If you know any thing of him, come with us and speak in his behalf: when he came there he interfered, and they turned him out: he said he saw a man run before, and he did not believe this was the same man; he came in again, and used the constable ill, and the beadle, and the patrols; he used a deal of bad language, and they detained him.</p>
               <p>Clench. My Lord, this woman has sworn, that she never saw the prisoner before or after till now; whereas when he was brought to Newgate she came in the coach with him and his wife.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn.</p>
               <p>I brought the prisoner to Newgate, and his wife and this woman came in the coach with him; I am positive to the woman, and I saw her at the office, and she said, you cannot get Forty by him as you wanted to get by my husband.</p>

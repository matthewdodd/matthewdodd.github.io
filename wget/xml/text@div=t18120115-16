A dressing case of that description had not been put up, we had sold two ink stands, the gentlemen were in the room, and we sold but to them two gentlemen, they were paid for, and the gentlemen put them in their pockets, I am positive that the dressing case nor the inkstand had been put up that day; I have been in the habit of seeing the prisoner about nine month before, he has been in the habit of attending sales at the Mart.</p>

            . I am a wholesale linen warehouseman, I was between nine and ten o'clock at the auction, I had not been long in the room before the prisoner came in, a gold ring was put up which he purchased and paid for, soon after another was put up which he bought likewise, he said he would leave the second until the sale was over. A rocking horse was then offered for sale, the greater part of the people's attention was taken with the rocking-horse; I saw him endeavouring to put something into his left hand pocket, it must have been something of magnitude by my seeing it. I afterwards saw him take an inkstand and put into his right hand pocket. The prisoner left the room and went down stairs, I followed him to the bottom of the stairs, and said stop, I want to speak to you. Before I had told him what he had got in his pocket, he said what a fool you are, I am employed by the auctioneer to help him off with his goods. I told him he had been robbing him, and must go back into the room. I then, with assistance, led him up stairs, as soon as I had got him up stairs, I told him he had got an inkstand in his pocket, which he took out, I marked it; we sent for an officer, he came and examined his pockets, in his left hand pocket he found a dressing case.</p>

I took a will out of my pocket, and filled it up before her face, and read it over to her; I wrote the name of Farmer , and Rochead wrote the name of Stones ; I wrote the name of Ryan, and he made the mark: the name of Davis was wrote after, it is a different sort of ink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntridge produced the will, and proved he had it out of the Prerogative Office: [ then the will was read.]</p>
               <p>Sherlock. The Prisoner, Rochead, and I, went to the Commons, and she went to Mr. Alexander's , a proctor; she returned and said, she had proved the will, and the probate would be ready next morning. The next day I went, but we had no money to pay for the probate, and I desired Mr. Alexander to let his clerk go to the Navy Office to get the ticket: when we came there the name was Ryant upon the books, and the clerk would not deliver the ticket, because the probate was in the name of Ryan, but Mr. Alexander's clerk said he would get it done properly, and he got the words (otherwise Ryant) interlined. The next day we went again, the Prisoner, Rochead, and Mr. Alexander's clerk, went all in together, and brought out the ticket - I believe Mr. Alexander's clerk had a crown for his trouble. The Prisoner, Rochead , and the clerk, went to Mr. Parr's at the Blue Anchor in Crouched Friers , and the Prisoner could not remember the time of his entering on board, or the time of his death, or any thing. Mr. Parr said she was an impudent creature, and would have nothing to do with her; we were forced as we had no money to leave the probate and ticket with Mr. Alexander's clerk. We went to one

After the demur at Mr. Parr's we gave her fresh instructions, and she went through it very well, and it was sold to Mr. Coward Mr. Hexshaw's clerk, who discounted it for 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. in the pound, and we had a draught upon Casewell and Mount.

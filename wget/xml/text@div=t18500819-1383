                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Tottenham. On 3rd Aug., I was at the Three Tuns, about eleven o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner there—I gave him my waistcoat to hold, and I saw him take the tobacco-box out of the pocket—I asked him for it, and he told me to go somewhere else—I said if he did not give it me I would get a policeman, and as soon as he saw my back turned he cut away out of the house directly.</p>

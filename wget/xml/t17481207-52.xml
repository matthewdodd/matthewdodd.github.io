               <p>Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>'' As I am well assured you do a great deal of '' business, in regard to discounting of bills, I make '' so free as to direct my nephew to you, in order '' to get a bill of 300 l. discounted, as I am to '' pay a large sum of money next week, for an estate '' bought of my lord Warrington, am indeavouring '' to raise the cash against that time, be '' so good to give the bearer, my nephew, a bank '' note, as he may send it by the post; I am not '' certain whether he will be able to wait of you '' himself, for I am afraid he is very much indisposed '' with sickness, he is now secretary to lord '' Anson, but has not done any business this some '' time, having had very bad health; if he does '' not wait of you himself, please to send some person '' down to Deptford to him, except he send '' a message by a person who he can confide in, '' pray be so good as to assist him herein, and the '' favour shall be always acknowledged: I shall be '' in London in less till a three weeks time, at which '' time I shall wait of you,</p>
               <p>Sir, Your most obedient servant, Wat. Will. Wynn.</p>

               <p>Dear Nephew,</p>
               <p>'' Yours I received, and inclosed 7000 l. in bank '' notes; I have inclosed to you five bills for 9000 l. '' which will be due as soon as comes to hand, '' which desire you either go or send to receive '' the money for them, and after you received the '' money, go to the Bank and get a note for it, '' and indorse it to me immediately; you'll find likewise '' another bill inclosed for 300 l. that is not '' due these several days, upon 'Squire Cholmondeley '' in James's-street, Westminster, get it '' accepted, and then apply to some of the gentlemen '' bankers, in or about Lombard-street, to '' get it discounted; get a bank note for it, and '' send it me along with the rest; as I am to pay '' for the estate I purchased of my lord Warrington, '' and the next week you must not fail sending '' down the notes to me, for my lord is now here; '' I am afraid you wont be so well recovered as to '' go about my business yourself, and before I would '' have you prejudice yourself by too soon going '' out; I'd rather advise you to get somebody '' and they to transact the business for you, a '' person whom you can conside in: I wish you '' was with me at Bath, I've an opinion the water '' would be of service to you; I shall be obliged '' to be in London in less till one three weeks time, '' I will endeavour to get you down along with '' me; I shall be going again soon afterwards: '' Sir

            . I am a domestick of Sir Watkins's. I have been his clerk five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Sir Watkins write?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, often. A letter was put into his hand. I am sure this is not his hand writing; there is somewhat in the name Watkin in resemblance of his. (Another was shewed him.) That is not Sir Watkins's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you servant to Sir Watkins the 29th of August. Where was he at that time?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was then at Litchfield races.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him there?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, my Lord. He left his house in Wales the 24th of August, and went to Litchfield races, and returned, I believe, the first of Sept. I saw him set out with his servants; and at returning, the servants all told me he had been there, and that he hunted two days in company with other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since Sir Watkin was at Bath?</p>
               <p>Jones. He has not been at Bath many years.</p>
               <p>Alderman Ironside. I was present on the woman's examination, she was asked whether she was to have money for going of this message, She made answer, he said he had not money then, but that she would bring money back with her, and then he, the Prisoner, would pay her.</p>

            . My husband was in the Marshalsea, and I was employed in going of errands. The Prisoner at the bar sent me with those letters, all enclosed in a parcel to Alderman Ironside's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Gauler. He bid me carry that letter to Alderman Ironside. He did not tell me I was to bring back any money. The letter was sealed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come immediately away with it?</p>
               <p>Gauler. I put it out of my hand once, because I was in a hurry for my husband's errands; and there was no body else would go, because there was no money. I had the letter three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174812070015"></xptr> times in the morning, the 6th of Sept. At first it was long, then he took it, and did it up less; then I went directly. This I told Justice Hammond.</p>
               <p>Ald. Ironside. I heard her say this before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Gauler. He bid me not to say that I had it out of the Marshalsea prison. If I should be asked any questions, I was to say I brought it from Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Gauler. I have known him about two or three weeks; ever since he came a prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter in the same plight when you delivered it to the Alderman, as when you received it of Jones?</p>
               <p>Gauler. Yes, I am certain of that; for it never went out of my hands. Every thing was in it when the Prisoner gave it me, as was when I delivered it to Mr. Ironside. This I declare upon oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what sort of business the Prisoner followed before he came to gaol?</p>
               <p>Gauler. I have heard him say he was a sailor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Gauler. Had you no more letters besides mine that morning to deliver?</p>
               <p>Gauler. I had; but the Prisoner begged and prayed I would carry his; so I delivered the other back again. I had none but his letter when I set out to go.</p>

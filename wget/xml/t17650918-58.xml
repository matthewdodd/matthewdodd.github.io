            . On the 17th of July last, between the hours of ten and twelve at night, I lost two silver pint mugs; we missed them just before we went to bed; they were taken from off a table, just behind the door, in the fore-room: there was nobody at that table (it is not a drinking table). I was backwards and forwards in the house. I can't tell whether the prisoner was in the house that evening: I never found my mugs again.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner in my master's house, the night the mugs were stolen; he came in about eleven o'clock: I took particular notice of him; he call'd for a pint of beer, and sat down on a bench in the passage, and staid about five minutes: when I brought the beer, he was fitting on the threshold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180047"></xptr> of the door; then he bid me serve him with a pennyworth of gin; he came to the bar, and gave me 6 d. to change: I asked him if I should take for the pint of beer? He said no, he would not have it. As soon as he gave me the 6 d. the evidence Ryan came in up to the bar, and called for a pennyworth of gin; I served him, and he gave me a penny: they did not seem to take notice of each other. When I went to get change of my mistress in the fore-room, where the mugs were, the prisoner followed me in: I did not then look at the mugs, they had been just set behind the door that he and I came in at. I saw the prisoner the next morning about 11 o'clock before the justice: he asked me who had been in the house I said, I saw no other person in the house, but a man dressed in a red jacket, and a linen waistcoat under it, and his hair hanging about his ears: I had told my master that the boy which is evidence had a long brown coat on; I knew the prisoner directly before the justice; I am sure he is the man; I know him by his face, as well as by his cloaths.</p>

             M'Kenzie and I went all round Wapping one night; we came up Nightingale-lane; He said he would go and steal some silver mugs there; (we had use to go by there every night; he had seen the mugs before) he first went into the passage to the bar, and asked this last evidence for a pint of beer. I stood on the out-side of the door: the girl went to draw it; in the mean time he stole one of the silver mugs from a table behind the door in the fore-room: I saw him do it: he came out and gave it to me; we ran all the way up Nightingale-lane, and hid it under a dung-hill in Black-horse-yard: then we came again to the house, which is about an hundred yards from the dunghill; we call'd then for a pennyworth of gin each; he went in first; we had the gin, and he gave the girl sixpence to change: while she went into the other room to change the six-pence, M'Kenzie stole the other mug; he could reach it behind the door: we then went to his lodgings, after we had been and took the other out of the dunghill. The next morning we went to look for somebody to sell them to, in Duke's-place: we met one Israel Cowen (who is now in Bridwell); we asked him if he would buy some plate? he said, he would see for somebody that would, and he went and fetched Mores Abrahams. M'Kenzie and Abrahams went into a place to bargain; he asked five guineas, and Abrahams offered him two: he said, before he would take two, he would throw them into the Thames. I stood a little way off; Abrahams said, if he would fetch them, if they were worth more, he would give more. I went and fetched them, and in the mean time. Mr. Murry, a thief-taker, came and took M'Kenzie, and said he was the man he wanted: I had the mugs, and seeing him take M 'Kenzie, I turned back, and ran away (this was in Heydon-yard); we were going into the fields to let Abrahams look at the mugs: Israel Cowen met me in the Mulberry-garden, in about an hour after, and told me where M'Kenzie was: then I went along with Cowen into the fields, and let Abrahams have the mugs for two guineas, and I went and spent the money. I was taken about a week after; I was going on board a ship, and there were three boys that knew me: they told Mr. Murry, and I was taken out of the ship.</p>

               <p>This boy, Rvan, met me in Duke's place, and asked me if I knew any body that would buy old silver spoons? I told him, I did not know any body: there happened to come Israel Cowen by; he asked him; he said he would go and see for a man, and he went and fetched a man: they went a little way from me, and talked together, and sent the boy away, and he brought two mugs; I had not an opportunity to look at them; they agreed to go into the fields, and this Murry came and took hold of me. When we came to the prosecutor's, Murry almost obliged the girl to say I was the man. I never was at that house, till Murry brought me there.</p>

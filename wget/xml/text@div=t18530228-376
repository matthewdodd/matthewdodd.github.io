                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we live at No. 7, Eagle-court, Strand, in the first floor front room. On 30th Jan. I had been out with my husband—when I came home, about 12 o'clock, I found I had mislaid the key of our door (I afterwards found it at the bottom of a marketing basket which I had); I bad taken it out when I went out about 10 o'clock—my husband came up stairs and asked me for the key; I could not find it, and told him to look is his pocket and see if he had it—I had taken a little drop of gin, and he had some gin and beer, and we did not know where it was—he found a gimlet in hit waistcoat pocket, and went on his knees trying to start the lock of the door, for the children were inside—he was making a hard noise at the door, and I gave him a stroke at the side of his head and took the gimlet out of his hand—I made a start back with it; my foot caught in a hole in the stairs, and I tumbled head over heels, and that is the way I got the hurt—my husband was standing by, and not interfering; he never laid his hand upon me—I screamed, and fell down stairs—I laid the gimlet on the chimney piece, and then found blood coming through my stays—I did not scream, "Murder!"—the hurt was not much, and I did not feel it, especially having a little drop of gin taken.</p>

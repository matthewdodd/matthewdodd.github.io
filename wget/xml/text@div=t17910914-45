             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell; on Friday the 15th of July I first saw the prisoner with this horse in Smithfield-market; I asked him the price of it, and we did not agree at that time; then on the 20th I saw him again at the Horseshoe-inn, Goswell-street; I bought the horse of him then, and I asked him where he lived; he told me he lived at Edmonton; I asked him how long he had had it, and he said, he had had it ever since May, he had had it for two months, and he had worked him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him where he had got him? - He said he bought him at Godalmin fair, I gave him six pounds for it, after that I had some reason to suppose that it was a stolen one, and about two hours and an half after, a friend and I went with me to look for the man I had the gelding of; and after two or three hours search, I found him in Portpool-lane, he was just going into the Green man; I told him I was afraid he had not come honestly by the horse; he said he did: then we went to a public-house, and had a pot of beer together, and after some more talk, he would not confess but what he came honestly by it; so at length I charged the watch with him, and the next morning he was brought before Justice Clarke, the magistrate in Clerkenwell, and he was sent back again for re-examination.</p>
               <p>At the time you took him into custody, you had only a general suspicion? - No, only general; at length Mr. Wood came up and swore to the horse, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw him in Smithfield-market.</p>
               <p>Saunders. He is the man I saw in Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had it booked at the toll-book at Godalmin, and I wrote a letter to the toll-keeper, and he sent me an answer, and I gave the letter to Sir Sampson Wright, before I ever opened it, and Sir Sampson Wright has kept it ever since; I sent my mother to Sir Sampson Wright for it yesterday, but she is not yet come back; I have now nobody here.</p>

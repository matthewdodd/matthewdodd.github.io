                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 80, Alderminster Road, Bermond<lb></lb>sey—on 30th September, about 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner riding a pony in Alderminster Road—it was dusk, the lamps were not lighted just there—when I first saw him he was about twenty yards off, coming at a gallop, from ten to twelve miles an hour—it was a middling-sized pony—there was a bridle, but no saddle, only something like a sack—I saw five boys stand<lb></lb>ing not quite in the middle of the road—the pony came in a direct line to them—I crossed the road on to the pavement, and called to them to look out, but they did not hear—the prisoner, I fancy, sang out "Halloa!" but they did not hear him, and the pony ran against the boy, and fell on him—the pony got up directly, and I ran and stopped the pony and rider, when he had only just got up on his feet—the little boy's father ran out, and carried him into the house.</p>

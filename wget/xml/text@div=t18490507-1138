My mother gave me the baby to take care of while she went over the water—I met the prisoner in Sun-street—she said, "Shall I take the baby a little while"—I let her take it, she ran away with it, and I ran after her to a house in Crown-court she told me to go up stairs; I did so, while she waited below—I felt my way down in the dark, and found her still there with the baby—I asked her for it—she did not give it me—a woman next door and two men came and took it from her—she had not hurt it at all.</p>

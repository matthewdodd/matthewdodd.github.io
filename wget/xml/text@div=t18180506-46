I gave him a note to Mr. Wilmot, who had the mare, to deliver it to him. The prisoner called next morning, and said," I have brought your mare to town, have you any objection to my putting her in my cart to try her?" I said, "I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060020"></xptr>not; and let me see her when she is in your cart - She has been in the country sometime, and I want so see what condition she is in;" he said he would.

               <p>Q. Did you look about for the man - A. He said Mr. Rowbottom knew him. I was quite easy about it. I saw her about the 16th of April at the Red Lion, at Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner permission to have the mare, except to try her - A. None at all. I had not sold her, nor parted with the property.</p>

            . I am a pocket-book-maker, and live in Aldersgate-street. I know the prisoner by seeing him at the Crown tavern. I met him there-the conversation turned upon horses. The prisoner said he wanted a horse for all-work- I mentioned Mr. Crew to him; I did not recommend him to him, nor authorize him to use my name. I told him where Mr. Crew lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I told him of it to get my friend's mare sold. I will not swear I did not tell him to make use of my name; I might have done so. I did not know the prisoner's name. I have seen the name of Claxton on his card.</p>

            . I am a horse-dealer, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of January I bought the mare of the prisoner, in Northampton-square, for 8l. - he said he had lately bought it for 18l., but her eyes had fell, and her heel was grazed. He gave me his address in Percival-street. I paid a week's keep for it at the stable before they would let it go. I sold it to Mr. Barker with two others.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Rowbottom recommended me to Mr. Crew. I saw him two or three days after, and he told me he had mentioned me to Mr. Crew.

On the 15th of January, being embarrassed. I sold her. Hearing there was a warrant out against me, I did not like to call on Mr. Crew, but sent a gentleman to him to say, that if he would shew me a little indulgence I would pay him. He said, if I would give him 20l. he would give me a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>MR. CREW. I never offered to take 20l. for it. A gentleman called on me to take security, I refused. I never received any intimation from Mr. Rowbottom that the prisoner would call.</p>

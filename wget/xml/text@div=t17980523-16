I stopped at the Red-cow, a little farther on, where I met with the Bow-street patrol, and I described the tall man to the patrol; I took but little notice of the short one, my attention was fixed on the tall one; upon my description he was taken; I saw the tall man again at Bow-street on the Tuesday following, this was Saturday; he was dressed in a dark coloured coat, I do not know whether it was black or blue, and a black handkerchief round his neck; the moon shone very bright so that I saw his face perfectly distinct, he had a round hat on, not of a very good shape; the prisoner at the bar is the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. Not the least; the moon shone so bright that I could see his face very distinctly; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Bow-street, was he in the same dress that you had seen him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there nothing else besides his face, and figure, that you can swear to? - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property? - A. No; he was taken from the description I gave of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a house - are you a master engraver? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Bow street who was there first, you or the prisoner? - A. I was there about five or six minutes before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him was he brought to the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought with any body else? - A. Yes, with two others.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there for the purpose of seeing him? - A. Yes; the officer had called upon me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all brought up in irons? - A. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. But they were brought up as prisoners? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand, when they were brought, that you were to select a man out of those three? - A. Yes, if it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were to look at those three men to see which of them was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you immediately fix upon the prisoner? - A. I did, in my mind, but I was not asked any questions till they were all examined; as soon as Mr. Bond, as I believe it was, put the question to me, I immediately said the prisoner was one of the two men that stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Stowe.) Look at that stick? - A. I cannot swear to the stick; it was under the other man's coat that I saw it, it was a short thick stick; I only saw the end of it as he stopped to search me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this transaction take up? - A. Not a minute; it was all in an instant as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed at all? - A. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me if you are positive he is the man? - A. I am positive he is the man.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Were you at a public-house with him on the 25th? A. Yes: at the Red Lion, about two o'clock - we might he there an hour or an hour and a half; I did not get a little fresh - we went home, but I did not go to work; I went out with some messages - I returned about seven o'clock; I was next door at five o'clock - my wife came in, and then I went home, and found the things were missing; I had not worked with the prisoner that afternoon - I paid for what was drank; I did not know he had any money in his pocket. <rs id="t18290611-97-verdict515" type="verdictDescription">

On Saturday the 15th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to the prisoner's room, I asked her for my cap and apron I had lent her, she said she had pawned them, but she would get them when she had done her work; she asked me to sit down, which I did, she then told me of a book she had been reading concerning of a son and mother at Margate; I told her I should like to see this book; she went out to fetch this book, I staid in her room; it was half an hour before she returned.</p>

I missed the cloak about seven o'clock the next morning; when I went home I found nobody in my room, nor did I leave any body in my room when I went out, it was taken while I was in her room; she told me she would get my things out of pawn on Monday morning; I went to her immediately I found out my loss, and asked her for these things again, she told me that she had often blamed me for leaving my door unlocked, I told her it was somebody that knew my room well, she said I thought it was her that had taken it, if she heard me say it she would severely punish me. On Monday morning I went to Mr. Wright's, the pawnbroker, in Tothill-fields; there I found it pledged in her name.</p>

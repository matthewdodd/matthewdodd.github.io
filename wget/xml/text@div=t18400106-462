                  </hi>I keep a clothes shop in Monmouth-street. On the 28th of December, the prisoners and another came to my shop—while I was showing Wells a pair of trowsers, my neighbour gave me some infor<lb></lb>mation, and I missed a pair of trowsers from my door—I gave them into custody—Wells Iffered me the money for the trowsers which had been at the door.</p>

                  </hi>I serve in the shop next door but one to the prosecutor. On Saturday evening, the 28th of December, I saw Keefe at the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's door—he took a pair of trowsere off the rail, folded them up, put them under his jacket, and ran up Monmouth-street—Wells was in the shop with another person, bargaining, I think, for a hat—I went back to my master's door, and in a few minutes Keefe came back—I said he was the person, and the prosecutor gave them into custody.</p>

             (Police-constable T 155). I was just off duty, and was sent for to put some of the things in the fly - I do not know who put this bundle in; next morning, the 14th of April, the servant came, and said there had been a robbery - I went to Mrs. Jones', and from what she said I went to the stable to the prisoner; I asked him if he knew any thing about the property; he said he did not, but if it was put into the fly, he was certain it was left at Hammersmith - I then went with him to Mrs. Jones' at Hammersmith; he asked her if she had found the property; she said No - he said he was certain he must have left it there, as he knew unthing about it; I then went outside with the prisoner, to wait for Mr. Jones coming from London - he then asked me to let him go to Mrs. Jones' again; which he did, and told her not to make herself uneasy, and she should have the property again; I said, "Then you know where it is;" he said, "Yes, you have sent the serjeant to search the stable, and if he searches under the manger he will find it covered up in the litter" - just at that time his master arrived on a horse, to say that it had been found under a manger - I then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in your Police dress at that time? A. No, in plain clothes; but when I told him I should take him into custody. I said I was an officer - he did not tel me he expected to get something for it.</p>

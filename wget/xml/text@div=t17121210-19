               Felony, upon the late Statute against fraudulent Concealment by Bankrupts
            </rs>. It was plainly proved that he had contracted Debts; that a Statute was thereupon taken out, and that he did send away his Goods, place, Writings, and Books of Account, to Holland; and that he himself; together with one Norris, who assisted him in the Concealment, were shipped on board a Lacquer-Boat, where being Sea-sick, and going to ease his Stomach over the side of the Ship, Eight hundred Guineas (which he had in two Bags in his Breast, between his Coat and Waistcoat) fell over Board; and the Boat being forced on Shoar by the Weather, he was taken by Mr. Hudson, who had a Warrant from the Commissioners of Bankrupt, and upon search found twenty Guineas, and between five and six Pounds in Silver, and three Gold Rings upon his Finger. All which Particulars he confess'd upon his Examination before the Commissioner, except that he owed Mr. Thomas (who took out the Statute) nothing, but that he was in his Debt, and produc'd one Note of Seven hundred Pounds, one of Three hundred Pounds, and another of One hundred Pounds, under his hand to prove it; all which Notes being view'd by the Court and the Jury, appear'd to be forg'd by Towne, and the hand of Thomas counterfeited; as was also the Counterpart of an Account pass'd between them. The Prisoner after this call'd several to his Reputation, but had the Misfortune either to have them not appear, or if they did, to say very little to his purpose; one in particular said, he was the greatest Rogue in England, or to that purpose. The Court, after a long and patient Hearing, directed the Jury, and they brought him in <rs id="t17121210-19-verdict92" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I keep the Craven Head public-house, Drury-lane, and have one partner. Some months ago I engaged the prisoner as a general servant—among other things it was his duty to attend to the billiard-table—he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, his board and lodging—at the com<lb></lb>mencement of the present year I put up a new table, and on the 4th of January I entered into a fresh arrangement with the prisoner—he agreed with us to give us 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the use of the table, and the cues and balls, and to receive the whole of the profits of the table—he was not to have board or lodging under the new arrangement—he continued under that arrangement one week as marker to the table—he told me on the Monday that he had cleared 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was about an hour before he was taken into custody, on the 11th of January, on a charge of stealing four cues and five billiard-balls—I missed four cues—I do not live in Drury-lane—I was at home at Silver-street—I was sent for—I went down, and had a little conversation with him—I called a policeman—the policeman asked him if he had pawned any thing since he had been in our house—he said, "Decidedly not"—I then said I gave him in charge—I did not mention the articles I supposed he had pawned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. On the 11th of January the prisoner pawned four cues and seven billiard-balls—he had borrowed money on things twice before—he told me they belonged to him, that he hired the rooms, and had to furnish the cues and balls.</p>

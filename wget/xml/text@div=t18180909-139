On the 4th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty, and observed three men loitering about, which excited my suspicion; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them or not. I omitted calling the hour in consequence of it. About two o'clock I went towards the prosecutor's house, and heard a crack like the wrenching of a shutter or pane of glass. I went closer, to hear more distinctly. When I came to No. 12, which is opposite the prosecutor's, I heard glass breaking. I attempted to get over the rails into the area-my foot slipped, which made an alarm. The prisoner came up out of the area, up to the iron gate where I stood, and attempted to get over. I struck at him with my stick - He fell back into the fore-court; I attempted to get over after him, but found he was clambering over the next wall. I returned back, and kept in front of the area outside, on the footpath. He got over the wall from No. 12 to No. 18. He told me if I got over the railings he would murder me - I told him I would take the chance of that; I secured him. He struck at me with an iron crow. He at first made a stab at me with the sharp end, then turned it, and made two blows at me with the other end - I caught it in my hand, and took it from him. I found a dark lanthorn, a piece of wax candle, six skeleton keys, a phosphorus-box, and an open knife on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go back to examine Mr. Phillimore's house - A. Yes. I found the servants up, and a tub (with the bottom uppermost) against the window, for a person to stand on. A pane of glass was broken, and the sash of the window down. The inside shutter was partly open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you would have shot me if you had had a pistol - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phillimore, he keeps the house. I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock on the night stated in the indictment, after fastening the house. I left the window-sash fastened down with a catch, and the inside shutter closed, and secured with an iron bar across (the shutters fold). After the alarm was given, I found one of the leaves of the shutter broken, and falling down, it hung by one hinge; the glass of the window was broken sufficient for a man to put his hand through-it was in the middle of the bottom frame.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man got his arm in, could he get at the fastenings, so as to get the window down - A. Yes; he could not have got the window down without putting his hand in; he could then undo the fastening, and pull the window down; the shutter was then forced open, the top hinge broken, and the shutter hanging by the bottom hinge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could not the fastening be undone with an instrument as well as with a man's hand - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in a public-house in Lei<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090059"></xptr>cester-fields. Two men asked me why I was so low in spirits? I told them that I was poor and had no friends. They said they were servants to a gentleman at Kensington. One of them said he would give me some clothes-and proposed that I should go with them, and have them in the morning - I went. One of them asked me to let down the window and let him in. I went over with them, they began opening the window. I began to think I had done wrong, and atttempted to escape. The shutter would not open, and they left it. I picked up the crow, as I was determined to fight to get away. I did not go there to commit any offence.</p>

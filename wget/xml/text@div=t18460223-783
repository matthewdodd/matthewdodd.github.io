                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in the Borough. I knew William Robinson Waterhouse, the deceased—he was thirteen years old—I knew he was acquainted with the prisoner—about a fortnight or three weeks after Christmas I remember hearing a scuffle near my door—there was a knock at the door, and when I opened it I saw the prisoner holding the deceased by the collar—the deceased cried—I took hold of his hand, and he leaned up against the window-sill a long time, and bit<lb></lb>terly cried—I saw no blow struck—I heard the prisoner say, "Mind, if you never call after me I shall not after you, but if you do I shall serve you the same again"—those were the words, as I recollect—I turned to him, and said, "How can you give way to such passion? that is the way murders are com<lb></lb>mitted; he is such a little fellow to you"—I noticed a mark on the side of the boy's face, and I told him he would have a black eye—I took him into my house—he staid there a very little time—I wanted him to go home to his mother—he said he had struck him in the belly, but he did not mind that so that he did not have a black eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to see the deceased on Monday or Tuesday, the 26th or 27th—my assistant had been to him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230151"></xptr>
               <p>twice before me—I found him labouring under severe inflammation, the symptoms of which were chiefly pain and fever—he complained of violent pain just on the left side of the pit of the stomach—it was attended with fever, and great constitutional excitement—he died on the 4th of Feb., I think—I opened the body afterwards—the immediate cause of death was inflammation of nearly the whole contents of the belly—it had spread, apparently, from the liver downwards—the liver was inflamed to a very great extent—the entrails were glued together by the result of inflammation—I speak of the viscera, the liver, stomach, bowels, and kidneys—there was a lacerated wound about the extent of an inch and a half on the left side of the liver, near the end, just emerging from the lower rib—no doubt it might be done by a blow, by some external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you examined to see whether there was any appearance of external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not find the least—I cannot say, to a few days, how long the violence had been inflicted before I saw him—the injury was not so great but what in some circumstances it might be recovered from, even such a case as this—it must not have taken more that a fortnight, I limit it to a week in my mind, to have pro<lb></lb>duced the state from which he died—I think that more probably the injury must have been inflicted a week before, than a fortnight—I first attended him on the 26th or 27th of Jan., and he died on the 4th of Feb.—I mean a fortnight before I first saw him—I think I am in a condition to state, with some de<lb></lb>gree of certainty, that external violence produced this—I know that no wound of the liver can take place without violence; and I know, also, that the inflammation I saw had spread all over the surface of the inside of the abdo<lb></lb>men, from the liver—I had not heard of his taking brandy a few days before he went to bed—I think that would not make any difference in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had heard he had been walking about the streets, and doing his usual business, a week or ten days after the supposed violence, should you suppose that any preceding violence could have produced such a result? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, under some circumstances a slight wound of the liver as this was, might have passed off again, under favourable circumstances—it was an inch and a half long, and less than half an inch deep—I should not necessarily expect to find external violence corresponding, possibly I might—I cannot conceive anything but external violence could have produced the injury to the liver—I looked to see if there was any, having a doubt as to whether the injury was owing to violent vomiting, or to external injury—I satisfied myself that the stomach was sound, therefore it could not have been from vomiting.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he sometimes sensible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was more sensible than otherwise; occasionally he was quite rambling, quite delirious—I think, in the intervals, he was perfectly aware that he was dying—he did not show any desire to hear any statement of mine as regards his recovery, and I have rea<lb></lb>son to believe he heard me state to his friends that it was likely he would not recover—I said it so that he might hear me—I cannot be certain that he did hear me say so—I did not direct it to him, but to his friends—he might have heard me—I do not let my patients know they are about to die, unless I feel certain they are about to die—I had no doubt he was about to die seven days before—I did not think such a statement would influence him much, if at all—I partly thought him not very sensible of external impressions, and I was partly careless of the place in which I said it—I believe he would rather</p>

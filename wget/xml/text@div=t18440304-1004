I missed a brace of pistols, a portfolio of prints, a bible, a various other things—I had seen the pistols, a very few days before in the summer-house, which stands in the centre of the garden, about half a stone's throw from the house—the garden is enclosed by a hedge and pales—the summer-house forms part of the fence, it opens into the garden, but not outwards.</p>

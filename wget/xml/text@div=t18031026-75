             sworn. - I live in Marybone-lane, about thirty or forty yards from the prisoner, Smith's, on the opposite side of the way: On Tuesday, the 18th of October, I saw the prisoner, Bennett, go into Smith's house, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, with a bag of feathers; he gave it to Mrs. Smith, and she put it on the stairs; I heard her say, I expected you would have brought them before. On Thursday, the 20th, I saw him again, about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning; he had on a brown great coat, buttoned up; I had a suspicion of him, and watched him; he went in very quick; he came out again in about ten minutes, with his clothes unbuttoned, both coat and waistcoat, and an apron loose; I followed him into Oxford-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260041"></xptr>street, and there I lost sight of him; I came back past Mrs. Smith's door, and saw her opening some check; in about ten minutes after, Mrs. Smith's little girl brought some cotton and some check to my house for sale, but I sent them back, having first measured the check; I did not measure the calico; I afterwards gave information to Messrs. Foxhall and Frver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A cabinet maker and joiner, and fell brokery goods.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep an old iron-shop? - A.No, a broker's shop; I make new furniture, and from people that I work for I take old furniture in exchange.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What shop is Mrs. Smith's? - A. An old iron-shop.</p>
               <p>ANN WILSON sworn. - I live next door to Mrs. Smith; I have seen the prisoner, Bennett, go into Mrs. Smith's almost every morning for three months; the most that I have seen visible was horsehair; about a fortnight ago, I saw him carry in a carpet; at other times I have seen him carry in nails, and small pieces of bed furniture; I have seen him go in four or five times a day frequently; I gave information of it to Mr. Fryer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What shop do you keep? - A.- A. I sell tobacco, snuff, and old clothes.</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Mrs. Smith's little girl took back the check; I sent for it the next morning, and Pettifer had it from my house; it was cut so that it was very visible it came off the same piece.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PETTIFER sworn. - I received a piece of check from Mr. Stevenson; I took it home, and matched it with some check in the warehouse; I found it had been cut off that piece; I then returned it back to Stevenson, and then took it to Mrs. Smith's; I told her I was the person who wanted to buy that check; she said she could not take less than four shillings, and I gave her four shillings for it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LOVETT sworn. - I am a Police Officer, and went with a warrant to search Mrs. Smith's house, on the 21st of this month, and found two pieces of Turkey-pattern carpet, and two pieces of Scotch carpet; she made no objection to my searching.</p>

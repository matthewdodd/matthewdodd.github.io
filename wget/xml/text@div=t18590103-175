I had a letter from the governor of Newgate, requesting me to come here—I was sent for to the police-office—I was not at home, and my assistant dressed the prisoner's wound—she came to me next morning, and the wound was undressed on purpose for me to see it, and I gave my opinion, after carefully looking at it, that it was done with some sharp instrument; but it is very difficult to distinguish between a wound done with a knife and one done with this box of the door, which I have only just seen; it would depend on the way it is cut; it is a semicircular wound going right round the ball of the thumb; it is ragged at one end but clean at the other; now a wound might be done with a knife and yet be ragged at one end, the first part of it would be jagged even if done with a razor; to my mind it seems a very difficult thing to make a semicircular wound such as this from striking an object. I think it began at the back (<hi rend="italic">Examining the scar</hi>), but you can judge of it better, or as well as I can. The thick part of the wound is at the back, which would be the jagged part as I describe; that was evidently the last part that healed, as the scar is thicker there. This lock is so very sharp that I do not see how anyone can distinguish between a wound done by that and a wound done by a knife.</p>

If the woman's wrist came with force against this sharp corner of the hasp, I think it would inflict such a wound; in fact one corner is as sharp as a knife.

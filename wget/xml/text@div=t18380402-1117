                  </hi>. I am servant to my father, Richard Davis, a livery-stable-keeper in Plough-yard, Lincoln's Inn Fields. The prisoner, King, was in my father's employ five or six months—in consequence of inform<lb></lb>ation, on the 14th of March I mixed some corn in a particular way, so that I might know it again—I cut some brown paper, and mixed up with it—I put it into the boot of the Bexley Heath coach to go to Blackheath, where we send a lot every day for the horses—I did the same with a different shade of paper on the 15th, and put that into the coach—on the 16th I did the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 141.) On Wednesday, the 14th of March, I went to Burley-street, Greenwich, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I saw King go from the stable, which I understand belongs to Mr. Davis, with a sack or a bag on his shoulder—he went across the road, in the direction to Slowley's—I saw him come back again, but I could not perceive whether it was a sack or not then—I went the next night, Thursday, the 15th—I watched the same as usual, and saw King take a pail in the same direction—Slowley was not with him on either occasion—King came back again, and crossed over the second time with a pail, but I could not see what was in it—he came back again and crossed the third time, got a light, came and locked up the stable, and went up the street to Blackheath-hill—I went the next afternoon to a house next door but one to Slowley's gate, in the yard, and at near seven o'clock I saw King come to the back of Slowley's house, with either a sack or bag on his back—he went into the back-door—in eight or ten minutes he came out, and I did not see him again for ten minutes—I then saw him come back again, and go down the yard, apparently to get some water, with a pail in his hand—he went back again, and I did not see more of him till I took him into custody, about half-past nine o'clock—I then went to Slowley's, and knocked at the door—his wife opened the door, and said he was not at home, he was gone to get beer—he came in—I said I came to search his house, for the corn that he had received from the ostler, opposite—he made no reply—I went into the back-room, and in a tub under the table I found this portion of corn, which I now produce, and on the table I found this empty bag—I asked him where he got it—he said he bought it of a man named Shove, of Lewisham.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not tell the father, that if you got the things you would not prosecute? A. No - he said to prove his own honesty he would do every thing in his power to get the things; I did not say I would not prosecute if he would give me 4l. - I said the things would cost 4l. to make them good, and I hoped he would not let me have that additional expence to take them out: the mother came to the house sometimes, but not to speak to me - I believe she has been taken up; I went to the office, and the Magistrate said the mother ought to be taken up - I believe I am obliged to prosecute her; she had not an opportunity of taking any of these things, to my knowledge - I do not know that she ever entered my room; she could not have got to my room without her daughter let her - it was always locked, as I had a shop in the Arcade; either I or the girl had the key - I lodge at the house; I never saw the mother at Norris-street - I have seen her at the Arcade, and I have lost some things from there.</p>

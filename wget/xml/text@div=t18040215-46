             sworn. - Q. Did the prisoner live Mr. Chaband? - A. Yes, he lived with him about three months; he came to us in November, and left us in January, I believe the 14th; we had missed two articles, a gold seal, commonly called a pump seal, and a pair of ear-rings; I remember seeing them in our stock the 6th of December; I am sure we had not sold them; after the prisoner left us, we had some information; the officer has them now.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On Thursday the 2d of February, I was sent for to take the prisoner; in searching his box for other things, I found this little red Morocco case; there were in this case a couple of broches, and several duplicates, which lead to the discovery of the seal; I asked the prisoner how he came in possession of those duplicates; he answered, they were his own; I then asked him where he had been employed; in consequence I gave information to Mr. Chaband, finding he was a jeweller.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Shoesmith; he lives at Lewes, and is a carrier; Bartholomew was in his service. My master's wagon comes from Lewes to the Nag's Head inn, in the Borough—on the 14th of June I assisted in filling a sack with corn for the horses to eat on the road—it was a mixture of peas, oats, and chaff—on the 16th I saw the sack in the wagon, in the same state as when it was put up—Bartholomew came alongside of me as we were on the road, and said, "I shall sell that sack of corn"—I said the horses would want it before they got home—he said they had got plenty—I went with him down the Brixton-road—we stop<lb></lb>ped at the Crown and Anchor public-house, Brixton, and had some drink—I saw Gatton, the horse-keeper, there—I heard Bartholomew say to Gatton, "Have you taken that?"—Gatton said, "Yes"—I then went back to the</p>

               <p>wagon, and started the wagon again—the sack of corn was not there then it was gone—I had seen it safe before we got to the Crown and Anchor, and I saw it safe when we got there and stopped, I am sure of that—I did not say any thing about missing it till the Saturday following, and it was on Wednesday I missed it—we got home to Lewes on Friday afternoon—I told my master's son of it on Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the East Sussex constabulary. I received charge of Bartholomew, on the 21st of June, at Lewes—he asked my advice how he should act—I said, "I give you none"—he said, "If my mate has <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, I suppose I must suffer for it; I gave the corn away for some beer, but it was poor stuff"—he said he hoped he should not get transported; if he got off with twelve months' imprisonment be should not mind—I took Gatton on my road, on the 25th, at Brixton Wash-way—I told him I apprehended him for receiving some corn of Mr. Shoesmith's, carter—he said it was poor stuff, he only gave some beer for it—I said, "I shall charge you with stealing the sack"—he said, "No, I did not steal the sack, I took the sack back again"—he said he had taken it from the wagon—I did not make either of them any promise, or threaten them in any way.</p>

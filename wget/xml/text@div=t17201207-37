Boyle (the Commander of the said Ship) to walk the Quarter Deck when he pleased, to which the Deceased reply'd be might walk and be damn'd. That the same Day before Noon the Deceased told him (this Evidence) that the Captain had given him leave for the Boat to go on Shore when he would, to do himself Justice; that he (this Evidence) told him it were best let alone; but if he must do it, he had better defer it till he come to England, for it might be of very ill conse quence to him there; that he made light of his Advice,  , and went out of his Cabbin. That in the Evening the Prisoner came upon the Deck, and told one of his (this Evidence's) Mates, that he had got the Captain's leave for a Boat to carry him a Shore the next Morning.

That a little while after, as he was walking on the Quarter Deck (where the Deceased also came and walked) he saw the Deceased's Servant and the Prisoner getting the Prisoner's things out of the Deceased's Cabbin; after they had taken four or five turns, the Prisoner came up, and he and the Deceased began to reproach each other with normal Obligations, and amongst others, the Deceased told the Prisoner, that he had been greatly favour'd in being admitted to walk the Quarter Deck. To which the Prisoner reply'd that he had been admitted to the Society of Lieutenants aboard other Ships as well as this and received as many Favours from them, and said to him, you are my officer here, and insist upon Privileges but what are we when we are ashore? to which the Deceased answered, I am

            . Upon which the Prisoner said be believed him to be like an Old Woman, and could do nothing but Scold. That he (this Evidence) went after wards to the Deceased to endeavour to mitigate the Matter, advising him to sign the Paper, telling him that he believed that the Prisoner was in Drink, or else he would not have used him so. To which the Deceased reply'd Drink is no Excuse for Rudeness; he shan't lye in my Cabbin any longer nor will I forgive him; for he has as good as challenged me; nor will I sign the Paper; for I am not to be huss'd into Compliance. That the next Morning about 10 or 11 a Clock he found the Deceased walking on one side of the Quarter Deck, and the Prisoner on the other side; that he asked the Prisoner where he had lain the last Night, who answered, that he had lain with Mr Weston (the Second Lieutenant) in his Bed, who gave him a Can of Elip before they went to Bed; and then told him that the Deceased had ordered him off the Quarter Deck, but Capt.Boyle had ordered him on again; and told him, that if he had a mind to do himself Justice, he should do it; thereby making an Uriah of him. That presently after the Deceased came to him and told him that the Prisoner had Challenged him before the whole Quarter Deck, and had told him that if he did not do him Justice he would post him for a Coward; that he (this Evidence) told the Deceased he was sorry for it, and again begg'd of him to sign the Paper to put an end to the Difference. That about 2 or 3 a Clock the Prisoner came to him on the Quarter Deck and made a Protection that he would do himself Justice let the Consequence be what it would. That he told him to Morrow was Sunday, and he hoped he would not do it then; upon which the Prisoner asked him if he thought he was Child? and said, to morrow is my Birth-Day, on which I am 30 years of Age; and perhaps it may be the Day of my Death; I have but one Life so left. Upon which he told him, that if he could prevail with the Deceased to sign the Paper he hoped that would put an end to the matter; to which the Prisoners reply'd perhaps it may, and perhaps it may not; as he will. That afterwards, he (this Evidence) went into the Master's Cabbin to consult with him how to prevent the Mischief that might arise from the aforementioned Dispute, and then went again to the Deceased to persuade him to sign the Paper and prevent the mischief which might otherwise ensue; but the Deceased told him that he spent his Breach in vain, for it was not consistent with his Honour to sign it, because it would be to sign himself a Coward; and he was not to be huss'd and bully'd into a Compliance; that the Deceased said his Principles were as honest as any man's, and that he did not intend to Wrong the Prisoner nor any Man; but to pay him as soon as he was able; and that he meant to have sign'd the Paper if the Prisoner had not used him in such a manner; but now he would never forgive him nor Drink with him, nor sit where he was. That the next Morning he was call'd up about 6 o, Clock and found the Deceased dead on the Quarter Deck. That he had 8 Wounds, one whereof was over the Left Pap, through the Left Lobe of the Lungs, coming out under the Armpit, which he judged to be the Cause of his Death. And that about Half an Hour after the Prisoner was brought aboard, and he drest a Wound he had received. That on Saturday the 10th of October following, when Mr. Ely was a Prisoner aboard the said Ship, he told him, that the Captain might have prevented it. This Evidence being ask'd by the Prisoner, further deposed, that the Deceased and the Prisoner were intimate Friends, and the Prisoner very serviceable to him; that the Deceased used to jangle with the Officers, and had once threatened to Cane him (this Evidence) when he should meet him on Shore, to which he (this Evidence) reply'd to the Deceased, that he would not be served by him as he had served Capt. Clarke. And that the Prisoner was Well-behaved, and never given to Quarrel.</p>

That he went into the Master's Cabbin, and fetch him (this Evidence) a Cann of Elip; that then he went to the Deceased's Cabbin Door and having just opened it, said something to him; that about half an Hour after 5 a Clock the Boat was lower'd and Mann'd for him; and he gave his Sword to the Cox-swain, bidding him to take as much care of it as he would of his Blood, and so followed him into the Boat, and put off directly. That immediately after the Deceased came to him and asked him who was gone ashore, and he told him; and the Deceased said he would be with him presently; that the Coxswain came back with the Boat, and told the Deceased that the Prisoner gave his Service to him and desired him to make haste for it was very cold; who reply'd he might be there time enough to his Cost; that he went into the Boat, and about a quarter of an Hour after the Boat return'd with Mr. Bignell dead. That the Boat was order'd ashore again to fetch the Prisoner, and he went with the second Lieutenant (Mr. Wiston) and the Prisoner voluntarily surrender'd himself to them.

That when he returned to the Ship he found the Deceased walking the Quarter Deck and deliver'd the Message; to which he reply'd, I may be ashore by and by to his Sorrow. That the Deceased gave him a pair of Pistols wrapt up in red Bays, bidding him carry them into the Boat, and presently after came in himself, bidding him row him to the Place where the Prisoner was.

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of January the prosecutor gave me a warrant to take up the prisoner. I went to his door, and saw him and his wife sitting by the fire; I wrap'd at the door, but they did not open it. I said, why do you not let me in? I saw him make motions to his wife not to let me in. Then I called again for them to open the door, and it was opened. I went in and told him I had a warrant for him, and on what account, and said I hoped he would help Mr. Perrit to his things again, saying, he wanted them for a great while. He said, he never saw them; but at last he said he had them, and sent his wife up stairs, and she brought down the case of brass ones. He denied having the silver ones, till in the coach going to the justice. Then he said he broke the silver ones from the steel, and sold the silver to a silversmith. We sent for the silversmith, and he recollected buying such silver of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where did these instruments lay in your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They lay on the cornish over my chimney, in the room where the prisoner used to shave me.</p>

            . I had some pieces of broken silver brought to me by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Roark. It was about seven weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Roark I keep a shop at the corner of Hatton Garden. The prisoner asked me if I bought old silver, and shewed me some pieces of silver instruments. I asked him what was his business. He said he was a barber. I said, what use have barbers for compasses? He said, at his leisure hours he was a painter, and drew drafts; but these being of no manner of use to him, he would sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity were there of them?</p>
               <p>Roark. To the best of my remembrance they weighed an ounce and four penny weights; but there being some steel on them (for which he allowed six pennyweights) I paid him four shillings and six-pence for the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of silver was it?</p>
               <p>Roark. They were handles to compasses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My name was engraved on the silver cap to the case.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, but called two witnesses, one of whom had known him three years, the other eight or nine, and both gave him that of a good character.</p>

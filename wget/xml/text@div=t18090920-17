On the 23rd of August, about half past nine at night, I saw my marked money was all in my till; I had marked a dollar, fourteen shillings, and three sixpences; the shop then was shut up; I left them safe in my till and all business in the shop had ceased.</p>

               <p>Q. You had inside shutters in your shop to secure the shop - A. Yes, the last shutter that was shut up was locked, that secures the whole. On the morning of the 24th I looked at them again, I found there were about twelve or fourteen shillings, the dollar was missing. Upon this I went out for a constable, I assembled my servants together, and the prisoner among them, I stated the circumstance that I had been robbed for some time past, and that it must be some of them that had got it; they all denied it, the prisoner among the rest; the officer searched two of the young men, I looked over the money that they had got in their pockets, and while he was searching the other porter the prisoner said you need not proceed any further, it is me who has robbed my master, and fell upon his knees and begged for mercy; he produced a part of it, the officer searched his pockets and found the remainder.</p>
               <p>- BOLLAND. I produce the money; I have had it ever since; there is nine shillings and a dollar, making in the whole fourteen shillings; the rest of the money is here.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I turned round to the prisoner and expressed my surprise that he had robbed me; he said he had done it by taking out the small shutter from under the flap of the counter, that is what we call a trap door; I tried the trap door the night before, I could not open it; he said he had done it that morning and the morning before; he said the other porter was down stairs cleaning his shoes when he did it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor has not left it in my power to make my defence, by taking my money away, I cannot employ attorney or counsel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jenkinson, and live at No. 24, Charles-street, Hatton-garden—I keep a circulating library. On Wednesday evening, the 24th of January, the prisoner came to the shop with his arm in a sling, and asked me if I would go to his mother, and tell her he was walking the streets, and had nothing to eat; and to come and speak to him at my place—his mother lives in Kirby-street—I knew him by coming to my place—I went to his mother, and told her—she said she would come directly—when I went out I left my cloak and the frocks on the chair, and my husband's coat on the bed—when I came back the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone, and my little boy said something to me—I looked about and missed these things—they were all gone—these are all mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a certificate as second mate—I got it in 1863 when I passed my examination at the Board of Trade—on 22nd August, 1864, I joined the <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> as second mate—the prisoner was the captain, Mr. Parker was the first mate, and there were sixteen hands, including the captain and everybody—we were bound for Japan, then to Hong Kong, Singapore, and ultimately for New York—no particular unpleasantness took place till we got to Singapore, but we had words occasionally—the captain did not treat me anything out of the way till then, but he and the first mate were having words every day, and the first mate left at Swatow—the captain then made me first mate, and I served as such till we got to Singapore—when we got there some sailors went ashore and complained to the Consul of the captain's treatment, and the captain came on board in the evening and said that people thought him a good deal in the wrong, and he must think himself lucky if he got off clear—he asked me if I remembered if ever he struck the men—I told him Yes, and kicked them too—he said he did not remember it, and said, "You had better come on shore as a witness"—I said, "I cannot go ashore to take a false oath for any one," and I did not—I do not know whether he made a cross charge against the men, as I did not go ashore, but I believe they were put in prison—I remained on the vessel till we left Singapore; but before we left I had words with the captain occasionally, and he told me I could leave if I liked—that was after I had refused to go as a witness—I told him the ship was going to London, and I wanted to get home to London—when he left Singapore he said that they would not clear the ship out with me as chief officer, because I had not a chief officer's ticket, and I took my second mate's ticket, and Mr. Dyson was put on as chief mate, and After that the captain was breeding disturbances with me every day about something, finding fault with what I got done—on 9th May he told me to alter a seizen that was up on the mizen rigging—I said if he would show me what he wanted done I would take it off, and put it on the way he wanted it—he called me a d—young fool, and said that I was not worth my position, and that I should go in the forecastle along with the men; that is being disrated—we had two passengers on board, and, as I had good papers and good characters, I said that any one could look at the seizen, if it was wrong—the captain called one of the passengers, Captain Clifford, who looked at it, but said nothing—the captain then came and said if I did not apologise I should go in the forecastle—I was to apologise for putting it on in that way—I told him I could not apologise when it was right, and he told me to go in the forecastle—I went there, and was reduced to the rank of an ordinary seaman—that was about a month after we left Singapore—he had been finding fault with me almost every day, and finding fault with my steering—when we were clewing up sails he would give orders for something else, and would call the man down from the rigging and send me up, telling me he would take my smartness out of me—he found fault with me every day till 14th June, when he called me a thief and a</p>

               <p>liar, and said that I had stolen a pound from the ship, a thing that is for putting on the sails, but he afterwards found that it was below—it was my watch below, and he abused me, called me a thief, and said that I had flung it overboard—during that time one of the men was taken sick, who said that he had removed the pound and put it under the companion ladder—I told the mate, and the mate took it out—on 15th June I was on the quarter-deck repairing sails, the captain was abusing me, and told me to put chafing on the foresail, and said that I should get it done before dark—I wanted a pound to do it with, and while some one had gone to get me one he told me to go to Tom for some rope yarn—I asked him which Tom, and he pushed me down and called a man to secure me, as I refused duty—I said that I had not, but I went aft with the mate—the man would not touch me—he said, "He has not refused duty, Sir"—the captain put irons on my hands, and took me by the throat, and knocked my head two or three times against the bulkhead of the cabin, and nearly choked me—he then put me down the lazarette under the cabin floor—there is a hole about two feet square under the cabin table which leads to it—it is part of the hold of the vessel—there were some cases there, and ropes and casks, and part of the cargo—it is about five feet high, I could not stand [upright, and the lower part is about four feet long—there was a cargo on board, pepper, hides, and gambia—the vapour from the hides and cargo came through—it was quite wet every morning, and I could hardly breathe—the hatch was put over me corner ways the first time, so as to leave a very small hole—that was the only mode of my getting air, as I only got air from the cabin—the mate went on deck—the captain kept in the cabin, and commenced abusing me, calling me everything that was bad, telling me that I would not get out of his way at Singapore when he wanted me to, and he did not care a d—if he had to pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my back, he would have a game with me—he had not alluded to that before—he was half an hour abusing me, and I got alarmed—I was fastened in at night, and found the irons were too large large for me, and about six o'clock I took them off, when the steward brought me my tea—I told him I intended to get up when I had a chance, and when I got the irons off I got up by raising myself, and got out and hid myself in the forecastle, and shortly after the captain presented a revolver at my head and said, "You beggar, I will shoot you"—I was behind a water tank then, and the mate was holding a lamp—I heard him searching for me, and calling out—I saw the light when he presented the revolver—I told the mate that the captain had threatened me—the captain said again that he would pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my back—I was frightened, and the mate said, "Come aft, Bryant, I will watch you and protect you"—I then went into the cabin—the captain put the irons on my hands again, took hold of me by the throat again, and knocked my head against the bulkhead—I could hardly breathe, and I sang out, "Murder"—the captain abnsed me, and put me in the lazarette again with the irons, on my hands—he then called the mate, who came and put another pair of irons on my feet—I slept there that night—they put the hatch over corner ways, and fastened it by nails I believe—if it had been put on square it would have been stifling—the best thing would have been to have had it off altogether, and the worst to have had it on square, because it fits like a wedge—I slept on the cases and ropes—I remained there three or four days in irons—the captain had a grating-hatch made on the second day, which was fastened over with a wooden bar, and lashed down—the irons were kept on my</p>

               <p>hands and feet three or four days—I took them off on the second day when the steward brought me my breakfast—I could take them off easily, they were so large, but I could not take them off my legs, they were too tight—the captain came and asked if I had taken the irons off—I told him I had taken them off my hands to eat my breakfast—he said he would find a way to keep them on—he went away, and came back in a few minutes and came down with a claw-hammer—he had a revolver sticking in the waistband of his trousers—he asked me for the irons—I gave them to him—he said, "Put your hands behind you"—I said, "I cannot have that done, Sir, I will not take them off my hands only to eat my food"—I resisted—he called two men down, who pretended to try, but did not succeed, so I had them put on in front—while this was going on the captain struck me on the arm with the revolver, and on the face with his fist, in the presence of Charles Thomberg and Thomas Renough, the second mate, who took my place—the captain said he would lash me up, and he got a rope down, put it round my body two or three times, and one of the men put it round the sternpost and pulled the block out—the captain then got the carpenter to put a staple in—I told the captain I should see what law would do for me—he said there was no law for me, he had the law in his own hands—he put the rope round my body and then went up—I remained three or four days with the irons on, and was down there nine days before I was taken on deck—I complained of my eyes being sore, and then the captain allowed the steward to take the hatch off in the daytime—the pepper and vapour affected my eyes, and they are affected now—I remained in the lazarette twenty-eight days, and during the latter portion of that time I was taken on deck, sometimes for an hour and a half, and sometimes two hours a day—I had to walk up and down the deck in the middle of the day with the sun right over head, when we were in the tropics, and passing St. Helena—the heat was very great there—I was then taken ill, and could hardly walk, and when I went on deck one evening for air the captain would not allow me to sit where I wanted—he caught hold of me and said I should not sit there, and pushed me down—I told him I could not walk, and he said he would lash me up and make me walk—I could only walk by catching hold of the rigging—I was taken to the store-room and confined there till we got to New York, sixty-seven or sixty-eight days—the captain then summoned me to appear before the British Consul—I was not on deck for nineteen days before we got to New York—I told the Consul I had been falsely imprisoned, and that the captain had ill treated me—I came across in the first steamer to get redress, and was put to the expense of paying my passage from New York—I had not been guilty of any conduct more than I have told you of—a log was kept on board the vessel—the captain read something to me from it, and I told him that it was not correct—I contradicted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Singapore, or any other place, did any one of the crew refuse to continue on the vessel with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They offered the captain three months to get away because they could not stop, he kept calling them thieves—they did not refuse to stop with me that I know of—Parker left the vessel at Swatow—I did not hear that he refused to remain on board while I was kept on board—I had words with him, but I did not strike him—the two I struck were discharged at Swatow I believe—I was never drunk on the way out—I swear that I do not recollect Renough going to my birth to call me when I was so drunk that he could not wake me up—I do not recollect the captain giving orders for hauling down some of the sails on the rigging at Singapore—I did not refuse to obey his order—Renough acted as second mate at Singapore—he did not tell me what orders the captain had given, nor did I say to Renough, "Go to b—, and let him come and tell me himself"—the crew were taken out of prison after they had been four weeks at Singapore, and asked if they would go on board again, and they said no, they would not go with that captain—that was not in consequense of me being there that I know of—the disrating was on 9th May—the captain told me to alter two seizens that were put on—I did not refuse to do it in the way he desired—he said they were on wrong and ordered me to go forward—I had put them on to the best of my judgment—I have been at sea thirteen years—I did not use insolent language, I told him that was the way the others were on, and he called me a d—young fool and a b—fool—he said they were not right—I said, "Tell me the way to do it and I will do it," and then he went below for a few minutes, after which he surveyed the seizen and said if I did not apologise I should go in the forecastle—I suppose that was what I was to apologise for—I told him that I had nothing to apologise for that I knew of, and then he sent</p>

We also beg to state, on a great many occasions previous to date he did use most abusive and insulting language to the master, and also constantly made use of the most threatening language to the crew, and on several occasions struck and bit them most unmercifully; that on one occasion he struck the chief officer on the deck whilst on duty; that afterwards, while being re<lb></lb>primanded by the master for said offences and forbidden to repeat them under penalty of being punished by the British Consul at Swatow, he</p>

               <p>became neglectful of his duty; and whilst at Singapore he stole some brandy and gin from the cuddy stores and gave it to the crew, and thereby made them disorderly, and advised them to refuse duty and demand their discharge, which they did, and in consequence were sent to imprisonment; and also that he went on shore much against the master's wishes, and whilst his services were much required, the vessel being about to haul into dock; that on that evening he was much the worse for liquor, and again returned on shore, and on next morning there was nobody to assist in hauling the ship out of dock; and, therefore, in consequence of all this, and seeing his insubordinate conduct, I, the master, have disrated him as an unfit person to have charge of second mate's duty <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this read over to you, something which happened on 15th June?"We, the undersigned, beg to state that on this day the master was com<lb></lb>pelled to put A. Bryant in irons for refusal of duty and threatening to strike the master, and for continued insubordination and disorderly con<lb></lb>duct, and inducing others of the crew to refuse and neglect duty, thereby impeding the progress of the voyage and safety of the ship; that a few hours after his confinement he broke open the store-room, in which he was confined, and by some means got the irons off his hands. On discovery of this I, the master, fearing that he had gone forward to induce the crew to mutiny, ordered the four firearms to be ready, and went in search of him, and after an hour's search (the crew refusing to state where he was) we found him stowed away in the lower forecastle behind a water tank. I then ordered him to be put in double irons, and put him again in the store-room and extra fastened it. He positively refused to give up the irons he had on, and swore he did not know where they were. This morning A. Bryant was again found with the irons off his hands and continued insubor<lb></lb>dinate <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS LABEY</hi>, Master; <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS RENOUGH</hi>." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I swear that was not read over to me—a few of the words at the commencement were, but not the middle or the latter part—there was another date which the captain read of, which I said that I could contradict most of it.</p>

               <p>were not all written at the same time—I did not see any of them written—I mean that the captain and the man who succeeded Bryant signed fully, and I put my name across—I did not sign so for any particular object—this "CO" means chief officer—I wrote the one of the 9th May and the 15th June at the same time, and the 17th at the same time—the captain asked me to sign—I cannot exactly say when—it was not when we got to England, nor was it after we left New York, on my oath—I mean to say that these signatures were to the log when it was produced at New York—it was signed a day or two before we arrived there—I signed all these entries, and all at the same time—I do not know whether Collier signed the entry of the 25th at the same time—he did not sign it with me—I cannot recollect whether I put my name to the entry about Sobeski at the same time; I might have done so—I was aware that these matters were going to be inquired into at New York—the captain, I think, told me that when he asked me to put my name—there was another complaint made against the captain at New York by a boy in the ship named Smith—I do not know that there was also a charge against him by Mack Sobeski—he did not complain to me of being assaulted or struck—there was a complaint made by one of the seamen I know, but I believe it was Smith—Smith said that the captain had struck him—Mack did say that the captain had struck him with a belaying<lb></lb>pin at the wheel—nearly all the men left at New York—their time was up, but Hughes left from sickness—I did not hear them refuse to serve longer with the captain, nor did the captain tell me so—he brought two men home of those who were originally at Singapore—they were nearly all fresh men at Singapore—I cannot say that many of them engaged from Singapore to England—I know that Bryant was engaged to go to England—he sacrificed his passage and came home in a passenger ship—that would cost him extra money—Reeves, the carpenter, did the same, but his time of servitude was up—he did not refuse to go on; he was not asked—he said that he was going home, and did so—I have heard cries as of a human being in distress—they came from the cabin—the lazarette is under the cabin, that is the reason I cannot tell, as sounds must come through the cabin from the lazarette—the captain was down there at the time, and I believe one or two men—I do not know whether Thomberg was there, but he was not on deck—I did not see Renough there—this was, I think, the next morning after I had brought the prosecutor out from the tank—I did not see the carpenter go down while this was going on—the steward was there I know—I did not go to see what was the matter—that continued for a very short time, it was merely an exclamation, such as "Oh!"—Bryant has refused duty to me; on one occasion he refused me personally to go on the look-out, but he did go eventually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not swear at the police-court, "I never saw the complainant refuse duty?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Refusal of duty is when a man certainly refuses and will not do it—I believe I did say so, but I say I did not see him refuse duty—I was speaking about the case of Captain Labey—I say that I had a great deal of trouble to get Bryant to keep a look-out one night, but he did not actually refuse—he did not say in my presence when he was put in irons that he did not refuse to do his duty—he might have denied the charge—I do not remember his making any observation at the time.</p>

'—Bryant said, 'Yes,' and made some observation about his having been falsely imprisoned by the captain—the captain replied, ‘If I had not done so the control of the ship would have been taken from me'—I asked Bryant's solicitor if he intended to take any proceeding against the captain—he said no; if he were discharged, and his wages were paid, that would put an end to the matter—Bryant made some further observa<lb></lb>tion about his having been hardly treated by the master—the solicitor said, 'Never mind that; now the matter is settled, we need not go further into it'—I asked Bryant again if he was content to take his discharge, and told the master to prepare his account and his discharge, and so the case ended—the captain wished the witnesses to be examined—I said there was no necessity of going further into it—the prosecutor was in the office some two or three days afterwards, and there was some question about his wages—the captain thought he ought not to pay his wages in full, and I said he ought not to raise any objection now, as the matter had been settled by his solicitor—I had no complaint from Bryant.</p>

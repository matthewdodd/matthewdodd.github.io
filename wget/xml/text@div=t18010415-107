(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been King's locker? - A. I have been in the Customs altogether twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been dismissed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been suspended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Griffiths who keeps a wharf near Tooley-street? - A. I know Griffiths's wharf, I was stationed there once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not make a complaint against you? - A. I was cried before the surveyor, and I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, in consequence of that, any dispute or quarrel with the prisoner at the bar? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the prisoner the man who made that charge against you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I ask you, whether or not, in consequence of that complaint, you had no quarrel with the prisoner? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to the prisoner, that in consequence of the accusation made against you, you would bed d-d if you would not be revenged? - A. Never in my life to him, or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. From your vigilance in rubbing down the man, a man could hardly expect to escape with such a quantity as that? - A. This was too great a bulk to be passed by, there may be small parcels conveyed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for a man to carry out such a parcel as that without being discovered? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you tell us you took that bulk out of his small clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is that coffee of the same quality with that in your warehouse? - A. It is.</p>

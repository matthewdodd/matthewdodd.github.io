                  </hi>. I live at Twickenham. The prisoner was in my service—on 10th Dec. Jackson, the carrier, brought me a parcel, which I opened—it contained some boots, a cap, and some mutton, which weighed 1 3/4 lb., some soap, and two onions—I believe they were all mine—I did not see the mutton cut off my meat, but I am as convinced as I am here that they were mine—the parcel was taken from my house, but I did not see it taken.</p>

               <p>some mutton, two onions, and some soap—I accompanied Mr. Cole to his house with the parcel, and placed it behind the sofa—I saw the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards—I asked her if she had taken a parcel to Mr. Jackson's, the carrier's, that morning—she said she had—I asked her what it contained—she said an apron and a pair of boots—I asked her if there was anything else in it—she said there was a nap and a letter, and she did not think there was any<lb></lb>thing else—I told her to recollect herself, and asked her if there was any meat or eatables in it—she said, "Yes, some mutton"—I asked her how she came by it; and, after a short time, she said she bought it at Mr. Wade's, the butcher's—I asked her what she gave for it—she said, "10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I spoke to her about the soap—she said she took that from Cole—she said since she had been in Mr. Cole's service she had bought a number of things, and she did not know that she was doing any harm in taking the soap and mutton—she acknowledged that that was the parcel she had taken to the carrier's, and said she was going to send the things to her sister.</p>

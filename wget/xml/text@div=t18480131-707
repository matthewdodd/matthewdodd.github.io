I was observing Mr. Serivener's on 29th Jan., at six o'clock in the morning—I saw Sims walk up and down, he passed through Gilbert-passage, and went near Mr. Scrivener's shop—it was not then open—he went up to it a third time, and the shop-door was opened by Elen—he came outside, and he and Sims appeared in conversation to<lb></lb>gether, close to the door—Sima then left with something under his arm, and walked away very fast up Vere-street—I followed, and saw him apprehended by Brown—I went back to Mr. Scrivener's—I found the shop was shut, and the lights out—there had been a light when I first went there—when Brown came back we went into a coffee-shop—we found Elen, and brought him to Mr. Scrivener's shop—he pulled a key out of his pocket, and opened the door—Brown took him up to his master's bedroom, on the first floor, to get a light, and Mr. Scrivener desired Elen to go the kitchen and get a light—the kitchen is the second floor—he went there and got out at the win<lb></lb>dow—we found that, by the window being open, and the snow knocked off—we went to Sims' lodging, and found a large loin of mutton, and some loose meat—I apprehended Elen the same day—I told him he was charged with being concerned with Sims, in taking meat from his master's shop—on the road to the station, he said he had acted very foolishly in getting out of the window.</p>

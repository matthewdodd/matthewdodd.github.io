                  </hi>. I live at Sheffield, in Berks, in Harmonds--worth parish. I lost a gelding on the 21st of February, early in the morning—I saw it last in a stable adjoining my farm—yard—it was not locked—the door was shut—in consequence of information I went to the Magpie, on Hounslow heath, where the prisoner was taken—I came there on the Tuesday—morning, and I found the geldind there—the prisoner was taken about a mile from the Magpie, on the Sunday afternoon—I did not see him till me Tuesday, he remained in custody—he had worked for me in the harvest, for five or six weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Magpie, on Hounslow—heath. On sun<lb></lb>day, the 21st of February, I received by the Bath coach some printed—bills describing a horse which was lost—about twenty minutes to five o'clock, the same afternoon, the prisoner came with a black gelding, which answered the description I had received—I asked him what he would sell it for—he asked me 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I should give him no such price—I then said, "I think you stole that house, you had better walk in," and I took him in—the house was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him whose horse it was—he said his own—I sent to Mr. Rhodes immediately—he came and claimed the came house.</p>

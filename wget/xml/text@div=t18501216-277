                  </hi>. I live at Little Ealing, and have a skittle-ground there.

                  </hi>. I found this ball in a pond in the field, about 250 yards from Mr. Gould's—I saw footmarks from the pales to within fifty yards of the pond—I saw the policeman compare some shoes with those marks, and the heel, which had been worn away, and the nails, corre<lb></lb>sponded—they are the same sort of shoes as many boys wear.</p>

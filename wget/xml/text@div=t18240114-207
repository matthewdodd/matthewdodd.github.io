On the 5th of January, between half-past six and seven o'clock in the evening, while I was loading my coach at the Bell and Crown, the prisoner was standing by, in the yard; two or three more men were there; he stood there for about twenty minutes. I then observed him on the coach; and when I got up, I touched him on the shoulder and said</p>
               <p>"Where are you going;" he said to Hounslow. The coachman and his brother were on the box. I had put a leather bag into the boot which contained sundry small parcels going to various places on the road; it was the last thing that I put into the fore-boot, which was not above half full - there was more space above it than would have held another bag of the sort. The boot is two and a half feet or three feet deep. I stopped at the Gloucester Coffee-house, Piccadilly, and put two or three deal boxes on the top of the bag, and nearly filled the boot. The coachman and his brother both got down, and immediately after that the prisoner got on the coach-box, and continued there while I was putting these parcels into the boot; and after that I went into the coffee-house for the weigh-bill, and called to the coachman that I was ready. I came round in a minute or two to get up behind, and saw a man standing behind pulling at the leather bag, on the near side, close to the fore wheel. The prisoner was assisting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140071"></xptr>him; they had each got hold of the bag, the prisoner stooping down and raising it up with his left hand, to case it out of the boot. The man on the ground could not have got it out without assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Must it have been removed from the place where you left it - A. Certainly; they had got above half of it out - they must have got the whole quite from the place where I had left it. A deal box which was on the top of it was moved, and caught at the top of the boot. I sprang forward, pushed the man away, and put the bag back again - turned round, and the man was gone - the prisoner got off the box as soon as he could, and moved towards the tail of the coach. I stood before him, and asked where he was going, two or three times, but he did not answer. I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me you was going to Hounslow" - he said he had left a parcel in the City, and must go back for it. I said I thought he was colleagued with the other man, and gave him in charge - he said he was a gentleman. The boot of the coach has a wooden flap, and a leather cover over it. I had put them both down after putting the parcels in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you responsible for the things in the coach - A. Certainly. I signed a deposition at the office. The prisoner asked me to pick up a glove which he had dropped, and I did so. The bag is three feet long; it is a soft leather bag. I cannot say whether it stood on its bottom, or its side. I twisted the top round. The flap opens against the coach - I do not know which of them opened the flap. I saw the bag partly out of the boot - it was certainly quite moved from the place I put it in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How much space did the bag take up - A. It was about eight inches or a foot below the mouth of the boot; it could not be out of the boot at all without being lifted entirely out of its place, where I put it; or it could not have been so far out of the boot.</p>

            . I am coachman of this mail. On the 1st of January, the prisoner got on the coach-box to go to Hounslow, and when we got to the Gloucester Coffee-house, he got off, and said he should go no further, for he had forgotten a parcel and would go and fetch it. On the 5th, he came into the inn yard, and rode on the roof, and in Piccadilly an alarm was given, just as I got on the box to start; I saw him stooping down; he pretended that he had dropped his glove on the near side of the coach; the guard gave it to him; I asked him if he knew the man who was with him, assisting to take the bag out; he said he did: he turned round to me and said,</p>
               <p>"What is your fare to Hounslow?" I said, 2 s. 6 d. He said he only gave me 2 s. the other night. I said it was 2 s. 6 d., which he gave me, and was getting down. Kirk got down and assisted in stopping him: he was stopped on getting off the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he knew the other man - A. Yes, I am positive of that. I told the Magistrate so. I did not see the guard put the bag in; the boot was nearly full, and is about two feet and a half deep I believe. The flap opens towards my feet; a man on the box can easily open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say he pretended to drop a glove - A. Because I supposed he dropped it to take off our attention. It was dropped on the ground, not into the boot.</p>

            . I am coachman of the Bath mail. On the 5th of January, I was on the Exeter mail, and saw the prisoner stooping down, helping to pull the bag out of the boot; another person on the ground, with one foot on the wheel, was pulling it out as quick as he could; the whole of it was not out; the mouth of it was out as far as it could get; the bottom of it was moved a considerable deal, it was as far out of the boot as it could come, the box being on it; they were both pulling it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing the bag to have been put in after other luggage had filled up a space in the boot, might not the bottom of the bag be still resting on that other luggage - A. I do not think it possible; it must have been lifted from the place it had stood on, or it could not be so much out; the man on the ground pulled it down, and the prisoner put his left hand down to raise it up, to assist him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Civil Service, and live at May's Cottage, Bounds Green, Tottenham—on Monday, 4th October, I was on the platform of the Holloway railway station at 5.5—after I had been there about five minutes, I saw two persons there—I did not know who they were at that time—I afterwards ascertained they were Boyd and the deceased woman, Maria Death—I also saw two musicians on the platform at that time—I saw Boyd speak to them, and one of them played a tune, and the other sang, on the platform—shortly after that the 5.10 down train arrived from King's Cross—I saw Boyd and the two musicians get into that train—I did not take sufficient notice to say whether Maria Death got into that train or not—I got into the same train—I saw nothing of either Boyd, Death, or the musicians, until the train arrived at Wood Green—I got out there, and proceeded from the station, over the bridge, on my way home—after I had crossed the bridge, on looking forward, I saw Boyd recovering himself, getting up from the ground—I had not reached where he was at that time, and I noticed a severe wound on his cheek, it was bleeding—directly afterwards the woman Death ran past me towards the station, and the prisoner in pursuit—she was some few yards in front of him—she was running, and he was running in pursuit—he caught her, and caught hold of her by the waist—I looked round, and waited a minute till they passed me—he was still holding her by the waist—I did not interfere at all—I heard the woman say to him, "<hi rend="italic">Fred.,</hi> you know what you have said to me," or "told me; I am afraid of my life"—at the time she said this to him he I was taking her home, using no more violence than was necessary to take her home—he had got her right hand under his left arm, and was partly dragging her home—I walked behind—a little further on there is a corner; they turned that corner—after I had turned the corner I saw Boyd and the two musicians—the musicians were wiping the blood off Boyd's cheek—the prisoner and deceased passed them—a little further on there is a stile—the prisoner had to lift the deceased over the stile, she would not get over herself—when I was near the stile I saw Mr. Whitton, and he and I walked on together—at that time the prisoner and Death were in front of us, and Boyd and the musicians behind—there were two more stiles, and the pri<lb></lb>soner lifted the woman over both—a little further on is a road called Bounds Green Road; when they got into this road the prisoner and Death increased their pace, and by the time we reached Truro Road they were just about turning into the gateway of Nella Cottage—we still followed them—we were on our way home—we stood at the corner of Truro Road for a minute—we then walked nearly to Nella Cottage, Mr. Walter Gray accompanying us—he had joined us at the corner of Truro Road—I did not at that time know that there was another residence behind Nella Cottage—while we were fronting Nella Cottage I heard the report of a gun; I did not hear anything before that—after the report I heard something which appeared like blows—before the report I heard a scream, one or two screams—I looked in the direction of the</p>

               <p>report, and saw the smoke, and I saw the form of a woman fall; there were some shrubs, I could not see plainly—I called out, "The woman is shot!"—I saw the gleam of some instrument raised and put down with violence; that was at the bottom of the garden of Nella Cottage, the same place where I saw the form of the woman fall; and I heard blows—after that I saw the prisoner coming from the spot where I saw the instrument raised—he had a gun-barrel in his hand like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he came within three or four yards of me into the Truro Road, and said, "Yes, I have shot her; there is no mistake"—that was all I heard him say—he then walked into the Bounds Green Road—I followed—he still had the gun<lb></lb>barrel in his hand—there were a lot of <hi rend="italic">navvies</hi> standing in the Truro Road—I made some communication to them, I don't know whether the prisoner could hear it—he went on till he came to Elder Cottage, which was occupied by Boyd—I should say that is about sixty yards from Nella Cottage (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>)—I believe this is correct—from the time they started from the station till the prisoner stopped opposite Elder Cottage, it was not more than from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

I am a surveyor, and live at Wood Green—I prepared this plan, it is to the scale of 16 ft. to the inch—I have measured the distances of the different places—from the Wood Green Station to Nella Cottage is 900 yards, the route described by the witness—the distance from Nella Cottage to Elder Cottage by the road is 180 yards—Hinaon's cottage is at the bottom of the garden of Nella Cottage—Nella Cottage is the cottage of the landlady, behind which Hinson lived—Elder Cottage was Boyd's cottage—looking in the direction coming from the railway, Hinson's cottage would be behind Nella Cottage, rather standing to the left.</p>

When I saw the form of the woman falling I was standing in the Truro Road, and Nella Cottage was on my right—I saw Hinson turn into the gateway of Elder Cottage, and he was lost today view—I then retraced my stops towards Nella Cottage, and, not seeing anything of him, I turned again down the Bounds Green Road—I then saw him retracing his stops towards Nella Cottage, and he turned into the gate<lb></lb>way of Nella Cottage—I then saw two policemen in the Bounds Green Road, coming towards me—in consequence of what I said to them, they drew their staves from their pockets and turned into the gateway of Nella Cottage, which is occupied by Mrs. Allen, the prisoner's landlady—the constables went in first and I stood in front of the gateway—I went down the garden and saw the prisoner throwing a policeman—he had got the policeman on the ground—I went and seized the prisoner by the throat and he released the policeman—I left him in charge of the police, and went round to Boyd's Cottage—I went to the bottom of the back garden, and there saw Boyd lying on the threshold of the stable door, on his back—his head and face was battered about very much—I saw a woman there, named Margaret Robinson, I believe—I took her into the kitchen of Boyd's cottage and left her there—I then came out, passed Boyd, and got over the fence into the garden of Nella Cottage—I there saw Maria Death, outside the summer house that Hinson lived in, at the bottom of the garden of Nella Cottage, on the same spot where I had seen the form of the woman fall—she was lying close to the window, perhaps a yard from it.</p>

               <p>long it takes from the station, because I go over that ground every day—it is by that I calculate the time I have given—when I saw the woman run<lb></lb>ning back, outside the railway station, she was not running back to the place where Boyd was; Boyd was in front at the time—he was getting up from the ground—I did not interfere—if the prisoner had knocked her about I should very likely have interfered—I have said there was no more violence used than was necessary to take her home—I could not say whether the was sober, I did not notice—I noticed that she was very much excited—I did not state that before—I was not asked—what the cause of the excitement was I cannot tell—I can't say whether it was for the purpose of assisting her that he helped her over the stiles—I should think not—she did not want to go—I did not interfere, because I did not feel justified in doing so—I did not even remonstrate—I considered the woman was his wife—I did not know her—I considered she was his wife because I had seen her on the platform at Holloway, and Boyd also; and noticing that Boyd was knocked down, that was the inference I drew—I did not interfere because I thought she was the prisoner's wife—I saw no more done than I have stated, that would have justified my interference—I noticed the prisoner—I did not take particular notice of the musicians—I should think they were sober—I believe they were sober—Boyd was drunk—the prisoner appeared to be a little excited—I noticed him when he was coming towards Truro Road after the shot had been fired—he did not appear in a state of great excitement—he appeared as cool as I am now—I took particular notice of that—I did not notice the front door of Boyd's bouse when I went there—I went down the gateway at the side—I did not go through the house—I saw the door afterwards—it was not torn down, merely the catch of the lock forced—it was forced open—the catch that supports the lock was forced off—the fence I got over is a low fence—it separates the garden of Nella Cottage from Boyd's garden—it is about 3 or 4 ft. high.</p>

I am a clerk in the War Office, and live at Maidstone Road, Colney Hatch—I joined Mr. Sawyer on the evening of this occur<lb></lb>rence, as he was walking home from the Wood Green station—I had seen the prisoner a few minutes before—he was running after the woman—he was going towards the station at the time I first saw him—the woman was running from him—I saw her at the moment he bad caught her—I scarcely saw any running—he held her by the waist and told her to come with him—she said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Fred.,</hi> I would rather not; do let me go"—he then turned her round, and they went in the opposite direction, and walked across the fields—he held her hand very tight under his arm—you could scarcely call it dragging her along, but he caused her to go with him, evidently against her will—there were three stiles on the road—he lifted her over the first two; and the third, my impression is, she got over by herself—the last stile is perhaps 200 or 300 yards from Nella Cottage—I was following on after them—I saw them turn down the Truro Road and turn into the gate of Nella Cottage—I remained in the road, supposing they had gone into Nella Cottage—I then heard the report of a gun—I can't say exactly how soon that was after I had seen them turn into the gateway of Nella Cottage, but I should think certainly within two minutes—I also heard the sound of a blow and saw a figure fall, apparently the figure of a woman—before she fell I saw a stick, as I thought it at that time, raised above the figure, in motion, but I could not distinguish the person who held it—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186911220029"></xptr>
               <p>then saw the prisoner come out of the gate by the side of Nella Cottage, with a weapon in his hand resembling a bar of iron—I have since found it was a gun barrel—some one in the road, standing not far from me, said, "The woman is shot"—the prisoner, apparently in answer to that, said, "Yes, I have shot her; there is no mistake about that, and I will now kill," or, "do for the other"—I then saw him go round the corner, and saw him enter the gate of Boyd's cottage—I spoke to some men in the road, and told one of them to run as fast as he could to the station and bring some policemen, which he did—I saw the prisoner again in a very short time, indeed, it might have been a minute—he was then passing between the gateway of Boyd's cottage and the end of Truro Road, perhaps ten or fifteen yards from Boyd's cottage—I followed him, and saw him again enter the gate of Nella Cottage—I next saw two policemen running round the corner of Truro Road, and I called to them, or one of them, and pointed to the gate where Hinson had gone in, and they went in there—I afterwards saw a sort of struggle—it was very confused, and nearly dark, but I saw a figure on the ground, and a figure bending over him, apparently—I afterwards saw the body of the woman—when I first saw it closely it had been mored into the little iron house, Hinson's cottage—I had seen it previously among the bushes in the garden of Nella Cottage, within two or three yards of Hinson's cottage—from the time I first saw Hinson take hold of the woman to the time I saw him struggling with the policeman in the garden, I should think about twenty or twenty-five minutes elapsed.</p>

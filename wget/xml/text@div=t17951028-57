               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come in? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her while she was in the shop? - Yes, I did. On Friday, the ninth of this month, I was called down stairs, the prisoner at the bar was in my shop, when I came behind the counter, I recognized her features. I had seen her about three years and a half before in my shop; I had very great reason to suspect that she was a thief, as such, when she was gone, as there had been plenty of opportunity for her to take goods out of any shop, I looked particularly among them, and I missed two pieces of printed callico.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these the last time before it was missing? - That I cannot positively say, one of my young men can. I had seen them in the course of two or three days, they had not been in my shop above a week. In the evening of that night I and my young man,

            , made particular enquiry in the neighbourhood of Swan-street, where the prisoner had said that she resided, as I understand. I could hear nothing of her that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of her? - On Tuesday following. This was on the ninth that she was at my shop, on Friday. On Tuesday I went down to her house, and I looked into the window of her shop, she keeps a linen-draper's shop. I see her shewing these prints that I had missed to a customer. I came up for assistance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280094"></xptr>to the police office, and they went down with me in about an hour's time; we went there together, we searched the house for about an hour, without finding any thing that we were in search of, except the sag end of one of the pieces which was torn off. I have got it in my pocket; there is no mark on it, but it joins exactly where it was torn from. In the course of this hour we looked down the necessary twice, and there was nothing there, but I not being satisfied before I went, wished to have the place searched again; we went the third time, at least one of the officers did, and there lay these two pieces of print that I had missed, with that sag end cut off; the officer, after he had found them there, gave information to his partner, and I went immediately to the place, and see them there, and helped them to take them out. When I came into the shop again, the prisoner particularly solicited me not to proceed any further, offering me money, which I refused, telling her, that I did no more then what I thought was my duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your's is a shop of a good deal of business, you keep a good many shopmen perhaps? - I keep two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your wife serve in the shop? - She does not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the ninth that you saw her at your house, and the thirteenth, four days after that, you see her at her house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about this offer of money before the magistrate? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know why you omitted to tell that circumstance before the magistrate? - I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is now above a fortnight since, and at this time it occurs to your recollection? - It does.</p>

               <p>You are shopman to the prosecutor? - Yes. On the ninth of October the prisoner came in and asked to look at some different printed callicoes, I shewed her a variety of different patterns. In about two minutes after she came in, she told me her name was Mrs. Smith, a neighbour, likewise she had a sister, an opposite neighbour to us. She was in the shop about twenty-five minutes, as near as I can recollect, and purchased of me two gowns to the amount of three pounds nearly; she offered me a ten pounds Bank note, which I had not cash enough to give change. I rang the bell for Mr. Gillson, he came down stairs, and called me on one side, he gave me reason to suspect her; I came forward, and gave her the change, she immediately went out of the shop, the next instant I looked over the prints that I had been shewing her, I missed two patterns, two quantities, I know them, they have my own marks on them. I then immediately went and asked this person who she said was her sister, if she had any sister in town; she told me she had not. I went that same evening to Swan-street, where she said she lived, near Mr. Gillson's, we could find no person there of that name; on Saturday we enquired in the trade of our neighbours, likewise the same on Monday. On Tuesday we had information of a person answering that description and the name, with that Mr. Gillson told me he would go down to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with your master to the place? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your master keeps two journeymen, was the other journeyman in the shop at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. She bought goods to the amount of three pounds, you don't call that a bad customer that lays out two or three pounds with you? - Not a very bad one,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280095"></xptr>if we had never better, it would be very bad.</p>

               <p>Q. When did she go into the dock?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I don't know; I was discharg'd from the ship a little before she went into the dock: it is about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she delivered of her goods?</p>
               <p>Johnson. She lay at Shadwell-dock when she was delivered of part, but there were above 40 puncheons of rum left on board when she went into the wet dock; and there was a chest of arms.</p>

               <p>Q. In what part of the ship was the rum and chest of arms.</p>
               <p>Johnson. The rum was down in the hold, and the chest of arms in the steerage</p>
               <p>Q. Were the arms lock'd up?</p>

               <p>Johnson. I saw them when I was discharged, and gave the mate orders to lock up the chest, and he told me afterwards he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What arms were there on board?</p>
               <p>Johnson. There were 12 muskets, 4 musketoons and 6 pistols, all in the same chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any marks to them?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, none as I took notice of. I left them in the ship at Shadwell-dock.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find missing?</p>
               <p>Johnson. There were 4 muskets, one musketoon, and 5 pistols missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners on board then?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you inform the prisoners at that time, of what you missed?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Capt. Campbell. I am one of the owners of the ship Ruby; on Sunday was fortnight I receiv'd a letter from Mr. Perry, a master builder at Blackwall, giving me an account of these things being missing from the vessel. I sent word to

            , to go on board to see in what condition the arms were i n, and to come to me at the Jamaica coffee house; he came and inform'd me there were arms missing. Then I ordered him to meet me on the Wednesday after at Blackwall, which he did; then captain Johnson and I went on board; when we got upon deck we could not get the compainon open, there stood Login on board, I ask'd him what he did there? he said he was the king's officer, and said he would open it, which he did; we went down into the steerage, there was an empty cask stood on the arm chest, I bid him take it off, which he did; I opened the chest and bid captain Johnson take the arms out, which he did; there were 8 muskets, 1 pistol, 3 blunderbusses and eleven cutlasses.</p>
               <p>Q. What were missing?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There were wanting 4 muskets, one blunderbuss and 5 pistols, according to the inventory. I taxed Login with taking them, and ask'd what was become of them? presently Johnson came from out of the ship's hold; then I said to them, what a fine character have I got to lay before the commissioners of the excise of you for taking care of the ship; they said they knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any others left in care of the ship besides the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Campbell. No, there was no body else, the ship is laid up for a year; and on their desiring to be in the steerage, I gave them leave. Then we went to a publick-house in Poplar, and was told there were some arms there. The landlord told me Login had brought some arms there, and one McBean had carry'd them away; I think he said three musquets and some pistols. We took up McBean, he owned the same, and we found by his directions 2 musquets, 4 pistols, and a piece of canvas, and before the justice McBean confessed the stealing of rum. (Four musquets and five pistols produced in court.) I can't swear these are the same that were missing, they are such as I bought for the ship's use about six years ago; they were the property of me and the rest of the owners.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the owners names?</p>

            . On Friday the 9th of this instant February I received a letter from capt. Campbell, with another inclosed which he received from the master builder; he desired me to go to the ship to over-hawl the arms, to see what was missing. I went on the Tuesday morning and took capt. Johnson with me. We looked in the arm chest and found 8 musquets, 1 pistol, and 10 cutlasses. I went to the Jamaica coffee-house and told capt. Campbell what we found, he said then there were so many missing according to the inventory.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners challenged with taking what were missing?</p>
               <p>Sidney. They were, but they denied it, Then I found McBean in company with Johnson, he produced 4 pistols and some canvas; then he went with me before justice Berry and made his confession. I know nothing against the prisoners. I took charge of the ship at Shadwell-Dock, and carried her into the wet dock, at Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When a ship is in dock is it not customary for other people to come on board her ?</p>
               <p>Sidney. They have no right to go under the deck, they pass and repass over her, as she lays by the side of others.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there none on board the ship while she was in the dock to take care of her?</p>
               <p>Sidney. About three days after she was in the dock I discharged a man by order of the owners; then there were none left but the prisoner, no body had any right but themselves to be there, and I had the keys of the hatches.</p>

               <p>McBean. He did after he brought them, that he had them from on board the ship he was on; he came to me on the 8th of this instant, and asked me if I had a gimblet, and bid me come on board after him. I went; he took an old key out of his pocket, and unlock'd the padlock, and gave me a dark lanthorn and a candle, and bid me go into the hold along with him, and said he'd give me some rum, for it would never be missed; he took the gimblet and bored, and draw'd off some rum from a puncheon. Then he went to a locker on the side of the ship, and brought a piece of canvas and cut it in two pieces, and gave it to his wife, and she carry'd it to Poplar; and he gave me about 3 yards of it, which is this piece here in court; the bit he had was as big again as mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of rum did you take?</p>
               <p>McBean. He gave me four flasks, and kept seven to himself, the flasks held about a quart each.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Johnson had any rum?</p>
               <p>McBean. I know he had three gallons at a publick-house at Poplar, but how he came by it I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that?</p>
               <p>McBean. He told me he had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Johnson had any of the canvas?</p>
               <p>McBean. Login told me Johnson had some, but I did not see him take any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Johnson when you was on board?</p>
               <p>McBean. He was then at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>McBean. I live in Ratcliff-Highway, with my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his business?</p>
               <p>McBean. He is a grocer by trade.</p>

             in Poplar; The two prisoners have both brought rum to my house; there was more rum in my house, but who brought it in I know not; there were also 4 pistols and some muskets. I know not who brought them, but the last evidence carried them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners use your house?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. They did; I once put McBean in my house while I went to London, and what was transacted in my absence I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the rum measur'd?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I did not; I have seen two flasks in the prisoners pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay them for the rum?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I paid them 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you pay it?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I paid it to McBean, it was he that let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. No, I never did, I have seen them bring rum to my house and put it down on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did McBean deal in rum?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. They came all three together, and I made some of the rum into punch and they drank it; McBean measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much per gallon did you give him for it?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I did not make a bargain; McBean told me it would be of service to me; I am but a new publican.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might the flasks hold?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I believe each held a gill over a quart; they told me I should pay after the rate of 8 s. per Gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. This was three weeks ago, I believe; they always behaved well when they came to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity they brought?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not an allowance on board a ship for a Customhouse officer?</p>
               <p>Turnhill. I can't tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Johnson's defence.</p>
               <p>I brought rum to that man's house at different times, it was what I saved out of my allowance, and did not belong to the ship.</p>
               <p>Login's defence.</p>
               <p>This man, McBean, being a duffer, he used to go on board these ships; he is always lurking about that place.</p>
               <p>Q. to Capt. Campbell. Is there any particular allowance to the Custom-house officers for rum?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There is none at all, without we please to give it them.</p>

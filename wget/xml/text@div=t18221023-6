            , who is a widow, and rents the house. On Thursday, the 3d of October, I lost a hair trunk out of the second floor room, containing the articles stated in the indictment. I saw the trunk about five o'clock. I went to bed about nine o'clock, and it was gone. Proud was at the house about four o'clock that day, and Jenkins about three - I did not see them after four o'clock. I have found none of my property. Some little things were found in Jenkins's cellar the same night, about a quarter before ten o'clock; I was present when they were found - it consisted of patchwork, which had been in my trunk; they are here. I produce part of them - here is a piece, which I had a gown of myself. Jenkins was at the watch-house when it was found; I had caused him to be apprehended at the Castle, public-house, Broadway. Jenkins's mother keeps the house the pieces were found in, and he cuts wood in the cellar with Proud; the things were worth 10 l. I I was at home from five till nine o'clock, and heard nobody come in or go out; a rope was found at the top of the house, to which they must have slung the box, and let it down.</p>

            . I belong to Queen's-square. I was with Jenkins at Turpin's, in Dartmouth-street, a little after six o'clock in the morning, in company with Greenhill the watch-house keeper. Jenkins took us there, to shew us where the property was, but we found none of it; he pointed out the person, to whom he said he sold it. I examined the premises; and on the front garret parapet were marks of boy's feet, and marks on the wall where the box had been let down - the prisoner's feet are about the same size.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Brick-lane, Spitalfields.

I just changed a half crown—I asked her where she got it—she said she was an unfortunate girl, and did not know where she took her money—I said it was the second time—I sent for an officer, and gave her into custody.</p>

            . On the 1st of February, 1811, I took a lodging at the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t18230625-61-crimeloc354">White Cross-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230625-61-crimeloc354" type="placeName" value="White Cross-street"></interp>

I saw him in the shop when I went; it was not then open for business, a bill was in the window, stating that the upper part was to let, the prisoner shewed me all over it, except the kitchen and cellar; he took me to the first floor, the back room of which belonged to him, and the front room was entirely empty - he said that was not to let; he took me to the second floor, and said that was to let, and shewed me the rooms above. I said they would be too large; he said that he would let me the second floor, at a dollar a week, and we might have the use of the rooms above, for he should never use them. I said my husband must see them, that he was in the cabinet business, and asked if he might work on the premises, he said Yes, up stairs; and in two or three days, I took my husband up and found the prisoner at home - we were to take possession, on Saturday the 7th of the month at 5 s. 6 d. a week, and he was to be paid every week - we went in on the 7th, and slept there, and for the first two or three days, I observed there was nothing in the place, and asked how he came to take such a large place, and have no furniture; he said, he had been very unfortunate, that he had been burnt out at Bermondsey. I said "God help you and I will lend you every thing you want." He slept in the one pair back room; the doors were always open, and in that room, there was only a new<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250023"></xptr>tent bedstead, a new bed, a pair of new blankets, and a pillow; but no sheets, and a leather trunk by the side of the bed, but neither table or chair, there was no female servant, only a boy, there were no candlesticks, but a bottle was used for one. I offered to lend him crockery, seeing there was nothing but a bason in the place; he had a parlour behind the shop, and in it was a set of old fire irons, two or three old chairs, and an old deal table; a water barrel in the yard - counters in the shop, and a stove in every room as fixtures. I have mentioned every thing that I ever saw in the house. I had a great deal of furniture, and offered to sell him some, when I had been in the house about a week, he said he was going to furnish the first floor front room for a gentleman whom I had seen. I had seen a respectable gentleman setting on the counter, and he said that was the gentleman, (I offered to sell him furniture, he said No; he had a German who would sell him some.) I made tea for them, and said "I hope there is going to be a rational being in the house, for you are none." Two or three days after this, I came down stairs, and found the first floor front room shut, which before was always left open, the stair case was very dark, unless it was open. I said "Gotte, what induced you to shut that door? I cannot see the way down;" he said "I have got some beautiful chairs in the room," I said "When did they come in, I must have seen them;" he said "Last night, and I am going to have a beautiful table in to day." This was Thursday, the fire happened on the Monday following. On Friday, in my curiosity, I peeped through the key hole, but could see nothing - the shutters were never shut, and I could see all through the room. On the Saturday my husband went out of town; he came down stairs, and paid the prisoner 5 s. 6 d., and said he was going to St. Alban's; he said "Is your wife going;" my husband said No; he said "She ought to go, it would do her good." Gibbs said I could not and went out, and soon after I was bringing down a pail of dirty water, and slipped on the stairs, and came in contact with the door of this room - the pail went against the door as well as myself and forced it open - I fell into the room, and there was nothing whatever to be seen, but the stove - the pail rolled into the shop. I went down and said "Gotte, your boy must go and wipe this dirty water up, for I have fallen into your room, and how could you tell me such stories, that you had such beautiful chairs, and there is not a thing in the room?" he merely laughed and said, there would be bye and bye. On the same afternoon, he asked me to lend him a hammer and chisel. I went up to the garret (where my husband kept his tools) for it, and to my surprise, in the front garret were two sacks full of shavings. I took the hammer and chissel down, and asked how he came to take shavings up stairs; he said he bought them so cheap, and bye and bye he could not get them.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, had you remarked his going to the garret - A. Repeatedly, I said to him, "What makes you go up stairs after we go to bed?" he said he went up to see the comet; we generally went to bed at eleven o'clock, and I had observed him go up stairs, five or six times after that - the boy always slept with him. He had no furniture whatever in the garret. On Sunday morning I came down stairs, and saw him in the shop about nine o'clock, as I was going out to breakfast, with the mother of a young woman who slept with me. I said I was going out to dinner; he said so was he, and asked where I was going. I said to Shadwell; he seemed rather alarmed as I thought, and said "Shadwell, Shadwell, who do you know at Shadwell;" I said two or three people and named them, and asked if he knew them, he said "No; where do they live?" I said near the church, and what was his motive for asking; he said he had no reason, only a friend of his was burnt out at Shadwell; I said "Good God you deal in fires. you burnt out, and your friend burnt out! God help us" - before I left, I said "If you go out, how am I to get in?" he said he would leave the key at Stones, the Rum Puncheon, public-house over the way. I went out and returned, to the best of my recollection, about half-past two or three o'clock, as I changed my mind and went home, instead of dressing for dinner; I went over to Stones for the key, it was not there, and I came to the door, and found the door shutter up, which had never been the case during the fortnight I was there. I turned the handle of the door and it opened, it had been locked but the bolt had not gone into the hasp. I stopped for a moment fearful of going in, as I thought he was out, and somebody might have gone in. I threw the street-door wide open, and thought I would not go up, but walked through the parlour into the back yard, when I came to the parlour, I saw the hearth stone taken up and standing on its edge, against the side of the fire place, and Gotte on his knees; a sack of shavings laying on his left side, with the mouth towards him, on the right-hand side a tin can, what had been in it I cannot say, it was like an oil can with a spout to it - there was a lighted candle on the hob; he had some shavings in his left-hand, and was pushing them in between the boards with my chissel, where the hearth had been - he did not see me. I stood for a moment there; tapped him on the shoulder, and said "For God's sake what are you at, put that hearth down" - he did not answer me. I said "For God's sake put it down, for Gibbs will break his legs;" (as he had to cross that hearth in the morning, to the yard to wash his hands;) he seemed alarmed, and and raising himself on his arm, said "It shall be put down. It shall be put down." I said, "What are you doing?' he said "The shavings are wet, and I put them here at the top of the oven to dry, because they shan't smoke, when I light the oven." I said "I dont care what you are doing, only whatever you do, I will have that hearth put down," - he said it should. I think this place was over the oven. I went out immediately, (without going up stairs,) to a friend's house where my husband came - we went home together, between eight and nine o'clock, and slept at home; nothing particular occurred that night - we brought two friends home with us, who went home. On Monday morning I took some meat down to the bake-house, to ask him to bake it for me; he said No; he should not light the oven that day, as he had plenty of pastry left. I had never been in the bake-house before - a day or two previous to that, I had observed to him that he only had a sack; or part of a sack of flour in the shop; he said, "Oh dear, I have plenty in the cellar below." On the Monday, I saw three sacks of shavings in the cellar, and a quantity of coals strewed along the place, with shavings and chips of wood in a careless kind of way, but saw no flour. I said, "I thought you told me you had so much flour here;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250024"></xptr>more lies; it is like the chairs, you have nothing but shavings;" he laughed and said they would come bye and bye.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there any place below where he could have flour besides where the oven was - A. No place whatever. On the Monday evening a friend supped with us, and went away about half-past ten o'clock - I lit my friend down stairs, and then the leather trunk, which was always at his bed side stood on the right hand counter with the lid up; I asked if he meant to fill it with money, as copper money was in it - he laughed, and made no answer. I said "This is not the way to get rich, you are selling two-penny cheese cakes for a half-penny," and I bought one; he said they were very stale, and he should bake fresh ones next day. I went up, sat down with my husband, and in quarter of an hour heard our dog growl; I said, "There is that wretch coming up stairs again" - our door was open, and he came into the room; Gibbs offered him some beer, he drank and looked round our room, and said what beautiful paintings we had - I said, "What makes you go up stairs in this manner of a night;" he said to see the comet, and went up. We went to bed about eleven o'clock, and were awoke by the screaming of the dog, and found the room in a black smother - I said, "Oh! God, what is the matter." Gibbs jumped out of bed, opened the door, and the flames came into the room; he shut the door immediately, sat down on the bed, and said, "Oh! dear we are lost." I heard the cracking of the fire all about me - we had a small bench in the room; he wrenched out one of the iron bars from the window, took me by the neck and shoulders, and dropped me on the tilings. The flames were then in the room. I went along the tilings, clung to the chimney, and with the help of my husband and the fireman got away by the back of the building, and with a ladder we got down.</p>
               <p>Q. When Gotte came to your room had he a candle - A. Yes, and carried it up to the garret a light. I took refuge at Pye's, in Shrewsbury-court. The gentlemen of the fire office came to me next day, and I gave them every particular. I saw no more of Gotte for six or seven years after, when I was walking in Holborn, and cast my eye on him just as I came to Dean-street - he saw me, and got among the people at a caricature shop, turned from me, and looked at the pictures in the window - Miss Ryder, (who is now dead,) was with me. I let go her arm, went up to him, and said, "You wretch, you are the wretch that set me on fire;" he turned round, and with his left elbow struck me on the breast, and said, "Bl - t you, you b - h," and got away - I fell down from the fright, was taken into a shop, and sent home in a coach. I did not see him again till Sunday morning, the 14th of May last, the day after a fire had happened in New-street, Covent-garden - he came into a public-house opposite to where the fire was, with a man, and asked for a box which he had left there the night before. I immediately caught hold of him, and said, "What Gotte, what another fire! what burnt out again!" he did not answer, but asked again in an agitated manner for his box; the people gave him a tin cannister, such as sweetmeats and nuts are kept in. I then turned him completely round, and said, "Do you know me? what another fire! what burnt out again!" he said, "Yes, Yes, I know you, Yes, I have lost every thing now." I got to the door, and as he came out, collared him, and said, "You once escaped from me, but now you shall not" - he said not a sentence till be got into the street, and then said, "You b - h, what do you hold me for?" I said, "I will let you know, for God's sake somebody come and help me; send for an officer, for he shall not go from me." I was surrounded by firemen, who said, "This is the man who was burnt out over the way." I said, "Get me an officer;" one came at last, and I gave him in charge of Davis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you live then - A. In Brick-lane, Whitechapel. Gibbs belongs to the East India Company's service, as he did then, but since January, 1812, till now he has been a Bow-street patrol. I believe I have always given the same account. I was examined two or three times at Bow-street, and believe all I said was taken down. I mentioned about the beautiful chairs to Mr. Richmond, the clerk of Bow-street, who was taking down my deposition, and also that he borrowed a hammer and chisel of me. It was between twelve and one o'clock in the day when I was down in his bake-house. I suppose we were awoke by the fire from a quarter past eleven to a quarter past twelve o'clock; he was in our room about a quarter to eleven. I went to lodge there quite by accident, and had no acquaintance with him before; he shewed me all the premises when I went to look at the lodging. I did not expect a fire, but thought he was a rogue, and was going to cheat the landlord of the rent and taxes. I know he had nothing in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the fire place in the back room stand in the road to the yard - A. Directly opposite it. The pail of water my husband had up stairs was to wash his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there in the back room on the Sunday - A. A window looks into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the front door, a great deal of light would come in - A. It might; I walked in gently, being fearful, nothing disturbed him - he was too intent on his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at that time Mrs. Gibbs - A. No; I have lived with Gibbs twelve years - I have been his wife eleven years. I was divorced from Mr. Atkinson by the Ecclesiastical Court, when I was about seventeen years of age; he died in December, 1811. I married Gibbs in August, 1812, having lived with him for twelve years before. I had not lived with Mr. Atkinson for fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met the prisoner in Holborn, the persons assembled heard you called a b - h, and saw you knocked down, but yet he got away - A. I do not know that they heard it. I fainted and saw nothing of him. I was examined in Pape's room the day after the trial. I do not know whether they took down what I said. I believe Sir

            . I am the husband of the last witness, and am a Bow-street patrol. In 1811, I was a labourer at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250025"></xptr>East India warehouse, and worked as a cabinet-maker. On Saturday the 7th of September. I went to lodge at the prisoner's house, in White-cross-street, the parlour behind the shop, had two or three old chairs and a table in it, the whole not worth above seven or eight shillings. I never saw his bed-room that I recollect. On the Saturday previous to Monday the 23d, I went to St. Alban's, returned on Sunday evening, and slept with my wife. I was absent all the next day, and came home between five and six o'clock - a friend supped with us, and left five or six minutes before eleven o'clock; Mrs. Gibbs let him out, and came up stairs; the prisoner came up in quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, our door was open, he came in, I asked him to drink with me, which he did, and went up saying he was going to see the comet. I went to bed directly, and about twelve o'clock, as I suppose, my wife awoke me, the dog was making a noise; I got up, opened the door, and the whole place was in flames, they were rushing from down stairs, and also descending from the garret. I shut the door directly and made my mind up to be burnt in the room, for I was almost suffocated in opening the door, but I had got a work-bench with only two legs to it, I put a leg between the bars, but it broke. I pulled out the other, and broke the bar down from the window; put Mrs. Gibbs out on some tiles; told her to keep to the left, which led to the brewery wall; followed her to a stack of chimneys; got on the wall, and escaped - no alarm was give to me from below. I heard no cry of fire, or anything till I found it myself. All my furniture was burnt. I saw the prisoner two or three mornings afterwards at the Eagle Office, but had no conversation with him. I heard him say he came for his money, the clerk told him, if he came any more about it, he should be taken up - he went out and I saw no more of him. The gentlemen had been and examined me and Mrs. Gibbs about it, before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did the clerk take down what you said - A. No; when we were at Pape's house, Mr. Rawlings was present and other gentlemen. I did not see them take anything down, my wife told them the man had nothing in the place, and there was no doubt but he had set it on fire, and told what she had seen. I was appointed a patrol about six months afterwards. I passed the house he lived in, in New-street, almost every night, but never saw him there, and did not know that he lived there. I never observed his name over the door. I looked about for him, but did not know where to find him - his shop in New-street has been often open till one o'clock at night, when I have passed.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSHALL. Q. You did not know that he resided in New-street, till after the fire there - A. No.</p>

            . I was in the Eagle Insurance Office in 1811. The gentlemen signing this policy were directors at that time - two of them are now dead. I witnessed it as being executed by them, but cannot swear that I saw it signed, as many are probably signed without my seeing it done; but they were invariably delivered to me by the directors, as their act and deed before I attest them, and as their seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I dare say a great many are executed in the course in the day - A. Yes. I am generally present, but I may occasionally be called out of the room. Forty or fifty are handed round to the Directors together, and they say, "I deliver these as my act and deed."</p>

            . I have known the prisoner since 1811. I believe the signatures to this affidavit and the schedule to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you often seen him write - A. Yes. I do not swear that it is his writing, but believe it to be.</p>
               <p>The documents referred to were here read - the policy was dated the 9th of September, 1811. Total amount insured 700. The schedule stated the loss and damage to be as under: -</p>
               <p>s. d.</p>
               <p>Household Furniture, Apparel, Watch, Trinkets, and Books, which were enumerated</p>
               <p>70 16 9</p>
               <p>Stock in trade, and fixtures 149 0 2</p>
               <p>Building oven and furnace 53 0 0</p>
               <p>Purchase of Lease eleven years and three quarters, 40 of which was paid in advance</p>
               <p>120 0 0</p>
               <p>392 16 11</p>
               <p>To this schedule was affixed an affidavit stating the schedule to be a correct statement of the property damaged and destroyed, and that 242 3 s. 3 d. was the just value of the same.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to MR. BEETHAM. Q. Is not the premium charged on the goods doubly hazardous - A. Yes. The affidavit was filled up at the office. The sum of 242 l. 3 s. 3 d. is a mistake since discovered. It is common for persons to insure to the amount they expect to have on their premises. They must prove the actual loss.</p>

            . I am a broker and butcher. In 1811. I lived at No. 197, White-cross-street. I did not know my next door neighbour. After the fire happened, I went to the Eagle Office, and saw a man there making a claim about the fire - I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. I went to look at the ruins the day after it happened - the back of the house was down; part of the floor was left in the first floor, and in the shop; I saw no remains of furniture. When the house was re-built I saw the oven, my belief is that it was not injured the least in the world - I could not see that either the oven or brick work were damaged. I claimed 40 l. of the office for damages, and received 30 l., and had the goods returned, which made up the demand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long after the fire did you see the oven - A. A year and a half or two years; when the ruins were removed.</p>

A man came to out house before the fire - he was a pastry-cook by what he said; it was the man who lived next door - I believe the prisoner to be the man, but cannot swear it; I had known him as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250026"></xptr>master of the house for about three months. He came and asked me to recommend him a washer-woman; this was the first week he came into the house, and always after that he brought his linen to me to be washed, and three or four days before the fire, he came, and said, "Here is my linen, Mrs. Stuck, but don't let me have them back on Saturday night as usual, but let them be till I send for them;" they were fetched by a lad, a week or a fortnight after the fire.

            . I am a baker and pastry-cook, and live in Little Russell-street, Drury-lane. I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years - he lived with me as journeyman in 1812 and 1813. I had several conversations with him about this fire; he told me it happened in consequence of the falling in of the oven; that he was awoke in the night by a noise like thieves breaking in, and when he opened the door, the fire was on the stairs; that he shut the door directly, and pulled his bedstead to pieces, took the post, and broke the iron bars from the window with it, and escaped. I used to urge him to prosecute his claim; he said he had a friend who was pursuing it. He did not tell me the amount.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He did not say he went to examine the oven, and found it had fallen in - A. No; he said the reason of the fire was the oven falling in.

He was arrested in my service, and took the benefit of the Lord's act.</p>

            . I am a fancy biscuit baker. I first knew the prisoner in 1808, and lived three years with him at Shadwell, and left him early in 1811 - he still lived at Shadwell. I then went to live with a different master in the same line. I saw him afterwards in a shop in Whitecross-street, and found he lived there; I called two or three times, and the fourth time that I called he shewed me his first floor back room, the parlour behind the shop, and the bake-house - this was two or three days before the fire. Seeing iron bars to his bed-room window, I said, "Gotte, your bed-room looks like a prison with these iron bars;" he said it did, that he intended to take out the two irons bars in case of fire, or an accident, for while a person was striving to take out those two iron bars he might be burnt to death. He shewed me the bake-house - the iron work of the oven was much superior to anything I had seen of the kind before, but not since. I do not recollect observing his furniture or property. His boy came to my lodging on the evening of the fire, in consequence of which I went to Gotte's, and believe I got there about ten o'clock he wanted me to sleep there all night, to help him complete an order to make biscuits and cakes. I said my health was indifferent, but agreed to stay - he got salmon for supper. We both went to bed together in about half an hour from the time I got there. I was awoke by a dog barking, and awoke him, and said, "Gotte, here are thieves, or something in the house?" he made no answer. I immediately heard something fall very heavy, and a dreadful cracking; I thought it was fire. I shook him again, and said, "Gotte, for God's sake get up, for the house is all on fire;" he made no answer. I immediately jumped out of bed, and he after me - he immediately opened the bedroom door, and said it was impossible for us to escape down stairs; the fire was raging up the stair-case. I was dreadfully alarmed, and asked him where the window was; he said it was close to me. I turned round, and perceived it, felt about, and found two iron bars on the left hand side, but on the right there were two missing - he said the casement would open, but in my fright I burst through the casement, and fell out on the wash-house, and got into the yard. I had scarcely recovered myself when he threw a trunk out of that window - he came out the same way as I did; he did not appear hurt. I saw an old door which lead into a court - I forced it open, and he made his appearance just then, and asked me to take hold of the end of the trunk, which I did, and we carried it somewhere, which I suppose to be Pape's. I never saw the trunk afterwards. I remained at the house about a quarter of an hour - I had nothing on but my shirt. Pape lent me shoes and a great coat. Gotte had something slightly about him, but what he had on I cannot say. I went back to the place about ten o'clock next morning, and saw him sitting at Pape's, talking to a fireman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you left the bed-room did you observe whether he did anything with the bedstead - A. He did not; he followed me almost directly. Nobody broke any of the bars out before I got out. I saw him in Whitecross-street a day or two afterwards; he said he had applied at the office for his insurance, but did not state any amount.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not live with him after the fire - A. I worked with him for three weeks in Round-court; I could have found him at any time if I had wanted. Shavings give a better heat to bake biscuits, particularly if the oven has been heated before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is September, when carpenters are at work, a better time to lay in shavings than Christmas - A. Yes; I was articled to him at Stepney, it was Gotte and Lambol. We eat our salmon on a table. I cannot say whether it was deal or mahogany. I do not recollect seeing above two or three chairs in that room, or any being in the bedroom - we both went to bed at the same time; from the difficulty I had to awake him, I have no doubt of his being really asleep. When he opened the door I saw flames coming up from below, but there were none coming down; a few minutes more would have been our certain destruction. I made a spring and got through the window easily, without squeezing; he came and staid at my father's for five or six weeks afterwards, and went to the ruins every day - we lived about three hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived with him in Round-court afterwards, was his name on the door - A. Yes, in a shabby manner; he went to New-street, nearly four years ago, the last time I saw the house, there was "Gotte pastry cook and confectioner," in large letters up, that was about twelve months ago; he had a good business there. I worked there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250027"></xptr>at times, and slept there; he had me and another man, and two apprentices. I was with him in New-street, about four months. I remember his employing one Gaskin an attorney to recover his claim. I lost my clothes at the fire, and never got a farthing allowed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ask him for any compensation for them - A. No; he said if he got his insurance he would make me a little. Gaskin called on me to ask a few questions about the fire. I do not know that any thing was done after that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the trunk in the chamber, where you slept - A. I believe it was; the bars were all up when I observed to him that he was living in a prison, they must have been removed afterwards - the trunk was not large. I think it was more than one man could carry - we were to get up at three o'clock in the morning to work - no preparation was necessary over night.</p>

            . I am a tin-plate worker, and live in Baldwin-street, City-road. I lived at the corner of Henry-street., and Old-street, in 1811, had dealings with the prisoner; he came to me soon after the fire, to say he had been to the office, and should soon get his money, and if any of the people applied to me from the office, to know what amount of goods he had had of me, I was to say to the amount of 50 l. I had not sold him goods to near that amount; the last time I sold him goods was in 1810, when he lived at Shadwell, and they were under 10 l., and that was all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did he never pay money for things, which you do not book - A. I never recollect it. I supplied him with 10 l. worth of goods in the course of two years - he generally paid by instalments - the utmost amount in my books against him is 6 l. or 7 l.; he had paid it at the time of the fire, they were utensils in trade. I told him, I would say no such thing, that I would examine my books and say what he had had.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner on liking as an apprentice, at Shadwell, in the early part of the summer of 1811, I remained with him five or six weeks - the premises were burnt down, and he went to live in a private house, near the Commercial-road. I also went to live with him in Whitecross-street. On the night of the fire, he told me he wished to see Saberton. I fetched him to the house that night, and I went home, being very young then, I wanted to get to my playmates, and he said "Well if you go home, Saberton shall sleep with me." I knew of no preparation for any order. I left between eight and ten o'clock; nothing had then been done to the oven. I returned next morning, and the house was burnt down. I saw Gotte in Shrewsbury-court, and asked how he escaped, he said he got out of his bed-room window. I asked if he was hurt, and I think he said not much. I asked how Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs escaped; he said he believed they were safe There was not much furniture in the house. There was a bed, bedstead, box and trunk, in the sleeping-room, as near as I recollect, and in the parlour, there might be six oldish chairs, with I think hair bottoms, there might be a little crockery. I never remember above one or two sacks of flour coming in; there might be a sack or two that night.</p>

I think there might be, 18 l. of furniture altogether, including stock, and every thing; 40 l. would cover the furniture, stock, coals, flour, and all the moveables. I was only fourteen years old at the time.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant. In 1811, I lived in White-cross-street. My attention was directed to the fire about eleven o'clock, when the alarm was given. I came out and could see nothing of it, I ran into Shrewsbury-court, went up, Pump-court, and met Mr. Gotte, coming out of his house by the back door, which led into Shrewsbury-court; he was then dressed, the same as I am now, and had a trunk about eighteen inches long in his hand. I said "For God's sake what is the matter, where is the fire, he said "Hush, hush." I stopped a moment or two, and saw the flames breaking out backwards, and Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs making there way out of the second floor window. I saw Gotte again in about a quarter of an hour, on the other side of White-cross-street, looking at the fire, with the same trunk in his hand, and dressed the same.</p>

            . I live in Shrewsbury-court, and did so when this fire happened, and was awoke by Mrs. Gibbs, calling for assistance. I dressed as fast as I could; ran down and found Gibbs not quite descended from the ladder; there was a strong thick black smoke. in the lower part of the house, I thought it was in flames, both at top and bottom, but did not think there was any burning in the centre. I saw the premises next day. Gibbs was collecting a few things that were partly burnt - the front part of the second floor was still standing, and the back burnt. I did not notice the first floor - the dog lay down dead in the shop. I afterwards saw the things dug out of the ruins. The iron bar which Gibbs wrenched off, was brought to me with several planes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You saw that the back was burnt - A. Yes. the back part of the first floor being built of wood was consumed. The brick work was standing.</p>

            . In 1811 I lived in White-cross-street, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250028"></xptr>the opposite side to the fire. I cannot now swear that the prisoner is the man who lived in the house, but the man who lived there came to my house at the time with a trunk, and said, Gibbs had got out; he had his breeches on, and I believe every thing else, but not buttoned.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to SABERTON. Q. You and the prisoner were in your shirts that night - A. Yes. I recollect going into no house but Pape's. I did not see Mrs. Brooks that night.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in a long written address, stated that he was utterly at a loss to account how the fire happened, unless occasioned by the oven - that he escaped in his shirt, with only a trifling article of dress and a box - that he certainly took up a plank by the side of the hearth, which was broken, but denied placing shavings there. Having no means of prosecuting his claim, he entered into Carmichael's service, and was arrested for the charges of erecting the oven - that for the last nine years he had lived in public situations, carrying on business with his name over the door. He denied telling Carmichael that he had forced the window bars away with the bed-post, and concluded by protesting his innocence.</p>

            . I keep the White Lion, public-house, Edgware; before I went there I kept the Marquis of Granby, public-house, in Bow-street. I know Mrs. Gibbs, and would not believe her on her oath.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Be kind enough to tell us why - A. She was at my house once when Randall stated that a person had come in for change for a sovereign. I looked into my till, and missed a crown piece and some silver, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why Randall, I have just taken a crown piece and some silver, and it is all gone." It was said that my wife (as they supposed, but meaning her) had taken it out of the till - Randall said, "That woman has got it, and is putting it into her right hand pocket;" I said, "Mrs. Gibbs, you have got it. Randall saw you put it in your pocket;" she said, "No, I have not got above a shilling." I insisted on seeing what she had - she pulled out a crown, a half-crown, some shillings, and sixpences, and the man who paid me the crown said, "I will take my oath that is the crown I paid you." Q. Why not prosecute her - A. Knowing her to be an officer's wife, and my house being dependant on the officers, I thought it best to tell her to leave my house, and not come there again - she said she was sure she had not done it, but I turned her out. I met her husband some time after, and told him of it, but he treated it very lightly indeed. I never saw the prisoner before to day.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Wilstead-street, Somer's Town; Mrs. Gibbs lived next door to me in 1812; I have known her ever since, and would not believe her on her oath.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Why not - A. In 1820 she abused my child in the street, and said I was a reputed thief; the child came and told me; I went to the door, and asked why she said so; she said I was a thief and a reputed thief, and her husband could prove it; and if so why not take me?</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in custody - A. Yes; at Bow-street, on a wrong charge, for receiving a mare knowing it to be stolen; I was confined from Tuesday to Friday, then discharged, and gave evidence here against the thief.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses appeared to the prisoner's character, and said that his name was over his door in New-street, in large letters.</p>

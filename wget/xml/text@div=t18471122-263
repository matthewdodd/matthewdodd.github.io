                  </hi> I am potman at the Prince of Wales, in Brixton. On 22nd Nov., I went with a female friend in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to White Hart Inn, in the Borough—the prisoner asked me to change my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I got into his—I had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, all but three farthing—he agreed to take me to Brixton for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said be would save the gate, and go round by the Wellington; but he weat through, and insisted on my paying the toll—when we got through ken<lb></lb>nington-gate, he came into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dabed</hi> against me, <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> me from one side to the other—I asked what he meant by it—he left a boy on the box to drive, and came inside—I missed my money—I spoke to him about it—he denied it, and punched my head—I said I would give him in charge, and told him to drive to the station, but he stopped on the way—I said I would go—we went there, and he denied it—he was searched, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him—no one had been near me but him—I had been half asleep and half awake—I did not ask him to go in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me—I asked what business he had there.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Redcross-court, Borough. I am out of employment—I worked for Mr. Cullum, driving a horse and cart—I cleaned horses in his stable—I know the prisoner—on 22nd Nov. I was with him—I never drove his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he never went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> until Bone got to his jour<lb></lb>ney's end, and then he woke him up—it was about two o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I went that distance with him, as I had nothing to do—on my oath did not drive the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on that or any other occasion—I do know his horse—the road was heavy—the prisoner let his horse walk, because he sweated.</p>

                  </hi>. On 20th January the prisoner came to my place of business in Rathbone Place, with a man who called himself Williams—I had never seen Williams before—I knew the prisoner by name—Williams said "Is Mr. Witt or Mr. Wilkinson here?"—I said "I am Mr. Witt, can I do any<lb></lb>thing for you?"—he said "Yes, I am a pianoforte manufacturer, and bring my foreman with me to select some goods"—that was how he introduced the prisoner—I asked him where he carried on his business—he said "No. 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway"—I asked where he was trading, and he said "Prin<lb></lb>cipally to Jersey"—he asked me to show him some goods—I took him down stairs to show him the goods, and he told his foreman (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>) to select the goods—ho spoke to him just as tradespeople do to their clerk—the prisoner looked out goods to the value of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said "Those will be the goods which I think will suit our purpose; now you go to my master and make the terms"—we went upstairs, and Williams said some<lb></lb>thing to the prisoner which I did not hear, and the prisoner went outside—Williams then said "I sent my foreman out, because it is not necessary that he should know all my transactions"—he then produced this bill, which he said was from one of his customers, and asked if I had any objection to take it—I said, if it was a good bill, I certainly should not have any objection totakeit"—(<hi rend="italic">The bill was for</hi> 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated London, December</hi> 29th, 1868, <hi rend="italic">at two months, drawn by Thomas Williams upon and accepted by T. and H. Montague, Bridge Wharf, Cambridge Heath Road, payable at the London and County Bank, Hackney Branch, and endorsed by Thomas Williams</hi>, 12, <hi rend="italic">Hornsey Street, Hornsey Road.</hi>)—Williams wrote the endorsement in my presence—he called the foreman in and told him to go and fetch the horse and cart, to get the goods at once, because the men were at home waiting for them—the prisoner said the horse and cart was in the City just at pre<lb></lb>sent—Williams told him to go and look after it—they then went away together; in the evening, the prisoner came back with a man who he said was the coachman, and the goods were taken away in the trap he brought with him—I asked the prisoner on that occasion how long he had been with Mr. Williams—he said from twelve to eighteen months, and that he had sixteen or eighteen men under him, in superintending the manufacturing department, making the pianos—he said Mr. Williams was a man of wealth,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010070"></xptr>
               <p>and had gone into the piano trade for speculation—I read him Williams's address, and asked him if that was right—he said "Yes, 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway"—I asked him whether the factory was in the house—he said "Yes," the front was a private house, but behind was the factory—he said that he had been a piano manufacturer himself for some years past but had failed, and that he worked for Mr. Kelly for some years on his own account—that I knew to be true—on the faith of those representations I allowed my goods to be taken away—I should not have allowed them to go if I had known the prisoner was not in the service of Williams, and if I had known this was a private house and no factory—Shelly's name itself influenced me in allowing them to go, knowing he had been in the trade—two days afterwards he came again, and brought me a letter, and said, "My master sent me with this letter"—it was in an envelope—he said, "My master sent me for some goods"—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28th January, 1869, 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway Road—Gentlemen, be pleased to deliver to bearer what goods he may require, and charge the same to my account. If you have not sold the plank veneers, I would like the lot at the same price, yours, &amp;c., Thomas Williams.")—The prisoner had looked out some plank veneers on the first occasion, and taken a part of them away—I was a little suspicious, and I asked him again about the position of Mr. Williams—he made the same remarks as before, that Mr. Williams was a man of some wealth, and went into the piano trade just for speculation—upon that I gave him some more goods, but to a very small amount, about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he wanted more, but I could not give him more—the fact of him being a foreman, and having eighteen men under him, was mentioned again—I sent my partner out with him, to ask him if the statements he had previously made were really correct—I went next day to 12, Hornsey Road—I found an old lady there—it was a private house—there was no factory, nor any in that road, nor were there any men at work there; nor any business carried on at all—I have not got any money for my goods—the bill became due on 3rd March, and was dishonoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Mr. Wilkinson present during the conversation you had with Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my clerk, Elliott, was—the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed—I have not said that I believe the pri<lb></lb>soner did not intend to act dishonestly towards us, nor any words to that effect—I don't remember any statement of the kind—I have known Mr. Betts since the prisoner was in custody—he produced himself as bail for him at the Police Court, and I have seen him here—I have not stated to him, that in my opinion the prisoner did not intend to act dishonestly in the matter—he stated it to me—he said, "He did not believe Shelley acted dishonestly towards us, but that he was led away by Williams—I did not agree with him in any way—I did not say that was my opinion—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not appear the worse for liquor when he came; that I remember—I have not said so—my partner saw him on the second occasion, not on the first—I knew the prisoner before, by name, as a pianoforte maker—I only knew him by name, I never knew him personally—I should think a trades-man would know a man who has gone through the Bankruptcy Court—he did not say that he had worked at Mr. Kelly's—he said he had worked for him when he was in business for himself—I did not know the name of Williams before—I had a Directory on my premises—after the goods were delivered I looked in it to see if the address Williams gave was correct—it was not in the Directory, but I had only got the one for 1867—I believed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010071"></xptr>
               <p>that Williams was a pianoforte maker, upon the prisoner's representations—I knew the prisoner had been a bankrupt, but if a tradesman fails and then goes as foreman, it has a very honest look—I know now that the prisoner was at work for Mr. Perry, a pianoforte maker, at 72, New North Road—I did not know it before this—it was not on the supposition that the bill was a good one, that I agreed to supply the goods—it was on the prisoner's repre<lb></lb>sentations—it was about 3 in the afternoon when Williams and the prisoner called first, and between 6 and 7 when the prisoner called for the goods—Williams called the prisoner his foreman in his presence, he introduced him as his foreman—I should think he heard Williams give the address, 12, Hornsey Street; if he did not hear it I showed it to him after Williams gave it—if the prisoner had given every facility to the police, we should have found Williams in the first instance.</p>

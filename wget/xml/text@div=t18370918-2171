                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Daniel Loveday, a pawnbroker, in St. Alban's-place, Edgeware-road. Between eight and nine o'clock on the night of the 13th of September, I saw the prisoner with another person in the shop—the prisoner pawned a seal with me, and asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I lent him half-a-crown—the other man stood behind him, and was in his company—I finished writing the duplicate, and as they went out I heard a snatch at the door—I ran out, and saw a cloak on the pavement—it had been pulled down—the prisoner was standing outside the shop quietly—he had left me before it was snatched down—he had not time to get further, as I ran round immediately—the foreman told him he had a great mind to give him into custody—he said it was not him, and walked away—he was afterwards brought back by the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner—I saw the foreman of the shop and the prisoner standing there—he said he had a great mind to give him into custody for stealing the cloak—the prisoner walked very fast across the road up Earl-street, and I thought I saw something bulging out at his back—I told the foreman to see if he missed any thing else—I ran after the prisoner, and under his jacket found the sheet tucked up, he was holding the jacket over it to cover it—I took him back to the house—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., an eye-glass, two snuff-boxes, and a purse were found on him.</p>

I had come from Paddington—I went into the Hollybush public-house, near Mr. Loveday's, and was drinking there with two or three more coachmen—two men and a woman stood talking, and one man had a sheet and a wrapper, as he termed it, in hit hand—he said, "Will you buy this, old man?"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "A sheet and wrapper"—I said, "What do you want for it?"—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and said, "I have not sufficient money, I will go home and see what I have got"—I went over to the shop, and had the sheet in my jacket pocket—I pledged the seal there—I went back, and was standing by the Olive Branch, the constable came and said, "You have got other property?"—I said, "I have not, I bought it"—they took me into the shop, and gave me in charge—while I was standing outside the shop the cloak was pulled down on the pavement—the young man was outside before me—I had the sheet in my possession when I went into the shop—I had had it a quarter of an hour.</p>

On the 26th of January last, the prisoner came to our house soon after nine o'clock in the evening, and asked for a night's lodging, we told him he might have a bed; he went out for a short time, and returned again, and staid in the house; at eleven o'clock my servant shewed him up to bed. Sometime after he had been up stairs my daughter gave the alarm, and called for a light, the maid took up the candle, and I saw the prisoner come down stairs directly. I was in the bar, it was about a quarter of an hour after he had gone up. I took up my candle and followed him, he made towards the door, Pugh, the hostler, came up to him, and told him he had got a great coat on that belonged to a gentleman's servant, Pugh pulled it off. The prisoner was secured. I had no knowledge of him before.</p>

When I pulled the coat off, I saw he had got another coat on, that belonged to Mr. Tarbuck, who was gone to bed in our house. Mr. Mand came down and assisted me. On taking the prisoner into the kitchen, we took Tarbuck's coat off; we also took off a hat and a pair of shoes, which were Tarbuck's. I then fetched Dean, the constable, who found a purse, containing four 1l. bank notes, and a quantity of silver on him; there were two handkerchiefs and other things, found upon him, that belonged to Tarbuck.</p>

I had a purse, containing four 1l. notes, one shilling, which was French, and, I believe, four sixpences, in my breeches pocket. I am not certain whether there were three or four sixpences. I had fourteen or fifteen shillings in my other pocket.

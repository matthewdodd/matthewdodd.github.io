Oh my way to the countess of Morton's house, I was passing up Park street, that is the street that lady Morton's house is in; when I came to the turning, before I came to lady Morton's house, which is <placeName id="t18081130-45-crimeloc257">Chapel street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether Cavill was one of the men - A. I had not a fair sight of them; I cannot say, I saw the other men.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time was this - A. A little after six; I walked about lady Morton's house, unobserved by them, and just as it got dusk I got into the house; where Jackson, another officer, was waiting for me; Budgel came in immediately after that along with my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jackson in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. What did you do when you got in the house - A. Jackson shewed me down in the lower part of the house, and we shut ourselves into a room; directly behind the door that comes from the area into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that door was fastened - A. That Jackson will tell you; I did not see myself; I had a light in a dark lanthorn; we remained there for about an hour or a little better.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Butcher in the house at this time - A. I believe not; she was gone out I believe by Jackson's directions. After remaining there for an hour or a little better, there was a loud knock at the street door; that not being answered, in a little time after there was a louder knock; every thing then was quiet for a while, as much as ten minutes, and then I heard the area gate unlock at last, as if somebody had unlocked it; then in a minute or two after the gate was unlocked I heard some person come down the area stairs; some one attempted to unlock the area door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish the voices of any one - A. Not at this time; they for a length of time tried several keys; I could hear them change the keys, take one keys and change it for another, and put them in the area door that leads into the house; they were trying with the keys for about twenty minutes, and then some one who seemed to be standing upon the top of the area steps in the street, called out to the one who was below, damn you send it in; the one below answered, then hand me down the jemmy.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a slang phrase for an iron crow - A. It is one of the phrases that they have for it among many others. Somebody then came down the area steps; I heard the crow put it into the door and they began to wrench at it from without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door at last forced - A. Yes, after some trouble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then they began to wrench the door - A. Yes; the door then began to crack very loud, and a bell that was behind it rang, upon which they stopped a little; they then gave several other heavy wrenches, upon which the door burst and flew open. As soon as the bell was quiet they came into the passage, and one that came in called out to the others it is all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe whose voice it was - A. I cannot undertake to swear positively; I knew Starkey very well at that time, I do think it was him; I thought so then, and do now. I knew his voice, I do not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You knew Starkey very well before that - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell how many persons entered the house - A. As near as I could judge four; they said to each other, now go on and get a light; I heard them all go up stairs and walk about over my head; I had pulled my boots off before that, as any noise over the house was heard all about; I stood so very near where they were breaking in that as soon as I heard them up stairs, I went up after them; the light I had, I found from the heat of the lanthorn had melted away, they being so long getting in, was quite out. As soon as I got into the hall up stairs, I saw a light in the back parlour; it is a very large parlour, half as big as this court; I immediately ran into the room, I saw three men in one corner of the room, the further corner from me, and one near the fire place, whom I instantly seized hold of by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. I cannot tell whether it was any of the prisoners at the bar; there was plenty of light, but the moment I entered the room, the moment I seized him, the light went out; there were two lights, I think; there was a good deal of light; I held this man and said something to him to stand still that he would be shot, or something of that; instead of which he pulled from me trying to get to the other men, I suppose for a second; he struck me on the beak, he put both his hands against my breast and drove me very forcibly away; I only had hold of him with my left hand, and I had my cutlass in my right hand; so with his forcing in this way he drove me towards the place where I had seen the other prisoners; there I heard a sound as I thought of an iron crow striking against the wainscoat close by me; I suspected that they were striking at me in the dark, I trusted to my judgment; upon which I drew one of my pocket pistols and fired at the place where I heard the noise; I called out to the other officers to make haste and get a light; I followed them up afterwards by the light that come into a place about as big as this place where I now stand, into a little passage; I afterwards found, though I did not know then, there were four of them and me in this little place. I was the outside one; I laid hold of some one and they pushed me out of the passage into the room again; there were iron shutters as I afterwards found; I was in the dark, I could not find my way after them; I heard a door break open; at that instant Jackson, or some of the other officers, brought me a light; I then saw which way they went; I followed them, and found that they had broke out at the back of the house, on the leads of the kitchen, the platform that covers the kitchen. As soon as I got there with the light, I saw the prisoner Starkey on the wall; I saw him on the coping of the back office; there is a short side wall that adjoins the dwelling house to the back office; he had got up from the yard, he was just rising upon his knee upon the back office; there was another man on the side wall; he had a coat on such as Cavill has on now, but I did not see him so as to speak to his person; I saw that they were escaping into Park lane, I immediately ran round to there.</p>
               <p>COURT. These part of the premises adjoin Park<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300034"></xptr>lane - A. They go into Park lane. When I got round into Park lane I found the prisoner Starkey sitting on the bank on the foot path; there is a bank there that passes under the wall; I thought at first he had been shot, and said to him, Starkey, have you been shot.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him very well - A. I knew him very well; I said, Starkey, what have you been shot; he said, that is not my name.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you saw, had his name been Starkey - A. Yes, but he is commonly called Atkins as well as Starkey; I suppose that is what he meaned by saying his name was not Starkey; he said, no, I am not shot, my leg is broke.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then sitting down - A. Yes. I asked him how that happened: he said, as he was passing along under the wall a gentleman had jumped off it upon him and broke his leg, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Are you sure that was the man who was upon the wall, who was upon the platform adjoining the house - A. I have no doubt of it. The man I saw in Park lane I had seen on the coping, on his knee, rising.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then take him in custody - A. I did. There was another officer, Budgel, with me, I desired him to take him down Park lane; I believe Budgell ran up Park lane with me; he and some of the people took him back to the house; I found none of them besides; I returned to the house where they had carried Starkey; I went to the back premises then where these things had happened, upon the platform, there I found this iron crow just under the place where I saw Starkey going over the top of the wall, and half a dozen skeleton keys. I found a piece of green wax taper in the back parlour where I had seen the men; and on the leads I found a piece of cotton candle. I saw a great quantity of blood in the passage, and the ball of the pistol sticking in the door among the iron work, and a man's hat lying in the blood. I searched all the back premises to see if I could find any body that had been wounded. It was so very dark that we could not see any thing; there are trees planted at the back of the house; I could not see any one. They had sent somebody with Starkey to the watchhouse and to the infirmary to have his leg set; the watchhouse and infirmary is part of the house altogether. As soon as I saw the house was taken care of I went to the watchhouse myself; I had not been there but a few minutes before some other person brought in Lasper, and we stripped him immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you ever seen him before - A. I saw him in Park lane, but I did not see him in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. In what state was Lasper when he was brought in - A. He had been shot through the thick part of the left arm; I took him to the infirmary likewise to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was O'Brien the man that brought Laspar to the watchhouse - A. He was; his name is Owen O'Brien. They were secured. The next morning I went to see the house by day light. When I went into the back of the house I saw that the person who had been wounded in the room, had ran, after the door had been opened, to that part of the wall where I saw Starkey on; he did not get up there.</p>
               <p>Q. That you traced by the blood - A. Yes, by the blood; he had gone from that corner to the other corner of the yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Towards Park lane do you mean - A. No; to the other side of the yard, to a flew: it seemed to me to be a flew that runs from nothing at the bottom to the upper part of the wall; he got up there and jumped over into the next garden; there, from the quantity of blood there was, he seemed to have stopped a short time; from there he had gone on to the leads of the office of the next house, and from there along the spiked wall, to within a few yards of South street in Park lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. This you traced by the blood - A. Yes, by the blood; it was not in drops but in a sort of a stream almost all the way. I tried these skeleton keys to see if they would unlock any part of the house, and this skeleton key unlocked the area gate, and none of the others would unlock the area door. Then I matched the crow to the breaks on the door, and it so completely matched as to enable me to say that crow broke open the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure that it was the crow that wrenched open the door - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was Cavill apprehended - A. Understanding that Cavill was one of the men that was there, I left information at Bow street, and the other officers, that if they saw such a man he should be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Cavill before - A. I had not. I had seen such a man with such a coat on, but not so as to enable me to speak to him. By my information at Bow street he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he wounded at all - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. You are an officer of Marlborough street - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You know in this case there is a reward - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a large reward for three persons - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You was about this house some time before - A. I was, the night before, watching about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from any information you received - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood a robbery was to be committed - A. If the information I received was correct there could be no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.You had an information - you went in the house expecting that a robbery would be committed - A. I certainly did.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew what was to take place - A That I could not know; I expected that they would attempt to break open the house, but I could not tell what would take place.</p>
               <p>Q. The servant was sent out of the house - A. That I understood was the case; but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the house was entirely in the possession of yourself and your brother officers - A. Entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that you saw some persons about there the night before, but you do not know that either of them were any of the prisoners - A. No, not the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the house you say you saw two of the prisoners in Park lane - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Which of the two prisoners did you see in Park lane - A. Starkey and Lasper and three others, but I had not the sight of their faces so as to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Park lane is a place pretty well frequented - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300035"></xptr>Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing extraordinary in them being together there - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. They were some time breaking in - the persons who got in - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up with a light - A. I had no light.</p>
               <p>Q. The first opportunity you had of seeing them was when you got in the large parlour - A. That was the first time, then I did not distinguish any of them; the light was at that instant out.</p>
               <p>Q. And during the whole time they were in the parlour together with you, you had no opportunity of distinguishing their persons - A. Not any; they said nothing, so that I had no opportunity of knowing their voices.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could not speak to their persons nor their voices at that time - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. The men got away at the back of the house - A. Yes; in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man on the coping - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It was dark then - A. No; I had a candle alight then. I was about as far from him, or a little further, than from to you.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a common candle, it did not throw a large glare of light like a dark lanthorn - A. Certainly not; I had a view of him for a second, only as soon as he could get from his knee.</p>
               <p>Q. Excepting the light of this small candle it was very dark - A. As dark as could be, the moon had not got up above the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in the parlour with the light they were near to you at that time - A. No, they were some distance.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an instant when you was in the room when there was a light - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but an instant that you saw a person getting over, which you thought was Starkey - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards went round Park lane, there you saw Starkey - A. Yes; there I saw Starkey.</p>
               <p>Q. You accosted him by the name of Starkey, he said that was not his name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he goes by the name of Atkins - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you said before that he said his name was not Starkey - A. He knew me very well, he could not go and tell me his name was not Starkey only for that reason.</p>
               <p>Q. He said some gentleman had jumped off the wall and broke his leg - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the persons who had got away had jumped off that wall - A. No doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of lady Morton's house with respect to the furniture - A. There was a great deal there I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not in a state for the reception of the family - A. Certainly not; all the carpets were folded up; the house was not ready for the family.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the servant was the only person there before you went there - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time these persons broke in you were the only persons in possession of the house - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. On the day before the robbery you could not identify the persons that were standing about the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But on the evening of the robbery you could - A. I did; I saw five persons standing at the corner of Park lane by the post, in conversation, as I was passing on to lady Morton's house, and two of these five were Starkey and Lasper.</p>
               <p>Q. The state of lady Morton's house was as the house of any lady or gentleman would be when they are absent - A. Yes. This is the catch and the lock of the door that was broken off.</p>

               <p>Q. You went on the 3d and 4th of October in company with Foy - A. Yes. On the 3d we saw nobody that night, we went all about the street. On the 4th, at half past twelve at night, we were facing lady Morton's house, we saw five men come up towards the area gate; I stopped there; and three went to the front door and then they walked away; when the watch and the patrol were coming down the street they separated, some went one way and some another, and after waiting in the house till about two o'clock I went out to speak to the watchmen, and they said they had seen five suspicious characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these five men you had seen that night - A. I did not know them then; I had known Starkey many years.</p>
               <p>Q. When next did you go to lady Morton's house - A. About a quarter before six in the evening on the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body in your way there - A. I did not, I went to lady Morton's house, and I told the servant that I was an officer of Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it necessary to advise her to go out of the house - A. After that.</p>
               <p>COURT. You went into the house did not you - A. Yes, I did. I saw her lock the door in Park lane first and take care of the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened all the outside doors - A. Yes. I went up stairs when she was in the house, there came a knock at the door; I did not hear the name that was asked for, I retired because I would not be seen; Mrs. Butcher went to the door; for half an hour after this she could not go out, nor could I get the other constables in, because they were about the street then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, Jackson, after you came in did Mrs. Butcher go out - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be when she left the house - A. Near seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did Foy come in - A. Foy and all the officers came in before she went out; Foy was the first, then Budgell and

            . We all went down stairs into a room at the front of the house adjoining the area; there we waited some time before we heard any thing, and after some time came a knock at the door; after that, some time, came a louder knock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go to the door - A. Nobody went to the door. Then some time after they knocked harder, and after waiting some time I heard a key go into the area gate; they opened it very easy, they waited some time and came down into the area, they tried several keys for some length of time, and none of the keys appeared to open the area door; we plainly heard somebody say send it in or force it in, or something of that sort. One said, hand down the jemmy. They then made a violent force at the door, the bell that was affixed to the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300036"></xptr>very loud; they waited some time before they tried the door again; then the next try the door flew open with force, the bell rang violently again; after that one of them says, come in it is all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say how many persons entered - A. No; by their feet and their voices there appeared to be three or four; they said go on, get a light; we were without our shoes. Then Foy and the rest of us went up stairs, we all went up in the dark; Foy went first. When I was in the hall I could perceive the light; before I got into the parlour door the light was quite out; then I fixed myself in the door way leading from the parlour into the hall to prevent any of them from returning back; there I continued till the light appeared at the back of the house. I could not tell what part they were in. Then I followed Foy into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed where the light appeared - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you saw Foy - A. I did. I saw one of the prisoners just rising off the coping: it was in a direction where Starkey lay; I could not tell Starkey at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a man - A. I saw a man just rising from the roof of the back office facing Park lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. He was rising from where - A. From the leads; he got up upon the wall, he was upon his knee when I saw him, and he ran straight forward, he jumped over the spiked wall to the place where Starkey was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the wall next Park lane - A. Yes. Then Foy and Budgell ran round; in the passage that leads to the yard, inside of the house, there was a hat laying among the blood. I went into the house to fasten the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow the track of that blood - A. Afterwards I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how that blood came there - A. I suppose Foy wounded some of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. While you were at the door to prevent any of them from returning, did you hear any sound of a pistol - A. That was before I came there; there were two pistols fired in the yard; one in a direction for Starkey.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it you saw these two pistols fired - A. When we got in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. One in a direction for Starkey you said - A. Yes, in a straight line in the direction where he run; the other more to the left; that is all I saw of them then, till Starkey was brought round.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it before Starkey was brought down - A. In about two minutes he was brought down. Foy and Budgell went round, and they with other persons brought him round into the hall.</p>
               <p>Q.What condition was he in - A. His leg was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to say when he was brought in that he was the same man that you saw on the platform - A. I saw not his face then; I have no doubt but he was the same man that went in that direction, but I will not say he is the man. Then he was taken to the infirmary in Mount street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. The watchhouse and infirmary join together - A. Yes. In returning from the house, up Mount street I met Lasper, being brought to the infirmary with his arm bleeding, in the custody of O'Brien and another; when he was brought in the watchhouse I searched him, to see if he had any thing about him; I found nothing but a knife and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with Foy when he compared the keys with the door - A. I do not recollect that I was. I saw the crow compared.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the next morning to the house - A. We went and examined the place, and we traced the blood round the garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. You know there is a reward - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with an expectation that a robbery was to be committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw some persons lurking about the house - you did not take the persons up who were lurking about the house - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not quite so good a thing taking up suspicious persons lurking about the house - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.You, the officers, were the only persons in the house at the time when they came in - A. We were.</p>
               <p>Q. When the persons were in the house you did not see any of them - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The only opportunity you had of seeing any person was in the yard - A. Not in the yard; upon the wall, with their back towards the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. The wall is some little distance from the house - A. Not a great distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in the yard and saw some person upon the wall - a pistol was fired at that person, whoever that person was, in a direction to that person - whether it hit him you cannot say - A Yes, I can; it was about four inches below where that person was. I picked the ball up.</p>

               <p>Q. Another pistol was fired - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me two pistols were fired, one against the man on the wall and the other to the left; now take care, you have accounted for one, by saying one missed - whether the man upon the wall was Starkey you cannot say - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not there when Foy took out the ball in the parlour - A. I believe the ball is in the door or window shutter now.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey is the man that has got his leg broke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey was not shot - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Starkey, or Lasper, or the other person there - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say who the person were - A. I cannot say, I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you go there - A. It might be six o'clock, as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons near the house - A. Foy went a little before me; just as we come to the corner of Chapel street, I saw five men standing at the corner of Park lane in Chapel street, about fifty yards from lady Moreton's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in conversation together - A. I could not bear them; they appeared as such, they stood close together. I saw Starkey and Cavill.</p>

I am positive upon seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300037"></xptr>them there: I gave a sign to Foy, he walked on and went to the countess of Morton's house and went in; I followed him; Cavill was behind me following of me, I do not know whether he knew me or not; I turned down South street to the left; he turned down Park street again and went on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing - A. When he passed he looked up at the countess's house, he then went into Chapel street again; then I observed he came round a second time; he was so near to me that I was obligated to go down a mews in Chapel street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you - A. He must have known me, because I have seen him in custody at the office; then he went round again on the opposite side of the countess's house; and then I went into the countess's house, were Foy and Jackson were; I went down with Foy and Jackson, and Foy's brother, into the room next the area.</p>
               <p>Q. We hear that the men broke in, did you see either of the men in the house so as to know their persons - A. I saw Starkey in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the yard that the back parlour led into - A. It was; the back parlour led into the yard by a door; there is a kind of a platform there; there is a kind of a washhouse in the yard; I ran out of the back parlour into the yard with a candle in my hand alight; Starkey was exactly facing the door, then, getting up the platform, he jumped off where the spikes were; he either jumped or dropped, he went towards the further wall where the spikes were; I have no doubt of it being Starkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the other prisoners there - A. I did not; I saw a man drop to the left, I could not say who it was; there were some trees I went round with Foy; he took Chapel street I took South street; there was not a soul passed; I found Starkey sitting with his leg up; I said Starkey, is it you; he said no; I said I am positive it is; he said my name is not Starkey.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course nearer to the wall than you - A. When I came in the yard I went up to Foy; we were as near as possible together; I did not know Foy was in the yard till I came in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular either on the 3d or 4th of October at lady Morton's house - A. On Saturday, the 1st of October last, about eleven o'clock at night, going from the pay table into Park street just turning the corner of Chapel street, I saw four men opposite of the house that I lodge in, standing at the door of lady Steward's steps, opposite of lady Morton's house; I then passed my own door and went to the top of Park street, the corner of South street, and then I crossed the road and came down and passed the four men, who were on the top of the steps; I then saw one whom I knew, of the name of Cavill; I knew Cavill by working with him in Bridge street, Blackfriar's road; I then went down into Chapel street again, and at that time the watchman was calling past twelve o'clock. On the 4th of October I saw him at the Bleeding Hart, Drury lane; I went in there in consequence of knowing Cavill resorted to this house; there I saw Starkey, Lasper, and Cavill, and a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person474">Jack</persName>
             the Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain that they were the men you saw there - A. I am; they were in company together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation pass between them - A. Yes; I heard them appoint the time that they were to meet, this Cavill did.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he say - A. This was about six o'clock in the evening, he did not say where he was to meet; they were to meet at nine o'clock on that evening, the Tuesday evening, and they were to do the trick at eleven o'clock; this was on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand them it was to be eleven that night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Do not repeat what you understood, but what they said - A. They said they were to meet at nine o'clock and do the trick at eleven o'clock that evening; I then proceeded immediately to Marlborough street and gave information; I acquainted one of the officers with it, and I told him to be at my place by nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprised the officers, did they come to your house that night - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they watch in your house - A. Yes; I put them in the front parlour of the house that I lodged in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remain watching with them - A. I remained in the parlour with the officers. We stopped in the parlour till about half past twelve; there came five men up to lady Morton's door; four of them went up to the steps of the door; Cavill then crossed away and left them, and came under our window where we were, on the opposite side of the way, to watch them; Cavill was smoking a pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of distinguishing that it was the prisoner Cavill - A. I knew his face perfectly well; at the time he had a red waistcoat on. Then the watchman was coming his half hour, calling half an hour after twelve o'clock; they all dispersed, I saw no more of them that evening. On Wednesday the 5th I went to the Bleeding Hart again; I saw Cavill there, Lasper, Starkey, and 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person475">Jack</persName>
             the Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. Between one and two in the afternoon; Cavill then said I will go and see after so and so, see if the tools are all ready; that is the expression he used; he came back again: I remained there till he returned: he went out and came back again in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lasper, Starkey, and 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person476">Jack</persName>
             the Baker remain there - A. Yes; they were in the house when he returned; he said it was all right, we are to meet at five o'clock, and I will be down to the house by six o'clock. I then came down to Marlborough street again, and left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the house they were to go to - A. To lady Morton's, they mentioned the number, they said 228, Park street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the number of lady Morton's house - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that said this - A. Cavill. Then I went away; I came from Marlborough street and acquainted the young woman of the house of it. I stopped in the house with her till the officers came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any knock at the door come while you were in the house - A. Yes; about twenty minutes before six, as near as I can say, while I was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who answered the door - A. The young woman. I went up to the door and opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the door who did you see - A. I saw Lasper come up to the door; he asked if general Douglas lived there; the young woman answered no, no such person lived there. This Cavill was then standing behind him upon the pavement; only Lasper was on the steps; Cavill was on the foot path.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner Cavill - A. I am sure of it, because I saw him between the hinges of the door, I knew him before; they then went away and the door was shut. This was between five and six o'clock on the 5th of October. In a short time afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300039"></xptr>I went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me when next you saw the prisoner Cavill - A. When I went out of the house and came round South street, I saw the five men together. On the same evening, the 5th of October, I saw them in South street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to lady Morton's house - A. Just about three houses off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the men at the bar there at that time - A. Yes, all three.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this - A. I then kept back of one side till an opportunity suited; I kept on the watch; I saw Starkey and Lasper go to the gate, and Starkey opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to see what he opened it with - A. I could not see that; I saw him open it with some kind of instrument, it rattled. After he had opened it some persons came past and they went away towards Chapel street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did they come back - A. They were a considerable time; people came backwards and forwards; I believe it might be half an hour. Starkey and Lasper went down the area steps, and another person with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Starkey and Lasper you are certain of - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other person - A. Jem Britten his name is, he is one of the five. Cavill then stood at the bottom of Chapel street along with 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person477">Jack</persName>
             the Baker, and after some considerable time, when I supposed they had got the door open, one of them said it is all right, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it - A. I do not know, it was dusky. Then immediately Cavill left 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person478">Jack</persName>
             the Baker and went down the area steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eye upon the area steps all the time - A. Yes. 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person479">Jack</persName>
             the Baker went into Park lane at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cavill return - A. No; I waited at the front of the house till I heard the report of the pistol, and till Mr. Foy came out; when Foy came out 
               <persName id="t18081130-45-person480">Jack</persName>
             the Baker was coming round from Park lane into Park street to the front of the house; seeing Foy then he ran away into Park lane again.</p>

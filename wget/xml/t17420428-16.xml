She ask'd me some Questions, and then we agreed to go in and drink. She call'd for a Quartern of Gin, and after that, for a Pint of Hot, and then we went into another Room, where we stood pretty close together, and so she got the Money from me, and whipp'd out of the House. I immediately felt for my Purse, but it was gone, and I then cry'd Stop her! Stop her! but nobody did. I being a Countryman, did not know what to do, but this Gentleman, the Constable, went with me to the Justice, and got a Warrant, and came back to the House where I lost my Money. The Landlady pretended she did not know the Prisoner, and so we made further Enquiry after her, and found her about an Hour afterwards in the Vinegar Fields, and 25 s. 6 d. upon her. I am certain I had my Purse when I went into the Prisoner's Company, and as soon as she went out, I miss'd it.</p>
               <p>- Bunch. I was Officer in this Affair. The Prosecutor came to me, and said he had been robbed over the Way, upon which I went over with him, and accus'd the Woman of the House, and ask'd her, how she could give Liberty for such Doings; she said, she knew nothing of the Prisoner, but I threatning to take her before a Justice, she confess'd the Prisoner was her Sister. Then we got a Warrant, and took the Prisoner. I ask'd her how she could be guilty of so vile a Thing, and she said, she had but 9 s. of the Man's Money; and that was given her for Favours.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280014"></xptr> However I brought her away, and upon searching her, I found 24 s. 6 d. in her Pocket, which she could give no Account of: - The Money was stuck together with Yolks of Eggs in her Pocket.</p>
               <p>- Davis. I have known the Prisoner these six Months, and better, and never have seen any Ill by her, but I have heard. - She has a very ill Character here, but I can give her none. <rs id="t17420428-16-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

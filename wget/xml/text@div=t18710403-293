On Saturday evening, 4th March, about 7 o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate Street Without—I saw the prisoner cross from Sun Street into Widegate Street—he had this cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under his arm—he walked up the road sharp, and when he turned into Widegate Street he began to run—I ran after him—he slipped and fell, and I caught him—I asked where he got the cloth from, and he said he bought it from Mr. Isaacs, his master, in Finsbury, and was going to take it to a tailor's in Aldgate—the cloth was unrolled, and I told him it looked very suspicious—he said "I met a friend coming across the street, I showed him the cloth, and I forgot to roll it up again, I can't stop to talk to you any more"—I told him he would have to go to the station with me—he said "I will see you b—first"—we both fell—I struggled, and he gave me a violent blow at the left side of my nose—we had another struggle, and both fell again—on regaining our feet, he gave me a violent blow on the right eye, and then he made his escape—there were 9 1/2 yards of cloth—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the following Monday, between 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon, in Keate Street, Spitalfields—I told him I should take him on suspicion of being the man who assaulted one of the City constables—he said "Very well; I will go with you, but I know nothing about it."</p>

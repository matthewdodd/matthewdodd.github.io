                  </hi>. I live in Maps—row, Stepney—green. On the 5th of July I was employed by the Society for the Suppression of Vice, to go to the shop of Mr. Ward, No. 103, Strand—before I went I was searched at the Society's chambers, by police—sergeant Chadwick, to see that I had no prints about me—Chadwick afterwards accompanied me to No. 103, Strand—he remained outside—when I got there I saw the defendant, and purchased the two prints now produced, of him, personally for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the two—when I came out I accompanied Chadwick to the Society's chambers in Lincoln's inn—fields, "where Chad<lb></lb>wick marked the prints as well as me—on the 9th of July I went again—I was searched as before, by Chadwick—I bought the print now in my hand—I have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for it—I produced that to the officer on coming out—I went to fhe chambers, and marked it as I did the others this second purchase was not made of the defendant, but of a person in the shop was serving behind the counter—I have seen him several times serving in the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that by direction of the society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was desired to ascertain whether such things were sold there or not—he showed me something more curious—(that was the first or second time I spoke of it,) and I bought it—the greater part of the Wandering Jew was bought after the sale of the prints.</p>

               <p>and produced a portfolio with eighty or ninety in it—they were French prints—I saw the eighty or ninety prints afterwards in possession of the Custom-house officers, who had seized them under a warrant issued by the Commissioners of Customs—I never bought any prints of him or anybody except by direction of the society—whether the prisoner is convicted oar acquitted will make no difference as to the amount I am paid—I did not use any inducement or persuasion for him to procure them, but merely asked if he had such for sale—I never induce parties to sell them.</p>

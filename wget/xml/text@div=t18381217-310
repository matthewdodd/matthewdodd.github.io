                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in West-street. On the 6th of December I saw my coat safe on a block, near the door, about half an hour before it was takes—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the afternoon of the 6th of December I saw the prisoner passing backwards and for<lb></lb>wards seven or eight times, looking in at the door—at last I saw him unbutton the coat, which was on a block inside the shop door, and take it off—I ran out and caught hold of him with it in his possession—he was in the act of giving it to another person, who, when he saw me, ran away and threw it on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had scalded wet at the time, and could not run—I never had the coat—when he took me I told him that was the man who ran along there. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I am confident the prisoner is the man who took it off the block—I was watching him all the time going backwards and forwards—he walked quite expertly—he did not appear to me to he lame—the coat was about fourteen inches from the sill of the door—I was about two yards inside myself, and saw his face several times—I got ready to run out the moment he snatched it—I don't think he saw me—he was not two yards from the door when I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. W. COPE</hi>, (governor of Newgate.) I saw the prisoner when he came into prison, and drew the doctor's attention to him in consequence of his being lame, and he immediately ordered him into the infirmary—he could walk, but very badly—the officer took hold of his arm coming up the steps of the prison to assist him, but he would have greater difficulty in getting up the steps than in walking.</p>

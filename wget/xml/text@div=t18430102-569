                  </hi>. I am a pensioner at Greenwich-hospital. On the 22nd of Dec., I went to the prisoner's house in King-street, Deptford, about ten o'clock in the evening—I was a little <hi rend="italic">half-seas-over</hi>, and was taken there by a female—I sat smoking and drinking till three in the morning, in the pri<lb></lb>soner's kitchen—I then went to bed with Charlotte Dunn—the next morning we got up and had some breakfast—after that I was brushing my coat, and brushed my gold wedding-ring off my finger—they got me a light, and the prisoner, his wife, his servant, and myself, searched for it, but could not find it—Dunn did not move off her chair—she said, "You old fool, you are looking for your ring, when he has got it"—I afterwards left the house, be<lb></lb>cause the prisoner, his wife, and servant threatened to beat Dunn's brains out for charging him with the robbery—before I left the house I said to the prisoner, "If you find the ring, will you bring it to the College?"—after that I got information from Dunn—in consequence of that I went back to the house with an officer, and had the prisoner taken into custody—I asked whe<lb></lb>ther the ring was found—he said no.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Greenwich. On Thursday night, the 22nd, I went to the prisoner's house with the prosecutor—I staid there with him, and went to bed with him—the next morning he was brush<lb></lb>ing his clothes, and brushed the ring off his finger—I saw it on the floor, and the prisoner picked it up—they all looked for the ring, but I did not—I said the prisoner had it—I went away after the prosecutor, and returned with him and a policeman—I told him the same as I had before—I bad a duplicate of the ring, and sold it to the prosecutor.</p>

            , shewing her for sale; I owned it; he said he bought it of John Tubbs, and fetched me a witness to prove he bought it; I took her home, and she is in Smithfield now; I know her by a remarkable spot on the off side about as big as a crown-piece, two white heels, and a C star in her forehead, her colour black; I had her about a fortnight before I lost her; I can swear to her; Sharp has had a fall from a horse, and cannot attend.</p>

               <p>JOHN TUBBS sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Harrison, at the Castle and Falcon, in Aldersgate-street, and bought the mare of the prisoner on Tuesday, the 14th of June, in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I thought it would suit a waggoner, and gave 3l. 10s. I thought it was so trifling an affair, I asked no questions; I sold it to Sharp, a publican, in Little Britain, about an hour after I bought it; I was taken into custody on account of it; I saw the mare again when I was in custody, but I cannot swear to it; it looked like the same I bought.</p>

               <p>JOHN KIRBY sworn. - I am horsekeeper at the Castle and Falcon, and was going down Angel-street, and saw the prisoner, on the 14th of June, about three minutes after nine in the morning, stooping down rubbing the mare's legs, but I did not see Tubbs with her; I saw her again at Guildhall on Friday, and am sure it was the same black mare, with a star in her forehead; Tubbs was taken to Guildhall on Friday, when I saw the mare which I had seen in the prisoner's possession; Sharp took Tubbs into custody for the mare.</p>

               <p>DANIEL GRAHAM sworn. - On the 17th of June I saw Sharp, who said he was charged with having a stolen mare; I went with him and the prosecutor, and took Tubbs into custody, of whom he bought it; I asked him to give up who he had the mare from; he told me, and I attended Smithfield, and next morning the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GODDARD sworn. - I am a constable; I saw Tubbs in trouble, and, knowing him, I interfered; I found the prisoner was coming into the neighbourhood on Saturday, and I went and took him in Angel-street; he asked why he was a prisoner; I told him, and he denied it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never sold the property, or had it in my possession.</p>

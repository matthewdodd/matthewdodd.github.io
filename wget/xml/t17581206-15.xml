            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The prisoner and another man came into our shop; he ask'd to see a good strong pair of shoes; be fitted on a pair; and said, he thought they were rather to short; I show'd him a pair longer; he fitted them on; I ask'd him 5 s. 6 d. for them, then I bated 3 pence; at their going out of the door, I told them they should have them for 5 shillings; they went away, and in about a quarter of an hour after, they both came in together again; the prisoner ask'd me for the shoes he had been about; and said, he was come to give me earnest for them; I had a suspicion of the other man at his first coming in; while I was turning towards the shoes the other man snatch'd a pair of shoes from out of window, and run away; I said to the prisoner, that man has stole a pair of shoes; he said, he knew nothing of the man, and push'd out into the street; I followed him into the court, and call'd stop thief; he turned about and said, what do you stop me for; I said, you have brought a man that has stole a pair of shoes; the neighbours came and secured him, and we took him before justice St Laurance.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. When you call'd stop thief, whether I did not stand still?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He turn'd about and said as I mention'd</p>

            . I saw the prisoner stopt; he laugh'd, and made a sneer at it; when he was before the justice, he said, he did not value what they could do to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into that shop to buy a pair of shoes; I had but 4 s. 6 d. about me, so could not pay for them all at once. As I went in a man follow'd me, he did not belong to me, I know nothing at all of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did they seem to be both acquainted when they came into the shop?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, they did: while this man fitted them, on the other said, they will do very well, they are good strong shoes; they convers'd and pass'd there opinions together about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out together?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come in together the second time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Covent-garden market. On the 27th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw both the pri<lb></lb>soners together under the Piazza, and then in Russell-street, talking to<lb></lb>gether—that was from forty to sixty yards from Stevens's cart—I saw Manning leave Bishop and go to Stevens's cart—I saw Manning barter with Stevens, and give him something, and Stevens returned something to Manning—I went and asked Stevens what money he had given him—he said a half-crown—I got this half-crown (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) from Stevens—it is a bad one—I took Manning, he was discharged on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bishop. Q.</hi> Why did not you mention before the Magistrate that I was with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said there was another person, I did not know your name then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Manning. Q.</hi> Was there another officer with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—Morgan, the other officer, knew them.</p>

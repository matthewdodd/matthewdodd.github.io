               <p>Court.

               <p>Did you know who that man was? - It was not Wilson; I really believe it was the prisoner, but he had not on that coat, he had on a drab-coloured coat; I picked him out at Justice Blackborow's from a number, I suppose there were fifteen or sixteen; I said, if that was the man he had not on the same coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You never saw the prisoner at the bar before? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I suppose you know very well, that that man stands there for his life? - Yes; he was rather a short man.</p>
               <p>There are many men of the same size. - I never saw him again till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>You say you was too far distant to see what was thrown over? - I mentioned to my patrol, and said I believed it to be plate; it was the glittering made me believe it was plate; I gave information at the time they were taken to my patrol; I told him to look into the Charter-house Garden; the things were found the next day in the Charter-house Garden; I saw the prisoner at Mr. Blackborow's, I went there to see whether it was him.</p>
               <p>Who took you there to see him? - I had orders from that gentleman that stands there.</p>
               <p>Who shewed the man to you? - The prisoner stood at what I suppose they call the bar; it struck me that I knew him; I hesitated in my mind.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Blackborow; here are three tops of castors, two tea-spoons, and two salt-spoons, what I had from Weedon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have a drab coat here; I cannot say I found it in the room of the prisoner; I knew the prisoner lived there, by a private information; we apprehended him last Friday morning in bed, in Union-street; that was where the coat was found, on the same floor with the other; it is a common lodging-house, I believe; at the time we apprehended him, he asked who sent us to him; I told him that was a question I could not answer him; he said, it was my business to keep out of the way; I do not blame you for taking me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Then, if I understand you right, you had been at two places after this man at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was told he lived there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you found a drab-coloured coat in the next room to where he was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Neave. This is like the coat.</p>
               <p>Mrs. MYERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Goswell-street; the prisoner and some other person took some apartments of me; nobody lived in my house at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner live there? - They took some apartments; the prisoner and another person one Frost, and two women.</p>
               <p>Who lived with them then? - Two ladies that used to lodge in my house; it was an empty house; I have several houses that I used to let out in apartments.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in your house besides this man and Frost? - I never let any other apartments to any other men but them; the prisoner was never in my house afterwards; they left it some time in March, about the time; I do not know where they went to; I never was here before; the gentleman's name at the bar is Stewart; they were recommended to me as smuglers.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with a direction from the magistrates to the house of Mrs. Combrune at Hackney, and I tried this iron crow to the places which had been wrenched; this was found on Wilson; every part of the door that had been forced, the large part of the crow fitted; I applied it to the part that had been forced of the window of the garden; I found that fitted likewise; in the parlour there was a brass lock, the box of which had been forced off, and left a large impression; the small end of this crow exactly fitted that; I apprehended the prisoner on Friday morning last, over the water; he said it was his business to get out of the way, and ours to take him; I was present at the Justice's, when Mr. Neave picked him out from all the rest.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing that could distinguish him from all the rest? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What are you, Sir? - I am a constable of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>He had nothing on to distinguish him from other persons? - No, he was set at the bar.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the spoons; one of them is marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Do you know the spoons otherwise than by the letter upon them? - One has no letter.</p>
               <p>Do you know them by any thing but by their general appearance? - I think they are mine.</p>

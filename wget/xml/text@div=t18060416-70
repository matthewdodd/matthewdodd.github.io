               <p>Q. What room was she to have, - A. A garret,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160068"></xptr>for which she was to pay three shillings a week; she took possession of the room on the 21st, I gave her warning to go away the week she came, and she was to go at the end of the second week; when she was about ten days in my house, she went away with the key, and locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion, did you break the door open to see if any thing was missing. - A. I did, I missed a pair of sheets a blanket, and a pillow; she paid me one weeks rent before she went away; she told me that she was widow of Mr. Murry, a captain of a man of war who was deceased she was married again, she was obliged to keep herself quiet for fear she should loose her salary.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your sheets or your blanket. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- BRADLEY sworn. I conduct the business for my father, No. 71, Anchor and Hope alley, St. George's in the East; the prisoner at the bar pawned one sheet on the 24th of January, and one on the 25th, and on the 26th she pawned the pillow; I gave her four shillings and three pence for them together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (to Bradley) I told you they were not mine. - A. You called afterwards, and wanted to take them out, I detained them, because the prosecutrix had called, and said they were her's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last January I went to the prosecutor's house, being in little distress, I took this garret, I was to pay the rent weekly, when my week was due I asked them if they would take my money monthly, the answer was if it was sure they would; there was an old neighbour of mine that came to see me, and I was with her for three weeks; I went to the India House to receive my money, I then went to Mr. Bradley's to get the sheets, I told him they were not mine, I was going to return them to the people where I lodge, and pay my rent; Mr. Bradley said he must send for an officer, the pawnbroker knew me for many years.</p>

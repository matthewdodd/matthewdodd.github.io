I lost this money on Tuesday morning, the 5th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock; I saw it safe on Saturday night; I was not out of the house from then till Monday morning - the money was in a little box in my bed-room, at the foot of the bed, with many more odd things; there were two half-sovereigns, a 5s. piece, two half-crowns, nine shillings, and a 5l. Bank note - I do not know the number of it; it had two or three names on the back of it, but I do not know the names - I missed it on Tuesday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock; I know the prisoner - she has been in my house several times; she saw me receive the 5l. note, and said at the time, "I wish this was mine" - I said, "I must save it to buy some more pigs;" I had sold my pigs to a butcher- she is fourteen years old, and used to come to fetch errands for me; I went out on the Monday morning, and locked up every thing - there was a pane of glass broken large enough for her to get through - I suppose she got through there, if she stole the money.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. On Monday, between ten and eleven o'clock, she came to me, and brought a 5l. Bank note; I looked at the back of it - there were two names on the back which I could not make out; she also brought two half-sovereigns, and 19s. in silver - there were two half-crowns and odd shillings, but I did not notice a crown-piece; she told me she was acquainted with several girls of the town, and they had made a gathering for her, that the 5l. note and halfsovereigns belonged to a girl of the town, named

I know the prisoner - she came to me at Kensington on Tuesday night, and asked me to go with her to buy a frock in town; I went to town with her, in company with Conner, and she changed a 5l. note at a shop, for two shawls and a silk handkerchief; Conner took the change - we were coming back: I saw a Policeman - Conner said, "There are two Policemen coming - I am afraid you did not get this money honestly, and am afraid they will take me - I will chuck these three sovereigns away;" I saw him stoop, but do not know whether he threw them away - the prisoner afterwards said to him,"Why did you not give them to me, and I would have put them into my shoe?" he said, "If I had given them to you it would have been as bad as having them myself;" she cried, and said she should get murdered, for it had been given to her to get changed by Cusa - I went with her and her aunt that day, and bought a frock and some stockings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do all you could to keep his hand fast? - A. Yes, I did; I still held him fast by the hand, and collared him with my other hand; then another man came to his assitance to rescue him from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that other man? - A. No, I do not; the other man laid hold of me and tried to pull me from him; I threw the prisoner on the ground, and kept fast hold of him; they shoved me down, and while I was down I recived a violent blow on my cheek, which is swelled now; there were then two more besides the prisoner; I was afraid they would use me worse, and I let the prisoner loose.</p>

               <p>Q.There were a great number of persons about? - A. There were only the prisoner and those two men near me, they went away together among the crowd, my month was full of blood, and Mr. Williams came up to me, I pointed out the prisoner to him, and told him he had robbed me; the prisoner had not then gone more than three or four yards; then some more people came up who said they would assist me in taking him; I went up to the crowd to see if I could see him, but I had lost fight of him; Mr. Williams then saw several people at one hundred yards distance, or it might be two hundred, and said there he is going off the common now; Mr. Williams and I and two or three more went after him, and when he saw us coming after him, he began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you when he began to run? - A. One hundred yards or better, we followed after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those who were with him run too?-A.Some of them did, and one endeavoured to stop Mr. Williams, and said let him go, let him go; we passed them and pursued the prisoner, who was then running alone. I lost fight of him, and did not know which way he was gone, Mr. Williams and another were before me when I had lost fight of him; I went home, and having been home about half an hour, a person came from Queen-square to let me know the prisoner was taken; I went to Queen-square, and there I saw the prisoner, he was examined before the Justice; he had been searched but nothing found upon him.</p>

             sworn. On the 27th of November last, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a scuffle between the prosecutor and the prisoner. I know his person perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known him before? - A. Not before that day. I went up to Mr. Bartlett and asked him what was the matter, his mouth was bleeding at the time the prisoner got out of Mr. Bartlett's hands, and rushed into the crowd of people. I then looked round, and saw a corporal of the guards; I said, corporal, call up your men, here are pickpockets here; upon that I saw the prisoner and four or five more, going off from the mob on the other side of us, making the best of their way off. I said to Bartlett there he goes, he was then a hundred yards, or perhaps a hundred and fifty yards, from the prisoner; the prisoner seeing me observe him, immediately began to run and left the other behind him; French and I immediately went off in pursuit of him; we ran after him and cried stop thief; several of those who were in company with him, ran with us and said no! no! let him go; till at last we ran too fast for them, and got into Horseferry-road, the prisoner was a good distance a-head of us; we halloaed out stop thief, the prisoner halloaed out no! no! it is for a bastard child, let me go. I was then got foremost, and several people who had got hold of him let him go. I still continued in pursuit till I got down to Abingdon-street; and just in turning a corner to get out of the way he turned into a public-house; I ran into the house, and French went down the stable-yard; I found him in the parlour; I was in the house in less than half a minute after him; I laid hold of him, and continued my hold, till I sent to Queen-square for Mr. Blys he came and took him into custody, and then we sent for Mr. Bartlett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not upon the green twenty minutes after the prosecutor lost his watch-chain? - A. No, I don't think it was more than five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>- FRENCH sworn. - I joined in pursuit of the prisoner with Mr. Williams; I lost fight of him at the corner of Milbank-street, I did not see him go into the public-house, I ran down the stable yard, while Mr. Willaims went into the house; I afterwards went into the house and found the prisoner and Mr. William in the parlour; he was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to see this race, there was a great multitude of people; I was standing before the prosecutor, there were a great number of people round him, and a man in a blue coat snatched the watch chain from him and ran away; he charged me with it, I told him I had not got it, and he let me go; I was walking about there for twenty minutes, and then some people said they were coming to duck me, and I said, rather than be ducked, I would run away, and I did run away; I was in the public-house where I was taken twenty minutes before they came in.</p>

I was walking with the prosecutor - somebody trod on my heel, about a yard on this side of Ely-place; I turned round, and saw the prisoner and another walking abreast; both separated when they saw me turn round, the prisoner went up Ely-place, and the other up Holborn- I asked Hurley if he had lost any thing; he felt, and missed his handkerchief - we pursued the prisoner, both hallooing Stop thief! he ran past the passage leading to Hatton-garden, turned to go round again, and was stopped - I picked the handkerchief up in the passage, a very little way from Ely-place: he was stopped not above two yards from the passage; when he was stopped he said he had not seen the handkerchief - nobody but him could have dropped it.</p>

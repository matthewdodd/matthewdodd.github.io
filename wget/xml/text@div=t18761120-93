                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Wilson, a waiter, living at 18, Leopold Street, Vauxhall—on the 11th September a person named Ellen Smith or Sloper died at my house at 2 o'clock in the morning—she had been a lodger at my house since the 21st August—she occupied the ante<lb></lb>room at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; one room—she took the name of Mrs. Smith—when she came she brought a child with her, about six months old—she re<lb></lb>mained there continuously until she died—the prisoner used to visit her—I do not remember exactly the date when he first came, but it was some day in the first week—he did not come very often—he called himself Mr. Smith and he called her Mrs. Smith—on the 3rd September he came about 8.30 in the evening, and they were both together in her room—she had been in good health up to that time; she had no vomiting or sickness whatever—she went about her work as usual—the prisoner remained that night until 9.30—I was not with them; they were together alone in her room—when he went away she came down, knocked at my door, and said she had been very sick and bad—the prisoner was not present. (Mr. Fulton <hi rend="italic">objected to anything stated in the prisoner's absence, but</hi> Mr. Justice Denman <hi rend="italic">considered the evidence admissible so far as it was in the nature of. a complaint or a declaration accompanying an act</hi>.) I asked her what was the matter; she said it was the sarsaparilla water that he had given her—I think this was about half an hour after he had gone; about 10 o'clock—she felt weak and hardly able to stand; she appeared to be very nervous and shaky, as if she should faint—I never observed her in that condition before—I persuaded her to go to the street door, which she did for a short time and she then came in and went upstairs—before I went to bed I went up to see her; she was then retching very heavily; she was sitting upon a chair; I did not remain with her—that was all I noticed on that occasion—next morning, Monday, she came downstairs about 9 o'clock and she looked very bad and white, and was compelled to balance herself against the wall, she could not stand—she said that she had been very bad all night—she got better during the day—I did not see the prisoner again till the 10th—I think he was</p>

               <p>there on the Saturday, but I did not see him—I saw him on Sunday the 10th; he came about 8.30 in the evening—the deceased was then at the street-door talking to me, with the baby—she appeared in perfect health then—they went upstairs into her room, and about 9.30 the prisoner came and knocked at my door and said his wife had had two fits—I ran upstairs and found her lying across the bed with her head towards the door and her feet towards the window—the prisoner went up with me—she was in a kind of fit or convulsion—I sent the prisoner for water and brandy—she became a little conscious, and I went to touch her and she clutched me by the dress and said "Don't touch me! don't touch me!"—she had been unconscious—after that the moment she was touched she continually went into these convulsions—her teeth and hands were clenched and she was drawn per<lb></lb>fectly backwards; her back was a perfect arch—she was not conscious then—it was as much as the prisoner could do to hold her each time—he was holding her all the time—this continued from the time I went up until I sent for the doctor, which was about 10.30—he came directly and the prisoner with him—Mr. Miller was the doctor—the prisoner brought him from Tyre Street—when he came he looked at her; she was slightly conscious then—we applied hot flannels and mustard poultices—I did that myself—the doctor remained with her about five minutes, and Smith went with him then for a bottle of medicine—the doctor did nothing to her, only held her legs up while I put the plasters on—I saw her legs and feet at that time, they were perfectly white, and looked to me dead—her toes were drawn under, a little backwards like to the soles of her feet—the doctor told me to put hot flannels to her calves—it did not seem to do her any good—I ad<lb></lb>ministered <hi rend="italic">two</hi> draughts of medicine to her—she could not take it easily—she did not seem able to swallow; she went off into convulsions directly and bit the spoon—at the time she had these dreadful convulsions Smith was holding her—one dreadful one she had, and it took me and the prisoner to hold her; that was when her head seemed to be drawn perfectly backwards as if her neck would have been broken, and her back was perfectly arched—she became a little conscious after that—she said it was the nasty sarsa<lb></lb>parilla that made her like this—the prisoner said "Oh! no! I have taken more of it than you have "—he said he had given her two pills and taken two himself—then she complained of a dreadful pain in her heart; she continued unconscious then, a little at times she came to herself but very slightly—then she continued on in these convulsions until she died—she had fearful convulsions when the prisoner was holding her—she died at 2 o'clock; at that time she was perfectly drawn backwards the same as before—I was attempting to hold her—the prisoner was holding her all the time, and in one of the convulsions I and the prisoner had to hold her, and it was as much as we could do to keep her in the bed—she did not die when I was holding her; the prisoner was holding her then—she seemed to drop instantly after the dreadful convulsions—I gave her two dozes of the medicine that the doctor sent—I had not seen any sarsaparilla in her room, nor any bottle—there was no bottle left there after that night—Mr.—Smith, the coroner's officer, searched the room—the prisoner went away about 7 o'clock in the morning, and said he was going to telegraph down the line for somebody to be put on in his place—he came back in about half an hour, I think, and remained there I think until I sent him for the undertaker, which must have been about 11 or 12 o'clock—the coroner's officer took away the bottle of medicine which the doctor had sent, and also a pill-box from the</p>

               <p>mantelpiece, I had not seen that box before the prisoner came—the prisoner remained at my house that night until quite late in the evening—he used to give the money to the deceased to pay for the lodging, and she paid me—she said he gave it her; he paid me a week's rent himself on the Monday that she died—there was one pill left in the box—the coroner's officer took it away—when the prisoner went away that evening he said that he was going to his cousins at Clapham Junction—he came back about 8.30, I think—I asked him if his cousin was going to take the child—he said "Yes," and at 10.30 I dressed the child and gave it into the prisoner's arms in my kitchen, and he took it away—I had put the sucking bottle into his pocket full of milk—I followed him through the passage. (Mb. Beasley <hi rend="italic">proposed to ask when the witness saw the child again</hi>. Mr. Fulton <hi rend="italic">objected, as it might give rise to certain inferences prejudical to the prisoners in ike decision of the present case</hi>. Mr. Justice Denman <hi rend="italic">considered it admissible as tending to throw light on the conduct and motives of the prisoner</hi>.) I next saw the child on Friday, the 15th, at a public-house in Battersea—it was then dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not known the deceased previous to the 21st August; he was quite a stranger to me, I saw her occasionally during the time she was with me—she would come down, say "Good morning," and so on; nothing more—she was in perfect health, she never complained—the prisoner visited her on several occasions, I never noticed anything quarrel-some between them—I was never in their room, nor heard them talking together—I never heard quarrelsome disturbances between them; I think I mentioned before the Magistrate about her complaining of the sarsaparilla on the 3rd; I am sure I did—she said it to me at the door—she got quite well again after that and in her usual health—when I was called in on the 10th, I did not notice her eyes particularly; she had them closed when in these convulsions, the same as they were when she died, I did not hold her hand at all during the convulsions—I did not notice whether they were cold or clammy—her convulsions were so strong it was impossible to hold her—I was a good deal disturbed in my mind to see her suffer so; her breathing seemed very hard, and she clutched her throat at one time and said she should be choked—her breath was almost suspended—her teeth were per<lb></lb>fectly clenched except when she was a little conscious, when she spoke; they were perfectly tight; a perfect fixture; as well as her hands; perfectly clenched—I did not particularly notice gnashing of the teeth, only the clenching of them, when in convulsions—I was' so excited, having the baby at the same time—after she died, round her mouth was perfectly black, when she had not been dead more than about two hours or so—I did not notice any froth or foaming about her mouth before her death—she wanted to be sick on one occasion and she could not—she repeated that on several occa<lb></lb>sions; she evidently felt very sick and the prisoner tried to move her to be sick, and then she went off in convulsions the moment she was touched—in the morning after her death her face and the side of her nose was very much swollen like soap-suds blown out of a tobacco pipe—I kept saying to the prisoner "Whatever is the matter with her 1 how she does suffer; the poor thing"—he said "Yes; she does "—he appeared to be distressed, but not so much as you would think—he sat on the side of the bed and held her the whole time, acting kindly towards her to every appearance—I sent for the doctor at 2 o'clock when she died; he did not say that night what she died of—from 9.30 till 2 she was partly conscious, and partly unconscious;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200153"></xptr>
               <p>but more unconscious than conscious—at one time she appeared to be quite conscious and to understand what was going on—that must have been about 12 o'clock or 12.30 as near as I can recollect—she spoke, and seemed as if she wanted to move; she tried to move herself and said that she would try and move to sec if she could be sick—she got up and put her hand to the end of the bed<lb></lb>stead to catch hold of it; after that she was a little conscious for some<lb></lb>time; not long; and then she went off into these fearful convulsions again—she was unconscious most of the time, and she was unconscious at the time of her death—Mr. Miller came about 10.30, and he came again when the prisoner went for him, after she died; about 2.15 I think—on the first occasion when he came he asked the deceased about her symptoms—she was a little conscious then—I do not recollect that he put any question to me—I told him that she had had some fearful fits, as I thought they were—I cannot recollect whether or not I mentioned to him about the arching-; I think I did; I cannot positively recollect whether I did—there was none of that while he was there; only her feet were turned when he looked at her toes—I do not think her back was arched so much at that time the doctor saw her—I told the doctor of the dreadful shaking, that she shook so fearfully—I might have mentioned about the arching to the doctor; I have some idea that I did—the body was bent back in the form of a bow—I had never seen anything of that kind before; it struck me as a most remarkable circumstance, I thought they were strong fits; I had no idea of. anything else—I cannot positively say whether or not I did mention, the arching of the body to the doctor; I might not in my agitation, having the mother and the child to attend to; but I know I said about the convulsions—I mentioned the arching the first—time I was examined before the Magistrate—the under<lb></lb>taker was sent for and came—the prisoner was there at the time—he never came to bury her—he left the body at my place—he promised to come and bury her on Wednesday the 12th—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was at my place—she was taken from my house after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, after the inquest, that was on Tuesday, the 19th—I did not know that she died from strychnine—I had not heard from anybody that she had died from poisoning by strychnine—I had no idea but that she had died from fits—I think the first one that said that the symptoms I gave was poisoning by strychnine was the coroner's officer—I think he said it when I said the symptoms—he did not put any questions to me in particular; nothing con<lb></lb>cerning the death—I gave the account to Dr. Lees on the Sunday after, when he came to my house—that must have been the 17th, he was the first person—the coronor's officer came first and searched the room—I told him about the symptoms before I told Dr. Lees—I think he came on the Thurs<lb></lb>day and I gave him the symptoms; I thought you meant, did I tell strangers? I told the coroner's officer the symptoms of the death of the woman; and then he said "There is every appearance of dying by strychnine"—that was on the Thursday when he searched the room in the evening—he did not ask me the nature of the symptoms—I told him how she died and I told him of the arching—I was not asked, was there any arching—I gave a descrip<lb></lb>tion of the woman's death to him, and also to Dr. Lees on the Sunday—I had no conversation with anyone afterwards until I saw Dr. Lees on the Sunday—I never mentioned it to anyone out of doors—I mentioned it to no one except the coroner's officer—I had no conversation with my neighbours about it; nothing of the sort—I did not speak about the arching or' the dreadful convulsions to my neighbours; I do not gossip—the deceased was</p>

               <p>a sober, quiet, inoffensive woman, about 24 years of age—I do not know whether sarsaparilla is very much taken by people in her class; I never took any myself—the prisoner said he always had it by him; he always kept it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 30, Brunei Street, Vauxhall—it is a dis<lb></lb>pensary—I am medical assistant to Mr. T. B.

               <p>the course of my practice—I do not remember more than one—that may be about twelve months ago—the symptoms I then observed were very similar to the symptoms which I noticed in this woman—I know nothing about strychnine poisoning beyond what I have read; I cannot say that I was fully acquainted with the symptoms of poisoning by strychnine at the time I saw the woman—I knew that arching of the body was one of the striking symptoms of poisoning by strychnine—if that had been mentioned to me it would have led me to change my opinion of the diagnosis of the case—I saw her immediately after death, and placed my hand on the heart to see whether life was extinct, or not—there was no arching at that time—I did not notice any marked rigidity of the body, nothing more than the usual rigidity which accompanies death—if the body had been in any peculiar form I think I should have noticed it if it had been there—she was clothed; her clothes about the breast were undone—she had not gone to bed; she was lying in her clothes on the bed—if there had any marked rigidity of the body, I think I should have observed it; as a matter of fact I did not—the hands were partly closed—there was no other marked symptoms of rigidity about the body—I should imagine that I saw her about a quarter of an hour after her death.</p>

On Monday the 4th, she complained of being sick; she got better and went on all right through the week On Sunday, the 10th, he came at 8.30; she was at home. They went to their room; at 9.30 he came down to the landlady and said his wife had had two fits, and asked her to come up. She went up and found her on the bed dressed; she was then conscious. In a few minutes she went into another fit. 'She complained of a curious feeling in her feet and legs. Gave her some brandy; he fetched it; she got better. He went and fetched the doctor from the dispensary in Bury Street. He came. She was better then, shaking, but conscious, and pains in her feet and legs. He applied mustard to her legs, then hot flannels, and gave her some medicine. After that she was in and out of fits till she died, at 2 o'clock in the night, on the 11th September. She was there all the time. The husband remained till Monday night and left there at 10.30 or 11 o'clock, takingthechildwith him, tellingthelandlord he wasgoing to Clapham Junction to his cousins. She has not seen him since." I am sure she did not describe to me any arching back of the body—I said to her that it appeared like a case of strychnia—I said that only from matters that I had heard and read' that there is continually convulsions—that was a matter that I thought it was a symptom of, from what I have read—I had hold of the idea at the time from the continuous convulsions—that was all, nothing else.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I reside at 112, Walworth Road—I first saw the deceased on Monday, 18th September, in her coffin, at 18, Leopold Street—I made <hi rend="italic">a post-mortem</hi> examination that day, Dr. Lewis, a friend of mine, who I had asked to assist me, was present, he is here—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—the body was much decomposed—there was no morbid appearance to indicate death from natural causes—the limbs were somewhat rigid, the body was that of a woman fairly nourished, the stomach exhibited no traces of irritant poisoning, it contained, about 6 oz. of thin brownish fluid—that was all that it contained that was obvious to the senses—I removed the stomach together with its contents, and put it in a glass stop<lb></lb>pered bottle, and a portion of the viscera I put in another jar—I received from the police-sergeant Hazell five bottles and a packet of brown powder, on 19th September, the day of the inquest, and a bag containing Fullers earth—I saw a box produced at the inquest containing one or two pills, I can't say which, they were never in my possession—one of the bottles was a 6 oz. bottle, containing a few ounces of good sarsaparilla, it was about one third full—there was another bottle of the same size labelled sarsaparilla; that was empty, it had been recently rinsed out with water, it was practically clean—I say recently rinsed out because the inside was so clean and moist, the bottle was still wet; had it been rinsed out weeks previously it would have become dry—there were a few drops of water at the bottom, just a layer of water, just as much as would remain after being rinsed out, that was my impression—this bottle (No. 9), was one of the bottles; that con<lb></lb>tained about 2 grs. of dry refuse, dry powder, adhering to the bottom and sides of the bottle—I am not by profession an analytical chemist—I added these ingredients to the water, 2 dchms. of spirits of wins, 30 drops of hydrochloric acid, and a sufficient quantity of liquor potassae to render it alkaline—I grain of dry powder would be in bulk about as much as would equal a grain of wheat—I wrote on a slip of paper what the ingredients were that I added and stuck it on the bottle, and it is there now—my purpose in adding these ingredients was that I suspected that it might contain strychnine, and I commenced to test for strychnine, to separate it if it was present; but my proceedings were cut short by a visit from Inspector Easter, requesting me to give him the bottles to take to Dr. Bernays—the bottle then contained the dry refuse, plus the substances marked on the label—I corked it up and gave it to the inspector in that condition; what I had done up to that time did not enable me to form an opinion, because I had not separated the strychnine, it would probably have taken me a day with other duties, to have completed it, I should have left it to settle and had it chloroformed—I analysed a portion of the contents of one bottle, No. 3, a 2 oz. phial; that was the same day I handed it over to the constable—I tested two portions of it; I had completed my observations of that bottle before I gave it to the constable, when I received it it contained 1/2 a dchm. of a reddish brown fluid, 1/2 a dchm. would be 30 drops, 1/2 a teaspoonfull—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200159"></xptr>
               <p>I first tested 5 drops, put the drops into a vessel, and obtained clear evidence of strychnia—I used the same things as I had used with the other except potash and chloroform, and I obtained a substance which yielded evidence of strychnia when tested by manganese sulphuric acid, bichromate of potash, and peroxide of lead, those were three separate tests—the evidence of strychnia are in the colour—I used three separate tests, and had three-. fold indications of the presence of strychnia—I subsequently took 10 drops and repeated the process and obtained needle-shaped crystals, such as strychnia will crystalize in; I have some with me, (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>), they are very minute needle shaped crystals—that was evidence to my mind that it was a crystalline substance having the same form that strychnia some<lb></lb>times assumes—that is not peculiar to strychnia alone, it is a common property with others, with thousands of substances, it need not be a poison,—I do not think it is common to sarsaparilla—strychnia comes from a vegetable nux vomica—sarsaparilla comes from a vegetable, there may be crystalline substances obtained from sarsaparilla, but I cannot speak with authority on that subject—I am able to say that the stuff in that bottle did contain strynchnia, because I applied the tests to those crystals, that again is a matter of colour—strychnia when treated by these tests turns violet passing into red—I think taking a crystalline substance giving this colour, acting with the tests named, it would be consistent with chemical science to say that it was strychnia; in my opinion it was conclusively strychnia—it is certainly my opinion that the tests I applied enabled me to say that the bottle did contain strychnia—I showed the remainder on a watch glass to Professor Bernays-that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), Idid not test the contents of the bottle for anything but strychnia, I left about 15 drops in the bottle; I measured the quantity when it came to me, about 30 drops, I did not measure it afterwards some might have been lost, I corked that up and gave it with the other bottles to Inspector Easter—I produced this 2-oz. bottle at the inquest and sub<lb></lb>sequently before the Magistrate—I took the precaution to empty the remainder of it into a clean ounce phial, rinsing out the 2-oz., No. 3, with spirits of wine, that ounce phial I corked and locked up. in my drawer, and that No. 3 bottle I produced at the inquest and before the Magistrate, it was then empty—when Inspector Easter called on me I emptied both the contents of the 1-oz. phial into No. 3 and gave it to the inspector—I should think a considerable quantity of the fifteen drops was lost by evaporation; that was one reason that induced me to add the spirit, think<lb></lb>ing it would preserve what was left—all the other bottles I received I also handed to the inspector to go to Professor Bernays—I should think there was about l-120th of a grain of strychnia in bottle No. 3 when I first obtained it, but not now; that was only a sort of guess, and it would represent 4-5ths of the bottle full, 4-5ths of a grain, supposing the bottle was full—the smallest dose that would be fatal to an adult would, from my reading be 1/2 grain, and a less quantity would produce serious effects—I have no idea of the quantity of strychnia in bottle 9—I have been in practice fourteen years—I have attended to Mrs. Wilson's evidence, and if she has accurately described the symptoms, I am of opinion that they are consistent with death from strychnia—they only resemble those of the disease known as <hi rend="italic">indiopathictelanus</hi>, that means lock-jaw, which comes on of itself with<lb></lb>out any wounds—that will not kill a person in two or three hours, it takes from two to thirty days—wheether a person who was in a state of health at 8.30 p.m. and died, after convulsions, at 2 a.m., died from idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>, would</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Fulton*.

               <p>the muscles of the legs were also contracted there would bo greater pressure there, and the feet would be turned in—in epilepsy the symptoms come and go, it is not a question of stretching, it is a constant twitching; that is in ordinary epilepsy,; but epilepsy with tetanic complications is a thing I know nothing about—I examined the body on the 18th September, eight days after death—it was somewhat rigid, but that was passing off from decomposition—I should expect to find very great rigidity after the death of a person from strychnia—I should expect to find arching of the back, unless what we call the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had passed off—if I went in four or five minutes after death I think I should expect to find the person in an arched condition, but that is speculation—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> sometimes does not set in till some time after death; it varies in different persons—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances in cases of death by strychnia are not marked, but certain symptoms have been observed in certain cases—I found the membranes of the brain highly decomposed and turning green—I know that congestion of the membranes of the brain is one of the consequences of death by strychnia; I examined the upper part of the spinal marrow—the membranes of the brain were congested, that is present in death from strychnia and also from epilepsy—I found the lungs congested; I mentioned that in the written report 1 sent to the Coroner—the heart was flabby and empty; it contained a little coagulated blood—the heart is flabby and empty if you examine soon after death, but decomposition does away with most appearances—the blood was dark and frothy and of a dull colour, but those are appearances due to decomposition; a great part of the surface of the body was green—the blood was dark, unfreshlike, and frothy—the muscles of the throat and gullet were of a dark colour and congested, and the tongue also; but we do not attach much importance to that, on account of the decomposed state of the body—the only reason I give for the death not being from natural causes is this: I could not see any indication of disease; that was drawn from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I said that there were no morbid appearances to account for death—Battle's Vermin Killer contains Prussian blue, flour, and strychnia—I do not know of my own knowledge that it contains Prussian blue; I found no trace of it, nor should I expect to do so if it was administered in any small quantity—Prussian blue is a combination of cyanogen and iron—it is partly mineral—I give as a reason for not finding strychnia that it is a vegetable and is rapidly decomposed; that would not apply to a mineral, but Prussian blue is not properly a mineral—iron would not absorb, but iron is a constituent of the body; there is always iron in the blood—iron, in a small quantity, would not stain the stomach—I do not know how much iron is contained in one of those powders—I have heard that a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet contains 3 grains of strychnia—four hours and a half is a long time for a patient to whom strychnia has been given to be dying; death generally takes place more rapidly, but longer intervals have occurred and also shorter, five or ten minutes—the time depends upon the dose and the susceptibility of the patient and the form in which the dose is given; if liquid, it would come on more rapidly—death would not be more likely to come on if the dose was given in a liquid form; that would depend upon the dose given and the peculiarity of the individual—there are two cases given by Watson where two men each took a grain of strychnia by mistake and neither of them died, and one scarcely suffered at all—the minimum fatal dose, quoting from Taylor, is 1/2 grain, and the maximum is any quantity.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi> Mr. Poland. In an attack of epilepsy the patient will fall down, and probably utter a cry, become convulsed, froth at the mouth, turn livid in the face, and become unconscious—the convulsions would last for a varying time, and the body would be twitching during the time—I have never known that the feet sometimes beat the ground—sometimes the muscles on one side only are twitched—when the convulsions cease, the patient probably falls into a profound sleep, lasting perhaps for hours.</p>

I should say that five or six successive attacks of epilepsy would be a large number, usually there is one attack and the patient falls asleep and then awakes, perhaps knowing nothing of what has happened—I have seen more than 100 cases of epilepsy; the cases in which the convulsions most frequently occur would most resemble the case we are dealing with, but I never saw a case in which the fits occurred within intervals of a minute or so, in which the patient was able to talk and remained conscious—I have known a patient to have convulsions for a minute or two and then return—he would then go off into the final sleep and then recover—it ends in sleep, and it may end in the sleep of death, but it is very unusal—I do not recollect one case of epilepsy in which there was arching of the back, or such consciousness as to enable him to talk to the extent which is spoken to—if there was no arching of the back I should not assume that death was owing to strychnia—independent of the arching of the back there was the tetanic convulsions and occasional con<lb></lb>sciousness, and the freedom of the jaws as distinguished from idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital—I am not a medical man—on 17th October, I received some bottles from the police-inspector and a packet of powders—bottle No. 1, contained a portion of the viscera, and No. 2, the stomach and its contents—the only thing I need mention in No. 1, is that it was in a state of frothy decomposition, but not smelling at all badly—the heart was in No. 1, and was exceedingly flabby and very much decomposed, I am not able to tell what condition it was in when the subject died—No. 2 contained the stomach, the ends of which had been tied—I found no poison in it of any description, it contained a very watery fluid, with bits of cheese, the eye and gill of an hen-ing, a bone, some fibres of meat, some bread, and some tannin, which is the astringent principle of tea—I found no signs of valerian—if a fatal dose of strychnia had been given at 9.30 at night, and death followed at 2.30 a.m. I should not expect to find in the stomach traces of the poison, I should expect absorption to have taken place, and that the poison which had killed the person would have been altered in its chemical condition, and therefore be no longer strychnia—I should expect it to have got chiefly into the liver—it is said that half a grain is the smallest fatal dose, but I can only speak from reading—there was a small 2 oz. bottle which I myself numbered "No. 3," it contained very nearly 15 grs. of a somewhat clear liquid, strongly alcholic and smelling of myrrh—I made a careful analysis of it and found no strychnia in it—spirits of wine having been put into the bottle and turned out again, would account for the alcohol, unless it had originally contained tincture of myrrh—I found on examining the cork that the bottle had contained paregoric, or a minute quantity of morphia or myrrh; I thought it had been frequently used, and the cork had been saturated—I tested it for strychnia and did not find the slightest trace—I have been a professor of chemistry for 30 years and have had a great deal</p>

               <p>of experience at St. Mary's and St. Thomas's Hospitals—I have heard the mode in which Dr. Lees tested the strychnia, and am perfectly certain that what he showed me on a watch glass contained strychnia—I do not lay so much stress upon the crystals, I look upon that as a feature of the case only.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. My ground for saying that what I saw on the watch glass contained strychnia is, in the first place the taste inasmuch as certainly the 8-1000th part of a grain would be readily detected by its metallic bitter taste, and then by the use of the various colour tests which Dr. Lees has enumerated, principally oxide of manganese and per-oxide of lead, and sulphuric acid, and I tried them myself in his presence and found strychnia.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. Those were proper tests to be used—from my ex<lb></lb>perience I should say that the quantity tested on the watch glass contained 1-1000th of a grain of strychnia—the crystals Dr. Lees shewed me are quite consistent with crystals of strychnia—the mode of treatment leads to the conclusion that the crystals must be those of some alkaloid—I am of opinion that the crystals must have been strychnia, that is a matter of cer<lb></lb>tainty—No. 4 is a mere medicine, an anti-spasmodic—if she took valerian and assafoetida at 10.30 I should expect to find the greater part of it. absorbed into the system at 2 o'clock, and the smell of the contents of the stomach was exactly like valerian, but something had evidently been given which preserved the liquid from being offensive at all—ammonia will preserve from putrefaction—the medicine seemed antiseptic in its effects—I can account now for the smell of the contents of the stomach, which I could not account for at the time—I could answer for the quantity of medicine she must have taken, from the quantity remaining in the bottle, the bottle was nearly full when brought to me. (Mr. Miller <hi rend="italic">here identified the bottle of medicine as that which he made up</hi>.) A spoonful had been given out of it—knowing now what the mixture is I say that it tallies with what I found in the stomach—the contents of the stomach as far as solid food is concerned may he said to have been <hi rend="italic">nil;</hi> it was chiefly water; the medicine had been to a certain extent absorbed, because the coats of the stomach were slightly acid, whereas the medicine was slightly alkaline—it had passed through the stomach and the ammonia had gone—if it came after the strychnia, the strychnia would have the start of it, and the one that came first would be most likely to get absorbed into the blood; and if it was taken in a fluid state the crystalline bodies would pass through—No. 4 is an anti-spasmodic medicine—I did not examine it completely except to see that it was free from poison—No. 5 containes oil of aniseed and nothing else—No. 6 is very old mustard in powder—No. 7 was a very excellent compound decoction of sarsaparilla and nothing else, there was about a fluid ounce of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was labelled "Concentrated compound decoction of Jamaica sarsaparilla; warranted conformable to the British Pharmacopoea</hi>). No. 8 I handed to Dr. Lees, it had contained sarsaparilla, but it was not only empty but it had been washed out—this is No. 9 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I carefully examined it—I had no knowledge of what Dr. Lees put into it—I tested it to see if the contents corresponded with the label, and having found that they did, I set to work to look for strychnia—that was the proper way to set to work—I had not the slightest idea of what had been done; but when 1 found what had been done, that was the sort of thing I should have done myself, with a slight modification; it was per<lb></lb>fectly</p>

               <p>correct—I found on opening the bottle a strong smell, reminding <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of vomit; the bottle contained a full 1/2-oz. of alkaline fluid of a yellowish colour, with a flocculent deposit, which under the microscope looked more like broken starch granules and tissue—tissue means something like the coating you sometimes see on bread, the husks, or indications of something of that kind, or bran—I evaporated a portion of it to dryness to see that it answered the description given on the label, examined it tinder a micro<lb></lb>scope and found a crystalline mass, consisting mainly of chloride of potassium; in fact, what one would have expected from the analysis—I then took a small portion of it and decomposed it with sulphuric acid, filtered it to remove the flocculent matter from it, took a portion of it on a watch-glass, added a tiny drop of sulphuric acid to it and held it for a few minutes on a water bath; it slightly changed colour, it turned somewhat brown, but not quite black, and when I saw that it was the right time, after a few moments, I added a few drops of water, filtered it, and again evaporated it on the watch-glass, and then used the bi-chromate of potass, which gave me distinct indications of strychnine—I then took another portion and treated it in the usual way with chloroform, having first got rid of the alcohol—I adopted all the tests—the second process with the manganese, which Dr.—Taylor prefers, gave me the most perfect result as to strychnia, and the third the per-oxide of lead in the same manner—I have not the slightest doubt that there was strychina in that; I should say from l-50th to 1-100th of a grain—I only give that as a matter of opinion having had a good deal of experience with the students; I am acquainted with the poison called Battle's vermin killer; I had a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>: packet of it brought to me by Inspector Easter, on the 31st October—I have about 10 grains of it here—it consists of flour, strychnia, and a very small quantity of Prussian blue—the total quantity is 15 grains of a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet, and in that there is 1-603 grains of strichnia, that is one in three-fifths; I can only guess the portion of Prussian blue—it is simply flour slightly coloured by Prussian blue—there would be about 13 grains of flour in it, but I have done nothing to quantity that—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet weighs exactly double, and. contained 30 grains—the strychnia was 31 5th grains—this produced is a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet—in bottle No. 9 I found what appears to be brown starch—when I made the examination of it I thought it was consistent with its being some of the flour of Battle's vermin killer, and I think so now—I thought so when I came to the analysis; I was not aware whether it was Battle's or Butler's vermin killer; I do not know which, but one of them suggested itself as possible—I presume that it is made of starch because the mice eat the starch, and there is no smell about it—it is simply that there is something to eat, and it kills them—I had not heard that there was such a thing in the place where the prisoner lived; I should say it was possible by washing to remove the greater part of the flour and the blue—supposing it were put into a liquid and given to a person who died of the strychnia, I should not expect to find traces of the Prussian blue, first on account of the smallness of the quantity, and also because the slightest knowledge of chemistry enables one to remove the blue in a moment—I am a chemist, but not a physician—I cannot imagine any reason why the effect of a dose of strichnia administered at 9.30 might not be delayed until 2 o'clock, the following morning; sarsaparilla is a sweet substance—a good dead of the so-called sarsaparilla is liquorice—this was very good, indeed—I have no doubt it was made according to the British Pharmacopoea—it is a</p>

               <p>thing from which you can extract sugar—if a fatal dose of strychnia in the form of Battle's vermin killer was put into sarsaparilla, I should think it would make it bitter, in fact it must—except from reading I should not be able to give an opinion as to whether strichnia produces vomiting—I should imagine that it would; because as has been already said it does not so rapidly affect the throat as in the ordinary symptoms of <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>, and so forth—one of the first things that I should look at in a case of poisoning by strychnia, speaking as a layman, would be whether any symptoms took place soon after taking food or medicine of any kind—if convulsion results soon after taking food that would be consistent with having taken strychnia; but I get that altogether from my reading—the clenched hands, the curved feet and the jaw fixed are the direct effects of poisoning by strychnia—I should mention that there is another vermin killer which contains strychnia, and not Prussian blue; that is Butler's, and there is one of Butler's that contains no strychnia at all; but carbonate of baryta, I should say that these things ought never to be sold, or only sold by legitimate pharmacopoeists, and that persons using them should give their name; as they do in pur<lb></lb>chasing other poisons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have stated that I see no reason why death should usually be deferred from 9.30 to 2 o'clock; it depends upon the strength and constitution of the person; there are a number of cases on record of a far longer time than from five to thirty minutes, two hours, three hours, and six hours—in those cases which are on record the usual time is from five to twenty minutes, but there are cases not on record in which death has taken place much later than sixteen hours even—I would rather not answer the question whether from the symptoms described, with the arching of the back, I should be prepared to say it was a death from strychnia, because that is so distinctly a medical question and involves practice in medical science—it is, of course, my duty to be acquainted with the results of poisons, as well as the constituents of them—the arching of the back is certainly mentioned as one of the most important indications of poisoning by strychnia—in order to see whether there has been any case in which that was absent I should require to look into the books; I certainly do not remember one—suppos-ing' the symptoms I have heard today had been given to me, without the arching of the back, I should not have said that death was from strychnia, but what I should have said would be that it was a case of great suspicion and one that ought to be examined into—I should not have said it was a case of poisoning from strychnia, I mean independent altogether of the result of any chemical investigation—one of the results of death from strychnia is very great rigidity after death, but muscular relaxation takes place by time—in case of death by strychnia it certainly is said that there is great rigidity immediately after death, much more marked than the ordinary <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—it is stated in Taylor's book that a 1/2 grain is the minimum amount of strychnia that will cause death, but Gerard says that he has known the most serious symptoms from l-48th of a grain—I do not know whether that was a case in which death occurred—serious symptoms might occur in that case without death, but medicines have such different effects on dif<lb></lb>ferent persons that it would be scarcely safe to say that what would kill one man would kill another.</p>

               <p>been in Court during the whole of this case—I have paid special attention to the evidence of Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Miller, and of Dr. Lee's and Professor Bernays—assuming the description given by Mrs. Wilson of the woman's symptoms on the night she died to be accurate, in my judgment I should say that the cause of death was strychnia or some preparation containing strychnia; and assuming Mrs. Wilson's description to be accurate, I do not think it is consistent with any other cause of death—I do not think that idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> would produce the same symptoms; that is a very rare disease, and I do not think a case of idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> would have been so speedily fatal—I should say the symptoms detailed by Mrs. Wilson were remarkably typical of strychnia poisoning—assuming that description to be accurate, the death is not consistent with an attack of epilepsy—I agree—with Dr. Lees and Professor Bernays that if a fatal dose of strychnia was administered at 9.30 at night and the person died at 2 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing traces of it would probably be absent in the stomach—I have myself failed to detect strychnia in the stomach, when I have been able to find it in other portions of the body, when it has been absorbed in the liver—I have also detected it in the urine when I failed to detect it in the vomit of a per<lb></lb>son who had taken strychnia—the smallest recorded fatal quantity of strychnia is a 1/2 grain—I have heard the tests applied by Dr. Lees and Professor Bernays and I cannot doubt that strychnia was discovered by both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a rule, in poisoning by strychnia, the intellect is clear, except when the convulsions are very violent or prolonged, or when death is very near—supposing the patient was ill from 9.30 till 2 o'clock and during the greater portion of that time was unconscious, I should not say that was inconsistent with death from strychnia—on hearing Mrs. Wilson's evidence I am not sure that the person was conscious, in the medical sense of the term—persons may take no notice,—yet may be per<lb></lb>fectly conscious and during the paroxysms it would be quite impossible, I should say, to tell whether the person was conscious or unconscious—if proper tests are. applied it is easy to ascertain whether the person's intellect is clear; it is unusual for a person to be unconscious in strychnia poisoning, but it is not impossible that it should be so<lb></lb>most of the recorded cases go to show that the intellect is clear; by "clear" I do not mean that they become more clever than before, buy they understand what is said to them; when their attention is not concentrated on their sufferings they give clear and intellectual answers, and they are clear of what is going on around them; there is no impairment of the mental faculties—vomiting is not a symptom of poisoning by strychnia, not a usual symptom—persons often vomit when they come out of an epileptic attack, but I should not say that was a usual symptom—some people <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> sick and some not, some vomit and some not—a person may desire to be side with<lb></lb>out being so—vomiting on a desire to vomit would not be a symptom of poisoning by strychnia, nor especially a symptom of epilepsy; I have not read that it is a symptom, nor have I observed it in the effects of strychnia myself—I should think taking a great quantity of sarsaparilla by a person unaccustomed to that medicine might cause sickness; it is usually given in: water; I think it states so on the label of this bottle; it is not a thing you would take alone; it has a cloying sort of taste; a dessert teaspoonful of this is equal to a quarter of a pint of the decoction; that would be a full dose—if the patient had actually died in the middle of a convulsion I should</p>

               <p>expect to find immediately after death very marked rigidity of the body—the description Mrs. Wilson has given is consistent either with her being drawn back in the rigid state, or that relaxation had come on—the relaxa<lb></lb>tion of the muscles at the end of these dreadful convulsions does not usually stop on the sudden, not in a moment—the patient would be drawn back and rigid, then they would sink down, and relaxation would come on, and then they could bear to be touched—I believe it does end suddenly in a col<lb></lb>lapse; the person will suddenly drop back in the bed—there might be no marked rigidity shortly after death—I have never myself seen a patient actually die from strychnia, although I have seen persons who have died from it—my opinion is formed from what I have read—I have found in operating upon ani<lb></lb>mals that they will be quite rigid immediately after death—my own expe<lb></lb>rience and practice is consistent with rigidity after death; I have never observed the absence of it immediately after death in any animal—the time which the rigidity continues is very variable in animals; when it is observed im<lb></lb>mediately after death it often passes off very shortly; it may pass off in a few hours, it may be several days; I should not expect it to last a week—if the rigidity was immediately after death I do not think it would pass off in so short a space as half an hour—from my reading I find it stated that the body is generally as stiff as a board—when they are rigid after death they are extremely rigid—the expression "stiff as aboard "is one that has been used—the time at which <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> is continued after death in a person that dies from natural causes is very variable, it may pass off in a few hours or it may last several days; I have never observed it pass off within less than twelve hours, but there are cases on record where it is much less than that—between the death and the twelve hours the body would usually be laid out—I could not be sure that the rigidity would be likely to continue longer in a case of poisoning by strychnia than in an ordinary case; I do not think that it would be probable—if the body was rigid at the moment of death I should expect that would continue, it would depend upon whether the person was seized with death at the time that arching happened—the feet being turned towards one another would be consistent with strychnia poisoning—the feet may be averted or inverted—I should place more reliance on the fact that the muscles and tendons were subject to great ten<lb></lb>sion—in an ordinary case of strychnia you would find the toes turned down<lb></lb>wards in an arched form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Poisoning by strychnia does not produce unconsciousness in itself; it is from my reading I know that where persons have very violent and rapid convulsions, or when very near death, they may be unconscious when dying from strychnia—I do not think strychnia in itself produces unconsciousness—they are conscious immediately after con<lb></lb>vulsions.</p>

If the convulsions were very violent, I do not think that they would take any notice of what was said; but when they came out of the convulsions they would express themselves as conscious of what was been going on—I mean that a person would be so suffering in convulsions that they would not show consciousness, but when they came to themselves, you ascertain that they have been conscious of what was going on, they will describe their feelings to you—that would not be the case in death by convulsions from epilepsy—there is entire unconscious<lb></lb>ness during the attack in such cases, and drowsiness afterwards, with a loud snoring breathing—a patient recovering from epilepsy is not able to tell you what has occurred during the fit.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Fitch, a labourer, and live at 24, Falcon Court, High Street, Borough—the deceased, Ellen Sloper, called Ellen Smith, was my sister—she was twenty-four years of age when she died—I went to live in Auckland Street, in March, this year—the prisoner came up from the country to stay with me—she had been in town before, and had met the prisoner in town before—she and I occupied a lodging in the same house—on 4th March, she was confined of a female child, her only and first child—I was present at her confinement—it was a proper, full grown child—she had a very good time—the state of her health was very good all the time she was with me—she stayed with me six weeks, down to 15th April, the Saturday after Good Friday, and she went from me to Cheltenham, taking the child with her—I never knew of her having fits or convulsions—I next saw her a month previous to my seeing her death in the paper—she had come up from Cheltenham, and had the child with her—she was rather weak then—she did not stay with me then—she left me the same evening—she went to take lodgings at Mrs. Wilson's—I never saw her afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Bolton, and live at Chelten<lb></lb>ham—I knew the deceased woman Ellen Sloper—I was at service with her, near Stroud, for two years—she left there in June, 1873—after that I heard of her from time to time—she came to Cheltenham to stay with me on Saturday, 15th April last, and brought her child with her—she was with me two months, till about the middle of June—she then went to live with my sister for a week at Cheltenham—after that, she was living at 36, working as a servant—she continued at Cheltenham till 19th August—I saw her every day—during the whole time I knew her she never suffered from fits—she had perfectly good health—she was in good health when she left Cheltenham—she took her child with her and came up to London.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. STEVENSON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). Epilepsy usually commences in children or very young persons; it may come on in adult life—when a person is subject to epilepsy the attacks come on suddenly, in a moment—there is nothing inconsistent in an attack of epilepsy seizing a person of twenty-four years of age for the first time—it may come on at any time, but rarely at a late period of life—there is nothing in the suddenness of the attack, but there is in the gravity of the case—it is very unusual for a first seizure of epilepsy to kill a patient; I think it would not be impossible, but I have never seen such a case—I think I have read of such cases, but I am not in medical practice now, except as a toxicologist—an attack of epilepsy comes on very suddenly, a person is seized in a moment, they utter a cry perhaps and fall to the ground insensible—one attack is not usually followed by another very speedily, I mean not within a few minutes, or perhaps within a few</p>

               <p>hours—it is not continuous, as this was almost continuous; and when the patient comes out of an attack of epilepsy, when the convulsions are over, they are insensible and only gradually resume their consciousness, and they cannot recollect what has occurred during the attack—I do not think that epilepsy with tetanic convulsions is a well-known disease—I have never seen such a disease; I am not in medical practice now, but during the six years I was I never saw such a case—I think I have a very imperfect recollection of having read of such cases—I have great doubts about the reality, the entity, the separateness of such a case.</p>

I was in the room the whole of the time she was suffering as I have described, from 9.30 till 2 o'clock—she was in a continuation of violent convulsions, I can't say how many altogether, there must have been a dozen or more, for she was continually in them, she was no sooner out than she was in again, some of them lasted about five minutes; they differed in length; the one that took the prisoner and me to hold her lasted near ten minutes—I should say there were more than a dozen convulsions—I am sure of a dozen for it was a continuation of them.</p>

The ammonia in the mix-ture that was given might somewhat delay the absorption of the strychnia—it might prevent its being absorbed so rapidly as it otherwise would, but it would not prevent the fatal effects in any way; it would retard absorp<lb></lb>tion—I don't think it would retard the coming on of death—the only effect would be this: that usually the contents of the stomach are acid, and the acidity of the stomach makes it able to take up the strychnine rapidly, the ammonia would neutralise the acidity of the stomach and would to a certain extent prevent the immediate rapid absorption of the strychnia; that would not last long—death from strychnia is by convulsions or exhaustion—I do not think the valerian assafoedita or ammonia would act in any way as an antidote, or would prevent the access of convulsions—I don't think it would have the effect of retarding the operation of the poison.</p>

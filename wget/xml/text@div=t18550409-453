               <p>with Charles Oldham. The prisoner was our clerk—on 31st Oct. we had a bond for Turkish scrip left at our office—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was kept by the prisoner—this entry is in his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Oct. 31. 2,000 new Turks, for J. Rigg")—on 2nd Nov. I asked the prisoner for the four bonds, and afterwards, on the 14th, I discovered that there were not four—I had kept them in my desk in the mean time, and had kept the key—when I missed one it was half past 5 o'clock at night, and the prisoner had gone—I said to him next morning, "We have missed a Turk"—he said, "Oh, indeed!"—I said, "It must be found at once"—he said nothing, but tried to go out of the office, and then I challenged him, and said that I sus<lb></lb>pected him—he denied it, and tried to go—I said that he should not go until it was found—he said that he thought he could get it by applying to a man named Beach—my partner and myself set out with him there, and when we had got a few yards, I saw him speaking to my partner, who then said, in the prisoner's hearing, "Baker has confessed it all"—we then returned to the office—he persisted that Beach had got it, and my partner went with him, but I did not—they came back, and said that Mr. Beach was not within, but would be at 2 o'clock—at 2 o'clock I and Mr. Phillips were going to see Mr. Beach with the prisoner, and he escaped—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—we received them—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Pray, for God's sake, have one day's patience; give me to-day, and to-morrow until 1 o'clock, and I will settle it, or blow my brains out. R. B." "The business is all mine; Beach is only a name. There is a Mr. Beach, a friend of mine, but he is as innocent as an angel. He has promised to advance me moneys to buy a Turk, and he will in a few days, if you do not go and tell him, although <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have told him my position. If you do go and tell him, I shall not get one penny. For mercy's sake, say, <hi rend="italic">will you give me time.</hi> only a little time to put the Turk right. If I am deprived of my liberty I can do nothing towards this matter; but, if free, I can do all. I do not want to go away; but if I must, I shall do so effectually. I know your high posi<lb></lb>tion, your views of justice. If you will give your word that you will not have me arrested until some day which you may name, Friday or Saturday, I will freely devote myself to doing justice to you to the best of my ability; but, if this is not granted me, I leave you to conjecture how I am to act for life's sake. Send me word by bearer what you will do. I will freely speak about the Turk as soon as I can do so without danger; but I cannot <hi rend="italic">write</hi> about it, as you will see. Tuesday, 3 o'clock")—we sent no message by the bearer, but followed him—I did not see the prisoner again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did this bond belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; because I paid for it, but I supposed that we were buying it for your friend, Mr. Beech—you received it yourself from Mr. Rigg, I never saw or had it—before you came there was a great deal of speculation in the office—we commenced playing at cards at 12 o'clock in the day—blank cheques signed were occasionally left in the office, in case anybody came in—you could not have filled up a blank cheque unless you forged my name—I filled up a blank cheque when my partner was gone, and took all the money out and placed it to my account at another bank—that was because I could not trust you, and because I chose to do it—the bond was missed after that—there was a large specula<lb></lb>tive account open with Beech—the colour of the bond was red; I did not see it till the other day—I know Mr. Crook, I have received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. From him—I put it to his credit, and am ready to account for it at any time; it was not under protest—blank cheques were not constantly left in your pos<lb></lb>session by my partner, that I know of.</p>

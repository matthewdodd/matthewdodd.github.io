                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Davis, who keeps the Kent Hotel in Brownlow-street, Holborn. On 3rd Oct. the prisoners came about 7 o'clock in the evening for half-a-quartern of gin and cloves—I served them—Pomeroy put a bad half-crown on the counter—I called Mrs. Davis, gave her the half-crown, and told her it was a bad one—she desired the waiter Lewis to go for a policeman—he went out, and after that Jenkins went out—Pomeroy remained—in a few minutes Lewis returned with Jenkins—Mr. Davis, my master, stood against the door, and the waiter was again sent out for a policeman—while he was gone, Pomeroy said to Jenkins, "Go and see after him again"—Jenkins said, "No, I won't, they will say I meant to do the same again"—Mr. Davis gave me the half-crown again, and I marked it with a knife.</p>

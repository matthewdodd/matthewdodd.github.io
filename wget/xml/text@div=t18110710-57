No, I believe she said the corner of Old North Street, and that she kept a cloaths shop, and that if I would go with her to Theobald's Road she would give me another for it, she did not know it was a bad one. Her husband would make a fine piece of work with her if he knew it to be a bad one, that she had taken it for two shirts that had been sold in the shop, I told her that I would take her to No. 4, to see if she had lived there, she then complained that she was not able to walk, that she was unwell, I still persisted in going down to Drury Lane, and took her by the arm and crossed over and took her to Bow Street, there she was examined.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being brought to the office in Bow Street. - A. Yes, on the 13th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of searching the lodgings of the prisoner. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you learn them to be the lodging of the prisoner. - A. From her own account, she delivered the key of her room to me herself, she said that her lodgings was situated in Theobalds Road, I took her with me, Lack and Vickrey were with me, two other officers. In going there she was asked what property she had in the house and what description, she said she believed there was nine pound in bank notes in a pocket book, which were in a drawer, she was asked if she had any more, she said there were not that she knew off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that room situated that you went with her to, of which you had the key to open the door. - A. On the ground floor of the house, at the corner of North Street. We then proceeded to search, we found the nine pounds that she described, and on making a further search we found this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the nine notes in the pocket-book in the drawer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found them in the pocket-book were good. - A. They were so, we proceeded to search further, in this bag we found a five a two, and a one, that work bag hung up at the side of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they in a bag. - A. They were to to the best of my recollection in some paper, but I delivered the bag to Lack, and he will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. These notes you so found, you would know them again if you were to see them. - A. Yes, this is the one pound note I found, I endorsed it at the time; this is the five pound note, I marked it in the same manner; and this is the two, I endorsed it likewise, I have no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100034"></xptr>doubt of them. In returning from the room to the office she then said they were notes that she had taken in the shop, and she had put them there as a private purse of her own, and that she had put them there unknown to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear desirous of preventing you from suspecting her husband. - A. I should imagine that she did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you imagine that only from the expression that she made. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She is indicted as a single woman. The husband, as he is called, was apprehended for a different offence than that which the woman at the bar now is indicted for. - A. Truely so.</p>

Them notes that were in my work bag, my husband gave me the day before, to purchase some articles that I wanted in the house; he said, if I did not go that day, I might keep them by me, and he would go with me, I considered that I should like my husband to go with me, I put the notes in the work-bag, until he could go. Respecting the other note, that I uttered for the stays, I am positive that I took that note in the shop at Drury lane, and I put the name on at the name. The reason that I denied these notes being in the work bag. I did not know what to say, being in the hands of officers, I imagined my husband might know something of them, I knew I was in the hands of officers, I said, I knew nothing about it; my husband was at the door when I went in for the stays, and when I came out he was gone.</p>

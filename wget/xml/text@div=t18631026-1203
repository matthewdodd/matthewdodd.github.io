                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Little College-street, Chelsea—about half-past 1, on 27th September, I was going along Marl<lb></lb>borough-road, Chelsea—when I got to the corner of Oxford-street, I saw three young men—the prisoner is one of them; I am sure of him—they asked me for a lucifer—I said I had no such thing, or they should have it with pleasure—I went on a few yards, when they <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> me by the back of my neck and knocked me down in the street—I could not tell which did that—they then rifled my pockets, and robbed me of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half an ounce of <hi rend="italic">baccy</hi>—I do not know which rifled my pockets; they kicked me to that degree that I did not how I was circumstanced—I called out "Police!" and if it was not for them I would be killed in a minute—I did not lose sight of the prisoner until the others kicked me insensible, and then I had to let him go—I did not know him before—the others got away, and he was taken.</p>

I am a plasterer, and live at 9, Lambs' Conduit-street—I was going home early on Sunday morning, the 28th—the prisoner and another man came up to me, and stopped me, and asked what I was and where I was going—I said I was a plasterer—soon after the prosecutor came by—they asked him for a light to light a pipe—he crossed on to the pavement, and while there he complained of the prisoner putting his hand in his pocket—I went to look for a policeman, but could not see one—I saw the prosecutor go round the corner, and the prisoner and his colleagues following him for about sixty yards, and when I came up to them he was down on the pavement—I went up to pull the prisoner off him—he was holding his arms while the others were searching his pockets—I caught him by the collar of his coat—he aimed a tremendous blow at me, but I avoided it; it only knocked my hat off, and while I was picking it up two policemen came up—I am confident the prisoner is the person that had the prosecutor on the ground—he was caught; the others got away.</p>

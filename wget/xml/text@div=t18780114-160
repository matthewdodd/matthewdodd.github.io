                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Herman Koekoek, a picture-dealer, of 72, Piccadilly—on 24th September the prisoner called and I saw him—he had called about a week previously—he called to see an English landscape which he wanted to form a centre between two other pictures in his drawing or dining-room—I promised to get some<lb></lb>thing to show him—he afterwards decided not to have it—he gave his address, 15, Cavendish Place, Brighton—he said he was going to leave there, but was in treaty for a house about eight miles from Brighton, where he could have some fishing and shooting and amuse himself by looking after the men in the fields—I said I rather liked Brighton and had some notion of going to live there—he said "Well, if you are I will sell you my house"—he said he had bought it before things had gone up so, very cheap, furniture and all—he did not name any price—he did not state the name of the place he was in treaty for—he said they wanted 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, there was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. differ<lb></lb>ence between them, but he had the option of taking it if he liked with the option of purchase afterwards—he said he had a small collection of draw<lb></lb>ings, some of Birket Foster's and others, and also a small collection of pictures by the old masters; and he invited me, if I was coming to Brighton, to come and see them—I think he said that the two landscapes he had, for which he wanted one to put between, were by Meadows, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187801140015"></xptr>
               <p>I said "Well, Meadows is not a very great man, though he is a pretty painter"—there was a picture standing before him which he said was a very pretty picture—I said "Yes, it is by a very good man"—he asked the price—I said 95 guineas—he said "Well, I will take that"—I showed him another by Bazzani—he said it was a very lovely picture—I said he was a very great man, his pictures realised a very large price, and were increasing in value—he said "I should like to buy that, what is the price?"—I said 160 guineas—he said "If you can give me a little time I should like to take those two"—a drawing by Birket Foster was put by for him—the third picture was by Verbeckhoven—I agreed to sell him the pictures—he took the Birket Foster away with him that day; the others were to be sent, and I sent them the following evening—I have since seen the Birket Foster in the possession of Mr. McLean; the Ver<lb></lb>beckhoven in the possession of Mr. Gilbert; and the Bazzani in the possession of Mr. Cochrane—the first thing that induced me to let him take away the Birket Foster was, knowing the family of Elkington to be by reputation first-class, I believed his statement about the house in Cavendish Place and about his having a collection of pictures there, and that he had the power of selling the house—he also represented that he had a good income: that he was a man of independent fortune—it was the different statements taken together that influenced me—if he had said nothing about the house in Cavendish Place and his collection of pictures I do not think I should have parted with any property—if I had been perfectly satisfied he was the man he represented himself to be, I should not have hesitated—if he had been one of the family of Elkington, and a person of independent property; I very likely might have parted with the pictures.</p>

You did not say that you had taken, not bought, the house at Brighton; I swear that—you said you had bought the house and furniture, that it was a beautiful house, and a very nice place—a writ was served on you for the pictures, and execution was issued and withdrawn—there were no goods there of yours—there was an interpleader—I was not told that you had given 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods; I heard that you had given a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was not paid—I had no letter from you stating that your father had promised to accept a bill for you if I would allow the matter to stand over, and that it would be all settled after Christmas.</p>

I reside with my mother at 5, Cavendish Place—we are joint owners of No. 15—in August last we let that house to Mrs. Hewit<lb></lb>son, the prisoner's mother-in-law—I have frequently seen the prisoner there—the furniture in the house was the property of myself and mother—we have not received any rent in respect of Mrs. Hewitson's occupation—she left behind her a box of electro-plate, a looking-glass, and a few pictures, which were afterwards valued at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the rent due was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of John Merchant, and live in John's court, Marylebone-lane; he keeps a shoe-shop. The prisoner came to the shop one day last month, and asked me to show her a pair of shoes—I showed her a pair—she fitted them on, and said they would not do—I was going to give her another pair, and saw her rise from her seat and go to the window-board, which was inside the shop—I fetched another pair—she fitted them on, and said they would fit her, and asked the price—I said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, "If I go and fetch the money I may have them"—I said, "Yes," and as she went out I whispered to my mother who was in the shop, and she stoped her, and asked her if she had any thing to sell—she said, "No,"—she asked how she came by the shoes—she said, "Oh, I bought them, they not yours."</p>

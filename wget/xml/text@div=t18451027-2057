                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in Brydge's-street, Covent-garden—William Wetherhead is the occupier of the house—he lives in it, and lets out part of it—it is in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden—between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 23rd Oct. I was sit<lb></lb>ting in my parlour, behind the shop—two persons came in and told me something, in consequence of which I went out, examined my window, and missed about ten bundles of cigars, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the windows—the glass was broken—it was quite safe at half-past six o'clock—I saw some cigars produced afterwards by the officer—I could not say whether they were mine or not.</p>

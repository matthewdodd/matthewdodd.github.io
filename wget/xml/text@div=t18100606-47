               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether you traced how it was done - A. I found the door had been forced with two large pieces of iron.</p>

               <p>THOMAS NEWBERRY. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner about eleven o'clock at night, on the first of May, at the Lord Nelson public house; he said Hopkins was concerned with him, I then put him in the watchhouse. In the morning he said, he was not the man that took the bed away, it was Williams and Harding, they took the bed to Wildings, in Green-court, they had thirty shillings upon it. When he came to the office the magistrate sent two officer's to fetch Wilding, he was not to be found. On Wednesday I searched Wilding's premises, the bed was never found.</p>

            . I am an officer. In the way to the watchhouse the prisoner was left at my house, his father and his friend were with him, he did not scruple of telling me, that the bed and the looking glass were sold at Mr. Wilding's for thirty shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no conversation of the kind at Mr. Craig's house. I was in company all that night with the woman, till between the hours of one and two. When she asked me to go with her to the Pantheon. I told her I was going home to bed. I worked all the next day. Mr. Newbury came in the public house at night, and said. I was his prisoner, he took me to the watchhouse. In the morning he brought me a pint of purl and a quartern of liquor mixed with it; he said he would be my friend. I have been in the habit of cohabiting with the woman for a twelvemonth. It is a piece of spite, Newberry had a warrant against me for cutting his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at 88, Liverpool Road—on Saturday, 11th October, at 1.30 p.m., I was in the Metropolitan Meat Market, and had four shillings, a sixpence, and threepence in my ticket pocket—there were people near me on both sides—the prisoner stood before me with his arms folded—I heard him say to his friend "Go along"—I turned round</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200062"></xptr>
               <p>and felt in my pocket and missed the money—I called to the piisoner"Will you give me my money? you have picked my pocket"—he said "No I never did pick pockets," and he went the nearest way out of the hall; I pursued and caught him—I said "Where is your friend going to? "he said "He has gone"—I said "I suppose you have not the money, but have given it to him?"—he said "I am a workman and never steal' you want to say I am a thief"—I said "Yes, I will give you in charge"—he said "What do you think I stole from you?"—I said "9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he took out his money and said "If I have had 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of you I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; don't give me in charge"—I said "I don't want your shilling; I'll give you in charge"—he then ran away—I followed and cried "Stop thief!" and in the Smithfield hay market he threw away some money—I was running after him about 10 minutes, and never lost sight of him, and was only about two houses from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I had said nothing to you before I saw the other man go away in the crowd and missed my money—I had only put it in my pocket a minute before—my coat was buttoned—I did not say "Give me my money and I will not lock you up"—I did not ask you to show me your money—you pulled out three shillings and sixpence and some coppers and offered me a shilling and went off—another man who ran after you and picked up the money you threw away was given in custody, but afterwards discharged—I was alone at the market.</p>

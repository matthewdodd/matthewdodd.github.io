                  </hi>. I am a licensed-victualler, of Wells-street, in the parish of Whitechapel. On Monday evening, 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Nov., I was the last person up—I saw everything secure—a partition encloses the bar, and the tap-room is on the opposite side—I am sure I left no one in the tap-room—it is twelve feet square—there are settles all round the wall, and between the walls—I did not look under the settles—the front door opens into the tap-room—I was awoke about twenty minutes past one o'clock, went down stairs, and saw the prisoner and policeman—I missed nothing—the club-room window was open—the maid-servant slept there on a sofa—the prisoner said he fell asleep in the tap-room—I found a match on the settle, under the window, in the maid's room—some similar matches were found on the prisoner, and three inches of candle.</p>

On this morning, about twenty minutes past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out of the premises, crawling close to the ground—he ran down Grace-alley, and I after him, springing my rattle, and calling, "Stop thief!"—he turned up North-east-passage, and was taken by policeman Green—I took him back—he was dressed as he is now, and had a skull-cap—I lost sight of him a few minutes—I found a candle near the door, not on him—the lead under the window was bent down a little, as if by a person climbing up—that would not make the least noise—it is a sash-window, and has a catch by the side of the frame, which falls, but sometimes it does not catch—the bed is on one side of the room, and the window on the other—the door is at the foot of the sofa—he would have to cross the end of the bed to get to the door. <hi rend="smallCaps">

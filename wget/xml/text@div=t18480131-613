On 11th., about half-past six, I was on duty in King William-street, and saw the prisoners—I watched them, and saw them accost several gentleman, lay hold of them and speak to them—I followed along King William-street, Princes-streetm, Lothbury, Threadneedle, Bishopsgate,. and Gracechurch-street into Princes-street again and up Moorgate-street, where a gentleman passed them walked rather un<lb></lb>steady—they turned round and followed him—Williams went up first and ac<lb></lb>costed him—he shook her off, she back to Wright, and they spoke together—Wright ran after the gentleman, took him by the arm, and followed him 120 yards—he turned down Ropemarker-street, she still held him by the arm—he broke away from her and crossed the street, she ran, laid bold of him</p>

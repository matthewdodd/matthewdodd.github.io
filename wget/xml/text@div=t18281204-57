               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are you? A.Sixteen: my father's name is Thomas - he has no partner; I was down stairs about ten minutes, during that time, there was nobody in the warehouse - my mother was there while I went in pursuit; the warehouse-door was bolted inside - the front street-door was open; there is a middle-door in the passage, which was fast - the person who ran away had a bag or handkerchief; I never said I was positive it was a bag - I did not see it in his hand while I pursued, but I saw it when he started from the glass case.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your warehouse is the court where I understand some watches have been found? A. About as far as from here to the corner of Newgate-street; I lost sight of him only for a moment or two - no bag was found on him; what he had appeared more like a brown canvas bag than any thing - nothing of the sort was found on him, nor in the way he had run; I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said some of his friends should call on your father, did he not represent that he was unjustly detained, and his friends, and their attorney should call? A. No - he said his friends should visit us again, and we should all get our deserts; he did not say he was not guilty when he was first taken - at the watch-house door he said he did not know what it was all about; the tub was in a dark corner of a shed in the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you take him from under the tub? A. He was underneath the tub, which was on a high stool- he said he was was easing himself; his dress was as perfect as it should be - I did not see him go under the tub; he turned into the gas-yard, and we lost sight of him for a moment.</p>

I joined in the pursuit, and saw him heave the watches away - he turned to heave them over a wall, but they struck against the wall, and fell back again; he threw them with both hands; I picked up one watch and one case, and gave them to the prosecutor's son, in the same state as I found them - there was a chain, seals, and a guard to the watch; I gave him the same as I picked up, and the same the prisoner tried to heave away - I stood a minute when I picked them up to see if the owner was by- he was not, and I ran on; I lost sight of the prisoner, but was present when he was taken in the gas-yard, under the butt - the prisoner is the man, I am certain; I saw him run across the square, and saw his face then, and he is the man who hove the watches away. I went to the watch-house, but did not go in, till they sent for me - the prisoner was there; he said if I appeared against him, his friends should do something to me - I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far were you from the person? A. Not above ten yards; I was passing the square - I could not see what he had in his hand when he ran across the square; he sumbled his hands about going down the court, and I saw him throw the watches away - I did not see any canvas bag; I did not lose sight of him above three minutes - I asked a girl which way he was gone when I took the watches up; she is not here: he had one corner to turn in the court after he threw them away; he was angry at the watch-house, and said we should repent of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the things fall that he threw away? A. Yes; it made a jingling noise - I instantly ran to pick it up, and another boy picked one watch up I am certain I picked up what he threw away.</p>

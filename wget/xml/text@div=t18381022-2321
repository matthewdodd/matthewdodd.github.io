About five o'clock in the morning of Saturday, the 6th of October, I placed myself near the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop-door—at a little past six o'clock the door was opened, and Owen came out of the shop, looked up and down the Strand, staid there half a minute, then went into the shop, staid a few minutes, and came out with another person—this other person went up a court which leads to Drury-lane—soon after I saw Fletcher come running as if he came from Charing Cross—on Fletcher's coming, Owen went into the shop, and Fletcher followed him in—Fletcher had a basket, which had nothing in it I am certain—he came out in three or four minutes, and his basket was very full—he went to Newcastle-street, where I stopped him—I asked him what he had got—he said meat which belonged to himself—I said I was an officer, he must go with me, as he came out of Mr. Bellringer's shop, who had lost a great deal of meat, I must take him—he said no more—I had not my uniform on—I found a shoulder of mutton, a piece of beef, and a loin of mutton in his basket—he had a coat on, which I told him to take off at the station-house, and I found a hind quarter of mutton in the hind pocket of it, which is very large.</p>

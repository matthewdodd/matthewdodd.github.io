                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 21st of January, about two o'clock in the day, the prisoner Dawson came into my shop, and offered me this silver table-spoon for sale—I asked how he came by it, and he acknowledged getting it at Green's hotel, Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn-fields—he said he found it amongst the dust—I asked him how he came to bring it away, being valuable property—he said it was their perquisite—I saw the other prisoner looking in at the window, and asked Dawson if that was his companion—he said it was, and I ordered him to call him in—I then asked Crocket if he knew where this spoon was found—he said, "Yes, amongst the dust"—I then asked how the spoon became</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Green's hotel, Lincoln's Inn<lb></lb>fields, kept by Mr. James Green. This is his spoon—the spoons there are in my charge—the prisoners were employed there to fetch away the dust—about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, the woman, in the hurry of busi<lb></lb>ness, had swept this spoon amongst the rubbish, and it was put into the dust—it was not missed till it was brought by the officer, about two in the day—the spoons are put into an iron-safe at night, but the man who has charge of the plate neglected to count it that night, or it would have been missed—it had been used over night, in the room No. 32, which is on the ground-floor, twenty yards from the dust-hole, which was the only place to which the prisoners had access at that time in the morning when they were there—this spoon must have been carried from No. 32, and been thrown off the plates in some way into the rubbish, and thrown with it into the dust-hole the next morning.</p>

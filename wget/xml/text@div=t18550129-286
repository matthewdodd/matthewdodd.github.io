                  </hi>. I am single, and have been living with the prisoner as his servant. On 13th Jan., between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, I was in a back room of the prisoner's house, No. 19, Wilmer's-gardens, Kingsland-road—I went there to fetch away the remainder of my clothes—I and the prisoner had been to several public houses previous to that—when he got to his house he was about to unlock the street door to go in—I snatched the key from him, and ran away with it—I was a good deal excited at the time—in about a quarter of an hour I went back to the prisoner's house, and he let me in—I went with him to the back room—there was a light there—directly I got into the room he stabbed me under the jaw—I raised my hand, and he nearly cut my finger off, I cannot tell what with—I bled very much from my neck—I called for assistance, and was taken to the hospital.</p>

About 10 o'clock, on this Satur<lb></lb>day night, I went to the prisoner's house, and saw the prosecutrix sitting in a chair in the first floor front room, bleeding from her right hand and neck—the floor was covered with blood—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the back bedroom—I told him that he was charged with stab<lb></lb>bing a woman, and must go to the station—he said, "I know I have done it, and I meant to have done it, and meant to have killed her, and I would not care if I had swung for it"—I took him to the station, and found this common hack knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his left hand waistcoat pocket, covered with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Coward, surgeon to the police, of the New North-road. Between 10 and 11 o'clock on this Saturday night, I was called to the police station, and found the prosecutrix with an incised wound on the cheek, and a gash inside the fore finger of the right hand—the wound on the cheek was three quarters of an inch wide, and down to the bone—a knife like this would produce both the wounds—neither of them was dangerous, no vital part was injured—I did what was necessary, and she was afterwards taken to a hospital.</p>

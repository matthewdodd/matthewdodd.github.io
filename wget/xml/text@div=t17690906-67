               <p>Q. Were they married.</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, they were not, as I know of. She died, I believe, five weeks ago, yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she come by her death?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. By an ax. The prisoner used to beat and abuse her several times. (I have seen him.) She had a cut on one side of her temple; it was a great hole. I think the prisoner did it by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think he did it?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. Because he ran away, and the ax was found bloody. That day I was with my mother in her room; she said, Peggy you may go out, I shall go to sleep. I went out, and never went into the room any more before I found her dead. This was about eight o'clock, when I went to breakfast in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the room in that time?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him with an ax?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this room where you left her from the kitchen?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. There is a long passage between.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her cry out?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, I did not. After she was dead, the prisoner went out, and went to an alehouse, about a mile and a half off. He was brought back, and charged with having killed my mother. He said he knew nothing about it. He was brought back by the ostler.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before the coroner?</p>
               <p>M. Phipps. No, I was not.</p>

            . I was out of the room, so I heard nothing. We did imagine my mistress was killed with an ax. (An ax produced in court, the pole end bloody.) It is my mistress's ax. I did not know, till this happened, but that the prisoner was my master. They lived as man and wife. He hired me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060046"></xptr> I had been but eleven weeks there. The ax was found in a cellar adjoining to the room where my mistress was killed. The wound was on her temple. We thought it was by the back part of the ax. On the Sunday before this he struck her with an iron poker, with much violence, over the crown of her head. I came in and prevented him, or he would have struck her again. The blood ran down very much: upon the account of that, and his going away, we suspected he was the man that had killed her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Banyard. I am a surgeon. On the 30th of July, between eight and nine in the evening, I was desired to go to the Lamb inn, to Mrs. Phipps. I found her all over bloody about her head and bosom. I asked her what was the matter; she told me that Taunton had beat her with a poker. I asked in what manner; she said they had been at supper, and having a cucumber in her hand, she asked him whether he would have it peeled, or eat it with the rhind on: he made no answer, but went to the fire place, took up the poker, held it to her, and bid her lay hold of it. She said, What for? He said, Lay hold of it. She said, If I must, give me the clean end, and not the smutty end; but what must I lay hold of it for? He answered, To knock my brains out. No, said she, Taunton, I will not hurt a hair of your head. Then, said he, If you will not knock my brains out, I will knock your brains out, and immediately struck her with the poker. The first blow was on the top of the crown of her head; it laid the scull quite bare: the second blow was upon the forehead; it cut her, I suppose, an inch and a half, quite to the scull. I attended her; she went on very well till the Friday, when the prisoner came in while I was dressing the wound. I said, Look here, Taunton, what a sad accident has happened! If you had killed her, you would certainly have been hanged. He said he knew very well he should be hanged, and was very sorry for it, hoped she would get well, and desired I would take all the care of her I could. Then I apprehended no danger from the wound: but on the Friday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went down to visit her again, when the daughter came out, and called a couple of men. I think I heard murder called. I asked what was the matter; they said they believed Taunton had killed Mrs. Phipps. Immediately I went into the room, and found the body lying on the left side, the head upon the arm, seemingly asleep, with the right arm hanging over out of the bed. I observed a bruise on the right temple, the size of the palm of my hand; the scull seemed to be beat in: it seemed to be done with the head of this ax, or a hammer. I am in no doubt but that that wound was the immediate cause of her death. The bed-clothes were not disturbed. I believe she could not have power to stir after that. There was a large quantity of blood about. When I came out, I said to the ostler, Why do you not pursue him? Then this man and another followed, and brought the prisoner back into the parlour. I asked him how he came to do it: he said he could not tell. I said, you will certainly be hanged; you have killed the woman. I know it, said he, for I did it with the poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he did it?</p>
               <p>Banyard. No, he did not. I do not believe he had seen the body then. The ax was found bloody the next morning, in the cellar, when they went to take an inventory of the goods.</p>

            . I keep the George inn on Snow-hill. I have known the prisoner a great many years. He sent for me to come to him to Clerkenwell New-prison, I believe five weeks ago to-day. He said his money was taken from him. I imagine he wanted me to help him to some. I asked him several questions in regard to this murder, and told him I was afraid he was guilty of it; he said he was, and it could not be helped now; but he was sorry for it. He killed the woman (this he said.) I asked him his reason for doing it; he said, because she told lies of him. I asked him what those lies were; he said she said he was not a man sufficient for a woman, and that made the women laugh at him; upon which account he was determined to kill her. These reasons he told me privately. Here are two witnesses that heard him own he killed her.</p>

            . I live at the Pack-horse at Poulton, in Gloucestershire. The prisoner called at my house one night. I went into the stable and heard a groaning; there the prisoner was lying on his belly, and his garters tied to a spur of a ladder, as high as a man could reach; but it had untied, and he was down We lifted him up; he could not stand; the blood came out at his mouth; we led him into the house, put him into a chair, and he came to himself. We asked him the reason of his doing that rash action; he said he had been out of his mind some time back. I went about a mile with him towards Colebrook. Sometimes he talked sensibly, and sometimes nonsensically.</p>

            . I live at Poolton. The prisoner came to my house about two days after Mr. Allen had taken him part of the way to Colebrook: this was going back again. He staid a day and a night. He was very uneasy; he could not rest. The next morning he set off for Colebrook.</p>

            . The prisoner was once going to jump into a ditch, in order to drown himself. The ditch was as deep as up to my waist. I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he was going to jump in?</p>
               <p>White. Because he had his coat and waistcoat unbuttoned, and said somebody should have his cloaths: this was the Saturday night before he beat the deceased with the poker.</p>

            . I lived at Tedbury in Gloucestershire. I have known him fourteen years. I now live in Turnmill-street, I am a plaisterer. I visited him in Clerkenwell prison. He was not the man as he used to be when I knew him drive our country waggon. I asked him about this action, and he always said he knew nothing about it. I said, if he did, the best way was to acknowledge it, and make his peace with God; but he always denied it.</p>

            . I drew up this case from facts I had heard in the country. I live at Harsley, in Gloucestershire. I have known him ten years. (He gave an account of seeing the prisoner on his journey in the country in a down melancholy way, and judged him either in trouble or out of his senses: he rather thought the former, as having heard he had married a woman that was in law circumstances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Victoria Place, St. Pancras—the prisoner occupied two parlours in my house for a week—he had lodged with me before, and I took him in out of kindness on account of his wife and children—his wife was in the hospital ill—on 15th September I went home to dinner about 12.30—my wife made a communication to me and I went up and knocked at the prisoner's door—he opened it and said "You old b—, I mean to do for you before I go"—he stabbed me several times, and said that every time—he gave me one stab behind my left ear and cut my chin—my wife came up and tried to take away the knife, but could not, and she was stabbed three times on her left breast over my shoulder—I fainted from loss of blood, and afterwards found myself in the hospital—I am still very weak and bad—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner—he is a shoemaker—he attacked me suddenly the moment I entered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>) He had been in the house a week this time, but before for two or three months on and off, going and coming—he had some children there; he has eight altogether—I went to his room to know the reason he was threatening our lives in the morning—that is what my wife said—when he opened the door I did not see his children—I did not see the table; he did not give me time—I won't swear that there was nothing to eat on the table—I spoke first—I said "What have you been kicking up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with my wife for?" and he immediately struck me—I did not lay hands on him first, or on his clothes, or take him by his throat and ask him what he meant by talking to my wife in the morning—I do not know whether they were having dinner, or whether his daughter Rhoda was in the room—I did not go in, but I was pulled in—I did not go down to quarrel with him, but I wanted to tell him that he had said something to my wife in the morning—there had never been any quarrels between any of us before—I got three stabs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on 15th September, about 8.30 a.m., I saw the prisoner at the foot of the stairs; he called my child an ugly animal—that was the first time I had seen him that morning—I asked him if it was my child he spoke to—he said "Yes, you d—old villain"—I asked him if he could make a pair of shoes before breakfast, and said "If you don't mind, standing there insulting me, I shall give you twelve months"—he said "I will give you two years looking through the bars"—his daughter told him to go and wash his mouth out—he went out with his children and I saw no more of him—my husband returned at 12 o'clock, and when he had eaten part of his dinner I told him the same as I have told you—he went and knocked at the door of the prisoner's room—I was on the first floor—I did not hear the words, but I heard a struggle, went down, and the prisoner had got my husband in front of him—I took my husband by the shoulders, took him away, and gave the prisoner notice to go on Saturday—I then found blood on my hands and laid hold of the prisoner, and he put the point of the knife through my fingers—finding I did not let go he <hi rend="italic">made at</hi> my left breast two or three times—my husband was very faint; two men led him out, and at the top of the gate he dropped, and was taken in a cab to University Hospital—a woman told the prisoner to put the knife down, and after some minutes he put it down on his board—we had no quarrel before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was in the house two months the first time, and nearly three months on and off—there are eight children—he did his work in the house, but sometimes I did not see him for two or three days together—my child used his broom in the yard and he told her to put it down and called her an ugly animal—I told him she did not hurt the broom—I do not remember calling him any names—I do not habit myself to using bad words—I do not know whether he was giving his children their dinner—they never had any regular dinner time; they had a piece of bread in their hands, but there was nothing to eat on the table—the children were all in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at University College Hospital when Winter was brought in; he was in a state of collapse and had lost a little blood externally—he had three wounds, a stab perforating his chest below the nipple and near his heart—one cut had gone under the skin and glanced off, not perforating the wall of the chest—the stab was dangerous—he was unconscious—I attended him a month and he has quite recovered—this knife would inflict the wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three wounds between 1 and 2 inches apart—I think they were deliberate wounds, and not done by the struggle; some amount of force was necessary.</p>

I took the prisoner after Winter was taken to the hospital—he was standing at his door, and as I advanced he came to meet me and said "I will give myself up, police<lb></lb>man, for I have done it in self-defence"—I said "What did you do it with? come back to the house and show it to me"—we went to his room and he searched and produced this knife with blood on it.</p>

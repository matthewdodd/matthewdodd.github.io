            Was you alone? - Yes, I was alone. Presently the door opened, the steps were let down in a great hurry, up jumps a person in a great hurry, and put a pistol to my head, said, that if I did not deliver all that I had -</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he asked for your money. - He demanded my money with the horridest oaths and imprecitions that ever I heard; I put my hand in my pocket, and I gave him all I had in my hand; he went to the light and see it was silver, and he came back again, and said, give me more; I put my hand in my pocket and gave him some more; he said again, give gold, or I will blow your brains out directly; I gave him all I had, I told him I had no more; he said, give me your cloak; I said, take it; he said, give me your watch; I said, take it; he says, you have silver buckles in your shoes, give me your shoes; I said take them; he took the right shoe, and I gave him the left. He shut the door, he went and robbed the coachman with the same behaviour, and then he took away the shoes and buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose by this he was on foot? - Yes, he was on foot. I heard a voice say, give the gentleman his cloak, do not take his cloak; with that he comes to the door and opens it, and throws my cloak in, cursing and swearing again, and then takes my buckles out of my shoes, and throws my shoes in through the glass of the carriage, that it broke the glass all to pieces, cut my face, and broke the second window, he threw them with such vengeance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea that the prisoner was the man? - I know his voice and his appearance, but I do not know his features; I have no doubt of his being the man, but I cannot swear to his features.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light, or how? - Being the 7th of October, six weeks ago, it could not be dark about half after six; yet it was so dark, that I could not distinguish persons near; the reason of that was, it was between the shades of high trees.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he stay with you? - I cannot tell, because I was in such a state as I never was in before; I could not count the time; three or four minutes perhaps.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110029"></xptr>Q. Upon your oath, what is your belief, as to the person that did it? - I have sworn to the property I have lost, except the money; I have sworn to the watch and buckles; I had his appearance by me some time after that; I saw him nights by the bed side, I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>

            When you say you saw him by your bed side, you mean the impression was on your mind? - Yes, his behaviour was so dreadful; I have wounds in my face, but whether it was by the glass or with his pistol, I cannot say; such was the confusion of my mind at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch again and the buckles? - Yes, they were found in the hands of the pawnbroker; and I have seen them, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner in custody? - They came down to me on Saturday morning, to let me know that they had taken him on Friday night, after he had robbed me on Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in custody, what was your belief then? - The same as it is now; I knew him the moment I see him, but his features I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man you did not see at all? - I did not see him. They told me at the office where I was, that such was the character of those that robbed me, that it was well I made no resistance, if I had I should have been dispatched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the gentleman whether I was the person that opened the chariot door? I never robbed a man on the road in all my life.</p>

               <p>Court. I hope bad as you have been, that you are now going to speak the truth; if you take away that man's life you know how much you increase your guilt. Tell us the truth? - As I told you before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110030"></xptr>when we committed the robbery, that I told you just before, we were obliged to move, we went to live in Spitalfields, and we went out on the road many nights, but this night we went to Edmonton-road, and in Edmonton we saw a carriage, and we thought it was not a fit place to rob it, we jumped up behind the carriage, till we come in a fit place, I had a cutlass in my pocket and Tomlinson a horse pistol, then it was agreed that I should jump down, and stop the horses, while he robbed the passengers, whoever was in.</p>

            Whereabouts was it? - It was between Edmonton and Enfield, about a mile on the other side of Edmonton. Then, as we agreed, I jumped from behind the carriage and catched hold of the horses head on the right hand side, and John Somlinson, as soon as it was stopped, went to the door and demanded the gentleman's money; and he robbed him of his watch, and a pair of shoe buckles, and seven shillings in money, as he told me, then he forcibly pulled the gentleman's cloak from his back, and it fell down on the ground, and as soon as Tomlinson had shut the door, I thought he wanted nothing else; I told the coachman to drive on, and he called to me, d-mn your eyes, I will rob the coachman; I said, I would not rob the coachman; he says d-mn your eyes, you are no man to go and leave me, I told him I did not want to leave him; so we went to the coachman and demanded his money; the coachman threw out a crown into my hat, whether he threw any thing into Tomlinson's I cannot tell, I was then going to make my escape across the fields, as we were going by, we see the gentleman's shoe lay on the ground, he took it up and threw it through the glass of the coach. We got home to Spitalfields about one, o'clock that night; in the morning, Tomlinson, or one Greaves, that was in the room, went to Mr. Davis's, and he came, I was in bed at the time, and I produced him the property from the bed, and I asked him thirty shillings for them; and he agreed to give me twenty shillings, and Tomlinson had half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the gentleman's cloak? - Tomlinson took it off the gentleman, and it fell down on the ground, and he afterwards threw it in the carriage, before we left the place.</p>
               <p>Q. The buckles and the watch are the same that you gave to Davis? - I can swear to the property if I see it again, I know the watch by the upper rim, the tortoiseshell is all knocked off, or wore off.(The buckles and watch shewn) This is the very same watch, and these are the buckles, but the tongues and chases is knocked out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man's character is so bad that he would swear any thing to save himself, he received four hundred lashes at Chatham, and deserted two nights afterwards, he is a deserted, in every regiment within fifty miles of the country. I am innocent of every thing that is laid against me; I never robbed a man on the road, never broke a house open, in all my life; if his shirt was stripped up, the marks would be seen on his back.</p>
               <p>Stacy. You seem very willing to convince any person that what I say is false.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you ever tried here, in the Old-bailey? - I was once, it was on suspicion of robbing my lodgings, but I was innocent of it, and cleared.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Charles Page, and live at Read-mead Lane, Wapping—on 7th January, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Cable Street—I had a gold watch, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in my watch-pocket in my dress, attached to a chain round my neck—as I was passing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186902010027"></xptr>
               <p>along the top of North East Passage, I was attacked by some person, who seised my chain and dragged me down the passage some considerable dis<lb></lb>tance, on my stomach—I had seen my watch safe a few minutes before on the swivel—it was a very heavy chain that it was attached to—as soon as the man got possession of my watch he ran away and left me lying on the ground—I can't identify the prisoner as being the person: I had not the slightest chanco of seeing him, I was on the ground immediately, and when I got up he was some distance from me—I can't say that I was kicked when I was on the ground—my ear was bruised—I had earrings on—when I got to the station I put my hand up and found the drop was gone, and only the wire left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my parents, at 31, Bette Street, St. George's—on the night of 7th January, about 6 o'clock, I was playing down North East Passage—I saw Mrs. Page there—when she got to the middle of the passage the prisoner came up—he knocked her down, and dragged her down the passage by the chain on her neck—he kicked her in the ear and broke her earring—I knew him before—I had seen him down there every day—heran away afterwards—I gave information to the police—I saw him at the station afterwards, amongst a lot of others—I knew him and pointed him out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say he "kicked her" in the ear and broke her earring, how many pieces did it break into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know, but I think it broke into two—I had a cold in my eyes at that time—one of them was covered with a handkerchief—I told the policeman the same night he did it—it was not Dunaway—I see the prisoner there every day when I am playing down there, when I come from school—I play there every day—I live in Betts Street—that is some distance off, but we used to live down there—I was playing with a lot of my school boys—my sister was there as well—there were six or seven boys there—the prisoner was outside a public-house, in the middle of the passage—I don't know the name of it—thereis no name over it—I can't write—I can read a little—we play at <hi rend="italic">hoop</hi> in the passage—it is not a very long passage—it is not much longer than this Court—it leads into Wellclose Square—we play in the middle of the passage—we sometimes play at <hi rend="italic">touch</hi>—Princes Square is just before you come to the passage—we do not play there—there are no school boys there—I go to a ragged school in Pell Street—we hide in the doors of the public-house—Cable Street is a very narrow street—when I am not at school I always play in North East Passage—we were going home just as we saw him do it—I had been home to tea and come out again—I have been at the ragged school about six months—I never spoke to the prisoner when I saw him there—I don't know where he lives—I did not know a boy named Armstrong—I know McCarthy, a shoeblack—I never played with him—I have known him a long time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Little Gray's Inn Lane—on the 16th August I went into a public-house for refreshment—I stayed there about half an hour—I saw the prisoner there; he was drinking with some other men—he offered me something to drink—about half an hour after, as I was returning home, I saw the prisoner lying on the ground, half on the pave<lb></lb>ment and half in the road—I said, "Get up, old friend"—I went to lift him up and felt something go into my leg—I pulled up my trousers and saw blood—I saw something in his hand, and took it away; it was this knife—I was then taken to the hospital—I lost a great deal of blood—I had done nothing to provoke him—he was very drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Liquorpond Street—about ten o'clock I was going along; I saw the prisoner on the ground—the prosecutor went to pick him up—he tried to pull him up, and the prisoner took out a dagger from his pocket and stabbed him in the leg—a policeman came past, and he gave it to him—the prosecutor did not provoke him in any way.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on 16th August—I examined him—there was a wound on the side of the right leg about half an inch in depth—his trousers were cut—it was not a severe wound—it was done with an instrument like this dagger.</p>

I live at 3, King Court, Minories, and am a labourer—on 27th July, about 3.30 a.m., I went up Commercial Street, and there was a fight with the keeper of the lodging-house where the prisoners lived—one of them asked me to tell his wife lie was looked up, and about 4.30 I saw the prisoners come in—Bryan had gone oat in his shirt-sleeves, he came in with a new coat on—Wilson said, "Come up and lay down in bed for half an hour"—he also had a coat, with bin, and I saw Bryan sell a coat for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

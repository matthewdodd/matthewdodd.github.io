                  </hi>I am the wife of John Henry Rivers, who keeps the Fox and Hounds public-house, Gilbert-street, Southwark-bridge. On the 17th of December, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came for a pint of porter—I served her—she gave me a bad shilling, but I did not see that it was bad then—I gave her change, and put the shilling into the till, where there was no other—I went to the till in the course of a quarter of an hour, took out the shilling, and found it was bad—I placed it on the bar-parlour mantle<lb></lb>piece, under the foot of the looking-glass—it remained there till the even<lb></lb>ing of the 26th, when my husband gave me a bad shilling which he had just taken—I marked that, and the one I had taken of the prisoner on the 17th—I gave them to the policeman—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—this is the one I took on the 17th.</p>

It is not a bad one"—I turned to my wife, and said, "It not this the party that passed a bad shilling to you? "—she said it was—the pri<lb></lb>soner denied it—I sent for the policeman, and gave her in charge—I gave the shilling to my wife—she marked it, and gave that and the other to the policeman.</p>

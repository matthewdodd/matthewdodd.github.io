On the 31st of December, I went with my master's waggon - Eltridge drove it; it had a load of hay, and two trusses of hay for the horses -Edgware is on the road to London, and when we got to the George I saw Eltridge get up into the waggon, and throw one truss of hay down, Lee took it, and carried it into his loft; I did not say any thing then, but I told of it the next night, which was Saturday, and the prisoners were taken on the Monday; that truss was one of those I had seen put on the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How long have you been in Mr. Moate's service? A. Since Michaelmas Eltridge was there; I assisted in loading the waggon - I had not left the waggon; I do not know what was done with the hay afterwards - we were in the habit of calling at that inn, and giving the horses corn, but never any hay there; I have never had any quarrel with Eltridge -I did not hear him say any thing to Lee; there were two examinations before the Magistrate - I said both times that it was a truss of hay; I saw the hay loaded, and these two trusses were for the horses.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You found your own hay for the horses? A. Yes; it was not the practice to give out hay- Lee took it up, and said nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your master's house from there? A. About twenty miles - we had four horses; I went up with the load; it was sold in London - all the hay was my master's; there was a load and three quarters on the waggon, and the two trusses for the horses; we stop at the George, in going down - I do not know what had become of that hay - the horses never had it, they had the other truss; they had corn at the George.</p>

             is my carter. I sent off the load, and the two trusses of hay for the horses; they stop at the George, but do not have hay there; it is not usual to throw a truss down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever prohibited them from giving hay? A. It is the general rule not to give hay at the inns, but chaff and corn; I do not know that I ever laid down that rule to Eltridge in particular - I had not told Lee he was not to buy any hay of me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is it your practice to sell single trusses on the road? A. No.</p>
               <p>Eltridge. It was not a truss.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. It was a truss of clover hay.</p>
               <p>Eltridge. I threw it down for my horses to eat.</p>

               <p>Lee. And I took it into the yard - Eltridge took it out again, and put it on the front of the waggon.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. It was not taken up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the waggon all the time you were at the inn? A. No.</p>

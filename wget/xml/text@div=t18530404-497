                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>, I can undertake to say that this silk twist has not been sold—we attach a label to all silk twist that we send out; the label of the London house—we never sell any without attaching the label to it—that is our usual course of business—the label is attached with gum—there has never been any label attached to these—in this lot here is 1 lb. on eight reels—I never sold any of these to the prisoner—here is another lot and some of these reels have not the labels on them—these are <hi rend="italic">legee</hi> twist I can swear to the manufacture of these, and they have not been sold—here is a pencil mark on this other parcel which was put on it by our boy when we took stock—it would not have been sold with this mark on it—if it had been sold it would have been put in another paper, and it would have been labelled—this other parcel I can swear to, as being our goods; I cannot swear whether it had been sold—these articles we are selling every day—the two parcels of twist are what I can swear to as not having been sold—the prisoner used to be at our premises almost every day, he called to see Mr. Taylor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the business you carry on extensive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two persons in the establishment besides myself—Mr. Taylor only is authorised to sell goods—if Mr. Taylor and myself were absent, the boy would of course be forced to sell—it may be so that there have been instances in which goods have been sent out without labels—I am not aware of it—it might have occurred—the same sort of goods are made by other manufacturers in the trade, but they are made up in a different manner—there are several other manufacturers at Leek, but our goods are made up differently to any other manufacturer—they differ in the way in which the twist is put on the reel, and if you take the twist off you will find there is a small bit of paper on the reel under the twist—I will undertake to say that that peculiarity is not to be found in the twist of any other manufacturer—that I say positively—I have been at Leek and seen the twist wound, and it is known in the trade—I could bring twenty persons to prove it—this black sewing silk was ours—I cannot undertake to say it was not sold—I have always considered the prisoner to be a respectable man—his name is Griffith—I did not know him passing by any other name—I did not know him in the country—I have known him in London about four years; he came to the warehouse to see Mr. Taylor almost every day—I do not know the nature of the business there was between them—I saw him leave the establishment day after day—he did not always leave the premises in company with some one—we never thought of watching him—when I have been in the counting house, I have frequently seen him go out—I could see him from the counting-house to the door—we only sell to wholesale houses—I cannot say to how many in London—we send to Manchester—I know that from Leek they send everywhere, and all the goods are made up in the same way—we took stock on 31st Dec.—not at the end of Jan.—I cannot say that I know that the prisoner was in pecuniary difficulties.</p>

Worthington may have supplied other houses in Manchester—supposing them to have done so, and the Manchester house to have sold them, I should not have expected to find our boy's mark on the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant in the establishment of Mr. Worthington—I have been there ten years—I know the prisoner by the name of William Griffiths, never by any other name—it is the custom in our business when this twist is sold always to put on it a label, which we have engraved in London for our own use for the London house—that is our invariable practice, we never send them out without such a label—I never knew an instance in which it was done—this parcel has our boy's mark on it, and this other has Mr. Russell's mark—this drab twist is our manufacture—I am quite certain this has been in our possession—supposing it had been sold, it would not have been sold with this mark on it—this mark, 1 lb. 8oz., is the mark of our boy at the time of stock taking, on 31st Dec. 1852—I can speak to this grey silk; it was dyed to eight different shades—there are eight different shades in each bundle; about the beginning of Feb., we had about 30 lbs. come up, dyed to our own patterns and shades—they were in six different packages, eight shades in a bundle—I have not the least doubt that this property was in the possession of my employers—I went carefully over the stock when they were taking stock, and I went over it to see if anything was missing about fortnight ago—we are short altogether in the aggregate, about 150 lbs. weight—Mr. Russell and myself, and the porter are in our establishment—if Mr. Russell and I should be absent, which is a very rare occurrence, the porter would sell things and make a memorandum, and we should enter it when we came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the age of the boy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nineteen—when Mr. Russell and I are absent he serves, but that does not happen once in three months—Mr. Russell has not been ill since Christmas—his father died, and in consequence he was absent one day—if I were away during his absence, the porter would have the charge of the house—I am certain this grey silk is of different shades—it is common to have silk dyed in different shades, these are for tailors—it is customary to have various shades dyed—the mark on this paper is the handwriting of the porter—it is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was the stocktaking mark, but there is more in it now—we fill up papers</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person came in for a parcel of things, would you take one of these old packages and wrap it in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew it to be done—no instance has ever occurred to my knowledge of an acquaintance coming in with a book or other article which required to be wrapped up, and one of those old covers being given him—I have been on terms of intimacy with the prisoner—I have known him sixteen years up to the present time—I never had any suspicion, but that he was a highly respectable man, I knew him in Shropshire—I know he has a wife, and a large family—I know that from connection with railways he has been in difficulties—I think he came to town about five years ago—I knew of an action being brought against him by a namesake of mine—he was defendant in an action about Christmas last, and while the trial was at Guildhall he called frequently at our warehouse—he came to ask me if I could speak to a fact—I believe there was a compromise of some kind—I know he expected a judgment against him—I never knew him to take any other name or go by one.</p>

               <p>shut up he would walk up the street, and join Mr. Taylor at the corner of the street—in some cases, in winter, he would have a Mackintosh on his arm, and sometimes he has had a leather bag—I never sold anything to him—I sell things in case of Mr. Russell and Mr. Taylor being out—I have no doubt I have sold twist—I make a memorandum, or enter it in the book—there are labels attached to it—I have not sold any without attaching labels, only to one customer—he has had about half of one of these parcels without a label—that is Mr. Popplewell—sometimes, when it was wanted expressly for particular orders, he had had it without labels—that was one pound or half a pound—these are two pound parcels—here is one paper with my mark on it—I should sell it in that way—it would go out in that way, with that mark on it, if I sold it—I could not swear whether I ever sold a parcel as large as this with this mark on it—if I sold it I should sell it with that mark on it—in that paper, but another brown paper round it.</p>

Q.</hi> You have wrapped up things for the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Once I wrapped up a coat in a sheet of brown paper—I have not wrapped up other things for him on any other occasion—I have not seen Mr. Taylor do anything of the sort—I never saw him wrap up a book—I never saw any parcel wrapped up for him except the one I have mentioned—the prisoner has gone out alone after I put up the shutters; he would walk out, and Mr. Taylor would close the door and go out—the goods were not put away before we shut up, the things were lying about on the counter—I saw the prisoner go out a great many times—I saw him walk out of the door—I have seen Mr. Taylor go out with him time after time—when he has been on the premises some one has been with him all the time, or most of the time—Mr. Taylor stopped merely to shut the door and put the padlock on.</p>

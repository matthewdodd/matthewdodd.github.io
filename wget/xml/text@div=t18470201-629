About six o'clock in the evening, on the 18th of Jan., I was in the Old Kent-road—I saw the two prisoners in company, and watched them for three quarters of an hour—I saw Smith open the garden-gate of the house No. 3, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road—he went up some steps to the door—he looked up at a number of boots that were exposed for sale at the shoe-maker's shop next door—they hung about ten feet from the ground—he went out again, and joined Johnson, who was standing three or four yards from the garden-gate, about seven yards from where the goods were—Smith returned and cut down this pair of boots, and walked away with them—I heard some person cry out—Smith threw the boots down, and both the prisoners walked away in the same direction—I took Smith—Johnson ran away—my brother officer pursued and brought him back.</p>

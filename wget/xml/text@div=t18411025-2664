                  </hi>. I live in Conduit-street, Bond-street. In September last my wife was staying at Herne Bay—on the 21st of September I wrote a letter to her, addressed to "Mrs. Meyer, at Mr. Piercey's, 3, East-street, Herne Bay, Kent"—I gave it to Hugh Jones—there was half-a-yard of Irish cambric, a strip across the cambric, which I bought as a pattern, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in it—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was in the letter—it has two names on it, by which I know it, besides the date and number, which I took at the time—on the 23rd, in consequence of hearing from my wife, I went to the Post-office and gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Dawes. On the 21st of September I remember receiving three letters from Jones—one was directed to Mrs. Meyer—I received the postage of that letter—I put it into the paid letter-box—the prisoner was in Mr. Dawes's employ at that time—he had the opportunity of observing the letters—he was in the shop that day—no one but him and I had access to the letter-box—I did not see the letter after I put it into the box—on the 22nd I had occasion to send the prisoner into the City between two and three o'clock—he returned between five and six.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was sent for to the solicitors office at the General Post-office, on Saturday, the 25th of September—Mr. Peacock, myself, the prisoner, Mr. Phillips the clerk, and Mr. Elb, another clerk, I believe were there—the first thing said to the prisoner was that a letter had been posted at his master's house containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a piece of cambric, since that the note had been changed at the Bank of England, and the writing on it much resembled his handwriting; and from this cir<lb></lb>cumstance his person and lodging must be searched—he made no objective—I asked him where he lived—he said, "No. 7, Tyler-street, Regent-street"—I asked him if he had got any money at home—he said, "Yes, he believed his wife had got three or four sovereigns—I asked him where she got it—he said she saved it from her last situation—I then went to No. 7, Tyler-street, and asked if Mr. Poor lived there—I found a woman an<lb></lb>swering</p>

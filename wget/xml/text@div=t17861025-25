            ; on the 30th of September, I had been out to Covent-Garden market, and was returning into Bloomsbury, between eight and nine, where I live, two girls passed me and returned into the middle of the street, and the tallest of the girls struck at me, I was on the foot-path, the tallest of the two attempted to strike me, I shrunk back, I received a blow on my nose and the side of my face; she struck me again, and I received a blow on my neck near my throat, with her hand, with her fist; at the same time, the same person that struck me tore my locket from my handkerchief, and my handkerchief all down, she ran by me and went towards Covent-Garden; I was stupified with the blow for a moment, I did not call out for any assistance, but on recovering myself I turned round and saw she had turned into the Pizzas, I saw my locket in her hand with a piece of my handkerchief, she turned round and d - d me for a b - h, and held up her fist.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It might be half an hour or thirty-five minutes after eight.</p>
               <p>You spoke of two of them? - Yes, the other stood by the side of me all the time, but did not meddle with me at all; she did not offer to assist me nor make her escape.</p>
               <p>Did she go away when the tall one went off? - No, she stood still.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to say against the woman at the bar? - I will not swear to her, but I believe she is the woman.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see her? - That was on the Saturday evening, and I saw her on the Monday night at the watch-house in company with two more; I saw the locket before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you before she struck you? - Nothing to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Had you pushed against her, or any thing of that kind? - No, I saw them there and gave way; they came from behind me, they went on before to the dark part of the street, and turned back and met me, by that time I was got to the dark part of Hart-street, which leads into <placeName id="t17861025-25-crimeloc145">James's-street</placeName>

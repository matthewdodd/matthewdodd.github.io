                  </hi>. I am a chaser, and live in Tudor-place, Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 14th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was out—my apprentice came to me—I returned with him, and found the prisoner and my daughter in the shop—I asked him for the silver—he denied having it—my daughter said, "Don't tell a story, I saw you put it in your pocket"—I sent for a policeman—the prisoner attempted to go into another stop—I prevented him—he took off his boots, and shook them—he then took off his coat, and threw it into an adjoining shop—he then took off three waistcoats, and threw them at me, and said, "There is your silver"—it was not there—he then took off his trowsers, and then his belt—the policeman arrived, and searched him, but found nothing on him—the silver was found on the floor, under his coat—it was impossible for it to have fallen on the floor there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the apprentice. The prisoner came in, and wanted some iron wire—I saw him pick up some silver wire—I told him to put it down—while he was talking to me he slipped it into the skin, and took it away, and as I came back I saw him take the silver wire up, and put it into his pocket—I asked him for it—he said he had not got it—I afterwards saw it found under his coat—it was in another part of the that I saw him put it into his pocket.</p>

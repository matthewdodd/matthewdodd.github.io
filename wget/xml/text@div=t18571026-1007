                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of No. 47, Mark Lane. I am acquainted with persons who are members of the Submarine Telegraph Company, Cornhill—I know Mr. Cadogan by sight—a gentleman named Sandiland, a friend of mine, is connected with the Company—about 4th Aug., I cannot recollect the day, I met the defendant, Evans, at a luncheon house, leading out of Lombard Street—I knew him before—he asked me if I had seen that correspondence in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, about the telegraph, I said that I had not—he said that it was Sir James Carmichael's letter, and that he was going to answer it, and was going to see Mr. Sampson, of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I saw him shortly after that day, either the Friday or Saturday after, I think it was Saturday, 8th—I met him accidentally at the Blackwall Rail<lb></lb>way Station, about 12 o'clock in the morning; I said, "Evans, I have not seen that letter of yours in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>"—he said, "I have got it in my pocket now, and I will show it to you if you will come with me "—he pro<lb></lb>duced it, and I read it; he said that he was going to take it to Mr. Samp<lb></lb>son, to see if he could recommend any alteration in it before it was pub<lb></lb>lished—I have known Evans two or three years, merely by seeing him is the office of the Submarine Telegraph Company when I used to go there; he was acquainted with persons connected with the Company.</p>

I have the conduct of the City news connected with the <hi rend="italic">Times newspaper</hi> On Wednesday, 5th Aug., Mr. Evans came to me with reference to a letter which had been published, from Sir James Carmichael, in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the preceding day, that he could contro<lb></lb>vert</p>

               <p>the statement as far as regards the purity with which the matters of the Telegraph Company were managed; he said that he had been in the service of the Company—I asked him if he had been discharged from their service; he said, "No," and produced a letter, a testimonial, which he stated that he had received from the Company on leaving it—I then told him that I could not enter into his statement then, but that he had better put what be had to say in the form of a letter and send it to me; he said that he would do so, and there on that day the interview terminated—on Saturday, 8th, Evans called on me again, with Mr. Thorn; he then said that he had prepared the letter, and wished me to read it; I did so (it has been cut up for printing)—he said that all the statements in that letter were within his own knowledge—I said, "They may be, except in one case; you make a statement here which you cannot say is the case; you may assume it, and you may believe it, but you cannot positively know it; and if you like to put in the words, "I assume", that will meet it, but this is a very grave affair; you must be prepared to meet it, and therefore you cannot be too cautious "—I see the words, "I assume," put in here; this is the letter—I should think it was about half past 2 o'clock, at the earliest, that they came, and they were there about twenty minutes—Thorn took hardly any part in he conversation, but when I pointed out the serious character of the letter, he made a remark as if he considered that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> must judge of that; it struck me that the remark was intended to throw responsibility on the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with regard to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am by profession a barrister. I was one of the promoters of what is now the Submarine Telegraph Company—from the year 1852 down to the end of 1854, I was constantly at the offices of the Company, and for long periods, daily—at that time the arrangements were almost in embryo, and were being perpetually changed—the internal arrangements in connection with the clubs and other places, and also the Continental arrangements, had to be made—those were all made from 1852 downwards to 1854—I attended constantly at the office during those periods—the course of a message proceeding to the Continent is this: it is brought by the sender to the counter on the, ground floor, where the number of words is computed; the money is paid, and the mes<lb></lb>sage is taken up by a lift to the transmitting room, the instrument room; the message is then sent to its destination immediately, if there is no other message on the file previously sent up; if there are other messages to be sent by the same instrument, it is placed underneath, and is dispatched in its turn—the duty of dispatching it in its turn would attach to the superin<lb></lb>tendent of the room in the first place, and to the transmitting clerk at the instrument in the second place—Evans held the position, until he was discharged, of superintendent of the submarine telegraph room—he was also superintendent of another telegraph under the same roof—he was the superintendent of the room in which the submarine telegraphic messages were received and dispatched—there were a good many other clerks, all of them under him—the history of a message coming from abroad is this: it is received on and by the instrument in connection with the foreign and Continental line, or town, as the case may be, say Paris; it is received at an instrument in a room at No. 30, Cornhill; that room contains several instruments, several clerks; in the centre, the superintendent's table, and the superintendent; in one corner is the dispatch office, with a hole in the wall, or door; it is received in manifold; that is to say, the clerk reads off the message, and writes it in manifold; that is done either by the clerk at the instrument or by his assistant—as soon as the message is complete, he hands it to the superintendent sitting in the centre of the room—that is the room where Evans was superintendent; he had complete authority; he was supreme there—having been received by the superintendent, it is read by him, the words are counted by him, the message is prepared for trans<lb></lb>mission, and all the different formularies are arranged upon it; the hour, etc., is seen to be correct—I believe the time is inserted by the superin<lb></lb>tendent, but I am not sure, or by his clerk—it is inserted or checked; then it is handed to the clerk, who sits near the door—by him it is put into an envelope, and sealed; he makes some signal, either rings or knocks, I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260021"></xptr>
               <p>know which, and he hands the message, through a trap in the door, to the boy, the next boy on the rota for taking messages—my position is inva<lb></lb>riably in the boardroom—that is where my desk is, and that is where I sit when I am there—unless I was in the superintendent's room, I could not by any possibility have the first access to the messages—all Government mes<lb></lb>sages are in cipher, except those that are upon public matters; for instance, I should think the list of killed and wounded, or the history of a battle, would not be in cipher; but, to the best of my belief, all matters of Govern<lb></lb>ment correspondence are in cipher, wherever it is practicable—it was not my habit to interfere with the transmission of messages, or to have one message placed before another—I have no recollection whatever of a dispatch from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to Lord Clarendon, dated Constantinople, Dec. 3rd, and Vienna, 13th, nor of the funds falling half per cent, in rela<lb></lb>tion to such a message—I cannot swear that I did not see the contents of such a message—I can swear I do not recollect it—if I did see it I can swear I did not use it for any purpose, or look at it for the purpose of using it in any way, taking it in the broadest possible sense—I have never used the contents of any such message for my own private purposes—I never employed a person named Edenstein, in London, to send a message to a person named Jacquemont, at Paris—I never heard the name until I saw it in the libel—during the time Evans was in the service I frequently looked at the contents of the forwarded, and received Continental messages—I did that for several purposes connected with the administration of the office—I never used that knowledge for private purposes, or for any purpose whatever—I have given instructions to forward news to my private residence, but not in the sense in which it may be contemplated—the only cases in which I can recollect having desired any news to be forwarded was during the war, upon questions in which I was very deeply interested, having relations engaged in the war; therefore, when the news came of the list of killed and wounded, I have on several occasions, when I have not been at the office, had those sent up to my house—they were certainly not sent up to my house until they had been made public—they never came to me until hours after they had appeared in print, or in some public source—I can swear that that was the character of the message—I never had a commercial message sent up to my house, or a message connected with the funds, or pecuniary matters—the messages that were sent to me were purely those which had reference to the engagements in which my brothers and friends were, in the Crimea—I imagine the allusion in the libel to an Indian tele<lb></lb>graph received by Austrian Lloyds, alludes to this transaction; in 1853 the Company laid down wires to the West End, to four or five club houses; at the time those wires were opened, the Company made an arrangement with a news agent at Paris, of the name of Havarse, who is a general news agent at Paris, to supply them with a summary of news in the afternoon; and that summary of news, which he was in the habit of supplying at a fixed price, was to be sent to the different club houses, into which buildings our wires were taken—we did that more as an advertisement—it lasted a very short time—on one occasion Havarse's message arrived containing the Indian summary which belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and I believe, also, to the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi>, who were associated with them—Havarse's summary contained the fact of this Indian message arriving at Marseilles—it was just then that the Submarine Telelegraph Company was completing its arrangements with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for the reception of its messages, both by Marseilles and Trieste—I gave instructions at the office that this message of Havarse's, containing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260022"></xptr>
               <p>this improper matter, or rather this private matter, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, should be forwarded—at this distance of time, I can hardly tell what the message contained, but I desired it to be sent to the club houses—it was not sent only to my club, Brookes's—to the best of my belief, it was sent to the four or five club houses with whom we dealt, but I cannot swear that I was not at the club at the time—I had a communication with Mr. Mowbray Morriss on the subject, and I explained the matter to him by letter—there were written communications between us—I never ordered a dispatch to be forwarded to Mr. Seymour Clark—I do not know Mr. Clark—I have never seen him to my knowledge—I have never spoken to him—I have not the most distant conception of anything about Mr. Seymour Clark, except that I see his name printed up as manager of a railway com<lb></lb>pany—the Rothschilds deal with us constantly, daily.</p>

               <p>not seen Mr. Evans for four days, that Mr. Evans was laid up at Gravesend with a bowel complaint—he read me a note from Mr. Evans to himself, stating that he was ill, and he showed me Mr. Evans' testimonials in an envelope; one was the testimonial of my own secretary, who is dead now, one of the secretaries of the Submarine Telegraph Company, and other private papers belonging to Evans, stating that Evans had left the matter entirely in his hands; he represented him, as he was unable to be in London himself—I asked him why he brought me this letter; in the first place he gave me the libel to read, and I read it out loud, and returned it to him—I said, "I must have a copy of it"—he objected at first, without assigning any particular reason, but subsequently he said that I should have a copy, but that it was necessary for him to consult a friend before he gave it, but he pledged his word as a gentleman that I should have a copy that night—he repeatedly drew my attention to the fact that he had had heavy pecuniary engagements with Mr. Evans and with gentle<lb></lb>men "at this end of London," that was his expression, that he was mixed up very deeply in money matters with Evans—he volunteered that repeatedly—I should think he said it half a dozen times—he added that he was in Evans's power, that he thought it very imprudent of Evans to write such a letter, that it must be manifestly to my interest and the interest of the Company that this should not appear; he repeated that several times, and that was pretty much the substance of the conversation, except that it was repeated over and over again—I rather think he said that he was very sorry Evans had written the letter, it was very imprudent, and he would have nothing to say to it—I think he said that, but I am not sure, but it extracted this observation from me, "What is the use of your bringing me this letter, <hi rend="italic">non constant</hi> that Evans may not have sent it to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> at this present minute?"—he said, "Oh no, the matter is left entirely to me; here are all Evans's credentials and his papers, and I am quite certain it will not be sent to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> except through me"—that is the sum and substance of the first conversation; he then left, arranging to come back at half past 9 o'clock, after seeing his friend—he came back at half-past 9 o'clock, and then he said to me, "Mr. Cadogan, I wish you to release me from my promise of giving you a copy of the letter"—I said, "Mr. Thorn, I have no sort of idea of releasing you from your promise; and as I shall certainly take legal proceedings on this matter, I advise you to let me have a copy of the letter now, which otherwise I shall extract from you in a court of law"—he hesitated considerably, but I pressed him very much to let me have a copy, and the result was, that he sat down in the library at my father's house, and he copied the letter, and handed it to me; he signed it, I signed it, and my wife signed it with her initials—at that second interview he again alluded to the pecuniary position that he was in, with Evans, and he brought in this money question by the neck and heels, as before—he mentioned the money question on the second occasion without any allusion of mine whatever to it—he then left—I took an opportunity of communicating these circumstances to the managers of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and on the following Monday or Tuesday I applied to a police court—that is the copy of the letter, signed by myself.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260025"></xptr>
               <p>messages at my private house, private messages, such as any individual might receive—I have had messages from different parties, as any one else may have, and I have had messages on service very often—I have used our telegraph to the out stations, to Dover and those places—these were not always messages connected with the working of the office—they were frequently pri<lb></lb>vate messages of my own, frequently from abroad, entirely of a private charac<lb></lb>ter—I believe I have not constantly received public messages at my private house, sent from other parties to other parties—I cannot recollect receiving more than half a dozen messages of the description you allude to; they were only the battle messages and the events of the war, and I have had none since of any sort or kind—there is no file of public messages—I tell you, as I told you before, I have occasionally had constantly to examine the file of messages—I was not in the daily habit of examining the file of messages—it may have occurred several times a week, not examining the messages through, but doing it for a certain purpose—I am trying to give an answer that will explain the purpose—the tariff arrangements that, are made by the foreign governments were then being perpetually changed, and the working of the office to meet these tariff arrangements was being perpetually changed; there were very difficult technical questions as to the transmission of messages over foreign lines; those subjects were constantly before me, and constantly required my reference—some two or three months ago the foreign governments, if you will allow me to give you an illustration, made another very arbitrary rule about the number of words to be contained in a message at a given price; it was then for us to consider whether the reduction from twenty-five words, I think it was, to twenty or fifteen, could be made; and I should think for two or three days, two or three months ago, the superintendent on duty had constant communications with myself and with other directors upon the subject, and I dare say I must then have seen fifty private messages—it was for that express purpose, but what they were I have not the slightest notion—no particular duty was cast on me at all, but I was generally living in London, and many of the directors do not, the chairman at any rate, does not live in London—I, as one of the promoters of the concern, took a great interest in it, and virtually all the internal arrangements, at least a great many of them, were left to myself and the chairman, and were ratified by the board if they thought proper—as a question of degree, I should think I was the only director that took such an active part in the instrument room; many of the questions came under the view of the chairman as well as myself—there was an order made that nobody was to come into the instrument room without the permission of the secretary; it was made at my request and the chairman's; a printed order, I think it was; we had reason for making it—the order was that no one should go into the instrument room except the directors, unless authorised by the secretary—I do not know whether the directors were excepted in the printed order or not, but they were not <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, because they were there—to my knowledge, complaints have not been made that I was constantly in the instrument room; never in my hearing; I do not believe it was said by Mr. Brett; this is the first time I have ever heard of it—I have not the slightest recollection of Mr. Brett complaining, in my presence, that I was too often in the instrument room; I could almost swear that he did not; the question has never arisen—I know a Mr. Edwards—I have never been charged, in his presence, with being too much in the instrument room, never that I recollect—you take me by surprise—to the best of my belief, I have not the slightest recollec<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>of it, or of any circumstance that could lead to it—it would not be the duty of the accountant to look at the messages on account of the alteration of the tariff; his duty would be merely to see that the moneys were paid and the tariff complied with—that would depend on the number of words sent—that was not my only object; my object was not to verify the amount taken or received, but upon the general principle; matters were then and are still perpetually being changed—there are no private companies abroad; the whole is in the power of the foreign governments, and they are perfectly arbitrary in their arrangements—I was constantly doing all this until the end of 1854, when I went to the Crimea—from 1852 to 1854 I was constantly at Cornhill, doing this, except when I was away, which was very often—I do not mean to say that there were alterations in the tariff week after week—I was not at Cornhill for the sole purpose of any question of tariff; I was there for matters, as you have extracted from me, in connection with four different companies.</p>

               <p>time when our wires were all broken down—that message is no doubt here—we have every message of Rothschild's tied up here, therefore it must be amongst them; but I do not know which it is—(<hi rend="italic">papers produced</hi>)—I have now all Baron Rothschild's messages before me; here is one dated 3rd Feb., and one dated 4th Feb—I cannot tell whether this is the message to which I was asked to give precedence; the libel states that there is a memorandum on the message—I cannot say whether either of these is the message to which I gave precedence, I have every reason to believe not—there is no note of Evans on any one message; there is none on any of Baron Roths<lb></lb>child's—I have not myself looked over them all for the purpose of ascer<lb></lb>taining it, but they have beep examined for that purpose—every message is numbered—they are numbered in the instrument room, but at what period of the history of the message I do not exactly know—it is the duty of the superintendent, or the person who receives the messages, to number them according to their order, but I do not know when they are numbered—of course, "first come, first serve" is the great principle upon which we go—there is no message here bearing any mark; all the messages are here that went through' the office on 3rd and 4th Feb—they are numbered consecu<lb></lb>tively, I do not know whether it is done as they arrive—I say so most dis<lb></lb>tinctly and emphatically—if half a dozen messages are brought up from down stairs, from where the public have delivered them, I do not know by what machinery those messages are separated and numbered in the course as they arrive—they have consecutive numbers, and they are regis<lb></lb>tered by those numbers—I think they have almost invariably the time on them at which they are sent, but I think not always—I do not know the date of Baron Rothschild's message to which I gave precedence, I have no recollection whatever—that was the only occasion on which I gave that precedence—I did not. myself go through all these messages before the sum<lb></lb>mons was heard at the police court, to see whether I could find the message of Baron Rothschild—I gave instructions that it should be done by the officers of the Company—no message has been discovered which I recognize as the one I ordered to be so transmitted—I gave order for the precedence of that message, because. I conceived it to be a case in which I could do so without injury to the public, and without giving it any unfair priority over say other persons—I never did it in more than one instance; it was applied for in another instance, and refused—I may, in the case in point, myself have taken up a message of Rothschild's, and put it forward for transmission—I should think I probably did hand the message to the superintendent to send—I should think so, I cannot swear that I did—I cannot say how many I gave it precedence over; it is quite impossible for me to say; it is three years ago; it was done as a matter of favour to Baron Rothschild—I considered it perfectly justifiable, and perfectly not wrong—that may not be very good English, but that is what I mean—certainly, the bulk of my brother directors were not aware of it, because they were not there; whether the chairman was aware of it or not, I do not know; he was aware of the second case, because I was with him at the time, and we together refused the message on account of its having the price of the funds in it, and because it was not, therefore, a private message, we refused to give it priority—the superintendent brought me the message, with the request that I would give it priority, and I believe the observation was from him, "This message cannot go, because it has got the quotation of funds in it," and we said, "Certainly not"—Sir James Carmichael was with me—I should not think any other director was with me when I sanctioned the priority in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Honourable Frederick Cadogan. We were staying at his father's house, in Piccadilly, in Aug. last—I remember a person named Thorn coming there on Saturday, 8th Aug.—Mr. Cadogan had made some communication to me on the subject of that person before he came, and in consequence of that, I remained in the room during the whole of the conversation which took place between him and Mr. Cadogan—he came about 7 o'clock—he brought a letter from Mr. Evans, enclosing one which Mr. Evans had written to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he gave it to Mr. Cadogan, who read it out aloud at the window in my presence—he said that he thought it would be a damaging letter to the Company and Mr. Cadogan, and that he had better bring it to him—Mr. Cadogan returned the letter, and asked for a copy of it—he said he must consult a friend, and he would bring him a copy of it before 10 o'clock that night—he said that he had not seen Mr. Evans for four days, that he was ill in bed at Graveseud, and had sent him this letter—he had some papers with him, and the letter from Mr. Evans to himself I understood—he could give no particular reason why he came; he said he thought it would be damaging to Mr. Cadogan and the Company, and he thought Mr. Cadogan would wish to know of it; he said that he was the greatest friend of Mr. Evans, and was mixed up in heavy pecuniary engagements with him—Mr. Cadogan said he did not understand why he should come to him about it at all; Mr. Evans could send the letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Thorn replied that he thought it would be to Mr. Cadogan's advantage, and that of the Company, that the letter should not appear—he was there about a quarter or half an hour—he came again about 10 o'clock I think—I was not present at the beginning, but I came into the room soon afterwards—he was then sitting at a table, copying the letter, which Mr. Cadogan held in his hand; he finished it, and gave it to Mr. Cadogan—he repeated frequently that he was under heavy pecuniary engagements with Evans and with other gentlemen at the west end of town, and that he was in Mr. Evans's power—I put my initials to the copy—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

I came into the office, and, seeing a dispatch of foreign news from M.

Yours very truly, Fred.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260033"></xptr>
               <p>letter in your paper of the 4th inst., and which I presume is intended as a complete answer to your article appearing, under the head of 'Money Market and City Intelligence,' on the 1st inst., I come forward, upon public grounds, to answer one part of the same, and will direct my attention to the sixth paragraph of Sir James's letter, which states, 'Of the cause of the delay of the messages to the East India House and Lord Clarendon, I as yet know nothing, and consequently (unlike the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>) will not hazard an opinion, or even a suspicion. But I do know that during the Crimean war, the submarine telegraph wires were not found at fault in their part of the important duty of conveying the messages of the British Government; and I may also venture to state that, since the establishment of our first telegraphic communication with France, no person in the service of this Company has hitherto been suspected of betraying the trust reposed in him by the public, nor has any message been either tampered with or delayed in any one of our offices, though, of course, we have been liable to our fair share of delays from accidental causes, for which we expected and received blame.' Now, Sir, I beg to say that I was superintendent of the instrument rooms of the Submarine Telegraph Company, at 30, Cornhill, from the 5th Nov., 1852, until I resigned my appointment, in July, 1854; that during the above period one of the directors of the said Company, viz., the Hon. Frederick Cadogan (now, I believe, the deputy chairman) was in the habit of visiting the instrument rooms, and waiting in the board room daily, say from 11 A. M. till 3 or 4 P. M., and I had special instructions from him to send up all messages of importance for his perusal; and, as a consequence, I can instance one particular despatch from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to Lord Clarendon, dated Constantinople, Dec. 3rd, Vienna, 13th, and received by us <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> Brussels, when, within half an hour after the message had been seen by the Hon. Frederick Cadogan, the funds fell half per cent. He suddenly quitted the office, and we almost directly received a message from Eversheim, London, to Jacqueman, Paris, touching this parti<lb></lb>cular fall. There could be no possibility of these parties having obtained information only through us; and I am positive no clerk quitted the office during that time. That the said Hon Frederick Cadogan frequently looked at the contents of an Indian telegraph received from Austrian Lloyds, Trieste, addressed to the 'Times,' London, being forwarded to the Hon. Fre<lb></lb>derick Cadogan, at Brooks's club. Another time I remember forwarding the contents of a despatch to Mr. Seymour Clarke, by order of the Hon. Frederick Cadogan. Again, on the arrival of some important Continental news, there occurred a rise, or fall, in the funds (for the moment I cannot say which). The result was, that at about noon there was a rush to the office by the first stockbrokers of the day. The Hon. Frederick Cadogan, being in the instrument room, said, 'Well, Evans, are you busy?' I replied in the affirmative, whereupon the said Hon. Frederick Cadogan took up a batch of about twenty-five messages, lying by the side of the Paris instrument, for transmission, taking out from near the bottom a message from Rothschild, London, to Rothschild, Paris, which he placed on the top of the pile, request<lb></lb>ing me to give it precedence, although all those which he desired me to jump over were upon the same description of business, and to the same place, viz., Paris. At the time, I told Mr. Cadogan that, all messages were sent in the order received at the counter, and that it was doing the public a great injustice; yet he desired me to do so, and I of course obeyed his commands, which can be proved if the Submarine Company will permit a reference to their file of forwarded messages, as the original message paper has a note of</p>

               <p>mine in ink with regard to these facts, and I challenge the, Company to produce it. I have not stated a single fact in this letter but what I am in a position to prove by officers or servants who now are or have been in the Company's employ, and by reference to my diary of these circumstances I could add more, but for the present will be content with the foregoing statement, which I think, Sir, you will agree with me, completely answers the paragraph I have quoted from Sir James Carmichael's letter, and, I also think, will prove to the chairman and directors of the Submarine Telegraph Company and the public, that you do not 'hazard opinions based upon rumour only.' I in close here with the testimonials I received from the Company on resigning my appointment, and remain, Sir, your obedient servant, Thomas D. Evans, late superintendent of the Submarine Telegraph Company's instrument rooms, 30, Cornhill.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the defendant Evans, and am clerk in the Admiralty, at Somerset House. On Saturday, Aug. 8th, my brother and Mr. Thorn came there to me, between 3 and 4 o'clock—my brother showed me the letter the subject of this inquiry—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was in a sheet to the best of my recollection and belief, half a sheet of foolscap—this would make a sheet if it was put together, and I believe it is the letter; yes, it is—I had been in the employ of the Sub<lb></lb>marine Telegraph Company, from the opening of the first cable to France, and remained from Nov., 1851, till Jan., 1856, when I resigned my appoint<lb></lb>ment—my brother and Mr. Thorn left about a quarter to 4 o'clock, as near as possible—I was appointed assistant superintendent at Liverpool—previous to that time I was clerk—during that time Mr. Cadogan was in the office daily—his not being there was quite an exception, unless he was out of town—he never remained long—I have known him come in and out of the instrument room three or four times in the course of the day—the messages that are transmitted are on the file, and those that are received are by the side of the instrument, in a heap, if there is any delay—if the clerk does not take quickly, or the wires are in bad order, there will be about twenty or thirty—if a message is received from Brussels or Paris, or any part of the world, it was the duty of my brother and myself to send that message off—Mr. Cadogan had no duty to perform in sending off messages, or. in their trans<lb></lb>mission from here elsewhere—I have seen him go to the messages during the time I have been acting as assistant superintendent, and have seen him take up the forwarded and received messages, and look most minutely through through them, reading the contents of nearly each—I have also seen him come and refer to the messages, and without saying a word, he would leave the room with his hat on, and his overcoat—I have seen him do that daily—I know of no matter of business relating to the Company that would render it necessary for Mr. Cadogan to do what I saw him do—it is no part of a director's duty; as in that case a superintendent would be unnecessary—I have never seen any other director do what I saw Mr. Cadogan do—he has given directions to me when leaving for the day; he has said, "Evans, if anything of importance arrives, send it to my house," meaning his private residence, and I have frequently done so; and during the day he has fre<lb></lb>quently said, "Evans, if anything of importance arrives, I shall be in the Board room"—the messages that I took were any that contained important news, whether addressed to the public, the government, or the press—any message that contained important news—I have made extracts from them in my own hand, and have sent them in an envelope to his own private resi<lb></lb>dence—that was done by his instructions, distinctly—I have also seen him come in with his hat on, refer to the messages, and return immediately—he has frequently not given any orders—he did not say a word, but looked at the messages, and went out—when the House of Commons' Office was open, and communication was made to the Clubs, at Mr. Cadogan's wish, I was sent to the House of Commons, which was in connection with the Cornhill Office, and also with the Clubs—on one occasion Mr. Cadogan came in from the House of Commons in his wig and gown, into our telegraph office, and asked me to telegraph to Cornhill, and asked if there was any news—I remember a dispatch being received relating to news from the East—it was a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> dispatch, to the best of my knowledge—it was sent to Brooks's club by Mr. Cadogan's order—I recollect the circumstance well, from the word</p>

               <p>"phases" being used in it—I thought it was "phrases," and Mr. Cadogan said, "No, no, 'phases' is correct"—I was also superintendent to the British and Submarine Telegraph Office at Dover—Mr. Cadogan came there once, I believe in passing to the continent—I cannot say that I have ever seen Mr. Cadogan move a message from the bottom to the top of the file—I have never seen any of the other directors deal with the messages in the way that Mr. Cadogan has—I have been nearly two years a clerk at Somerset House—I believe it is the practice of the Company to keep all the messages that are received; at all events for a certain number of years—if the file of messages of 3rd Feb., 1854, were produced, the numbers ought to be consecutive—there ought to be no gap—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the file</hi>) message 103 is not in it's place, if it is here; nor is 105, nor 114, nor 140, nor 147—these are forwarded messages received at the Circus Office, not at Cornhill—numbers 101 and 102 are here, and 103 should follow in the ordinary course; 104 is here—Mr. Thorn did not take any part in the discussion between me and my brother; in fact he was not present when my brother showed me the letter; he was six yards away—I anxiously looked in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Monday for the letter.</p>

I was formerly in the employment of the Submarine Telegraph Company; I left on 11th July last—I entered the Company in 1853, as messenger; I was afterwards employed on the line, and since that I have been assistant porter about six months—I have often seen Mr. Cado<lb></lb>gan come into the instrument room—in 1852 the instrument room was altered from where it is now; there was a long passage to it, and it was my duty to take messages along that passage, and I have seen him go into the room often—I have seen him read the messages, I may say several times, but being a messenger I had not the opportunity always—I was not employed in the instrument room, and was very seldom in there, but it was my duty to be there to take messages—I have taken messages up to Mr. Cadogan's private house frequently, but I took parcels principally, which were left at the office, but I have taken messages and notes—I have seen Mr. Cadogan there, lately, as late as 12 o'clock at night.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect the night service being opened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was in March or the beginning of May that I saw Mr. Cadogan there at 12 o'clock at night—in Jan., 1854, the office was open at night for anybody to receive messages, and I was there to take them; it was in May—I never saw Mr. Cadogan in the earlier part, but I heard he was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of the Submarine Tele<lb></lb>graph Company—I am not solicitor to the Company; I am a solicitor—I take no active part, I am a sleeping partner in London and Bristol—I have not given any evidence to the attorney for the defence, I have merely received a subpœna—from 1852-to 1854, I scarcely missed a Board meeting—I went into the instrument room very seldom indeed, not once in six months—I never on any occasion read the forwarded and received messages—no complaint has been made to me of Mr. Cadogan dealing with the messages under any circumstances—I know that he was in the habit of going into the room, but not so frequently; I had no means of knowing it—he never stated at any of the Board meetings that he was constantly in the habit of reading the messages—I should say that it would be unques<lb></lb>tionably wrong to transpose a message, and give priority to it, except under some very extraordinary circumstances—the proper judge of that would be, I suppose, under ordinary circumstances, the Superintendent, the Chairman,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260042"></xptr>
               <p>or the deputy chairman—if a message was transposed, it would be known in the Superintendent's office—I never until yesterday heard of a message of Rothschild's being transposed by Mr. Cadogan.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WETTENHALL</hi>. On 13th Dec, 1853, the funds fell three-eighths per cent., and about the same on the 14th (looking at a book).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the first fall was on the 13th, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was three-eighths per cent, fluctuation each day, I mean a fall—95 5/8 was the highest price, to 95 1/8; that is half per cent, fluctuation—the closing price on the 28th was 94 3/8—they opened on the 13th at 94 ¾, and closed at 94 ¾.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the fall was intermediate between the opening and the close? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they opened at 94 ¾, and closed at the same—94 ¾ was the lowest price on the 13th, and on the 14th they went to 94 1/2, that is, a quarter per cent lower, and closed at 94 ¾, which was the same again.</p>
               <p>

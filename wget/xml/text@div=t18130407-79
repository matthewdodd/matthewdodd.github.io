            . Q. In the month of September, 1812, were you acquainted with the prisoners - A. Yes, I knew them some years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you also acquainted with a person of the name of Cook - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you engaged with them in any transaction, with respect to Ladbroke and Company - A. I was engaged with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you ever saw that check drawn - A. I possibly might, it was drawn by Cook. I received it from Cook; and after I had so received it, by appointment, I met the prisoners at the Horns tavern, Doctor's Commons. On the morning of the day, that the check was presented for payment, it was there arranged between me and Webb in what manner the business should be done. I think Brady was present at the first part of the conversation. It was arranged that Webb should go to the Angel inn, in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand, and from there send the check for payment, by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the check produced at the Horns tavern - A. I think not. I had it in my pocket. Webb and I left the Horns tavern for the purpose of carrying this into execution. We went together to the Angel, in our way there I gave Webb the forged check. Webb went into the coffee-room of the Angel first, and I after him. We took our seats in different boxes, to give the appearance of not knowing one another, as I was to follow the porter. That was preconcerted. I called for a glass of sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Webb, in the Angel, do anything<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070052"></xptr>- A. I heard him desire the waiter to send the porter. The porter came in. I saw him give the check to the porter, and I think he desired him to go and get the money for it. The porter took the check and went out, and as soon as the porter was gone I left the room to follow the porter. I followed the porter as far as the Poultry. Webb quitted the coffee-room shorty after me, and joined me in the same street. He walked with me to a public-house in St. Martin's-le-grand; there I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked with the porter as far as the Poultry - A. I did. That was after I left Webb, and I think I saw Brady in the Poultry. I remained in the Poultry a few minutes, until I saw Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. What part in the transaction was it agreed that Brady should perform - A. It was agreed that I should follow the porter into the banking-house, but I did not do so. Brady told me he had some business at Ladbroke's, and that he should go to the banking-house instead of me, and he followed the porter to the banking-house instead of me. I went into a house near the spot. He soon after came to me at that house. He told me that he believed the check was not paid. I left him instantly, and went to the house where I had left Webb. Webb and I went to the Horns tavern. At that time none of us were taken. After that, I was taken in custody upon some charge, and I made this disclosure.</p>

Webb sat in the box next the door. Richardson sat in the third box. Webb called for a glass of sherry, and Richardson called for a glass of sherry. Webb asked me for the porter that we send of errands. I called the porter. I saw him speak to the porter and send him off. The porte went out of his errand, and after the porter was gone, Webb and Richardson paid me separate, and they both went out; and shortly after Mr. Gillman; the banker, came in with the porter. Richardson and Webb never returned again. This was on the first Monday in Bartholomew-fair time. I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of September last, did the last witness present that check at your banking-house for payment - A. Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon looking at the draft did you suspect its genuine - A. I saw there was a difference in the writing certainly. I believe it is not the hand writing of Mr. Keene. It is a good imitation; there certainly a difference.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the partners in the house of Messrs. Ladbroke and Company - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that draft, purporting to be drawn of Mr. Keene for seven hundred pounds sixteen shillings, handed to you - A. It was; and upon the examination of it, I believed it to be a forgery. I pressed the porter as to the person from whom he received it, and in consequence of his information, I went with him to the coffee-room of the Angel. I did not find the person that had sent him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY PROCTOR. I am a clerk in the banking-house of Ladbroke and Company. On the 7th of September last I was in the banking-house when the forged draft was presented for payment. Some little time was taken up upon the examination of it by the clerks and Mr. Gillman.</p>
               <p>Q. While this was going on did you observe any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070053"></xptr>person in the banking-house that came for change of country bank notes - A. Yes; I think Brady is very much like the person, but he is very much altered. He is about the same size. He is like him, but I cannot say with certainty that he is the man. I saw Brady about two months ago. I then said he is like him, and I think now he is like him.</p>
               <p>(The forged check read.)</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. I am utterly at a loss to make a defence, only to declare my innocence. I cannot charge my memory that I was in London on that day. Any other man in court might be charged in the same manner that I have been.</p>
               <p>Webb's Defence. I beg leave to observe that at the time they swear to me I was in Nottinghamshire.</p>

I saw him again at my house on a Wednesday on the beginning of September. He then slept at my house two nights. He went away on the Friday in the York Highflyer. He told me he was going into the North. I saw him at Wormley in the beginning of November.</p>

            . I am a malster at Wormley.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Wormley from town - A. Fifteen miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner, Webb, being there any time in the autumn of last year - A. Yes, he put up at Mr. Woolman's, the White Horse. He staid there from the Wednesday to the Friday. It was in the beginning of September. I cannot recollect the day of the month. It could not be later than the second week in September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so late as the 11th or 12th of September - A. I believe it was not so late as the 11th.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WADDINGTON. Q. Do you come here upon a subpoena - A. Yes. I keep the Granby's Head, at Redport, in Nottinghamshire, Redport is one hundred and forty miles and odd from London.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. A little better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you in the month of September at your inn - A. Yes. I suppose he came to my house in a coach. I found him in my house when I came down in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the High Flyer come through Redport - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the month of September was it - A. It was very early in the month of September. I remember having a sitting dog of my brother-in-law's that I was to have taken home on the 1st of September, and something put me off, and I had the dog at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the 1st of September was it that you saw the prisoner - A. About two or three days. I cannot swear justly to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a week - A. I think not. He came to me on a Saturday morning. He stopped and dined with me. I sent to the market; I saw his sister; she was standing there selling butter. I told her there was some person belonging to her at my house. His sister came to my house and when she came he met her in the gateway an kissed her. He went home with his sister. It is only about three miles from where the sister lived. I saw him on the Monday again. He continued in Nottinghamshire near two months, and on the latter end of October he paid me a score of five pounds and odd money.</p>

            . I am sister to the prisoner, Webb. I live at Haydon, near Redport, in Nottinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. In last September were you spoken to by Mr. Waddington in the market-place - A. Yes; I was standing in the market-place selling my butter on the 1st Saturday in September to the best of my belief, on the 5th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for remembering that day in particular - A. The three first days in September my family were mowing of barley, and on the Saturday he went home with me from the market; he spent the sabbath at my home, and my husband observed if it was a fine day on Monday we all of us were to turn out to assist in turning the corn. When the morning came, it was a fine day; I mentioned it to my brother. He said he would walk out, and he walked out. I saw no more of him till the next morning. He returned to Mr. Waddington's, as we understood from him. He continued coming backwards and forwards to our house ever other day until the latter end of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, look at your brother and tell me whether he is different in person now to what he was then - A. He was poorly in health then, and thin as he is now.</p>

            's defence. Last Friday week I was at work in the London Road, at Mr. Barber's, stick-manufactory, when my brother came to me, and asked me if I was busy; I said not particularly, for it was the first day I had been at work there; he asked me if I could step along with him, and he would satisfy me for my trouble; I asked leave of my master to go, and went with him home to Westminster; he asked me if I knew of any person where I could leave a bundle for him; I told him I had nobody to leave it with as I knew of, but I would go to Mr. Ellswood's wife, and ask her if she would let me leave it there; I went, accompanied by my brother, and left it there, saying, I would call for it in the morning; as such I did not call till the Monday following, and we were both taken into custody; I know nothing more of the property.</p>

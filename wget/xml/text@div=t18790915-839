                  </hi>. I am an engineer, at 100, Great Portland Street—I was walking along Edward Street, Hampstead Road, at 11.15 p.m. on 10th August, and received a blow on the side of the neck, and at the same time someone put an arm round my neck and held me and gave me serious bumps with the knee about my body—I gripped the individual, who then struck me on the jaw, using an oath—he tore my waistcoat open, but did not get my watch—he felt me over and took out of my side pocket a news<lb></lb>paper, and then flung me into the road—I screamed out, "Murder," and "Help," and as soon as I got up he turned round upon me, and with</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter, in the service of Messrs. Clarke and Rowe. The prisoner was their warehouseman—on the 15th Jan., he came and asked me if some tea that was there was Congou tea of the ship <hi rend="italic">Sarah Muir</hi>—he took a large scoop full of it, went to the counter, and made a parcel of 4lbs. with it, them came into the warehouse and put it into his bag—in twenty minutes after, I saw a man come into the warehouse, the prisoner gave the parcel to him, and he took it away—I looked in the book that evening, and that tea was not entered—the book is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Francis Thomas Clarke, The prisoner was in our service—we allow persons in our establishment to have what tea they require for their own use at cost price, or nearly so—before it is taken from the premises, it is their duty to enter everything they have on their own account—we had no knowledge of what they did with it—I heard something, and went to Mr. Biaggini's, in London—wall, and he pro<lb></lb>duced to me these ten invoices—one of them refers to the 4lbs. of Congon in question—there is no entry in our book of any tea purchased by the pri<lb></lb>soner for himself, or anybody else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On one occasion the prisoner had a chest of tea <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was sent into the country—it was entered in the book; to whom it was sent—this invoice is, "Bought of Clarke and Rowe"—the prisoner was not in the habit of selling tea for us—I am not aware that he had been em<lb></lb>ployed to obtain customers—he had entered the purchases he has made, with the date—this is the book in which small quantities are entered—we have a large journal—these entries are made by different parties—we have three clerks—it might sometimes happen that one clerk might make an entry for another—this being called the warehouse-journal, came more particularly under the province of the prisoner, he being the warehouseman—we have entries in the book every day—I make entries occasionally, and my partner also—if this tea had been entered in the book it would be a corresponding entry to this invoice—if ready money is paid, it would be immediately taken to Mr. Clarke or myself.</p>

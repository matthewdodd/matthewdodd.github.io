                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Cold Bath, Greenwich. I am foreman of the flushing department of the Board of Works there. On Friday night, 19th Sept, I saw twelve deals belonging to the Board, in the river, off Billingagate Dock, Greenwich, which belongs to the Board—they were secured by a chain round the middle of them, which was made fast to an iron in a wall, at the middle of the wharf; on shore—I went on purpose to see, and they were fast—there were four twelves, four elevens, and four eight foot lengths, three inches thick—the eight feet ones were one inch wider than the others—there was no mark on them, but I knew them by continually working on them—they were used for making a stage and driving piles there—I have seen them all since, and the chain, two handspikes, and a lever were also taken—they were all chained together—I do not know the prisoners.</p>

On Saturday, 20th Sept, about 12 'clock, the prisoners came—Thomas asked me whether I could draw him a little load of deals to New-cross, and what I would charge—I went to his house, looked at them, and said, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—they were lying across the road, against an old sawpit, on a hit, of waste ground, about 100 yards from the water side—when I got outside</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a wood yard in Pomeroy-street, New-cross. On 20th Sept., about 11 o'clock, the prisoners came to my gate together—Thomas said he was recommended to me about some deals he had for sale—I told him that I was not in want of any, and asked him if they were lying on board a ship—he replied, "No; they are landed"—I asked him if they were his own—he said, "Yes"—I asked him why he did not try to part with them in Deptford, without coming all the way to New-cross—he said that he had been to Mr. Jones's, at Deptford, who said that he had laid out all his money that week, or else he would have purchased them—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and I told him ultimately that I would take them—they were spruce deals, and were worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon Thomas came, and said, "I have brought the deals"—they placed them inside the gates—I told them to call at 8 o'clock for the money, and they went away with the carman—some short time afterwards a police inspector and constable came, and I gave up the deals to them, without paying for them—I made an arrangement with the police to stop over the way—the prisoners came about half past 7 o'clock, and I sent for the police—the inspector asked them where they got the deals—Thomas, I believe, said that he found them floating, or lying under the bows of the cholera ship at Deptford—he took them in charge.</p>

I went to Mr. Jones's, and found twelve deals, and a 12 foot spar; four 12 feet, four 11 feet, and four 8 feet—I did not measure them, but I am in the habit of seeing deals—that evening I was taken to the premises again by Mr. Jones's son, and, crossing the road, I saw Freshwater—I said to the constable, "Here is Freshwater; bring him in"—I went to the house, and found Thomas there—when they were together, I asked them where they got those deals—Thomas said, "I found them athwart the bows of the cholera ship"—I asked him why he did not take them to the water bailiff if he found them adrift—he said, "What, row them down to Charlton?"—I said, "No; there is a water bailiff at Greenwich, within 300 yards of where you say you found them"—I took them into custody—the Watergate stairs, Dept<lb></lb>ford, is about a quarter of a mile from Billingsgate-dock—I know where Galloway lives, and the piece of waste ground; it is about a quarter of a mile from Billingsgate-dock.</p>

               <p>Q. Having known by your son that the barge was missed did you go about to the deal yards - A. I did and on Thursday after I went to Mr. Houghton's premises in the Borough road; he sells old building materials; I saw no new there but my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any deals there that you thought were your own - A. I did, thirty-five in number; thirty-two eight-feet, and three twelve-feet. I marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150052"></xptr>them before they came to the office. I recognised them by the ship's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Having examined them did you proceed to Union Hall to obtain a warrant - A. I did. I went back with an officer, and took possession of the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. While you and the officer were there did Houghton come in - A. He did; I asked him how he came by them deals; he said he had bought them of a man of the name of Chapman, who lived in Dover-street; that is a cross street near the Magdalen; he said he bought two hundred and a half, he gave thirty-five pounds a hundred for them; I asked him what become of the rest of the deals; he told me that his wife and he had retailed them out at two or three at a time, and to whom he did not know. I told him it was a serious loss to me, if he could tell me it would help me; he said it was using him ill to ask him. I went to him again in the evening. There was an hundred deals at the Royal Mortar in the London-road, Mr. Inman, he lived next door but one, he claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had found them did you tell Houghton that you had found them - A. On the next day I told the magistrate before him. In counting over the two hundred I found nine that did not belong to me. In the thirty-five that I found at Houghton's they all belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you find these deals at Inman's premises to his - A. About two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe Houghton, who is now indicted pointed out to you where to apprehend Chapman - A. He did, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Did King and Culliver come to you on the evening of Thursday the 19th of December - A. Yes, they came to my own house; they said they wanted to speak to me. We went over to the Dover Castle public-house, they asked me if I wanted to buy any deals, they said they had got about an hundred; I said I did not want any, I am out of business, I have got nothing to do; I said, I knew a person that did; I would let them know the next evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any price mentioned - A. Not then. We had two or three pots of beer together. We met again the next evening. On Friday I went to Mr. Houghton's, I asked him if he wanted to buy any deals; he said yes, he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any price agreed upon - A. Not then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Houghton ask who was to supply the deals - A. I told him they were lightermen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Houghton and you how the deals were to be brought - A. He told me to provide carts to bring them to his house the next morning, and he would go down with me in the morning, and I went to see Culliver and King that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. That evening did King and Culliver come to you again - A. Yes; I informed them what had passed between Houghton and me; King told me he would call me up in the morning about half after five. The deals were to be at the Anchor wharf, Wapping Old-stairs, Mr. Johnson's wharf; he told me that they would be there at high water in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, that evening, did you go to bespeak waggons - A. I did, that evening, to Mr. Briant's, East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday morning did King call you up - A. He did, about half after five; I went with him over Blackfriars-bridge, and from there to the Anchor wharf; the barge was there; the name of the barge was the Union, she was laden with deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any oars in her - A. Yes, one pair, they were in the barge, and King, in about half an hour fetched the oars from the barge and put them on the wharf, and afterwards he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. About half after six, or nearly seven.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there did Culliver come - A. Culliver came in about twenty minutes with an empty barge, he moored that barge outside of the Union; the Union laid close to the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of mooring that empty barge close to the Union - A. To cover her; she was empty, and laid higher in the water. Culliver came to us at the public-house, there we had something to drink. We stopped there some time; I went out and met one of the waggons coming to the wharf; I directed the waggons to be loaded at the Anchorwharf. Culliver, King, and me went as far as Tower Hill together; then I went over the water to Mr. Houghton, I told him the deals were come to the Anchor wharf, one waggon was loading, and the other waggon was coming; I got a man to unload the barge. I breakfasted at Houghton's, and then Houghton and I came to the Anchor wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there did you find the waggons loaded - A. One waggon was loaded and gone out of the yard; Mr. Houghton gave them a card where to go to; they asked for money to pay turnpikes, Houghton gave each of the men a shilling; he paid the wharfinger and the man I employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the waggons were sent off - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Houghton to his own yard - A. Yes. In going over we overtook one of the waggons.</p>
               <p>Q. At last did the waggons arrive at his yard with the deals - A. They did; he and I assisted to unload them. All the deals came. On Monday we counted them over; I cannot exactly say the number, I think two hundred and seventy-three, short hundreds; I asked him thirty-two pounds a hundred; I said the men would not be satisfied without thirty, that was to be the lowest; Houghton said he could not afford to give so much money for them; he said, you know I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150053"></xptr>run a hazard, he agreed to give twenty-five pound, he gave me a pound note, earnest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Culliver call upon you. - A. He had called upon me on the Saturday night, to know if I was paid. On Monday night Culliver and King came together, and Houghton came to my house; we all went over to the Dover Castle, I went home to Houghton's house with him, he gave me twenty-nine pounds, making up with the one pound, thirty pounds; I went to the Dover Castle, and gave it King, Culliver was in the tap-room, I went into the parlour, and gave King twenty poundout of the thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the time. - A. Mr. Jones's boy was reading prayers at the time, the oldest son turned round and looked at me, while I was paying him the money; we agreed to meet the Tuesday evening to have the remainder of the money. On Tuesday evening they came to me, we went to the Dover Castle, I had not got the money, we appointed to meet on the day after Christmas day. On Thursday morning I saw Houghton, he gave me fifteen pounds, he told me that he had sold the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that leave to pay. - A. Thirteen pounds, with the expences, there were three pounds paid for waggons, wharfage, and landing, he promised to pay me that on the Friday or the Saturday after.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe on that evening, Thursday, an officer came to your house to take you in custody. - A. I was in the country, I heard of it, I sent a young man of the name of Murphy to King and Culliver, I saw Culliver, and told him that the officer had been after me; he said he had heard something of thirty pounds, he thought it must be Houghton that had told.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of the reward. - A. I was apprehended that same day, through Houghton; after I was apprehended I told Glannon all I knew.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. In what way of life is Houghton. - A. He buys new and old building materials.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in earnest. - A. Yes. I am a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Q. What house is it you keep in Dover-street. - A. A private house.</p>
               <p>Q. In which you let out lodgings. - A. That is not material, my wife does.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, according to your own observations, you applied to Houghton to purchase these deals of the lightermen. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a bill of invoice at the time. - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, though you said you had these deals of a foreign captain to Mr. Houghton, that you did not produce a bill of invoice pretending that you had them upon that account. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the man Houghton, when he was a witness before you and the other parties, do you not recollect his stating that fact, and did not you admit it. - A. No, I did not; I perhaps might, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, did not the prisoner Houghton say in your presence, and in your hearing, that you told him that you had the deals of a foreign captain, and that was what induced him to purchase them of you. - A. He might, I made no answer, I heard him say something, about a foreign captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you standing as a party accused of the robbery. - A. Yes, I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to the question. When you were first examined, did not you at each of the examinations, desire to have it postponed, that you might produce the foreign captain of whom you had the timber. - A. I never said a word about the captain, Houghton did; I said if they would give me another day, I would bring the person that I had the deals of. I never saw the other men untill they were under examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you asked at that very time whether you knew them two men, King and Culliver. - A. I was asked that, I said I believed I had seen them before, that was before I was put on oath.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you only tell lies when not upon oath. - A. When upon oath, I speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the first witness that has been examined, Clements, the lighterman. - A. I saw him at Hick's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you in the presence of Clements, and two other persons say, you would be d - d if you did not stick so close to Houghton as the shirt upon his back, because of your own expressions, he had pulled you up. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Houghton you say got the timber into his possession before you talked about the price of them. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. This yard of Houghton's in which the timber is put, is it not a yard directly open to the highway. - A. One part of it is open.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Glannon took you up, and whether you were charged with stealing or receiving, you did not know - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Friday you were taken to Union Hall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At first when you went there you had the discretion to hold your tongue; you told Glannon you would tell all you knew if they would receive you as a witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the receipt of Houghton's - A. Yes, Received of Houghton thirty pounds in part of the amount of the deals.</p>

When I went down there were about eighty deals in one waggon, they waited near an hour before any person came to give orders, then Chapman and Houghton came, I asked them where the deals were to go, Houghton gave me a card, I looked at the card and said, there was a deal of difference between Oxford Road and the Borough Road, Houghton said he should have them at his own yard. Houghton promised to pay me the cartage, I saw Houghton pay the wharfage.</p>

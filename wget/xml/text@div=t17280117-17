Several other Witnesses appear'd, who depos'd, That they had seen the Prisoner's Cane, and did believe the Cane, produc'd in Court, was the very same. But to confront them and vindicate his Character, the Prisoner call'd Mr. Snoddey, who depos'd, That the Prisoner was in Bed all that Night, and lay till 11 the next Day; at the same Time giving him a good character, he concluded, That he did believe that was not the Prisoner's Cane which was produc'd in Court, the Wife and Servant, and Lodgers of Mr. Snoddey, all depos'd, That the Prisoner was at Home all the Night, and gave him a good Character. The Prisoner being ask'd his Business, and by what Methods he maintain'd himself, said, he had been the Author of some Performances, which had made him acquainted with some generous Gentlemen, by whose Benevolence he had lived in Credit; though sometimes under poetical Circumstances. Several Gentlemen whom he had serv'd, appear'd on his Behalf, saying, That he behaved himself very honestly, but having a poetical Genius, he did not apply himself to Business: Upon summing up the Whole the Jury <rs id="t17280117-17-verdict72" type="verdictDescription">

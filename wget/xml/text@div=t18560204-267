I did not know Brown or Carter before this night—I have seen Brown several times since at a public house—on Tuesday, 6th Nov., I was at the bar of the Sun Tavern, in Gray's Inn-lane—Brown and Carter came in together, and were drinking together—they remained for an hour and a half to two hours—they went up stairs and came down again to go to the concert—it was about a quarter or 20 minutes past 7 o'clock when they left—they were talking, drinking, and quarrelling about some matter which I did not under<lb></lb>stand—it was not a serious quarrel, they made it up again, and had another glass of grog, and they quarrelled again, and Brown got up, bade him good night, and went across the road—Carter followed him to go home and fetch something which he had of his, a chair on which Brown sat and smoked his pipe of a night—Brown said that he was going home, which is somewhere in Theobald's-road—Carter was very drunk indeed, and Brown was about half drunk—when they went out Brown went up a step of a gentleman's house opposite, and Carter went after him; they both came down and went towards King's-road, twenty or thirty yards further—Carter got before Brown, to push him back and prevent him going home, and Brown knocked him down—Brown had his arm in a sling; he put his arm up and followed him up with his right hand, struck him in the mouth, knocked him into the road, and there he laid—Brown ran away—it was a very violent blow—Carter</p>

               <p>was very drunk; he had laid there insensible, till he was picked up by a policeman, who I sent—Carter did not strike Brown at all—I heard Brown say, "Carter, I bid you good night, I did not think you were this sort of man"—Carter said, "Well, I will follow you home"—Brown said, "Well, if you do, you will find something"—Carter had said something about Eagle-street—he said nothing more than, "This house belongs to me;" or, "The property belongs to me, and I will have it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Carter was brought there on 6th Nov.—I examined him—he had a severe scalp wound behind the right ear—the pericranium was exposed, and the skull was bare—he had also a bruise by his hip, and a blow on the face—he was in a state of almost insensibility, partially from drink and partially from the effects of the blow—the blow on his head must have been the result of very great violence—I do not think it could have been done by his falling from his own weight—there must have been considerable impetus—he remained in the hospital four weeks all but a day, and went out on his own express wish—he was cautioned before he went out, both by Mr. Lloyd and myself—the probability is that if he had taken great care of himself, and kept under a course of medicine, he might have recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing a man is very drunk, he falls without any power of resistance, does he not, like an inanimate object? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a man who is sober, and falls, struggles against it, and comes down with less heaviness—the deceased might have caught his shoulder or hip, or some prominent part, which would take off the force of the blow—I think he must have fallen against something sharp—he must have been pushed with a great deal of violence—I have been in the hospital four yeas—I have not known of drunken men killing themselves by falling on something sharp—I represent that as impossible, except from falling from a height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostier to Mr. Ockley, of Little Gray's Inn-lane. On 6th Nov., about half past 6 o'clock, I was at the Sun tavern, and heard Carter calling Brown a b——thief, and other bad language besides—Brown said, "I shall leave you, John," and went away across the street, and up three steps, to keep out of the way—Carter followed him, and went two doors beyond where he was—he then came back, and said, "John, I shall box you"—Brown came down the steps, and Carter hit him on the breast—Brown said, "I cannot put up with this any longer," and put his hand up, which was in a handkerchief, and pushed him away; whether he hit him, or pushed him, I was not close enough to see, but Carter fell down, and I helped him up—Carter was at that time in front of Brown, preventing his going along—some one took hold of him, and led him away; two policemen then came, and I went about my work again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you in the house with Carter and Brown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes—I was drinking—Brown and Carter were drinking, but not together, they each had glasses—I went out to take notice of them after hearing the words—I was going to my work, and it was on my way—I did not speak to Brown—I heard of his being charged, but not at the time—I did not go before the Magistrate—I have seen Brown</p>

               <p>two or three times since, going about the place—I have spoken to him about twice since, once was at a public house—the last time I saw him was the day before yesterday, at the Wolf public house, Little Gray's Inn-lane—I had something to drink, but not at his expense—I paid for all that I had, I swear that.</p>

I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, of No. 10, Ship-yard, Temple-bar—I know the defendant, and Carter, and saw them in Gray's Inn-road—Carter was in front of Brown, and he struck Brown first—it was on the breast, and Brown said, "Get away"—he lost his temper, and said, "I cannot put up with it any longer, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>," and struck him—he first <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him with the hand that was tied up, and then struck him—I took Brown home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the defendant's solicitor, and was present before the Magistrate when he was examined—I had witnesses there to tender on his behalf, but did not call them, I used my discretion—Mr. Tyrwhitt said that there was a case made out for further investigation—the defendant was not only anxious for me to call the witnesses, but was angry that I did not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 247). On 2nd May, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in plain clothes in George-street, Richmond—I saw Newman pass along at a quick pace towards London, with a bundle—I overtook him at the railroad-bridge, and asked him what he was in such a hurry for—he said he was going to Turnham-green—I told him I was a policeman, and I wished to know what was in the bundle—he said, "Some dirty linen"—I asked what sort of linen—he said he did not know—I told him to open it—he opened one half of the bundle, and instead of showing me linen he showed me part of a gown—I told him to undo the rest of the bundle—he refused—I took the bundle, and told him if he would not untie it he should take it to the station—he would not—he said if he must go to the station I should carry the bundle—at the station I opened the bundle, and found in it some bread and meat, some soap, a gown, an apron, and some tart—I asked him how he came by them—he said he got them up the town, but he would not tell me where—I went and made inquiry—I found the other prisoner, and took her into custody—I went to her master's house, and asked if such a person lived there, and Heath came forward—I asked her if Thomas Newman had called at the house—she said, "Yes," he bad called that afternoon—I asked her if she gave him anything—she said, "Yes," she gave him this bundle, with some victuals, and what was in it—she wanted to see her mistress; and she said, "Oh pray, policeman, you are not going to lock me up?"—she saw her mistress, and she fell on her knees, and clasped her hands together, and said, "Pray, forgive me!"</p>

I am servant to Mr. John Power, of Richmond-green—Heath was cook there for one month—I do not know any of these things but the table-napkin, which I know by the mark—on Friday evening, 2nd May, I saw Heath give Newman a bundle tied in a blue handkerchief similar to this—that was between eight and nine o'clock—they were then in the kitchen—I saw Newman leave the kitchen with the bundle—Heath had not occasion to send her washing out; her washing goes out with Mrs. Power's—I did not hear anything said about washing.</p>

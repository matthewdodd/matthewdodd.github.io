            . I went out of town the 29th of August, and returned the 30th. When I came home my servant, Bishop, acquainted me that his fellow <rs id="t17450911-33-deflabel172" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I carried him before a Justice, and he returned me the straps and a bridle with two winkers upon it, which were mine. The bridle was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Harper say when he was charged with it?</p>
               <p>Winne. He said they were not mine, and he brought them to me, as he said, to convince me that they were not mine; but they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the Prisoner lived with you?</p>
               <p>Winne. About eight months, and he never wronged me of any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you accuse Harper of taking the winkers?</p>
               <p>Winne. When he was before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to know whether in all trades people have not particular fashions, and whether it is not usual for other people to imitate them?</p>
               <p>Winne. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know these are yours?</p>
               <p>[Mr. Winne said to the Prisoner's council (pointing to the brass work upon the winkers) I could answer that, but it will do you more harm than good.]</p>

            . On the Thursday when my master went out of town, I saw Harper cut out four straps, and afterwards I saw him few the four straps together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when he was cutting out the straps, or when he was sewing them together?</p>
               <p>Bishop. I did not say any thing to him about it. Here is a crupper and a strap which he brought to my master, (at my master's desire,) to see whether they were his or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What, after he was taken up?</p>

               <p>Bishop. No, it was before he was taken up; and he told my master this was the breechin he sewed in that day my master was out of town, and he would pay my master for the time he was doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master charged him with these, upon your information that they were his, did not he offer to bring them to him?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Yes, but not till my master desired him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he would bring them for his master to see whether they were his?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Yes, but not till my master desired him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he would bring them for his master to see whether they were his?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would take them with a felonious intent?</p>
               <p>Bishop. I had no such opinion of him before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a quarrel subsisting between you and him at the time?</p>
               <p>Bishop. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Bishop. That of a very honest fellow. <rs id="t17450911-33-verdict173" type="verdictDescription">

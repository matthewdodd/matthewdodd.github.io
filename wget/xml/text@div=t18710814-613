In the month of April I was watching Rooslar's place—I was there on the 24th, with Legg, and saw the prisoner drive up with a van with three horses—it had on the name of S. P. Mumford, and was covered over with a tarpaulin—when he arrived at Roosslar's shop he got off the van, unfastened the tarpaulin, took a sack on his shoulder and took it in at the side door—I saw "S "and some other letter, "Mumford, Greenwich," on the sack, in red and black letters—he went in at the door which goes into the bakehouse—at that time our attention was directed to the men who had stolen from Messrs. Hadley.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with Farley on the 24th April, watching Roosslar's premises—in the morning I was following one of Messrs. Hadley's vans—down there—and saw Mumford's waggon draw up between 11 and 1—I think it was before 12—the prisoner was driving the waggon with three horses—he got down, took a sack from the hind part of the waggon, and carried it in at the side door of Roosslar's shop—he returned and drove away—there was a tarpaulin on the waggon, it was raining—I saw distinctly "Mumford, Greenwich," I did not interfere then, because I was engaged on another matter in finding out another robbery—I communicated to my superior officers, and they advised me not to interfere with Mumford's till I had finished what I was about—I saw the name of Mumford on the sack when he took it in—some of the letters were in red paint—I saw it was Mumford, Greenwich, and that was all I noted down—I searched Roosslar's premises and found three sacks of Mumford's, and a large quantity of Hadley's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was between 11 o'clock and 1; I can't speak positively as to the time, it was a matter I was not much interested in—I had fol<lb></lb>lowed Hadley's waggon from their mills—I saw Mumford's name on the waggon, the prisoner was driving—it was written on the front of the waggon—he was driving three horses—the van was very heavily laden—the passage at Roosslar's is a direct entrance from the street into the bakery—that would be the proper way, but you could go through the shop also—I saw the prisoner some time after that, in the course of my travels, following Hadley's vans—I saw him at Mile End—I did not see him again till I went down to Greenwich, after Roosslar was in custody, and I picked him out as being one of the men—I had seen him once between the 24th April and 27th May—I have seen him since he has been in custody at Greenwich, and also here to-day—I was not present when he was taken into custody—I believe he was taken on 7th July—I went to Greenwich to give evidence against him the first day he was brought up there—I did not apprehend the man—I gave information to Messrs. Mumford's, as I was instructed to do.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I recognized him when I saw him between 24th April and 27th May—I was watching Roosslar's premises seventy-four days—a large number of Hadley's men have been convicted, and it was necessary to get evidence against each of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The van was properly loaded when I saw it, and fully loaded—any more sacks would have to be put on the top of the others—all the vans have a tarpaulin over—they would have to lift the tarpaulin and put the sacks under—that would take some time—I was only away a quarter of an hour, perhaps not quite that—the prisoner went to harness his horses—that would take him some time—I have no doubt I saw the van start—I did not notice anything irregular about its appearance—I don't know how many sacks were delivered at Brett's—I have nothing to do with that—the note is returned to the office—we have a rest from 5.45 till 6, and I was away during that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is the practice, if there is not room for all the sacks standing up, to put them on the top of the others, and if it was wet, the tarpaulin would be put over them—my attention would not be called to the van after it was loaded.</p>

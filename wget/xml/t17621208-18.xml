I said, I would buy it of him, if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080022"></xptr> came by 3 o'clock. Accordingly he came with Steers to the Amsterdam coffee-house, I took them into a room and asked Buckey, if this was the man that had the India bond? they both answered no, that the man was at the Fleece alehouse in Threadneedle-street. They had before offered to sell them for 5 l. under value, I offered them 90 l. a piece for them. There were then 2 mentioned. Steers said he would go and ask Stevens whether he would take that money; he went, and returned, and said, Stevens humm'd and haw'd about it, but believed he would take it. I told them, I could not then stay, but if they would go to the Fleece, I would come to them. I did accordingly, then there were the two prisoners and Buckey; I made an excuse and went to the officer in Change-alley, Mr. Sivers, he was not at home; I left word, that two of the bonds that had been advertised had been offered to me. I went to the Fleece. Steers was gone, there were Stevens and Buckey; then they went to the Four Swans in Bishopsgate-street, there they were all three together. I told them, I had brought the money and desired them to give me change out of a 200 l. note; Stevens then produced the bonds to me from out of his pocket-book; I compared them, and found they agreed with two of the three lost. I made an excuse out, and Buckey followed me. I said, had they not the other? he said, he believed they had not, but he would ask them. We went in again. I wanted to go out, but knowing they would not trust me alone. I desired to speak to Buckey. I talked to him about the danger of purchasing them; he said, I had better let them alone. I had not been there three minutes, but the officer and the constable went down the yard; I gave the constable charge of the prisoners.

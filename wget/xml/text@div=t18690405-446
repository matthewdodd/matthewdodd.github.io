I live at 1, St George's Valley, St. George's Road, Peckham—about 2.30 on the morning of 27th March I heard a noise—I got up and went down into the kitchen—I found the glass of the window broken, and the sash thrown up—I went into the washhouse, which leads out of the kitchen, and saw the prisoner standing up, lying on his arm, pretending to be asleep—I called my lodger, William James, who took charge of him—I turned him round, and asked him what business he had in my house—he said, "Your house?"—I said, "Yes, my house"—he said, "You go to b—"—I then went for a policeman—I don't think the prisoner was drunk—I did not miss anything.</p>

I am a printer—I live in the house of the last witness—I was called up about 2.30, and found the prisoner in the washhouse, standing against the sink—I took hold of him—he pretended to be asleep—I asked him what he did in the house—he said, "What house?"—the land-lord then said, "What do you do in my house?"and he used the expression the last witness stated—I found the washhouse window open about a foot—a pane of glass had been broken—the lattice was put back—some flower pots, which were on the window-sill the night before, were removed and put under the window—the prisoner's hand was cut from the broken glass—it was bleeding, and there was blood in the washhouse—I asked him where he lived; he made no answer—I had fastened the window the night before.</p>

I was called about 2.30 on this Saturday morning, and took the prisoner—his hands were smothered with blood, as if cut from broken glass—I asked him what his object was in coming to the house—he said he would tell me at the station—when we got to the station he told me nothing—some pots had been removed from the window and set on the ground—I found a brass tobacco-box, which the prisoner said belonged to him—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—he was dirty with getting in at the window where the flower-pots stood.</p>

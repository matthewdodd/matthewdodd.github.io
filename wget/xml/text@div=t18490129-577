                  </hi>. I live at Richmond; the prisoner was in my service. On 6th Jan., I gave him this check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to get changed—I told him to take his wages, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of it—he was to return me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see him again till the Wednesday following—he then wanted to know whether, if he brought the money back, I would not proceed against him—I told him I could not receive it, the law must take its course.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was on the Tuesday that I went back to my master; I told him I had been in bad company, and lost the money; I would have returned it, but I was taken the same evening, and had not the opportunity; I wrote to my master on the Monday, to tell him I would come back and work it out; he told me to get it cashed on my way home. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th Jan., begging forgiveness for having lost the money</hi>)—I gave him leave to go home that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at the Quart Pot beer-shop, at Kingston. On 6th Jan., the prisoner came there tipsy, with a female—I saw him with four sovereigns, a half-crown, four sixpences, and a halfpenny in his hand—I advised him to leave the money in the landlord's hands—he said he was his own money-keeper, and he would take care of it himself—next morning he inquired for the landlord and landlady, and complained that he had lost a sovereign—I saw him on Sunday morning, with three sovereigns, a half-crown, two sixpences, and a halfpenny—he gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my care, when he was fighting in the Quart Pot—I went with him to the railway</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, This witness changed two sovereigns, one at Kingston station, and one At Waterloo-road station; she took me home, and robbed me of the rest of the money, and my pin and handkerchief. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> A half-crown and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given at Kingston, and a sovereign I changed, in company with the prisoner and a porter, near Waterloo station, for some rum.</p>

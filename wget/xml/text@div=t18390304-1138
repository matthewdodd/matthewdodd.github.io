                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Gardner-lane, Upper Thames-street. On the 15th of January Sully was in my employ—I received several orders for sugar, and on the 16th I gave Sully an order to go to the West-India Docks to load five hogsheads of sugar—he was to deliver one in Gray's Inn-lane, one in Holborn, two in Blackfriars-road, and one in the New-cut—the one in Gray's Inn-lane was for Mr. Barber, and the one in the New-cut also—Pledger had been a servant of mine, but was discharged—on the 17th I heard that the hogshead delivered in the New-cut was short weight—I went over there to Mr. Barber's shop—I saw a hogshead lying in the shop, which had been delivered overnight, as Mr. Barber told me—the sample-tin had been removed—there were three odd nails in it, and only one was a cooper's nail, such as is used in the Docks—the hogshead was weighed in ray presence, and it weighed 14cwt. 27lbs. gross—it ought to have weighed 15cwt. 2qrs. 13lbs.—there was a deficiency of 1541bs.</p>

               <p>No. 34 weighed 15cwt. 2qrs. 13lbs. on that day—it had lost 5lbs. on the landing weight—that is the one that is-deficient—the person, who came for it produced an order—only one of these nails, in this, tin, is such as the cooper delivers out with his tins.</p>

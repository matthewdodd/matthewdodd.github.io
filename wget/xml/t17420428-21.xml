He did not care for that he said, but if they wanted any thing in his Way, he would be very ready to let them have it. At last, after some Disputes, I lent them first three Pounds, and then 20 Shillings, and he wrote this Note, and sign'd it in my Presence. These Witnesses happened to be in the Room at the same Time, and saw him sign the Recepts, and receive the Money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ticket collector in the service of the Great Northern Railway at Holloway—on Sunday, 14th April, I was collecting the tickets there from the 10.16 a.m. train—I found the two prisoners and a third person, a lady who is outside, in a second-class carriage—when I applied to the female prisoner for her ticket she held up a season ticket, showing me the date, King's Cross and Crouch End, second-class—I asked the male prisoner for his season ticket and he pulled a purse out of his pocket and held it up—I asked him a second time and he held up a reddish purse, something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said "Season"—I did not notice which side he held up, but I can say that it was a purse and not a ticket—I asked him a third time for his ticket—he then opened his purse and said "I have left my season at home"—I said "Will you pay the fare <hi rend="italic">?</hi>"—he said "No, I will give you my name and address," and then said to the female prisoner in English, "Write my address out for me"—I then asked her to let me see the season ticket she had shown me and she handed me this ticket No. 7239—(<hi rend="italic">This had</hi> "Mr. H. Gehrke" <hi rend="italic">printed on it</hi>)—I said to the male prisoner "Is this your season ticket?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You told me just now you had left it at home; how is it this lady is using it?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060080"></xptr>
               <p>then offered to pay the fare—I would not take it, and called the inspector, who told me in the prisoner's hearing to take the name and number of the season, and ask for the address—the male prisoner gave his address 7, Park Villas, Crouch End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This was on Sunday morning, the last train running before church-time—I am not aware that on the following Tuesday he went to the Company's offices to give a full explanation—I did not call at the defendant's address, Fern Villa, 19, Perth Road, Finsbury Park, N., nor do I know that a Company's officer did call there—Mr. Forbes is the traffic manager—I have been a ticket collector three years and a half—some persons carry their season ticket attached by an elastic band to their purse, and some inside their purse—I have often seen it on the purse with an elastic band—he offered to pay me the money before I called the inspector, and he offered to pay the inspector, but neither of us took it—the second-class fare from Crouch End is 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I heard him say Park Villas—the young lady asked me for a pencil and was writing it down—I can't say whether she finished, for she got up and looked out of the window on the opposite side—I did not get the written address—I re<lb></lb>ported the matter the same day, and it would go to the Company's office next morning—the season ticket books are kept at the King's Cross office—the lady witness who is to be called was not at the police-court she was not heard of until yesterday—she was next to the carriage door, hers was an ordinary ticket—the female prisoner sat on the far side of the compartment—she gave me the ticket when I asked her—I asked the male prisoner "Is this your ticket?" he said "Yes," and offered to pay the fare for the lady—I did not supply the paper for writing the address down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I took a note in my book at the time, of the address he gave, and refreshed my memory by that—I say that it was 7 Park Villas, Crouch End.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector at Holloway station—I was called on this Sunday morning to a second class-carriage, and heard Faulkener ask the male prisoner for his address—he said "7, Park Villas Crouch End"—Faulkener asked him whether the season ticket was his—he said "Yes"—he offered to pay me the fare; I refused to take it and told Faulkener to take his name from the season and the number of the season; and then he was asked for his address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When the name and number are obtained we can find out by the books the name and address of the person who holds the ticket—I did not go to Fern Villa, 19, Perth Road, Finsbury Park; I believe Mr. Williams did—he is the Company's detective inspector, I know some one went—Faulkener asked my advice and I said "Take the name and number of the ticket"—I did not see paper and pencil produced the train was very soon off after I came up—the gentleman offered me the fare to King's Cross—they might have got out at Holloway but they did not—I asked him whether the season ticket was his and he said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Citizen Road, Holloway—I got into this train at Holloway station—the prisoners were in the com<lb></lb>partment when I got in, sitting opposite each other, and nobody else—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060081"></xptr>
               <p>after the train left Holloway they were talking to each other, and when we got to York Road I heard one of them say that they thought the Company would not take any more notice of it, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I gave a statement yesterday of my evidence, to Messrs. Wontner, the Attorneys for the Great Northern Railway—it was not in answer to an advertisement; I expect they knew me, I have travelled for many years on the line, and I mentioned it to one of the inspectors as I came home the same day—I took what the male prisoner held up to be a purse—I heard the collector ask the lady for her ticket, and saw her give him this season ticket—he opened it and said "Is this your address?"or "your ticket?"—the male prisoner said "Yes,"and offered to pay the fare for the lady I suppose—the inspector was then called, but before that the gentleman asked for a piece of paper and lead pencil to write down the address—the collector gave him a pencil, and I think they had a piece of paper themselves—the lady tried to write but she could not—I do not think the pencil would mark—I heard the collector read the station from the ticket, it was some villa near Crouch End—the male prisoner said "That is our address."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The lady was asked if hers was the same address, and she said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk in the Season Ticket Department, Great Northern Railway, King's Cross—the prisoner Henry Gehrke is a second-class season ticket holder between King's Cross and Crouch End—this is the season ticket issued to him—he gave his address Fern Villa, 19, Perth Road—the female prisoner does not hold a season ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There is a proper register of season ticket holders, and on looking at this ticket we could tell Mr. Gehrke's address—I do not recollect his calling at our office on Tuesday the 16th to explain the matter, but I was told he did call—I did not hear the explanation—he has been a season ticket holder for three years—just before the expiry of season tickets we send a form to holders to be filled in, and one would be sent to Mr. Gehrke—I did not call on him to ask for an explanation on 25th April—I cannot say who did—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner Augusta here produced a third<lb></lb>class season ticket in her own name, between Crouch Hill and King's Cross on the Midland Railway, until</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1878)—I did not know then that she was a season ticket holder on the Midland, but I know it now—the Crouch End station of the Great Northern Railway, and the Crouch Hill station of the Midland are a very short distance apart, and some of the trains when they arrive at the Metropolitan Station, King's Cross, stand on the same platform, but only those trains which run through to Moorgate Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and reside in Little North-street, Port-man-market—on Saturday afternoon, 12th March, I was in Lisson-grove, going home, between 3 and 4 o'clock—the prisoner and two other men came up to me—I was knocked down—one that is away knocked me down—I know him by sight, but I don't know his name—I was not a great way from the Champion public-house—the prisoner was there when I was knocked down—before they came to me I had a purse in my left-hand pocket containing 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was when I was knocked down they all ran away down Stamford-street—the prisoner was the last who ran away—I directly felt for my purse, and I had not got it—the money and the purse was gone—I have not been able to get it since—I went to the police-station in John-street, Edgware-road—I saw the prisoner there; he is one of the three that were together when I was knocked down.</p>

               <p>Was your house destroyed in June last? - It was. They began on Wednesday night and finished on Thursday morning. The house was all broke to pieces, and my goods burnt.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners? - I know the white woman, Roberts; she lived next door to me, some time ago; her behaviour was so audacious, I got the officers of the parish to remove her from me. On that account she had a great spite against me. After the mob had pulled down the ambassador's house, she came by my house, and said, You outlandish bouger, I will have your house down; you outlandish Papist, I will have your house down. She said so on Monday and Tuesday. On the Wednesday evenning she went by my house with another woman. She terrified me.</p>
               <p>Mention the expressions she used on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, about pulling your house down? - In the evening she and another woman came by and called me an outlandish bouger, and said my house must come down, that it was a Papist's house. And used other language of that sort. She was like wild fire to burn the world down. These expressions were repeated on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.</p>
               <p>You heard these expressions? - Yes, and many of my neighbours. She fulfilled her word; my house was destroyed that night. When I went about three o'clock in the morning to see the condition of the house, I saw her in the room where I lay. She had taken possession of the house; she was leaning out at the window; she had the command of the house.</p>

               <p>Did you see her take more than one parcel? - I did not observe how many parcels, but she was in the mob the whole night to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What were the mob doing? - Pulling the house all to pieces, both inside and out, and throwing the things out at the window. They carried them out to the top of Towerhill, and there they burnt them. It is about fifty or sixty yards from the house to where they made the fire.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did you see me take any of the property away?</p>
               <p>She took them after they were thrown into the street, and they threw them at one another. I did not see her go into the house.</p>

When they came down stairs she was carrying things by loads to the fire, and was bringing things out of my master's house.

               <p>I live at Deptford. I was in St. Catherine's-lane, at about eleven or a little after eleven o'clock, at the time of this riot.</p>
               <p>Did you see Roberts there? - Not till about three in the morning. I absconded from the house, and did not return till day-light; when the gentlemen of the association came. I saw this woman, Roberts, in the bed-chamber. I spoke to one of the young gentlemen of the association, to present his piece at her, in order to intimidate her; he did; she was leaning out of the window, and seemed very much in liquor. She said he might fire and be buggered.</p>
               <p>Had you either that night or the night before heard her say any thing about the riots? - Several nights I heard her threaten Mr. Lebarty's house.</p>
               <p>What night in particular? - On Tuesday night, she said, There was a mob in the Minories, and she would go and fetch them to pull down his house. She called him an old Portuguese bouger. I watched her out of the lane, and then I absconded from my house for fear. On Wednesday night I saw her go up the lane, and I think she then used the same expressions.</p>

               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners then? - No; I saw the rioters, but could not distinguish any body in particular; I heard her say when she was taken, that she had some of Mr. Lebarty's property.</p>

There was a man with a flag, and another with a bell; and a man with a frying pan and a pair of tongs; and there was a black woman between the men.</p>
               <p>How long after that was it before Mr. Lebarty's house was broke open? - I suppose about a quarter of an hour after; as soon as they could break the window shutters they got in; they hallo'd out huzza! down with Popery, down with Popery.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner Gardiner hallowing? - Yes; before the house was broke open; she hallo'd and huzza'd, and cried out Wood for the fire, d - n your eyes, wood for the fire.</p>
               <p>Was there any fire at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect observing her go into the house, or that she was in the house? - Yes. I saw her going in and out of the house several times; I believe she was the first who got in at the door; I saw her go in and out and bring out a great deal of furniture and carry it to the fire.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say any thing at that time? - Yes. I heard her swearing and crying, More wood for the fire, d - n your eyes you bouger, more wood for the fire. She continued there the whole night.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you see her first? - At about half an hour after eleven o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280156"></xptr> when the mob first came; when the gentlemen soldiers came she dispersed with the rest of the mob.</p>
               <p>ROBERTS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming home pretty near eleven o'clock; they were breaking Mr. Lebarty's door open; I could not get to my apartment. The mob asked me if I was a Roman? I said no. They said, if I did not help to carry the things to the fire they would smother me; somebody threw a bolster over my head, and almost smothered me; a person gave me some paper to take care of. The next morning I heard there was a fire there; I was not there the next morning that the gentleman mentions.</p>
               <p>For Roberts.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I will speak the truth, which I know between my neighbour. I live as nigh to him as I am now to your lordship, opposite his house. I was at my own door; a great many of the mob came. I rescued as many things as I could from these people for Mr. Lebarty. I had a great many of his things concealed in my house before the riot began. I put them with the other things which I had of his. I saw Roberts picking up feathers, the mob had cut beds and were throwing them about the place. I said, how can you behave so when you are neighbours all together. Said she, I will take care of them for Mr. Lebarty, when he comes for them he shall have them. The next day, I believe, she told me the bellman had been about; she gave him notice that she had things in her possession. The bellman told her to keep them till he fetched them and she should come into no trouble about it. I saved a great many of his goods for him, and because I did not choose to swear to people whom I knew nothing of, he said, they would reckon me among the mob; they told me if I did not come that they should take me up after the session was over, and give me three months imprisonement.</p>
               <p>Court. Who said so to you? - Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. What time of the morning are you speaking of that you saw the prisoner taking care of things? - Three in the morning.</p>
               <p>You are certain the prisoner Roberts was taking care of something, what was that? - Loose feathers, which lay down on the ground, and a few wills and powers, which I saw; they came and returned them to Mr. Lebarty.</p>

               <p>Q. On what day - A. I believe, I proposed it on the 19th of April: there was no bill due until afterwards. I think the first bill was not due till the Wednesday; I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. By your stopping payment the prisoner was suddenly called upon for payment of these bills - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at the time that you stopped payment you knew that you and the prisoner were not insolvent - A. I knew I was, and I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your stopping payment there was an arrangement made - A. There was an arrangement made with the Bank. I was not there; my trustees went to the Bank. I put my affairs into the hands of Mr. Warner.</p>
               <p>Q. Nash put his affairs into the hands of Mr. Kemble, the tea broker - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least idea that the prisoner had the least idea of defrauding you, or the Bank - A. Not the least; I always believed him to be a safe man, a respectable and worthy man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I most solemnly declare, that I had no intention to commit a fraud upon any one; had I been so disposed, is it reasonable that I should put my own name after Mr. Cobb he accepted all my bills, and they have been all regularly paid, and this would have been paid had not Mr. Cobb failed at the moment, nevertheless my estate was fully able to pay my bills, and every shilling I owe; a little time was required to arrange my affairs, and get in my debts, and in order to shew that I had no intention to defraud, that after the bill became due I never absented myself from my business, or my home; I frequently went to the Bank to arrange the payments of the bill, one for five hundred pounds has been paid since my imprisonment, the other has been offered; I have nothing to add. I have a wife and four infants, wholly dependant on me.</p>

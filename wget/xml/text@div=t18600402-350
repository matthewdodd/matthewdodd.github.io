                  </hi>. I am master of the Edmonton Union—on 30th December I went into the board-room and found one of the windows broken, the fastening undone, and the sash put up—I missed this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which had been hanging up, and this small desk used by the chairman—the prisoners had been inmates of the house—Watts came in on 20th December and left on the 27th, the day after we kept Christmas day—Eaton came in on 29th November, and discharged himself with Watts on 27th December—I saw the clock safe on Wednesday, and this was on Thursday or Friday—I have seen the desk many times.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 177). I took Eaton on 7th March and told him I should charge him with being concerned, with another prisoner named Watts who was in custody, in breaking into the Edmonton Union and stealing a clock and writing-desk—he said, "I thought as much, but I did not steal it; I am concerned in it; I persuaded Watts not to take the desk, but he thought there was some money in it, and took it: I told him I thought the job was not worth doing."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eaton. Q.</hi> Did you ever see us in company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and you have been convicted together in 1857—I did not see you together at the time of the robbery, but I did the day before—I saw you together about a week or a fortnight before you were apprehended, which was in February, but you had been locked up three weeks for an assault before I apprehended you.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of December, I was in a boat with my brother, I said somebody was robbing my master's craft, we had better row after them, which we did; I saw a skiff alongside of the barge; we came up to them and asked them how they came by the coals; they said they were given to them. The skiff was near to them. There was about eleven bushels, which were worth about thirteen-pence a bushel; we took the men up and put them in the watch-house; they then said they had lost their skiff, and that they gave a man three-pence to take them down to the barge.</p>
               <p>FEELING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had two loaded craft belonging to a gentleman who was my employer, which lay along-side these gentlemen's craft. I thought I had a skiff ashore, but when I came to look for her she was stolen away. I said to these two men, I will treat you with a pot of beer if you will lend me a hand in with two craft which are loaded; they agreed to go with me and lend me a hand. I went down to the water-side, and the skiff, as I said before, was stolen away. I got a skuller and gave three-pence to carry off these two men and me; when I got along-side, I had Mr. Wood's craft to step over to get into my master's barge; just as I had stepped over one or two of these craft, I happened to see my own skiff along-side my master's craft; I said here is my - skiff, I will take her to the wharf and see if any body owns any thing about the coals, if not I do not know what to do with her. There came off five or six of these men; they asked, who are you? I said a lighterman. Have you been robbing the craft, these are my master's coals? I said I do not know that they are your master's coals, they were along-side my master's craft? they said we will take the skiff away to Mr. Wood's our master; I said if you will you must, to be sure there is a supernumerous of you; I said did you see me or either of these men touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120029"></xptr>a coal. They said, O, you have had them out. I said, if they would say that I could not help it; I said, they may belong to you for any thing I know. They stopped the skiff and then fetched a runner from Mr. Sherwood's and took these two men that were in the barge astern of my master's barge. I said to Mr. Sherwood's men, you know me, I am not going to run away nor fly, I have done nothing I am afraid of. They said we know you and will take your word. I said either to-night or in the morning I will surrender myself voluntarily up to you. They took my word, and in the morning I went and surrendered myself up, having done nothing to be afraid of. We had a hearing, and according to what these men said Mr. Sherwood committed us; he said it is petit larceny; after that Mr. Wood made it grand larceny. I did not know any thing about petit or grand. As to the coals I did not touch one; it is natural for a lighterman to walk over other people's craft without any design of ill-behaviour. If I had any inclination that way, there was property enough of my master's, without distressing any other gentleman; there were thirty chaldron of my employer's coals.</p>

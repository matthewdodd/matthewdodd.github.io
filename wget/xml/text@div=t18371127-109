                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, and keep a shop at No. 49, Hedge-row, Islington. On Tuesday, the 19th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was looking through a hole which I made in my window, which separates my kitchen from the prisoner's parlour—they live next door to me—(the window was painted, and I rubbed a bit off to look through)—I saw a goblet which belonged to me, and which I had missed on the Sunday—the policeman and I then went into the prisoner's house, and there I found numerous articles belonging to me; there were eleven pairs of trowsers, a pair of breeches, eight waistcoats, and a quantity of articles—they are here now—I saw the female prisoner, and told her I understood there was a trap-door communicating from their house to mine, I wished to see it—she asked us to walk up stairs, and showed a place which she said she believed to be the place—the policeman then said he wished to see her boxes and drawers, and in every box and drawer I found something belonging to me—I found a quantity of glass in a glass case of hers—I believe they are man and wife—some of these boxes were locked—I think she took the keys from her pocket—I could not speak positively to that—shortly after the male pri<lb></lb>soner came in—the policeman made some remark to him, and told him he was in custody, and that it was an unfortunate thing for him—he made no particular answer—the policeman showed him some articles that were found—I went into the yard, and found some baskets, and there was a number of articles in two of them belonging to me—I did not go through the trap-door—it communicates with my house—I can lift up the trap in my kitchen—it communicates from there to their bed-room—I did not know of it before—I have been there about twelve months, and have been losing property all the time.</p>

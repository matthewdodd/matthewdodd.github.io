They call'd for a Dram and drank it, but did not give me any, upon which I told them my Business call'd me, and I must go. Then they said, if I would not have any more, I should pay for what had been call'd in, and they began to swear and threaten me, therefore I pulled out my Money to pay for it, and they seeing my Money, that Woman at the Bar laid hold of my Hand and took it from me. There were three Guineas in Gold, a Moidore, a French Crown, some Silver, and a few Halfpence; the whole I believe was about 5 l. 6 s or thereabouts. The Prisoner wrench'd my Money out of my Hands, some of which she got, and the rest fell on the Floor, and I then cryed out Murder! upon which she called for a Knife, and swore she would stop my cackling presently. Seeing some of my Money on the Floor, I attempted to take it up, and then they sent to the Sign of the Porto-Bello, and six or seven Fellows came with Sticks, and began to beat me, and the Persons who came to my Assistance in a very violent Manner.</p>

            . I was in the House when the Prisoner was taken up, which was on Christmass Eve, and that Man in the white Coat and white Wig, (Sugden) came in with the Constable , and said he had lost so much Money, and right or wrong he would swear to the Prisoner. I was there when the Man came in first and the Prisoner was not then in the House, but came in a Quarter of an Hour afterwards. He might as well charged me as her. I did not see him pull out any Money, neither did I hear any Cry of Murder, but there was something of a Noise above-Stairs, and then I went out.</p>

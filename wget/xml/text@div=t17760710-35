I said with all my heart; Captain Johnson took up the money: we then agreed to meet at the King's-Head Tavern, at the corner of Tower-hill, to shew the money and determine who had gained or lost: I went between three and four in the afternoon, and found them all there; they proposed to go to the <placeName id="t17760710-35-crimeloc164">Ticket Porter's in Cooper's-row, Crutched-friars</placeName>

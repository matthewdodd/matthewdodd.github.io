            . I am a carpenter. On the 23d of June, a quarter before nine in the evening, I was coming home, this little girl came crying to me, and said some person had taken the tea chest off the mantle piece; I came back with the little girl, I saw the prisoner going towards the house again; I went up to him and asked him what he had done with the property, the little girl said he had got it in his bat; accordingly he pulled off his hat and gave it into my hands; I asked him how he came to do such a thing; he told me it was through distress; he begged me to let him go. I took him to Queen-square office.</p>

            . I am going eleven years old. My mother went out and left me and my younger sister in the house; the prisoner knocked at the door and came in, he asked me if Mrs. Mackenzie was at home; I told him no, he said he brought a bill from Mr. Smith, the linen-draper, for Mrs. Mackenzie; then he went into the parlour and asked me if I could mind the bill; I told him I would mind it very carefully. He put the bill on the mantle piece, in the mean while he took the caddie and and put it in his hat. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

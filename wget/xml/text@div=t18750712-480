                  </hi>. I served my time with an auctioneer in the country and subsequently I was engaged in the office of Mr. Marsh, the auctioneer—in October last I was desirous of finding a business for myself and communicated with my solicitors, Messrs. Harper and Battcock, for that purpose—a few days before 20th October I received a communication from them and went to the defendant's premises 127, Edgware Road—I said my brother had told me that he was desirous of getting a partner and I had called upon him to learn a few particulars of the business—he entered into a general detail of what he had been doing for the last ten months—he said he had been carrying on business as a house and estate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120033"></xptr>
               <p>agent and house decorator and he had made about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that'-time I understood him to say, and he then introduced this book (<hi rend="italic">pro duced</hi>) and said all the entries of money was commission that he had made and which made up the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had made during the year—he said where the entries were marked across that was the commission he had received—I did not examine the book carefully—I just went through it—the entries are crossed some with the word "Let" and some "Sold" and "Com" with the amounts—I did) not examine any of those entries in detail on that occasion—he told me that one of the reasons for taking a partner was that he had taken an hotel at Gravesend and he wanted to devote attention to that and wanted somebody to look after the business—I said I would see my brother about it and see him again—I saw my brother and went with him on 20th October—my brother was spokesman on that occasion—the book was again produced by the defendant—my brother took down on a piece of paper the amounts that were in the book as they were read out by the defendant—my brother was taking them from the book, and he said he would call them out—he said the entries were the commission that he had received—we then went away and I wrote this letter to him the same afternoon—I can't say whether this is the original or a copy; of course I took a copy of the letter that I wrote—I received this letter from Marshall in reply: "Dear Sir,—Your letter of yesterday's; date came duly to hand. In reply I beg to state that I accept your offer on the terms, but on condition that the same be completed forthwith. You; know my reason for making this condition, namely, that I want some one here as soon as possible. In going over my books you must please not forget that the twelvemonths is not up till the middle of December, and therefore the business is really more* than you think. With regard to references you don't state what you require to know, but as you have seen everything else I presume you refer to respectability, and therefore mention Mr. A. Brown, 88, Edgware Road, who has known me about fifteen years and also my landlord, but I could not see him to-day, and of course must ask before giving his name. There is nothing to prevent your preparing the necessary deeds, as you will find everything so straightforward that you cannot be otherwise than satisfied. I am faithfully yours, George Marshall." On receiving that letter I communicated with my solicitors and on 29th October I went to his office and gave him a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has been paid—on 4th November we met at the solicitor's office and a deed of partnership was drawn up, which was signed and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by my solicitors on my behalf—I personally made inquiries from Mrs. Stoffell and Mr. Ward, there being those entries in the books—I also went to Mr. Hanscomb and Miss Grabham, Miss Skinner and Mrs. Davey—in consequence of the information I there gathered I communicated with my solicitors—I told them what had happened and left the matter since then entirely in their hands—I was induced to pay the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the commission that he said he had earned during the ten months; the profits he had made, but more especially the commission—I knew more about that than I did about house decorating, as I know nothing about that.</p>

               <p>which has been produced—I saw some books with counterfoils—this is an ordinary auctioneer's book with cards to view; the names of the places and so forth would be on the counterfoils and tickets are torn out and given to the persons desiring to view—I kept a book like that myself during the two months I was there—I. saw this book at the time, some of it is in my writing—it is a full book of counterfoils of people who came to do business at the premises, to view houses wo had to let, and which were on the boobs—it is the custom with house agents and auctioneers for people who have businesses to let or sell, to place their business or premises on two or three auctioneer's books at the same time, so that the same things that were on our books may have been on two or three other house agents' books at the same time, and whoever lets first gets the commission—I have not had any notice to produce a document of arrangement entered into between me and the defendant, subsequently to my leaving the business—I don't know that, my attorney has—I don't know anything about it—I can't say that any agreement was entered into between us—I don't know anything about. it—I left it entirely in my solicitors' hands; they knew how to settle it better than I did—an arrangement was not made at my suggestion that the part<lb></lb>nership was to be dissolved and a portion of the money paid to me—I never gave my solicitors any such instructions—I can't say what. was done about it—no arrangement was made that I know of—Mr. Marshall never attempted to remove the book, which he first showed me, from the office, during our partnership—he left it there for me to have free access to it, and to do what I liked with—I took the book away subsequently, when I. found out this—some actions were brought in the country in which. Mr. Marshall was the plaintiff—I did not refuse to return the book to carry on the suits—I had not got the book, my solicitors had it—I. took the book away under their instructions and gave it to them—when I went into partnership the defendant had a banking account at the City Bank—my solicitors had possession of the leases of the premises as well as the book—they were with the solicitors from the commencement of the partnership, and I suppose they never got out of their hands—they have got them now—I value the leases at very little—if properly let I should say they-are worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more, certainly—I have not taken any one's opinion as to their value, that is my own opinion—I gave the tickets to view to persons who applied for them and the premises were, all on our books to let—I can't say that there were fifty-eight furnished houses on the books to be let, when I left the business in February 15th, and I can't say that the com-mission if let would be 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or that there were twenty-one properties for sale and the commission on them if all had been sold amounted to 2,670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say that they are in the book—I don't know how much they would make up altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The houses and properties entered in the book for which I gave orders to view were not all in the book before 4th November—some of them were entered in the book before the partnership and some after—I can't tell you the number of properties that were put into my charge for letting from November to February; I could tell from the list—I should think about thirty or forty fresh properties came in during the time I was partner—in some cases they were brought to me, and in other cases we sought for them—I never let anything at all, and nothing resulted from the orders to view—I paid in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the City Bank, and he paid in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the leases that I have spoken of is the lease of the offices—I paid</p>

               <p>100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I don't think they would let for any more—then there is the lease of next door, 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the rental of that is 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—it ought to let for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in detachments, and we should have to pay property tax for that—I think the lease has six or ten years to run—as an auctioneer, I say that the total value of the leases in the hands of my solicitors is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have purchased the goodwill of this business for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known what I know now with reference to the commissions in the. book. (<hi rend="italic">The deed of partnership was partly read.

I am the prosecutor's brother, and a member of the firm of Harper, Broad &amp; Battcock, solicitors, Rood Lane—my brother com<lb></lb>municated with me for the purpose of taking a business, and I saw the defendant alone in Edgware Road before I went with my brother—we had a general discussion about his business, and he said he was making at the rate of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he had made that within the previous ten months, and I said I would call on him again with my brother and we would go into the matter—on the 20th October I went there with my brother, and we had a general conversation to the same effect—I asked Mr. Marshall for his books, so that we might see what business he was doing—he produced this book, saying it was the only book he had showing the state of his business—I took the book—he said they were entries of houses in his hands for the purpose of being sold or let, and where the figures were written across, was the commission he had received for the sale or letting of-those houses—upon that, I took a piece of paper to take down the commissions to see what they amounted to—I took down the. first two or three amounts myself, and then the defendant said it would save time if he called them out to me as he knew the book better—he called out the amounts, and I took them down, they amounted to 539<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that' is the commission—he also gave me a list of other sums earned, with reference to valuations, but I did not attach much importance to those—we said we would consider the matter, and make him an offer—we then left, and a letter was written by my brother on the 20th, and the answer was received on the 29th, which has been read—on 4th November 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid at my office, and the leases were deposited with me—I prepared the partnership deeds, and they were left with me as solicitor for the parties at that time—I have them still—this book was brought to me shortly before 12th February, and this letter was written by my firm on the 12th. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "Having been consulted by your partner, Mr. H. T. Battcock, with reference to having secretly drawn cheques in the name of the firm, we, in consequence of being informed that hardly any business has been done since the commencement of the partnership, advised inquiries to be made as to the commission which you stated you had received in the ten months preceding the partnership and on the faith of which Mr. Batt-cock paid you a premium of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The result of those inquiries has been that in almost every case gone into it appears no commission was received by you at all. It thus seems to us that the premium of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was obtained by you under false pretences. But before finally arriving at that conclusion we desire to give you an opportunity for any explanation you may think proper, and we request that you will do this at once, otherwise we shall conclude that you have none to offer.")

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Cambridge Crescent, and have a boarding-house there—I went to the prisoner's office to give him particulars with reference to letting my house, but I could not find anyone there—my husband after-wards put it on his books, I believe—the house was sold, but it was not car-ried out—I can't say whether it was sold by Mr. Marshall; it was sold at the time it was on his books, but it was not carried out—I think there were some orders to view from the prisoner—I have not paid him 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or any money—my husband is here and he will tell you whether he claimed it or not.</p>

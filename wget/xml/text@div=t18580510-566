On Saturday afternoon, May 1st, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the two prisoners, came there—Knight went up and got his great coat—he was very much the worse for liquor, and I asked him to sit down in my room, which he did—the other man came up with him—when "Knight unlocked the door, Lawrence went into the warehouse—I saw him antying the papers—he tied thein up, and took them down stairs—Knight then went down; ne did not see Lawrence take the papers down—while Knight was sitting in my room I could see into the warehouse—Knight followed Lawrence down stairs soon after he went—Knightsat in my room a few minutes—as he sat he could not see Lawrence take the paper down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, having premises at No. 17, Harp Lane. The prisoners have been in my employment—Knight as foreman of the store for about fifteen years; he is not a mechanic; and Lawrence about the same time, on and off—he had not been in my employment for the fort<lb></lb>night before this happened—he had no business to be on my premises on that afternoon—the room mentioned by the last witness is where I keep my stock of paper hangings—I have looked at these papers produced, but I cannot swear to them—in consequence of information, I sent for Lawrence, the following evening, Wednesday, 5th May; I asked him how he came to be on my premises when I was gone into town, the Saturday night, and said, "You could have no business there at all"—he said he came after a broken auger—Isaid, "You could have no auger up there; what did you do with the bundle of paper hangings that Mrs. Arlow saw you take up and carry down stairs?"—ne said it was a bundle of paper hangings that he bought on Saturday afternoon, of the Jews in Petticoat Lane, and took up stairs while he looked for the auger—I said, "What! Petticoat Lane on a Saturday? there is no business done there"—he said, "Yes, I have, and I have bought another bundle this morning in Bishopsgate Street?"—I said, "Have you any notes of them? If you will take me to the persons whom you bought them of, or to whom you disposed of them, I shall be satisfied; otherwise, I must take you to the Lord Mayor, and see if he will believe that story"—he said that he did not know them, and went away—I had told Knight on the Saturday, when I paid-him at 2 o'clock, that he need not come back any more—Lawrence had no business there at all for anything.</p>

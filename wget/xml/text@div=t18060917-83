               <p>Q. Where did you meet with O'Donnell. - A. I heard of his being taken the Friday after, I ordered the Bow-street man to give notice.</p>

               <p>Q. You found out you were mistaken, and you found him to be a Bow-street patrol. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard on the Friday after, that he was taken up, did you go to Bow-street, or any other office, to make an enquiry. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say to some person that you did not mention his name to the Bow-street officer, and that you did not know his name. - A. I do not know that I did, I cannot swear one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. He was afterwards committed, that you heard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to Marlbrough-street, after he was committed. - A. I did, I saw Foy, I went there to ask what officer took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never intended to make any charge, till after he was committed, you never made any charge to the magistrate that he had robbed you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you mentioned to Foy that he was the person that robbed you. - A. I forget, I will not swear it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever prefer your bill until you saw the prisoner at the bar for trial at this sessions. - A. Yes, I went last Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you understand there is a forty pounds reward, and that you would perhaps have a share in it. - A. I do not want it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you suppose that you would be entitled to a part of it. - A. I know now you have told me, I did not know it before. I have heard many say so both before I preferred the bill of indictment and after.</p>
               <p>- CODGELL sworn. I am the daughter of the last witness, I was with my father on the said night, I was asleep when the man was in the cart, my father awaked me, he told me there was somebody wanting money, there was another man at the horse's head; I did not know the man in the cart; after he had robbed my father, he laid a pistol across my lap, and he desired me to give him my money, I told him I had none, he said he knew better, if I had it not about me I had it in the cart. I then told him I had some halfpence, he put his hand into my pocket and took a handful, he dropped some in the cart, I gave him the rest, he got out of the cart and told my father to go on; we went on, about twenty yards, and then my father said he would go after them, I went home with the cart and my father went after the men.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner. - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. - There was no property found that ever belonged to this man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My Lord, I have had the misfortune to be here tried, and convicted of a capital offence. I hope that circumstance will not operate against me on the present occasion; I was led into that offence by Cuddiford, who was the principal witness in that case. I most solemnly declare I am innocent of this charge, and to this declaration. I call upon God to witness, as I expect for mercy here and hereafter. I did not know of this charge against me till last Wednesday, when I was informed that my prosecutor had sworn that I was the man that robbed him, that he knew my person only from happening to see me at prize fights. I understood also that he went to the Bow-street patrol, and informed him of the robbery, but not of my person. If he had known my name he ought to have mentioned it directly and have gone to the Police-Office. If he had so done, I should have been directly apprehended. He must also learn from the public newspapers that I was in custody, and had been several times examined at the Marlbrough-street office. I should humbly think he ought to have gone to the office and made his charge, and then I should have heard what he had to alledge against me, and when the circumstance was recent I might have brought to my friend's recollection where I was, but in this course of time I cannot; I must trust my case to your Lordship and the jury, being well assured that notwithstanding my unfortunate situation, every justice will be done me.</p>

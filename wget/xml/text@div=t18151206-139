I lost a chest of tea, between the hours of four and five, in the afternoon of the 11th of November; my shop is in the lower part of the house. I received some information, and heard the words, he is gone! he is gone! and then I saw the prisoner crossing the road. with the chest of tea from my shop; he was carrying it on his shoulder; and he was brought back immediately after. He threw it down, and then ran about a hundred yards; one of my workmen took care of my tea, while it was on the ground. I pursued the prisoner, but somebody stopped him before I did.</p>

            . I was in Southampton-row, on the evening in question; I am a workman of Mr. Smith's, I am a plumber. Towards the evening, I saw the prisoner lurking about the shop window. I was in the shop at the other end, drinking some beer, with the other workmen, and I saw him take a chest of tea out of the shop; I saw him on his knees with his hands before him. When he got to the door he set off running, and run across the road, with the tea; the tea was on his arms. I assisted in pursuing him, and he dropped the tea, which I took care of while the prisoner was stopped and brought back by Mr. Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cook, and live in Park-street, Grosve<lb></lb>nor-square. On Saturday, the 21st of May, I was, I was on my return from Fetcham-park in a wagon—it was half-past ten o'clock when I arrived at Epson—it was about one o'clock in the morning when I lost my skewers—I cannot tell where I was, or in what part of the road—there were many person in the carriage—they stopped at a public-house—I got into a wagon—the prisoners were, there, but not when I left Epsom, they came in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183606130187"></xptr>
               <p>afterwards—I found myself pushed about by them—I meant to walk on foot—I had my portmanteau, when I arrived at Epson—I could not get any coach—I saw one cart, and in that cart five or six gentlemen—they said, "You go to London?"—I said, "Yes, what time do you think you will take to arrive?"—they said, "Five or six hours"—I said, "How much you charge?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—they said, "Where is your port<lb></lb>manteau?"—I gave it to him—I got in and took my seat—they stopped a quarter of an hour at one public-house—it was about midnight—the cart stopped again—all the people got down except me—they said, "Come with me"—I said, "No, thank you"—they go in the public-house, and then they come in again in three quarters of an hour—that two prisoners came by my side—I was sleepy—in half an hour I felt my pocket touched—I thought these men would have something from my pocket—a few minutes after I felt the skewers gone from my pocket—after that these men touched my pocket again, and said, "You can sing an Italian song?"—these two left, and the man changed his seat, and squeezed me as much as possible—after that I slept a little, and felt his hand come to my side—I took my coat tail up, and the other made all possible movement to move my hand, and one knocked my head once or twice—I said, "Will you be quiet if you please? I pray you leave me alone—I don't want to play with you"—they laughed, and said many disagreeable words, and squeezed my legs—I complained many times, but it was useless—they did not understand—during that time we had passed one gate, where the carriage paid the duty—they stopped at that time, and then went on again—I called the carter to stop the cart—he said nothing—he smoked his pipe, and I knocked him—he was sleepy all the night—he says, "That is very bad; you make very bad manners with that gentlemen"—then I get over the cart to go and get my portmanteau—he would not let me have it—I said, "You must let me have it"—I cannot tell the precise time when I lost my skewers—it was about one o'clock in the morning—the two prisoners were by me when I lost them—they did not push me before they left—I suppose they came to London—they stopped till I got down, but I stopped about half-road—I got my hat and port<lb></lb>manteau, and went to find the policeman—Stone's hand was on any pocket to get my watch out, but the skewers taken before that—I was sensible they were taken from me—Stone took them, I am certain—when they were out I was much more comfortable—I was not so squeezed—the other prisoner knocked my head to give him facility—I was not knocked at all before the skewers were taken—I was squeezed before I felt them go.</p>

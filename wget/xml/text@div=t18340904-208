On the 18th of August, I saw the prisoner walking about the whole morning, with a newspaper in his hand, and no hat on - about two in the day, when the shop was full, he came in - he pulled out a card, and said, "I am a merchant, and to-morrow morning I shall have a cargo of goods, come over, that will stock all Marylebone" - I said, "Do not bother me; what do you want?" - he said, "A white hat" - I showed him one - he said, "This will do; I will go and look in the glass" - I thought he was going into my room, but he ran off in a moment - my neighbour followed and took him.</p>

            . I keep a public-house, next door to the prosecutor. The prisoner came to my house the day before; he said he wanted lodging for a week, and his brother was coming from Paris with a cargo of goods - he said he had a large mansion in Paris - I showed him my bed room - he was satisfied with it - he had his breakfast and the newspaper - he took dinner, tea, supper, and bed - the next morning, he called for breakfast and the newspaper - at eleven o'clock, he called for a pint of ale - I took it to him, with the bill - he then walked out with his hands behind him, and came in with this hat - he said he had bought a very nice white hat, and he thought he looked better in a white hat than a black one - I thought he was going up stairs, but instead of that he bolted out at my back door - I followed in him about an hour and a half, and then came up to him, and said, "Do you mean to come back and settle this bill?" - he said he would come back and settle it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040115"></xptr>double and treble - he went to eight or nine different houses, and wanted to borrow the money - he then said he would leave his coat with me for it.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had bought the hat for 7s. 6d., and went to his bed-room for his purse, which was missing, and he could not pay for it.)</p>

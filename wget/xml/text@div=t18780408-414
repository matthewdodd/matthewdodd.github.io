I am a cabinet-maker and live at 10, Elston Street, but I lived at 5, Royston Street, on 9th of March—I am a volunteer—on 9th March I was in a fried-fish shop in Weaver Street—Hurley was leaning on the counter—he said "I know how to use that b—thing as well as you," meaning my rifle—he also said "I will take your bayonet from you and put it in your b—guts"—I said I did not come there to make a disturbance, and my wife told him not to in<lb></lb>terfere with me—he struck my wife and I struck him—I was thrown on the ground and forced into the street—about a dozen people were in the fish shop—two men seized my rifle and tried to take it from me—I struggled—Hurley struck me on the nose and knocked me down—I was kicked—my wife was then in the shop—I felt that my bayonet was being drawn—I heard my wife call out "Murder," "Police"—I lost my bayonet—when I got up a man gave me information—I walked with him till we met a policeman, in Commercial Road, when he ran away—I saw my wife when I got up; she said "I have lost my purse," and I said, "I have lost my bayonet"—the man who went away was one of the men who held me.</p>

I am the wife of William Edgell—I was in his company on the evening of the 9th March in the fish shop—I heard Hurley say to my husband "Put that bayonet down, I know how to use it as well as you do, and if you do not put it down I will put it through your b—guts"—my husband was pushed out—when I came out I saw a man standing over my husband with a bayonet as if he was going to push it in him—Hurley put his hand in my pocket and took out my purse—I held him by the collar—the shop door was shut—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Was in the purse—there was a half-sovereign, two two-shilling pieces, some shillings and small change—it was a brown leather purse—Donovan came up and said "Have you got it?"—Hurley said "Yes"—Donovan kicked me on the leg and ran away—I was then obliged to let go my hold of Hurley—I went into the fried-fish shop about 10 minutes to 12, and the affair lasted about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

From information I received, I stopped Donovan in Little Pole Street at 12.45 on 10th March—Mrs. Edgell was with me—she identified him—I told him the charge—he replied that he had not been in the fish shop or near it, but that he had been to an Irish wake and had only just come out—I was at the station when Mrs. Edgell came, and it was from her description that I appre<lb></lb>hended Donovan—I went to Hurley's house with another constable—I told him the charge—he replied that he had been drinking at a public-house in Whitechapel and had heard of the occurrence about an hour previous—at the station he said he saw and knew all about it, but he did not leave the fish shop but stayed in the shop the whole time—I found nothing on him.</p>

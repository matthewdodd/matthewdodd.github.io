                  </hi>. I am an engineer of 7, Charles-street, Islington-green—about half-past 2, on 29th January, I was looking into a toy-shop window, in Cheapside—a man came up to me, not the prisoner; I had some conversation with him, and we went into a public-house in Newgate-street, where the prisoner introduced himself to the other man, and said that he had just recovered an action in the Court of Chancery, and on the following Saturday, he was to receive 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other man said that he had some houses to sell, would the prisoner buy them, and the prisoner agreed to do so—upon that, it was agreed that we should adjourn to another public-house, in Earl-street, I believe—we all three went there together, and the first man that introduced himself to me, left the prisoner and me, and fetched a third man—(they had said at the first public house that I was to be a witness to the purchase of the sixteen houses)—after they returned, gambling was the first thing carried on, by chalking upon the table—the prisoner and the other man who was fetched in did that—one pot of beer was had—I drank once out of it—this was up stairs—one of them, I do not remember which, asked me to pay for the pot of beer—I said that I could not, I had only twopence on me—the man not in custody then asked me what the time was—I pulled out my watch and told him—I had no sooner done so than he snatched my watch from me and gave it to the prisoner—I requested the prisoner several times to give it to me, and it was agreed that I was to go out with them and pawn it—I did not agree to pawn it as I had ordered no beer—we all went off together, the watch being in the prisoner's possession—I kept fast hold of the prisoner's arm—I asked him for it three different times on the way, and he pulled it out in his hand, and said, "My good man, your watch is safe," so I know that he had it—I never let go, but held him fast till we got on the bridge, where we met a policeman coming towards us; and as soon as the prisoner saw that, I called the policeman he gave up the watch—I did not see the other two men afterwards—they were in front of us—I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch some yean back—I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

               <p>before we got to Blackfriars-bridge, this was the first—I did not go up there looking for a pawnbroker's shop—I did not complain to the landlord of the public-house—I complained to nobody till I met the policeman—I drank once of the beer, I had no particular wish to do so; I was asked to go there as a witness, I had nothing to pay for—they did not say that I ought to pawn my watch to pay for it, but they proposed that I should pawn it, and I went out of the house with them—I took the prisoner's arm from the public-house in Earl-street till we met the policeman—he took the watch out when we stopped—I could not, of course, hold his arm when he was taking the watch out—I took his arm the as I would take your's or any gentleman's—I did not complain to anyone till I met a policeman—I did not think the public were fit persons to complain to, I was looking for the aid of the law—I asked him three times for the watch—we stopped each time, and he pulled it out and showed it to me three times—I was bound to let go of his arm when he put his hand in his pocket—the last I saw of the other man was when I called the police—it is true that I had no money about me but twopence.</p>

On 29th January, about 4 o'clock, I was on duty on Blackfriars-bridge, and saw the last witness and the prisoner walking towards me—the last witness had hold of the prisoner by the arm, and, before he came within two or three yards, he called out, "Policeman, I want you"—he then asked the prisoner to give him his watch—the prisoner looked at me, put his hand in his pocket, and handed the watch to the prosecutor, who gave him in custody for stealing it—I took him to the station—he refused his name and address.</p>

            . I was going home to dinner on Thursday: going through the hospital, Mr. Steward was with me: we stood up to let the children of the hospital pass: I saw the prisoner, and two men more, by the prosecutor: I said to Steward, let's see this sun, they are going to pick the gentlemen's pockets: we followed them: before we came from under the gate-way, I saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's left-hand pocket: as soon as he took his hand out, I said, you have picked the gentleman's pocket: I clapped hold of his hand: he had got the snuff-box partly into his pocket: I said to Steward, take care of him: I went and told the prosecutor of it: he found he had lost his box. (A paper box produced, deposed to by prosecutor.) After he was taken, the mob were for ducking him *. When we got to the compter, he gave the names of several of his confederates: he mentioned one by the name of Doctor, and said, he was to be found on Saffron-hill, at the Globe.</p>
               <p>* It is the contrivance of the confederates to propose ducking the thief, by which means they sometimes prevent their being brought to justice.</p>

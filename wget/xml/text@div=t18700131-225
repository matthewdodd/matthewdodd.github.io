                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a carman, at Pudding Lane, City—Playfoot has been in my service six or seven weeks—Burke has been employed by me occasionally, as a porter—I never saw him selling oranges—on 18th January I was employed by Messrs. Adams &amp; Co., the consignees of a cargo of oranges—we were to remove them from the London Docks to our warehouse—in nearly all cases the oranges are sold by auc<lb></lb>tion—a mark is put upon the case when they are landed, signifying the condition—I have seen the box of oranges taken by the police—there is no London mark upon that—it formed part of the same cargo—there was one box missing when the oranges were delivered—it had never been sold.</p>

               <p>loaded with oranges—Playfoot was on the top of the load—I saw him lift a box off, and ease it down the tail part of the load on to the tier, where his foot was—he turned the box round and Burke took the box off on to his head—he crossed Eastcheap with it—when he got on the pavement, he shifted it from his head on to his left shoulder—I lost sight of him for a moment, and I saw Playfoot shift the other boxes, and he placed two where there should have been three, so as to fill up the tier—I followed Burke—I saw him come out of a court leading into Gracechurch Street; the box was then on the same shoulder—I spoke to Sergeant Adams, and he fol<lb></lb>lowed him—I never saw either of the men before, to my knowledge—I did not know whose van it was at that time—I know now it was Mr. Oakley's.</p>

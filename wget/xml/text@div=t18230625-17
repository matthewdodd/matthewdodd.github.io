I felt their hands about my person, and called watch many times. I shifted my money from my breeches to my coat pocket; but M'Donald snatched it out, and ran away with it. I held Dyer and took her to the watch-house - M'Donald was taken a week after. I am certain of them both. I went with them for no improper purpose.</p>

I called the watchman while they were pushing me, and Dyer put her hand over my mouth to hinder me. When M'Donald was taken she denied it.</p>

            . I am a constable. Dyer was brought to the watch-house. I afterwards took M'Donald, from the prosecutor's description, on the 14th of June, at her lodgings in Crown-court, Golden-lane - I had seen her the night before, and told her of it - she said she was not guilty, and should not go out of the way. I said I would bring the prosecutor to-morrrow to see her, and told her to be at home; she said she would, and I found her at home. I took the prosecutor there, and asked if she was the woman; he said, "Let me look," and asked if her name was M'Donald or Smith - she said, No; he said, "Well, you are the woman, I'll swear to you;" I found 6 s. 7 d. on her. He was rather intoxicated, and I think a little insensible when he brought Dyer in, and told me he could not swear to the woman who had escaped.</p>
               <p>DYER'S Defence. He has spoken very false. This woman was not with me.</p>

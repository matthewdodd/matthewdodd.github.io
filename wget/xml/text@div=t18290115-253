            . I am a gas-lighter. On Sunday morning, the 11th of January, at a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in the news and gave information to the watchman - Smith asked me what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>WATKINS WILLIAM MARTIN. I am a liverystablekeeper - my stable is in the mews; these four glasses are my property - they were in post-chaises which were standing in the mews; I have no doubt they are mine - one is broken and the piece of it is left behind; they would cost me about 8l.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I was passing by the mews, and saw two young men pass with these glasses under their arms- they went to a watch-box, returned and placed them against the side of the mews, and when the watchman came by, they went to a watch-box, returned and placed them against the side of the mews, and when the watchman came by, they decamped; I staid till be passed, and then I must own I was going to take away the glasses.</p>

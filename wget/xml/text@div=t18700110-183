I am the prisoner's wife, and am a professional singer—I hare not lived with the prisoner for some time—I have two children of the marriage—they were under my husband's care, and I sent him money for their support, when I could—on New Years' Eve I was at the house where they were, 26, Oakley Street—I had been there for a week—about 6 o'clock that evening I was preparing to go to my engagement, and the prisoner asked me what I was going to do—I told him I did not know, I would not live with him, I could not—he got in a rage, and got the hammer, which was on the table—this was in hie bed<lb></lb>room—he has only got one room—he told me to die, and every time he gave me a knock with the hammer, he said, "Die"—he struck me with it three or four times—he had me down on the floor, but I managed to get up—I bled very much from my head—he took up the poker, and gave me a knock on the side of the head—that was the worst blow—I do not remember much after that—I felt rather dizzy, and sat down on the sofa—he had something sharp glittering in his hand, and then I held my head down, so that he could not get at my throat, and I felt a cut on my chin and on my arm, and do not remember anything more till I got out into the street—this is my dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is cut through in two place—I had been using the knife, cutting up the children's dinner before I went out—I do not remember whether I got out at the door or not—I was getting insensible, and do not remember whether he opened it or whether I did—it had been fastened—my husband was perfectly sober—I was seen by Dr. Donoghue about twenty minutes afterwards, and am still attended by him—I cannot attend to any of my engagements.</p>

My son was got into Exeter College choir, Oxford, where my wife formed an improper connection with John Tuke, and we were obliged to leave. After that, she lived with him in Paddington, but used to come to see me daily. After that she got an engagement at Southampton, from where she wrote me these letters.

She wrote to me daily. Her letters were all in that tone till she picked up with this monster, Harry Spong, who she lived with in Glasgow, from whence she wrote me, promising to be a faithful wife, if I would send her money to come home. I did so, and she came home about 26th May, and she was at home, happy for a time, till William Spong traced her to London, and she used to see him daily without I my knowledge. On this Friday night she tried on a new petticoat We live over a draper's shop. I went down for another, and her sister brought up another. While she was trying them on, she said, "I shall not be home to-night; but don't tell the children." I said, "Do not stay out to-night." She said, "Yes." I said, "Do not; surely you are not going to sleep with that man." She said, "Yes; and I am three months gone with child by him." I then hit her with the handle of the hammer; but never intended to do her the injury I did do, and the poker I never used. She said, "See, I am bleeding, Charley;" and I opened the door and said, "For God's sake! ran for Dr. Willy." As she ran down stairs she said, in the hearing of my child, "Damn you, I will serve you out for this."

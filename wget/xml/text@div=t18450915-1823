                  </hi>. I live in St. John's-court, and am a goldbeater. On the 15th of Aug., the prisoner came and said he called to know the lowest price of gold leaf for cash, per 1000—I told him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about two hours after, he brought an order for 4000 gold leaf—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Aug, 15th, 1845. Sir, Please send 4000 large size deep leaved gold, at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand, with receipt, for John Murray, Charles-street, Hampstead-road. Let bearer have 300 with him; remainder to<lb></lb>morrow, if possible"—I gave him the 300 leaves of gold—he said I was to let him have the other as soon as possible, and to send it up to Mr. Murray, a brush-maker, in Charles-street, Hampstead-road—I went up on the Friday evening to inquire, and no such person lived in Charles-street, Hampstead-road—the prisoner said a person in the brush way kept a shop there—he said the 300 was to go to St. Albans, a man was to call there with a horse and cart for it, and, I think, the other was going to Ipswich by ship.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at St. Michael's House, Cornhill—on 23rd December, about I o'clock, I was standing in Bull's Head Passage, Leadenhall Street, talking to Mr. Wickmott, and saw Mr. Barclay and the prisoner close together—the prisoner knocked Barclay down, and before he could fairly get up I heard the prisoner say, "Let me go," and he knocked Barclay down again—he got up and followed the prisoner, saying, "You stole my goose," and the prisoner knocked him down again by a blow in the eye—I stepped between them to prevent a further assault, followed the prisoner, hailed a policeman, and the prosecutor gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 54, Baker Street—on 23rd December, about 1 o'clock, I was in Leadenhall Market, and saw the prisoner with a goose in a basket—he said he was only having a lark, and was going to take the goose back again—MR. Barclay said he would give him in custody—the prisoner asked him to take it back again, and, because he would not, the prisoner knocked him down by a blow on the mouth—he knocked him down three times—I did not see Barclay strike the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulterer of Leadenhall Market—on 23rd December I was standing at my door with my daughter selling poultry, and saw the prisoner looking about, and at last he snatched a goose from the end of my shop—I went after him, and he crouched down in Mr. Farmer's shop, and was in the act of putting my goose into a mat-basket—I followed him and said, "What are you doing with my goose which you took from the front of my shop?"—he said "All right, don't take any notice, I was going to bring it back; take your goose back"—I said "Not until I give you and the goose in custody"—he said "Let me go, there's a good fellow"—when he found I was determined not to let him go, he threw the goose away, and gave me a violent blow in my jaw, which loosened five of my teeth, and knocked me down—I was getting up, and he knocked me down again by a blow on my nose, and I have not been able to smell since—I got up again, and he knocked me down a third time by a blow on my eye, and tried to kick my ribs, but he kicked my elbow, and I had to carry my arm in a sling for more than a week—he was then given in custody—it is important in my trade that my nose should be perfect—my mouth bled very much, and I was advised to have leeches on my eye.</p>

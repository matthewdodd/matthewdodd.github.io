                  </hi>. I liven Join-street, Sidney-square, Commercial-road. I was at the Bell public-house, Gracechurch-street, on the 1st of June, between two and three o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, with a parcel—I asked what he had got there—I went to look at it, and said, "Its a piece of mouslin-de-laine"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I opened it, and saw the fag end had either been torn or cut—he immediately took it up, put it into his pocket, and said, "You shall not see this"—I asked where he lived—he said, "In Friday-street"—I said would see whether he did live there or not—I went with him as far as King William-street, and instead of going towards Friday-street, he turned to go over London-bridge —I said, "If you attempt to go over London-bridge shall give you in charge"—he then proceeded five or six yards—I met a policeman, and gave him in charge, with the mouslin-de-laine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had two parcels to take out for my masters; I went into the public-house for some beer; this person came up, and asked me what I had there; said, "It is a piece of mouslin-de-laine;" he asked where I came from; I said, "From Baines and Co., in Friday-street;" he said he would see the mark; I said he should not, it was no business of his and tore it off; he saw me tear it off. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was torn off before—I cannot be positive whether he mentioned the name of Baines and Co.—He said he came from some house in Friday-street.</p>

I stopped the prisoner, and asked him to give me the parcel—he said, "I shall not, it is my property, bought it from the foreman of the warehouse, we are allowed to purchase these things, and make as much by them as we can"—I took the parcel from him, and searched him at the station-house—he made a very violent resistance—it required five of us to hold him down—I found on him a parcel book and some duplicates—the book was given up to Mr. Baines—here the piece of mouslin-de-laine torn off, which the prisoner gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Michael Baines and another, of Friday-street, Cheapside. The prisoner has been in their service as porter six months—this mouslin-de-laines their property—the prisoner was never authorised to dispose of goods belonging to his employers—he never purchased this—there is no foreman in the establishment—I have the charge of the goods—it is not customary to allow porters to purchase to sell again at a profit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 14, Swan-street, Minories. On Thursday night, the 7th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I was at the corner of the Minories, and saw the prisoner and an<lb></lb>other man following several gentlemen—I had suspicion, and followed them to Leadenhall-street, where they followed two gentlemen, who were walking arm-in-arm, and crossing over by the East India Company's ware-house, I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from one of the two gentle<lb></lb>men's coat-pocket—I do not know his name—he retraced his steps—the gentleman proceeded a few yards, put his hand into his pocket, and turned round—the prisoner then crossed over towards Billiter-street—I went up and secured him till a policeman arrived—he dropped the handkerchief at my side—I cannot swear this is the same handkerchief, but I saw him draw something from the gentleman's pocket, which appeared to be a hand<lb></lb>kerchief—the one he dropped has two initials upon it—I was on the other side of the street, but opposite to him—I suppose the street is twelve yards wide—I could not discern the colour of the handkerchief distinctly—I had my eye on the prisoner, and the gentleman went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming down Leadenhall-street; a coach was running very fast; a great many people were looking at it, and I stopped myself; I kicked against a handkerchief, took it up, examined it, and put it into my pocket; seeing nobody owned it, I went away; about five minutes after, the witness laid hold of me, and said, "That is my handkerchief you have got;" I said, "If you can describe it you shall have it;" people came round me, and he gave me into custody.</p>

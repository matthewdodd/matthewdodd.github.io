                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 25, Queen Street, Brompton Road, and work at Mr. Orchard's, watchmaker, of South Audley Street—about 9 a.m. on Monday, 16th March, I was cleaning the brass work out<lb></lb>side the shop, when Green and two others, I believe the other prisoners, came up—I used to go to school with Green—he said "Halloa, Sally, is this where you work?" I said "Yes"—the other two walked a little farther on towards South Street—Green then joined them, and they walked away together—on the Thursday evening I was going home through the park gates at the top of South Street, when I met the three prisoners, and Green "said "Halloa, Sally, just done?" I said "Yes"—they then asked what I covered up at night, and how much money I thought the master had in the shop—I said I didn't think he kept much money there—Green asked how much goods I thought he kept there, and I said I thought about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—they asked me how I got in the morning—I said I rung the bell at the front door, and the servant opened the door, and then I went in the parlour and took the keys out of a little safe, and then I opened the doors—they asked me which way the assistant went home at night—I said I didn't know, but he went up South Audley Street—then they asked me where he lived, and I said "Somewhere at Notting Hill or Bayswater"—they asked me if my master had any diamonds—I said he had some in pins—they asked me where my master lived, and I said he lived at the other shop in the Gloucester Road—we had then got on to the Knights<lb></lb>bridge side, and they asked me to go to the Brown Bear public-house with them, where we had some ale and a biscuit; I think Webb paid for it—I saw Webb with his hand down as if picking up something, and he said "You can't always pick up these"—I saw 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his hand, which he gave me—then he said "That is an old one," and he gave me another one for it—he said "How would you like to have a couple of hundred of them? you have got your hand on them"—the landlady then said that a soldier had just come in and lost 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Webb said if he came in he should have it—as I was going away Green said to me "Don't tell my brother Fred that I have seen you"—he lives near me, and we are playmates—I left the</p>

               <p>prisoners in the public-house—next day, Friday, about 1 o'clock, as I was going home to dinner, I met Crossley and Green on the other side of Rotten Row—Crossley, I think, asked me if I had been up Clerkenwell, and if I had got any watch cases from there—I said I was in a hurry, and must walk quick, and they walked quick with me—we got to the Brown Bear, and they asked me if I would go in and have some beer—I said "No," and Green gave me a penny, and asked me if I would meet them that night at 8 o'clock—I told them if they were there when I was I would, but I would not wait for them—I then went home to dinner—when I got back to the shop I told my master what had happened, and he sent me to the Vine Street Police-station, and I asked for Inspector Naylor—he was not there, and another inspector sent me on to Inspector Naylor's private house in Wardour Street, where I saw him and told him all—he wrote a note and gave me to give my master—I did so, and the same night went to Vine Street and saw Sergeant Pickles—they gave me certain directions, and I went back to my master's shop, and I left after shutting it up, and went to meet the prisoners, as agreed, at the South Street gates—they asked me if I had just done, and if they got some keys would I try them to my master's private door in South Audley Street, and I said "Yes"—we then got up to the gate which leads to the Brown Bear, and they went up towards the monument, and I went home—Webb had given me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one of the others 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was to meet them on Saturday at 8 p.m.—I had previously arranged to meet my master at the Oratory, Brompton, and I made a communication to him—I leave at five o'clock on Saturday—I kept the appointment with the prisoners, but only met Crossley and Green—they asked me if I could not get the keys—I told them Mr. Orchard did sometimes leave them in the safe—they said if he left them in the safe and I could get them they would come in the next morning, and then we walked out at the Grosvenor gates—they said "Let us come out of this path," and we went into a public-house in South Audley Street—they said they would not forget me when they got in, but I should not have it for a week or two—they ordered some ale, and put down 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the man said he would not take it—Crossley said "That is good enough," and then they said "You don't want no beer, do you?" and I said "No"—Green gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I think Crossley gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me not to go down South Audley Street, and that it was only a whim of his—I said "All right"—he said that I might see him to-morrow at his brother's house, but I was not to say anything to him, and I was to meet them again on Monday—I then left and went into the park, where I met Inspector Turpin and constable Pickles by appointment—I did not see Green on the Sunday, but I met them on the Monday evening—the assistant had given me an envelope to take to Upper Grosvenor Street—I walked a little way with the prisoners, and then turned up a little path—I said "Oh, I forgot this note; I must take it to Upper Grosvenor Street"—they turned and walked back with me, and when we got near Grosvenor Street they said "We will meet you here as you come back"—I went to take the note, and when I came back I found the prisoners in custody.</p>

I told the Magistrate that I was con<lb></lb>fused about the dates—I think I am right now—I went to school with Green's brother, and have been a companion of his—I have known the prisoner Green a little over a year—there was nothing extraordinary in his taking a walk with me—I first communicated with my mother on Friday after I came home from dinner—they asked me the first evening about my master's property, but I did not form the idea till Friday that they intended robbing him—I have talked these matters over with Pickles since then—he has not told me any dates—I told him I had made a mistake—I cannot pledge myself as to which of the prisoners put any particular question—I saw Fred Green every night.</p>

My husband keeps the Brown Bear, 44, Albert Gate, Knightsbridge—about a month or six weeks before the hearing before the Magistrate I was serving in the bar when a soldier and a woman came in—some ale was called for, and the soldier put his hand in his pocket and said he had dropped 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I did not let him have the ale—afterwards Green, two other men, and Arter came in—I know Green by sight, but cannot identify the others—one of them picked up something, and gave it. to the boy—I said, "A soldier has just dropped it," and they said, "If he comes back we will give it him."</p>

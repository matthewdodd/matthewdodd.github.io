                  </hi> I was recently an able-seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Indian Empire,</hi> a British ship—I engaged for the voyage from London to Calcutta and back to London—she carried the British flag, and was under the command of Captain Deuchar—the prisoner was the second mate—we left Calcutta, on the return voyage, about the 22nd April—on the 30th of April, when eight days out at sea, I was ordered by the prisoner, about 9 o'clock in evening, to go aloft for the purpose of furling the sails—I had a bad whitlow on the little finger of my right hand, and my finger ras very painful and swollen—I told the prisoner I wanted a boatswain's chair to sit on when allot, because I could not hold myself by my right hand—he said that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200034"></xptr>
               <p>I could have the chair, and it was supplied to me—I went up the rigging in it, and presently afterwards he called me down again, and told me to go on the poop, as the captain wished to see me—I found the captain standing by the mizen-mast, and he beckoned me to go aft—he then asked me if I was going to do what I was told—I replied that I was—he asked me why I had used a boatswain's chair whilst furling the main trysail—I replied, "Well, captain, I could not do it without, as I have a bad finger"—he said, "Now, my boy, will you go down there," pointing to the hatch of the store room, or lazarette—I asked what for, and he answered, "You go down till your finger gets well"—I stepped backwards, and he then seized hold of my left arm, and the prisoner the right—the captain put one hand under my throat and shoved me back over the hand-rail of the poop—I sung out, "Captain, you are not going to choke me?"—he said something which I do not remember—I was then struck by some heavy instrument, and fainted—I do not know who struck me—I do not know whether I had other blows—it was two hours and a half before I recovered my sense—I thought I should die, and sent for a friend to give him direction as to my effects—my clothes were bloody, and blood was found on the poop the next morning—there were four wounds on my head, the largest of which was a little over three inches in length, the next a little more than two and a half inches, the third one about half an inch, and the fourth about an inch in length—when I became conscious, I found that I was in the cabin, and two men were with me—the store room where I was told to go, is not a proper place to sleep in—it was very small, and there was no ventilation, exception the hatch was removed.</p>

                  </hi> I was an able seaman on board, and, on the night of the 30th April, was at the wheel, and near to the captain when he stood on the poop—when Peterson came aft he said to him, "My man, will you not do as you are told?—Peterson replied, "I do, sir!"—then the captain said, "Why don't you furl the main trysail?"—Peterson said, "I was, sir," and the captain added, "Yes; with a boatswain's chair"—Peterson then told him that his fingers were sore, and that he could not hold on—and the captain said, "You shall go down here until your fingers are properly well, and then you shall do it"—the captain and the prisoner then seized the man, and called to the third mate to take off the hatch of the lazarette—Peterson said that it was not a fit place for him to go into, that he had done nothing to go down for, and he resisted, and stepped back as far as the rail—the captain then seized Peterson with his left hand, by the throat, and forced his head backwards over the rail, singing out at the same time for the mate and blacksmith—Peterson said, "Captain, captain, what are you doing? you are choking me!" and then he tried to release himself from the grasp—the second mate then struck him four blows on the head and face—the crew jumped on the poop, and took the man away from the officers, and stood him up by the wheel-house—some one of the crew shone a light, and I saw that his face, neck, and breast were bloody—the captain said to us, "I have been a seaman myself; come aft in the morning, and we will settle it—Peterson then fell on the deck insensible—the crew wanted to take the man forward and wash his wounds, but the captain observed, "We have injured the man, and we will cure him—he was then taken below—at 11.30 I went into the cabin, and saw that Peterson's head was much swollen, and plastered up—the next morning, about 4 o'clock, I saw him again, when he complained of an awful throbbing in his head, and afterwards said that he saw all kinds of strange things—he was out of his mind once or twice—some of the crew were sent into the cabin to take care of him—he was not in his senses at the time—he ran about the deck, fancying he saw all kinds of strange objects, and once or twice he tried to jump overboard—these symptoms continued for a fortnight or three weeks—he was unable to do duty, owing to pains in his head, and could not go aloft—the weapon used by the prisoner was something like a belaying pin, and was 16 or 18 inches in length—I do not think it was a piece of wood, because of the sound it made on the man's head—I believe that the prisoner he had one or two quarrels with the prosecutor before this, but they did not amount to much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Stepney—on 17th Septem<lb></lb>ber I examined Peterson's head, and found the marks of a cut, about an inch and a quarter long, over the left temple-bone; also the mark of an old cut, about an inch and three quarters; another over the eye, about an inch long, and several cuts about his face—he seemed to be a man who has had his head knocked about from time to time, severely—there are little chips all over his head, in fact—I cannot distinguish the date of any of the wounds, and some of them must have been inflicted for months—I should say that the wound on the head, just below the eye, had been inflicted for a long time.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a captain in the merchant service for twenty<lb></lb>four years, and have had command of the <hi rend="italic">Indian Empire</hi> for about four—the man Peterson, from time to time, prior to the 30th April, dis<lb></lb>obeyed orders, and was guilty of impertinence to the officers—on one occa<lb></lb>sion he drew his knife and threatened to stab the third mate, Mr. Newins—he entirely refused to do duty when the officers gave orders—he would only do what he thought proper—sometimes before 6 o'clock he would not work, as also on Sundays, only when the ship was in distress—when leaving Cal<lb></lb>cutta, I had great difficulty in getting the ship over the bar, and after that <hi rend="italic">the troubles of the crew commenced—the crew would not assist</hi> in taking in the cargo unless they thought proper, and we had to rely on natives to assist us—the cargo was getting damaged for want of being on board—the whole of the crew became insubordinate, Grant particularly so—Barcon was was not so bad—Grant, on one occasion, when the ship was in the Bay of Bengal, threatened to break the chief mate's head—there was a storm, and for thirty minutes we could not get the men out to mend the yards, the ship being in danger at the time—that was the starboard watch—they were in bed at the time—this was 3 o'clock; before the affair with Peterson happened—on the 30th April he made a disturbance about the water; he talked in a loud tone, and insulted the third officer—about 9.30 the same craning it was squally, and the weather dirty—the sails had been clewed up, and Peterson was sent aloft to make one of them fast, when he refused to go—the second mate said that the man was entirely refusing to do duty, and I said, "Fetch him aft to me, and let me know the reason why"—when the man came aft, he said that he could not do it, because of a sore finger—that was the first I had heard of the finger—I could see nothing the matter with it, and certainly he had no sore there next morn<lb></lb>ing—he was a man who was always shirking his work whenever he got the opportunity—I told him that unless he was going to make the sail fast, he had better go down into the lazarette until his finger was well—he tried to go away, and then I put my hand on his arm and stopped him—he lifted his hand and said, "Let go, you b—"; the prisoner jumped forward, lifted his hand and struck the man—I believe the prisoner thought that the man was going to strike me, and had I not stepped back, his hand would have alien on my head—I cannot say with what implement the prisoner struck the man—if he had used an iron belaying-pin, or anything of the kind, I should have seen it—I did miss my belaying-pin afterwards—some of the crew said that he struck the man with aslung shot—there are wooden belaying<lb></lb>pinsall round the ship—he might have struck him more than once, but I cannot say; I was so confused at seeing the prisoner strike a blow—I had cautioned my officers, at the beginning of the voyage, never to lift a hand to a man—</p>

               <p>the lazarette would be one of the best cabins in the ship if it were fitted up—there are lights in the sides—the batch was off at the time of the assault, as far as I can remember—the prisoner did all that he could afterwards—he fetched one of his shirts and "tended" the man—as the weather was hot, I kept him in the cabin for some days—on the eleventh day the man left, with not a plaster on him—on the second day he was walking about the ship's deck, when I asked him to keep out of the sun—he was playing cards, mending shoes, washing shirts, and dancing with the other men afterwards—after the eleventh day he commenced to work a little, but the other men would not let him; they kept him back from work—about a month before we came into dock he was working the same as the other men—the prisoner had been <hi rend="italic">with me ten months—he was the chief officer of the Scotia,</hi> and a very good one indeed—he has always borne a good character in his profession, so much, that there is a ship ready for him now, if he is able to go, as chief officer—he has a certificate as a master, and that will be jeopardized if this case goes against him—he may then lose his certificate—a better officer never went into a ship than he has been; he is invariably a quiet man, and, I repeat, that a better officer I never had.</p>

               <p>some others of the crew, by my directions, stayed with the man all that night—I was not afraid ho would die, but I did not know to what extent he was injured—I did not see that he was delirious—he was only eleven day in the cabin—almost directly after we had arrived in England he made a complaint to the Magistrate.</p>

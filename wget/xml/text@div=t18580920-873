                  </hi>. On 10th July last, I lodged at 15, Newcastle-court, Strand—it is a model lodging-house—I was in the kitchen on that night—I was not sober—I got paid about 8 o'clock in the market, and I came straight home; I think it was about half-past 8 when I got home—I do not remember going to sleep there—I remember nothing but going in; I spoke to the man at the door—I did not notice anything when I went in, that I know of—I do not remember seeing the prisoner there—I do not remember anything till I woke up in the hospital—I remained in the hospital 5 weeks—when I came to my senses there, my face was all scalded, all raw, and all over my chest and my right arm—I could not move it, and I have lost the sight of my right eye—I cannot see at all with it now; my left eye is getting nice and strong now, but it was very weak, I could scarcely see at all when I came out of the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live now in Holborn. On the evening of 10th July, I was in the kitchen of 15, Newcastle-court, Strand—I saw the prisoner and Wiley there—there was a young woman in the kitchen at the time—Wiley was leaning on the mantelpiece with his hands on his face, over the fire-place where the water was drawn from—this was a little after 9—he was not asleep, he was stupid—the prisoner was sitting on a form—I did not hear anything occur before the drawing of the water between the prisoner and the prosecutor—I was there all the time—I saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>draw the water from the boiler in a quart can; he took it from the boiler which hung over the fire-place—he drew a pot full—he afterwards put the can on the fire, with the water in it: it was a great fire—I should suppose it remained about five minutes on the fire—the prisoner in the meantime was lacing up his boots—immediately he had laced his boots up, he took it up, and chucked it up in Wiley's face—after that, I saw him kick Wiley several times—Wiley fell on the ground, and the prisoner set to kicking him—he next took up a piece of iron that is used for a poker, and would have struck him, only for the woman servant—he said he was sorry he did not knock his b—brains out—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at this lodging house on 10th July—I get my living by needlework or cleaning—I was there when Wiley, the prisoner, and the last witness were there—Wiley was standing over the fire-place cooking some eggs and bacon for his supper—that was between 9 and 10 o'clock—the prisoner was sitting on the form lacing his boots up, when I was down there—after he had done he went to the fire-place, and took the quart pot of water off the fire, and threw it into the prosecutor's face, making use of some violent language—I did not see who put it on the fire—after he had thrown the water into his face, the man fell down, and called out that he was blinded, and the prisoner then kicked him four times in the ribs, while he was lying down on the floor; and after that he took up the poker in his hand, making use of some very bad language, saying he would split his skull in two, and he would cut him open—the servant at the house took the poker from, the prisoner—I did not hear any words between the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>

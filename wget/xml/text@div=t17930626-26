               <p>I was the officer of the night of Whitecross-street liberty, in the parish of St. Luke's, on Tuesday night; with that about four o'clock we go off from Duty; I live about five doors from the watch-house; just as I turned myself to knock at my door I saw the prisoner at the bar with a flag basket, and heaving it on his shoulder, then his face was towards me; directly he saw me he turned round, and went up a place called Playhouse-yard; I went after him; and overtook him just as he got into Golden-lane, says I, holloo, what have got here? you have been stealing lead; no, says he, I have not; says I, whatever it is I must see it; I knocked my stick against it, he said it was a bit of copper he had found in Mr. Baker's fields; he put it down, and wanted me to take it, and let him run away; for God's sake, says he, do; no, says I, I shall not; I took him to the cage, and went to Mr. Baker's and Mr. Baker sent for a coppersmith, and it was matched.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Baker's field that you saw the man with the basket on his shoulder? - Better that a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before? - I knew him by sight, I knew him to be a bricklayer, I had seen him before, and he knew me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baker came to me yesterday morning, and told me he had lost some copper, and some copper was found; I told him if it came off from his houses I could be sure to tell; I went and matched it directly to one of his houses; the nail holes and every thing it fitted exactly with the place where some copper had been put on the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that that was part of the property that was put on Baker's houses? - Yes, I will be upon my oath it was, it was a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it nailed or fixed on? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix it on? - My man did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it before it was fixed on? - I have looked at my books, and it answers exactly to the measurement; there had been a part taken before from the house adjoining, the houses were both of a size, and each took a quantity of copper alike.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right a part of the copper which had been put on the gutter of one house was taken away, and a part left? - This that is now produced is what was taken from the whole of one house; there had been some taken away from the adjoining house sometime before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try whether it would fit the gully holes of the other house? - It would not; it did not go the right way for the current of the water; we value it at twenty shillings now; but it will cost Mr. Baker more than two guineas to replace it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found it in the fields laying in three pieces, and that bit of a bag lay by it; and I took it and put it in my basket, and took it away; I work for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260040"></xptr>Mr. Law, in Chiswell-street, he can give me a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Baker. When had you last seen it on the house? - I had not seen the top of the house for some months, the house was built before Christmas.</p>

                  </hi> I am smoking-room superintendent at the New University Club, St. James's Street, and have been so for two years and a quarter—the prisoner was drawing-room waiter for ten months, but left about four months ago—on 1st December my attention was attracted to the stranger's dining-room; there appeared to be a face looking through the ground glass—I pushed the door open, and fancied I heard a scuffling—I halloed out to know if anyone was there, and receiving no answer, I took out a match, struck it, and found the prisoner on his hands and knees under the table—he had no shoes on—I knew him, and asked him what he was going to do there—he said "I am going to sleep there"—I asked him how he came there; he said "I rushed past the night porter when he was looking another way, don't make any row about it, as I have been drinking with Litton, and I induced him to let me come and sleep at the Club as I was too drunk and too late to go to my own club to sleep"—I said "Does the night porter know you are here!—he said "No"—I said "You will have to come with me down to the night porter, and we will see about it"—he said that he did not come in with Litton, and that Litton was downstairs drunk—we went towards the hall porter, and when I had got down two or three steps I found he had gone back, and he must have got out at the coffee-room window, for he did not come down the staircase—Litton was not downstairs drunk; he sleeps on the premises, and we went to his pantry, but it was locked up—I did not go to his bedroom, and did not see him till 10.30 the next day.</p>

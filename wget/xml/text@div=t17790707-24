He went up stairs to the lady, who was in a room opposite my bed-room, where the watch was hanging at the bed's head. I saw it there between five and six o'clock that evening. When I went to bed at ten o'clock the watch was missing; immediately it occurred to me, that there had been nobody up stairs but the prisoner, and I had a suspicion of him. I got up at four o'clock the next morning, and went to his lodging and examined him, but did not search him; he was to come at eight o'clock to dress the lady; he did not come; that gave me a greater suspicion that he was the person. I went again about eleven o'clock, and found him in the room, and searched him, and found the watch upon him; he had broke the chain all in pieces; it was wrapped up in a handkerchief or dirty towel.</p>

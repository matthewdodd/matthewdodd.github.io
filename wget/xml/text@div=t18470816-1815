                  </hi> I am a licensed-victualler, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 21st of July I and my wife went to bed about two o'clock in the morning—I left the house quite safe, I saw it so myself—I was called up about a quarter-past four o'clock—I came down, went into the bar, and saw the prisoner in front of the bar, being searched by two policemen—the window of the bar-parlour was open—the bar of the shutter had been taken down, and the shutter was down, and he had got through the window—it had been shut the night before—I missed some money from the side drawer—it was a little open—I lost about three sixpences altogether, seve<lb></lb>ral halfpence and farthings, I cannot say how many—I am certain there were some.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher—I work for Mr. Lamb, of Bethnal-green, and sleep at Mr. Hall's—I got up about a quarter-past four on the morning of the 21st of July—on coming down stairs I came out at the side-door, and was walking down to the bottom of the street when a man came out at the side-door leading from the bar, turned the corner, and ran down Church-street—I saw him come out—I did not see his face, and could not discern his features—I saw Fowler, the policeman, opposite—I pointed to the man, and Fowler pursued him; I did not see him taken—I afterwards saw the police<lb></lb>man bring the prisoner back—I could not swear to his being the man I had seen, for I was rather late that morning myself and in a flurry—the man was something similar to the prisoner—I am not very sure on that point, I cannot swear to him—I saw nobody besides the person that went out, the one who was brought back, and the constable—I pointed out to the policeman the person I saw come out of the house, and saw the policeman go after that person.</p>

On the 21st of July, about a quar<lb></lb>ter-past four o'clock, the prisoner was pointed out to me by Camp, in Church-street, Bethnal-green, about twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Hall's—there was no other person in the street but him and Camp—I ran after him, he turned up Tyson-street—when he got to the corner, I sprang my rattle, and when I came to the corner there was no person in the street but him—I had lost sight of him, perhaps a second, in turning the corner—I was about twenty or thirty yards from Tyson-street, when I lost sight of him—I had that distance to run before I caught sight of him again, and when I came round, there was no other person in the street but himself—he turned up Shacklewell-street—another constable then came in sight, and he ran into his arms—I have not the least doubt that he is the same person that was originally</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 411). On Sunday morning, 7th January, about 12.30, I was on duty, in company with Mason, in Charles Street, Drury Lane, and heard the sounds of a scuffle in the middle of the road—I saw a man fall to the ground, and six or seven persons on top of him at once—I went towards the spot, and saw five men run away—I saw the prisoner—she was the last one that left him—she was atop of him—just as I got to them she started to go away, and she kicked his hat away, and tried to pick it up—I ran past the man who was on the ground—I saw his watch lying on the ground—I stopped the prisoner till 418 came up—I left her in his charge while I pursued the others, but I lost them in King Street, Drury Lane—when I came back the prisoner said she had nothing to do with the robbery, but she knew the men, and could take us to their lodging—the prosecutor had got up when I came back—the other constable picked up the watch and gave it to me—the prosecutor was intoxicated, but he had been knocked down and kicked, and cut under the eye—as soon as he saw the prisoner he said that is the one I will give in charge for robbing me—after charging the prisoner I went again to the spot, and found this piece of chain.</p>

I was with Parker, who called my attention to a sudden scuffle—we ran up and saw five men run away, and the prosecutor lying on the ground, and the prisoner was the last to get up from him, and as she was running away from him, she kicked his hat, and attempted to pick it up—I detained her—she said "Let me go, I don't know anything about it, but I can take you to the place where the men live"—when the prosecutor saw her he said "That is the woman that stole my watch"—he appeared the worse for liquor, and very much knocked about—he was bleeding from several parts, both hands and face—at the station she said knew nothing about it.</p>

I am a barrister's clerk, and live at 72, Colonnade Mews, Russell Square—on Sunday morning, 7th January, I was in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane—I recollect nothing previously to getting there—I was very much the worse for liquor—I was brought to my senses by a very sudden and severe struggle in which I was engaged with several persons—the prisoner is one of those persons—I had not seen her before to my recollection—I was very much ill-used—I was knocked about in all parts of my body, more especially about my face—a gold pin was taken from my scarf, some money, and a watch and chain—I remember the watch being taken—I recollect three of the persons struggling very hard to get my watch and chain—the prisoner was one actively engaged in endeavouring to get my watch and chain from me—the constables came up after I had been knocked down—the prisoner was then on the top of me—the others ran away—the watch and chain produced are mine.</p>

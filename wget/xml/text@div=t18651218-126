                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Bennett, a watch and clock maker, of 65, Cheapside—the prisoner was in his service as assis<lb></lb>tant and salesman in the shop—he had to deliver articles to purchasers and receive money—on 9th November he was discharged—he had been home with some jewellery on the Saturday, and from some circumstances that came to our knowledge we wrote to a lady and asked her if she had paid him, and he then immediately came down and paid the money to the cashier, while I was talking to the lady—the articles had been sold on the Saturday, and this occurred on the Thursday—he received the money at the lady's house—his duty was to have paid the money in—he was asked by the assis<lb></lb>tant, "Did the lady pay you?"and he said, "No"—he had to go again to see her—the money was not paid until the lady came—he was asked about it before she came, but not in my presence—I think it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was on Saturday, 14th November, and it was paid on Wednesday, 18th—in con<lb></lb>sequence of a letter which had been received from Mrs. Janvrin, I commu<lb></lb>nicated with Dean, and desired him to write a letter to me to explain—I saw him after that letter—I took an officer, who said, "You are charged with embezzling the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received by you for Mr. Benuett from Captain Taylor's servant"—I do not remember whether he said anything relating to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180055"></xptr>
               <p>the articles—the prisoner said, "You cannot do that, I tendered the money to Dean"—I said that it was out of my hands now, that I must give him into custody—he did not offer to pay the money to me—he said he had been down to my house at Norwood in order to pay the money—he said that was after he had offered the money to Dean—I produce a waste book—I find an entry in the prisoner's writing on the 16th <hi rend="italic">June</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "65, Cheap-side, London, 16th June, 1865. Captain Taylor, 6, Portsdown-road, Maida-hill. Marble clock 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received 16/6/65; John Bennett, per Fras. Caton"—it was about ten days after his discharge that I went down with him about the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to the time when I told Dean to write this letter the money had never been paid in by the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has the prisoner been in the service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—it was his duty to collect money—he ought to have accounted for this on the Saturday—it was taken late on Saturday, and from there he went home till the Monday, which he had no right to do—I never heard before that, when he came on the Tuesday, he told somebody that he had received the money and taken it to his house, and brought it the next day—he did pay the money—I say this 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not tendered to me, if it had been I should not have given him in custody—I don't know that the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered to Mr. Dean, and that he sent the prisoner down to my place—the prisoner said something about having paid the money, and that, if it was so, I was to return it to him—Mr. Dean is here—Mr. Bennett superintends the business himself; he never receives money—if he has money from the till, it is always given to him either by myself or Dean—Mr. Bennett was not preparing to put up for the Shrievalty about this time, he knew nothing of it until the very morning of the election; he never made any preparation at all—he has a very large and extensive business, and we are not unfrequently very busy indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Mr. Bennett's employ—it was my duty to receive money from the prisoner—when he received this money, on 16th June, for the clock, he ought to have handed it in to me on the same day—I do not know at what hour it was received; but he certainly ought to have paid it in by the next morning—our business closes at 8 o'clock—the clock was to be delivered at 6 that night at Maida-hill—the money should have been paid in on the next morning—it was not—it was not accounted for at all to me—in consequence of what Mr. Simmonds said to me, I sent a letter to the prisoner, and afterwards saw him—he said, it was a bad job, I believe, or, "What does it mean, "I cannot say which it was; something to that effect—he said, "I do not know whether I received the money, or whether I did not; I really cannot remember; but I have some money now to go through the Bankruptcy Court"—with that he took some money out of his pocket, and said, "I can pay it, and if it should be found out after<lb></lb>wards to be paid, will it be refunded to me?"—I said, "If that be the case,</p>

               <p>I have no doubt it will"—he then put it in his pocket again—it never left his hands—I do not know how much he took out—it was a roll of money wrapped up together—I went down to the house, in consequence of a letter from his wife or his parents—I had no authority at that time to answer him or to receive the money.</p>

            , of Bucklersbury, were indebted to us in the sum of 24 l. 15 s. 9 d., which was paid to the prisoner on the 13th of September, and for which he never accounted: it was his duty to collect cash and bills, and to deliver them at night at the house in Wood-street, to Mr. Todd, our cashier. We had occasion on the 1st of December last, to question the prisoner - he had then been absent a week on leave. When he came to Wood-street I took him up stairs to my office, and told him I was sorry to say there were some discoveries made during his absence, reflecting upon his integrity, and I hoped he would be able to exonerate himself - he said he should be able to satisfy me that there could not be any deficiency, or a very immeterial one, which he would make good directly if I would take him up to our other office in the City-road - I got a coach and took him there: it was then about eleven o'clock. I took him into a private office, and then mentioned to him the names of partis who had shown receipts which he had given to them, and had not accounted for to us. I sent for a cash-book and some others to show him it was so: he said if he might go over to his own office, he would fetch his book and tell how it was; I was simple enough to believe him - he went away, and I saw him no more till he was apprehended, about a month ago; it was his duty to enter every night in the cash-book what money he had received. A gentleman of the name of Veal was our cashier at the wharf, and he was burnt when our premises were destroyed by fire. The books were partly burnt, but there is a part of one of them here - we have directed two of our clerks to make extracts from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The prisoner had had leave of absence for a week previous to the 1st of December - A. Yes. Veal was the cashier, and the prisoner was to account to him; when I took him to the wharf I did not tell him I should send to Manchester for his bond; there was no bond then in existence: there had been one on his father, who was then dead - I do not think his own name was on the bond. Mr. Veal's books were burned; the books the prisoner kept were what were copied every month, by the ledger keeper, from the ledger - he was to receive different sums of money, and then to put them down at Wood-street, in what was called the payment book, and the cashier signed it, and that released him from any further responsibility: it should be in his own writing, and signed by the cashier. The place he first occupied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150064"></xptr>was not a place of trust. He might give a small cheque for a large one, but he had no right to give a cheque in change - he might have gone to a banker's to get change. Holland preceeded him as collector; he kept his book as Holland had done. The entries in the payment book were the day of the month, and then so much gold, silver, and copper. We have damages claimed sometimes, which it was his duty to pay after they had been ascertained. If he received a cheque he was not allowed to pay money instead of it.</p>

               <p>ROBERT LAMBERT. I am clerk to Messrs. Pickford and Co. The prisoner was one of the collecting clerk - it was his duty when he received money or cheques to enter them in the payment book, and give account of it to Mr. Todd, in Wood-street, who gave him his signature, which was his discharge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When this young man was absent his desk was broken open, and a number of papers found - A. Yes; they were given to me and put into my desk, which was burnt at the fire: there were a great many memorandums and different papers of the prisoner's, and a great many accounts, which should have been delivered by him, as collected; if there had been any papers among them for him to have shown anything on this charge they were burnt. The fire did not happen till the 26th of February.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Pickford and Co. The prisoner never accounted to me for 24 l. 15 s. 9 d. received from Messrs. Dobson, on the 13th of September, which he should have done when he came home. Veal was not then in the employ, but he was afterwards, and then he should have accounted to Veal. I never directed him not to change a draft to make a payment - if he brought the collection of the day it was of no consequence is what manner. He kept the books the same as Holland had done. He has never accounted in any shape or way for this money. Mr. Veal did not come into the situation till October. In this book here is an account in the prisoner's writing on the 13th of September, but no mention of the money received from Dobson. Here is one</p>
               <p>"10 l. note and four soverigns," received that day, that is all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The book produced was never meant as a book of particulars, but only a memorandum of the money collected in the course of the day. If I had gone to any house where they had offered a 50 l. or 100 l. note, I should have given them a cheque in change if I had it, and I never had any instructions not to do so - then of course the cheque would be sunk in the payment of that bill, and could not be produced in that specific form - the book I kept was called the cash-book; I had an item there of the cash I received, but that was burnt. The book now produced contains a great number of sums in the month of September, in cheques, gold, and silver, which are not put down from whom they were received. If the collect had got the right amount, or the form in which it was paid would not be objected to - if I had paid anything in the way of damages it would not be put down in that book: it was not considered a principle book; anybody might have entered things in it.</p>

            . I preceeded the prisoner as collecter at this house - the payment book is intended as a check between the collector and the cashier: there are entries in it of gold and silver; it is not specified from whom they are received. I have known the prisoner about five years, and never heard anything against him before: the first thing the collector does when he has received money is to enter it with the cashier - the cash-book is made up afterwards, from the collector's portable book; the ledger is posted from the cash-book: the portable book is the book from which the cash-book is made out, and it then remains in possession of the house. I left the service twelve months before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. LAMBERT re-examined. The prisoner should make up his cash-book from the portable book - I have seen the portable book, and looked over it very minutely indeed, and it contained no entry of 24 l. 15 s. 9 d. received from Mr. Dobson - I examined it for the purpose of ascertaining this fact from the 13th of September to the 1st of October, and after that the prisoner had no right to enter anything in it. I will swear that after the 1st of October there was no entry of it: these books are continually before me - there was no entry at all of this cheque in any shape, up to the 26th of February, the day our premises were burnt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you tell in what folio of the cash-book it should have been entered - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the entries in September - A. No: my attention was particularly directed to those entries where Dobson's and some others occur. I do not recollect the total amount of cash received in September, nor the items which composed it. I did not compare the cash-book with the portable book; what I speak of are the cash-book and the ledger. I looked at the portable book after this was found out - the sum total of the cash-book and portable book agreed together.</p>

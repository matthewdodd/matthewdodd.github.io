            . I am six years old. I was going to Mrs. Gillett's to get some things mangled for my mother, an apron, a gown, and a half shawl, I was to take to Mrs. Gillett, she lives three doors off the corner of our court; a woman called me, she gave me a penny to get a pennyworth of tobacco; she said she would give me a penny when I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the shawl, the apron, and the gown - A. She said, I will mind the things; she took them from me, I bought the tobacco, and when I came back she was gone. I told my mother that the woman gave me a penny to go for the tobacco, and she had taken the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe the woman that took the things was a tall woman, dressed in a black gown, and pitted with the small-pox, was she not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITWORTH. On the 11th of March the prisoner pledged the shawl, the gown, and apron with me for four shillings, between three and four o'clock. About an hour after Mrs. Watkins came and gave me information, and when the prisoner came the next day I stopped her.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Eliza Watkins. My dear little girl how was the woman dressed - A. She had a black gown; it was a tall woman.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Watkins. I believe them to be the things, I do not know them by any mark.</p>

            . I searched the woman; she said she had not got the ticket. I found the ticket upon her, then she said she pawned it for some woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman that was in the wine-vaults at the top of Old street, by Goswell-street, asked me to go into Whitecross-street and pledge the things for her, I did, and she waited at the door while I was served.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

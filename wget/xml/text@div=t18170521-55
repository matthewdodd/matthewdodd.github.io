            . I keep house for my brother, who is a butcher residing at Tottenham. The prisoner had lived ten weeks in our service - I did not suspect, that she was pregnant. On the morning of the 4th of April, I went into the kitchen, and found her at her work as-usual; but about four o'clock in the afternoon I perceived her to be ill - She complained of being ill - I did not suspect any thing - I sent for Mrs. Perring, who is a midwife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. On the night previous, I slept in the room immediately under her-if there had been any noise, I should think I must have heard it - I believe she is seventeen years old-while she was in our service, she fell off a table.</p>

            . I am a midwife, and live at Tottenham. On the 5th of April, I was sent for, and saw the prisoner in the kitchen - I asked what was the matter with her-she sat for some moments before she gave me an answer, and then gave me a key, telling me to open her box, and I should find a child - I did so, and found it was there-it had nothing over it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A fall from a table, in her situation, would have occasioned the child not to be born alive.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOLT. I am a surgeon. I opened the child-there was nothing unnatural in it but a slight effusion of blood in the veins of the head, which would have happened by unskilful delivery.</p>

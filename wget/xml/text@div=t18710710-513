I keep the Red Lion—on 22nd June, about 4.15, the prisoner came in with three women, and a man, I think—she called for a pot of porter, took a shilling out of her bosom and threw it over the bar, it rolled on the floor and I was unable to see it—I knew that it was a shilling, and gave her the change—she then called for a half-quartern of gin to treat two of her friends, and put a shilling on the counter—I told her it was bad, she said she knew where she got it, and I gave her back the pieces as she appeared poor, and I did not like to be hard upon her—after she left I found the first shilling on the floor, it was bad, and I handed it to the con<lb></lb>stable—she was semi-intoxicated.</p>

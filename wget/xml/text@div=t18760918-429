                  </hi>. I keep the Wilton public-house, 20, Cov entry Street—the prisoner was my barman for eleven months—prior to September, in consequence of a suspicion, in my presence five half-crowns, three florins, one shilling, and one sixpence were marked—at 5 o'clock on the evening of the 8th of September I took out all the large money—I found four half-crowns and one of the two-shilling pieces—two florins and one half-crown were missing; the prisoner was present at the time—I called him to the top of the bar and told him he had got money belonging to me on him, and I gave him into custody and he immediately took out of his pocket the money, amongst which was one of the marked florins and said "I am very sorry"—he placed it all on the counter and I discovered the florin there which I had previously seen marked.</p>

At 3.30 on the afternoon of September 8th I received half a crown and a florin marked like those before me from Leader and went to the public-house in Coventry Street and passed the half-crown to the prisoner—he gave me the change and placed the half-crown in the till—I went out and then went into the other side and changed the florin—the prisoner laid it on the bar where they washed the glasses.; he placed a cloth over the florin—he then went to assist the young man to place the ice refrigerator in the chest—the cloth was still over the florin; he afterwards took the cloth off, wiped the counter, served two or three cus<lb></lb>tomers, and placed the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in his left hand pocket—I was in company with Leader when he searched the prisoner at the station—the florin marked in two places was found in his watch pocket.</p>

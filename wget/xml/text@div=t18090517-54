               <p>RICHARD THOMPSON. On a Wednesday in May, I cannot recollect the day of the month, I was in Mrs. Ayscough's shop, I saw the prisoner with her arm laid over a bundle of pieces; she had her apron over both her arms; I saw her draw the pieces out of the bundle and put them in her pocket; I looked at her, and then took her by the arm, I said are you not ashamed to rob such an old woman as Mrs. Ayscough. Mrs. Ayscough was not then looking that way, she was serving somebody else in the shop; Mrs. Ayscough came round the counter and sent for a constable; her pocket was took off, and part of the cassimere was found on her; I saw her throw the rest on the floor.</p>

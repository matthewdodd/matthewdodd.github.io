                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and am married to the defendant Usher's sister. I set up a shop at Holloway which had been in my wife's family for some time; it was a private house; it had been closed some time—there was no one in it—about Aug. 1843' I put a shop-front into it, stocked it with my own money, and put up the name of "Read and Usher"—it had been carried on before in the name of "Usher"—I took Usher into my employ at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, I think, first, he had no share or interest in the shop;</p>

               <p>he was only a servant—he did not pay any rent—I was the tenant; I paid the rent, and have the receipts—Usher used to come down and settle with me every Sunday evening, and I used to pay him his wages—on Sunday evening, 14th Nov. last, somebody told me something at my other house, and I went to the shop at Holloway, about half-past five, and found Usher, Partridge, and four or five more, smoking in the parlour—I asked what they all wanted—Partridge said, "This is Usher's place, and we have got possession, and we will keep it"—I had been told the property was in jeopardy, and took Wm. Wood, Wm. Coney, and three more men who work for me, and told them to stop over the way till I saw if anybody was there—I called them in, and said, "I shall go home; you stop and mind my property till Monday morning, and I will see Mr. Young, my solicitor"—I took down the partition between the parlour and passage, and moved all the shoes away—no violence had been used then—Usher went out, and in about ten minutes got twenty or thirty nabigators from the railway—the minute they got in they fell on my four men: one of them ran out and said, "They are in, Mr. Read, they are in"—I went in, and was knowcked down with a spade, and my hat cut through with it—I do not know who did that—one of the men made a blow at Coney with an instrument about three feet long, as he was coming from the parlour, and opened his face from the eye to the chin—there was a good deal of noise—they tore down the fixtures to defend themselves—one of my men was pitched out, and his head came in contact with the edge of the door—I went to Mr. Earle, a neighbour, for protection—my party had not the opportunity of using any violence—there was a great deal of noise; blood flowed.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th Nov., the Tuesday after the Sunday, I saw Mr. Read and Usher at the King's Head, Holloway—Read said he was very sorry for what had taken place, it was all his wife's fault; the matter was all settled, and they all shook hands together—that was after they had been before the Magistrate—they drank and smoked together, were very good friends, and had two or three pints of half-and-half, and a glass of brandy and water—they all drank out of the same glass, and I did too—Read asked me to drink—Usher took some—there were four of us in the party, Read, Usher, his brother, and me—Read said he might go home, it was all right now, and think no more about it—they shook hands together and parted very good friends, and I thought—I should say we were in the public-house an hour and a half, or two hours, all sitting down together and enjoying ourselves com<lb></lb>fortably—there was nothing said about the books—they were in there before I went in—what we had was all put down to Usher—it has not been paid for.</p>

               <p>went to have a pint a half-and-half, and paid for that—I knew Usher and Read—Usher asked me to drink with him, and I did, out of friendship—something was said about the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> on Sunday night—I heard nothing men<lb></lb>tioned about the man's cut lip—I learnt there was a bit of a riot—I did not learn that from Usher—it was a pretty general report, I believe—I heard nothing of blows having been struck.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were not talking about blows, but about brandy and water, friendship and good will? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was all—they were all quite sober, shook hands with one another, wished one another good afternoon, and were quite friendly.</p>

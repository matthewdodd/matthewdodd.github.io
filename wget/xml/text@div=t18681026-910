On 16th October, about 7 o'clock, I was in South<lb></lb>ampton Street, Strand, with the bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on my arm—I heard somebody come behind me and pull my bag—I was struck on the mouth, tad knocked down, and two teeth knocked out, by a man, who ran away immediately—I got up directly, and called, "Stop thief!"—I am certain that the man who struck me took my bag—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody, but did not know him—he is like the man who struck me, and the same size—I believe the prisoner to be the man, but I did not see his face—the bag had in it 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in a purse, a half-pound of tea, and other things—when I got my bag the purse was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live at 13, Newcastle Street, Strand—I was standing at the corner of Burleigh Street, Strand, about 7 o'clock at night, heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running as fast as he could towards me, from Southampton Street, with this bag in his hand, and no cap on—I called, "Stop thief!" and saw him throw the bag away in Burleigh Street—I picked it up, and gave it to the sergeant—I saw the prisoner stopped, he is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). About 7.30, I was in Burleigh Street, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—the prisoner ran towards me without a hat—I planted myself in the centre of the street, he saw me, there being a public-house with great lights, and crossed over—I caught him on the other side, and said, "What's up?"—he was out of breath, and could not speak—Ward came up and said, "He has knocked down an old lady"—the prisoner said, "It was not me"—I took him to the station and found a life-preserver in his coat pocket, and an imitation gold Albert—after</p>

               <p>he was taken to the station, No. 87, who had found this hat and umbrella when the lady was knocked down, brought them into the station, and the prisoner said, "That is my hat."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was not out of breath. The life-preserver was presented to me by my father, who if a gamekeeper in Northamptonshire. I earn about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. I am not likely to go and knock an old women down. I saw a lady on the other side of the way; all in a moment, I saw a cluster, and heard screams. I was going to look at the lady. I was hit on the side of my head, and my hat knocked off; here is a lump now. When I got to the corner there were a lot of men in the street. I immediately ran across the street, and the policeman took me; not a person in Court can say anything wrong against me.</p>

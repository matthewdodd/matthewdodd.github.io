             took a bag of sugar, the bag was in an empty cask, he put the bag of sugar underneath his frock; after that he altered it, not finding it right, clapping it down not to make it so very large; the one then said to the other, we had better break a lump of sugar that lays in the tub, because they could not carry it without being detected.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the two prisoners? - Two porters.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you heard all this? - I was laid on a shelf in the lump room; they did not see me. As soon as they had done it, they came under the shelf where I was laid, and I came down and took hold of them both. This is the sugar; I see them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only ground for its being your master's? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar do you call it? - About one pounds of lump sugar, and three pounds of bastard sugar or ground sugar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted the sugar is not in the same state as it was then? - The lump sugar is, but not the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that you was on the shelf, where was this shelf? - Over the door, about two yards and a half from the ground or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not see you? - I believe they did not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not much light in the warehouse? - There was a candle about ten yards from where I was; that was the only candle in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you wish the jury to understand that you were almost three yards from the ground, and they did not see you, and you was able to see what past, and there was no candle within ten yards distance? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to the sugar? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. The lump sugar has been put in paper by you since? - It has.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no sleeping partner in this house, is there? - No. It was Stevenson, Hewson, and Fenn, but Hewson is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that there may be no other partner though he may not appear in the firm? - No, I cannot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Sharp, of Conduit-street. I was ill in bed, and the prisoner was sent to do for me—there was no agree<lb></lb>ment made as to what I was to pay her—she would have had what she re<lb></lb>quired—she was fetched away, and I missed two or three articles after she was gone—I had given her a key to go to a safe where I kept some irons-the bundle in the officer's possession contains stockings and other things be longing to me.</p>

One Thursday evening she was not in the room when I came home—I found her in Devonshire-place—I afterward saw a basket in my room—I asked the prisoner what she was going to do with it—she said she had had some mangling, and was going to return tw basket when she went back in the morning—I afterwards saw the same basket in the coal-hole, and some clothes in it—I saw some brushes by the side of it.</p>

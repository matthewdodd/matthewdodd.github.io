             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of December, between four and five in the evening, two persons came into my shop, and asked for some clear lawn.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - No; I believe she was connected with them, I apprehended that they were thieves, and looked sharp after them. I showed them the articles they asked for; they objected to it, and were going out; I said they had better let me cut them half a yard off; with that one came to the counter side, the other stood by a horse that we hang linen on to show. The prisoner stepped up on the step, and took this piece of printed linen from the horse. I stepped round the counter, called my wife, and went out after the prisoner, and saw it under her arm. I took her and brought her back. When I brought her into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130024"></xptr> the shop, some of the neighbours came in; she up with her sist, and threatened to knock my wife down. She knocked the candle in the constable's face, and burnt his eye.</p>

               <p>Going along I picked up this linen; the man laid hold of me; I said if it was his property he should have it. I never was in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 270, High-street, Poplar, in the parish of All Saints, and am a saddler. On the 13th of Feb., about two o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the policeman, and found two of my shop shutters taken down, and a square of glass broken—I had some head-stalls in the window, but did not miss any—the property in the win<lb></lb>dow did not appear disturbed—they hung as they had overnight, I believe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 171.) On the morning of the 13th of Feb. I was coming down High-street, Poplar, and near the prosecutor's house I heard a noise of glass breaking, and a sort of rumbling noise—there were three wagons laden with meat drawn up there—I went under the body of the wagons, and saw two men standing against the door of the White Horse public-house, and the prisoner on the rails in front of the prosecutor's shop window, which are about two feet high—he jumped off the rails, and ran up North-street—the other two ran up the same street before him—I followed the pri<lb></lb>soner, and kept in step with him, and sprang my rattle—another constable, who had kept on the other side of the horses, was closer to him, and secured him—I knew him before by sight, and am confident he is the man—he was not out of my sight—I found the iron bar which goes along the shop shutters lifted up at the two iron rests—two shutters were down, and a square of glass broken—I knocked the prosecutor up—Hart brought the prisoner to the shop, and he said, "It was not me broke the glass, it was my two mates; but here, I will pay for the glass"—I said, "No, we don't do business in that way"—I took him to the station, and searched him—he had nothing but a knife—he had no money to pay with.</p>

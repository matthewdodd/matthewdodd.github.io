I am the father of the last witness, and keep the Shakespere public-house—I was in the bar near my daughter who came across to me, and said in Goddard's hearing "This is a bad shilling, I think the same parties have tried it on with me before"—Goddard was with another man who is not here, and I said to him "What do you mean by this?"—he said "What do you mean?"—I said "It is a bad shilling"—he said "I suppose you would like me to give you another for it, after that girl has been hawking it all round the bar? What do you take me for? Do you take me for a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>? I am worth quite as much money as you are"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, fetch a policeman"—the other man was silent—Goddard said "There, I will show I am not without money, take it out of that," throwing down a half-sovereign—the policeman came in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I gave one in custody, but they took two—I charged Goddard—he was taken before a Magistrate next morning, and discharged about 11.30—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live at No. 2, Charlotte Street, Whitechapel; I closed my shop on Saturday night at 12 o'clock, before going to bed—it was all safe—I was disturbed between 2 and 3 o'clock on the following morning by seeing the reflection of a light in the shop—the light disappeared, and I heard a match struck; I jumped out of bed, and called to the lodgers upstairs that there were thieves in the house—then a man ran through the front shop, unbolted the street door, took the chain off got into the street, crossed Charlotte Street, and ran up Gloucester Street—I saw the prisoner turn into Gloucester Street.</p>

On the morning of the 12th November, about 2.30, I heard the cry of "Police!"—I met the prisoner running up Gloucester Street from Charlotte Street—something fell on the footway—I said "Stop!"—he said "What have I to do with you?"—I said "I will see," and I took him back to Charlotte Street—he tried to get away—I sprang my rattle first—a female told me some one had broken into No. 2—I took the prisoner there and saw the prosecutor—I then took him to the station and charged him—he was covered with whitewash down to his knees—the prisoner ran about 100 yards—I found some matches in his pocket and in the shop, which correspond—I also found a candle.</p>

About 2.30 on the morning of 12th November I was in Gloucester Street and heard a policeman's rattle—I saw the prisoner in custody of last witness—I searched the prisoner at the sta<lb></lb>tion and found a gimlet, apiece of pipe, the string produced, and some matches—there were marks on the window sill of the shop, and I found a piece of candle outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The gimlet might have fallen from a workman's basket—I saw two men walk up to the shop and stop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor cannot swear I am the man. He never saw me in his life previous to ray being in charge. He makes a dif<lb></lb>ferent statement on 13th November to what he does on the 20th and he never says anything about the black hat-till the 20th. Constable Devonold says he heard something drop but he did not look for it Two other men were about and it is as likely to be them as me. I had been engaged mov<lb></lb>ing goods till late and that is how I came dirty with whitewash. When the prosecutor was asked if I was the man he said "I don't know." "Never mind," said the constable, "You charge him." I am innocent.</p>

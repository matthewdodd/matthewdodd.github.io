                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Richards, of New City Chambers-On Sunday evening, the 4th of September, I was going along Whitechapel, and at the end of George-yard I was taken hold of by the collar of my coat, dragged up George-yard, and knocked down at the end of it—I was tripped up, and thrown violently on my back—I am not certain whether the person came up to me behind or before—he was at my side when he tripped me up—he caught hold of my collar, and threw me on my back—I am not quite certain whether there was more than one person then—there was two when I was down—one put his hand on my mouth while I was down, the other tore open my coat and waistcoat, and with force took away my watch, which was suspended by a guard from my neck—it was a silver, double-cased watch—the guard was quite broken—they both immediately ran off—I cried out for a policeman—my head was cut very much, and I was very much hurt on my loins, so much so, that I could not rise for several minutes—that was from no other violence than the fall—when I got up there was a little boy standing, who saw the whole transaction—a policeman came up—I got up and went to the station with him and the boy—on the Friday following I saw the prisoner Rowan in custody—I cannot swear to his being one of the persons that attacked me, but I believe him to be the person whose hand was on my mouth, for I felt his jacket rough—I have some slight knowledge of seeing him at the time—my hat was rather over my eyes—I did not see Allen till last Wednesday—I am of opinion that he is the man that took my watch—I am confident of that—he stood in front of me, wrenching at my waistcoat—I had an opportunity at that time of seeing his person—the place was not very light—there was no gas near it—I have no doubt of his being the man—I believe I saw the prisoners in a public-house before the robbery—I am not quite certain, but they are like the men I saw there—I was not quite sober at the time this happened—my watch has not been found. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

On Sunday night, the 4th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was in Whitechapel—I go out with physic from a doctor's shop, and was going home after doing my work—I was at the shop till near midnight—I saw two men knock a gentleman down in George-yard—they tripped him up behind, pulled him right up the court, laid him down, and one of them kneeled down and put his hand on his mouth while the other took the watch off his neck—I saw them do it—it was the prisoners—I have often seen them about Whitechapel—Allen sold apples—I have bought apples of him—I had seen Rowan before that night with Allen—one had a corduroy jacket, and the other something like a black coat—I did not do anything when I saw this—I stopped till the gentleman got up, and then went to the station with the policeman, and gave a description of the men—the prisoners, ran away up the court—Rowan tripped the gentleman up, and the other took his watch—I saw Rowan at Lambeth-street-office on the Wednesday after the robbery, and Allen last Friday—I have been there twice to see</p>

On Sunday night, the 4tn of September, I was on duty in Whitechapel—I heard a noise, went to George-yard, and found the prosecutor had been knocked down and robbed of his watch—he was the worse for liquor, and all over dirt and blood—he was just at the entrance when I came to him, just in the street—he was standing up—I saw a boy there, but did not notice it was Howard till we were on the way to the station—Howard went there with the gentleman and me, and gave a description of the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I received information on the 5th of September, and on the 9th I saw the prosecutor—he had been confined to his bed till then—I went with him to the Red Lion and Spread Eagle in Whitechapel—there were about ten people in the room—I told the prosecutor to go in and look about him—there were five or six young men about the same age as the prisoners—the prosecutor pointed out Rowan, and said he believed he was one, but be should not like to swear to him—I took him—I saw Howard next day—he gave me a description of two people, and of their dresses, in consequence of which I apprehended Allen at the Founders' Arms, Brick-lane—when I went in he held his head down for seven or eight minutes—I took Howard next day to Lambeth street office, and opened the cell—there were from ten to twelve men there—I asked him to look round, and see if he knew anybody—he looked round, and pointed out Allen, and said, "That is the one that knocked the gentleman down, and the other one held his hand over his mouth"—I do not think Allen heard this—it was said just at the door—he might have done so—on the night of the robbery I was in White chapel from seven to half-past nine o'clock, and saw the prisoners go into the Red Lion and Spread Eagle—I saw them about three times in the street, going in and out of that house, which. is about twenty yards from George-yard—I knew them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rowan's Defence.</hi> Last Friday week, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in the Red Lion and Spread Eagle; Foay, two other officers, and the prosecutor, came in and looked round, the officer said, "Stand up," and we all stood up. The prosecutor looked round, and said, "No, I don't see any body here," and was going out; Foay called him back, pointed to me, and said, "Don't you think it looks something like him?" he said, "Why I don't know, I can't say;" he said, "Will you give him in charger?" he said, "I can't say it is him." He said, "I shall take you in charge". I said "Very well;" he said he could prove where the watch was taken to, and what it was sold for; he took me, and next morning he brought Howard to the station; as soon as he saw the policeman putting the hand cuffs on me, he said, "That is him." Howard stated, at first, that it was two men in white jackets; and afterwards, he said one had a black coat on, and I was the other. He denied ever having said that both had white jackets on, till Bull was called in and stated it; and then he said he could hardly see in the dark. The prosecutor told the policeman he</p>

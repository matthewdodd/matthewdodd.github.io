            . I went with Mr. Griffiths, the officer; he searched Mrs. Charrington's room, an acquaintance of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there at the time that you made the search - A. No. The officer has got the lace. I saw Mrs. Charrington take it out of her pocket, and put it on the table, under a pair of trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her, did you - A. Yes. The officer went to search: I took the trowsers up, and shook it, and out tumbled the lace; I said, here is the lace; the officer took it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the prisoner took it there - A. Because she owned it before the Justice.</p>

            . I searched Mrs. Charrington's room along with the last witness. When I was beginning to search on the left hand side of the room, the last witness called me, and said, here is the lace, Mrs. Charrington has taken it out of her pocket, here it is; Mrs. Charrington denied knowning any thing of it; she said, she did not pull it out of her pocket. In searching Mr. Charrington's place, I found a yard of ribbon; I have had the lace ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Moses. Look at the lace that Griffiths produces - A. I know it to be mine; there was five yards of it, there is but two yards now left; I know the lace to be mine by the pattern; part of the piece was taken away, and part left; I have got a pattern of it here. This is the pattern.</p>
               <p>JURY. This piece that Mrs. Moses has produced appears half an inch wider.</p>

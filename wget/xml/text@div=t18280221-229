            . I am a sadler, and live at No. 7, White-street, Little Moor-fields. The prisoner called upon me with the duplicate of a saddle, on or about the 12th of January; he wished me to buy it - I thought he was an honest man - it was pawned for 9s. or 7s. - I would have nothing to do with it; he said the duplicate belonged to another man; I told him if it was worth buying, I knew a person who would buy it - I went to Jeremiah Aish, and we went to Fore-street and took it out, and looked at it; he asked me what the person wanted for it, I told him 9s., he said he would give 5s., and something for himself; the prisoner was taken up that day.</p>

            . I am shopman to Jacob Russel, a pawnbroker, No. 43. Fore-street.

             re-examined. I have no doubt at all but that the saddle is my master's; the prisoner worked in the yard when his brother sent him - his brother used to come into the yard.</p>

A man came and asked for Macdonald - he said he had a saddle to sell; I told him I did not think he wanted one - he asked me to buy it - I said I had not money enough, and he asked me if I would pawn it; I asked him where he got it - he said from a man at the White Bear public-house; I went to pawn it - I told him to put my name on the ticket - I bought the ticket, and told other people so.</p>

On the Friday night I told his wife my stockings were very dirty, and desired her to wash them against to-morrow; she said she would: I got up in the morning, and ask'd if my stockings were ready; she said, No; but there are stockings up stairs; you may put them on till I get them wash'd: I put them on, and went after a place; the place was gone; and when I came back again, this man said I had stole his stockings, and he pull'd them off my legs.</p>

               <p>I live at the Conduit, in Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you <rs id="t17950916-45-viclabel261" type="occupation">keep the Conduit public house</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950916-45-victim494 t17950916-45-viclabel261"></join>? - Yes. About the latter end of July, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I could give change for a five pound note? I told him that I fancied I could; he called for a glass of shrub and water. He gave me the note into my hand; I see it was a Plymouth note, I desired him to endorse it, to put his name to it, which I gave it him for that purpose; and in the time that I went up stairs to get cash for the note, the note was endorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note that you took when you came down stairs, the same note that you had received of the prisoner when you went up stairs? - It appeared to me the same; I cannot positively say; it has the same appearance, only with the name endorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ink wet or dry? - I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name endorsed to it? - I don't know that; I cannot say how it was spelt; I did not take any particular notice, because he was a man so much respected by the company there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner write before? - Never did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down again, did you receive the note of him? - It was laid on the ledge of the bar. It was endorsed, but I don't know by what christian name.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it from the ledge of the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was there at the time? - Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cash the note? - Yes. When he had drank the shrub and water says he, I believe I owe you something, what is it? I did not recollect at that moment, I said, that I believed that he did owe me something for eggs, gin and water, and beer, to the amount of a shilling or fifteen-pence. I had not two half guineas, I wanted to give him half a guinea's worth of silver, and one half guinea in the change. I went into the parlour and asked if any gentleman in the parlour had two half guineas for a guinea? I came back and gave him the full change for the note, and he paid me out of it. I kept the note, I did not see him for eight or ten days after, till I see him in prison, in the Borough New Gaol I believe it is; I went and got admitted, and asked him, in the presence of another young man that was in company along with me, how he could give me a forged note? He answered that he did not know it was forged, and that I should not lose by it; I immediately told him that I was a poor man, and could not afford to lose by it; and he said, I should not lose by it, he said. he got it of that fellow Catapodi for a debt or money, or something of that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then taken before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination? - I did. (The note shewn him) This is the note I received of the prisoner, that I took off the ledge of the bar, that I gave him cash for.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same endorsement that was put on it when you received it? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Messrs. Hankey's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present the promissory note for payment? - Yes, I did, to one of the clerks; he is not here; they refused payment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had the prisoner been in the habit of frequently using your house? - Yes, he was; he has dined there with his friends, three or four times.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160121"></xptr>Q. I take it for granted that to a stranger, you would not have given cash for a country bank note? - No. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I would presume that you gave him this money more on the credit of his endorsement than on considence in the note itself? - Most assuredly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the prisoner have been under the necessity of resorting to a fraud on you if he had wanted this money to this amount? - No, he needed not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have given him this money on his own note? - On his own account I would.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some other persons in your house at the time he got this money from you; and after he got this money did he not go in and associate with them? - He was there but a very short time; he wanted eggs, and my wife did not like to send out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should be very sorry to take up the time of the court, but I would wish to state the simple facts that occur in this case. Some months back I was in the habit of going to Islington and Hornsey to spend my afternoon, there I got acquainted with a man of the name of Catipodi; he infinuated himself into my favour, and at several times borrowed money of me to the amount of six pounds; when I asked him for it, he always avoided giving it me, but at last he appointed a certain day; I went to Hornsey at the time, it was the 3d of August last; I told him that I was rather short, as I had been from my ship a considerable time; Catipodi evaded as usual, and said, he had no money in his pocket except a five guinea bill; which I took of him. I went to town about seven in the evening; I went immediately, as the most probable place to get this note cashed, where I was best known in town; and whenever I was in town have bore a most respectable character by every body there; I offered the note to Mr. Robertson as soon as I came in, I asked him if he could change it? he said, yes, he could. He went up stairs and brought down four guineas and a half, and borrowed half a guinea of one that is a witness in my favour. After this I asked for some eggs for supper, which he could not oblige me with, being rather late; so I drank my shrub and water, and wished them a good night. The very next day I was apprehended for being concerned with Catipodi and Davis, whom I had been seen with. It is hardly probable, in the minds of any rational being, to convict a man for going to a house where he was perfectly well known, endorsing a note with his own name, where the majority knew the place of my resort; and I should certainly have called the next day had I not been apprehended the next day, which was the 4th of August.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the habit of frequenting Mr. Robertson's house? - Nine years. Mr. Robertson has not kept the Conduct all that time. The first knowledge I had of the prisoner was at that house, which, I believe, is now about four years ago; he was very well known at that house; as far as ever I saw he was a perfect honest, up right man; I never heard any imputation of his character till this, not the least in the world. He is a <rs id="t17950916-45-deflabel263" type="occupation">midshipman in the navy</rs>

               <p>Q. Was you by when the prisoner endorsed this note? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endorse it without any reluctance? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in company? - Several.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know something of his friends? - Only by report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you see him endorse that note; how many were by at the time? - Six or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Robertson say that the company was in the other room? - I could hardly hear what he said; I have been up in the gallery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was not Mr. Robertson above stairs at the time? - He was to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two more witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

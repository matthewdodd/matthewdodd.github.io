                  </hi>. I am master of the City of London Union Workhouse, at Bow, Middlesex. Ploughman was an inmate there up to the morning of 5th Jan.—he was an able bodied pauper—it is the rule that if we can get employment for able bodied paupers, they must leave—we had not obtained employment for him, but his mother and brother came to the house, and said that there was employment for him to go to, if he chose to go out and do it—hedid not refuse, but he did not go—I mentioned it to the Committee, and they made an order on 4th Jan. that he should leave, and he was discharged on the morning of the 5th—it is part of my duty to attend the meetings of the Board, at No. 51, St. Mary Axe, every Tuesday, and I went there on 5th Jan., in pursuance of my duty—I arrived there about a quarter past 2 o'clock—Idid not see either of the prisoners at that time—Willcox had discharged himself from the workhouse—I remained at the Board till about a quarter past 4 o'clock; and when I came out I went towards the van to get into it, to return to Bow, and the two prisoners who I had not seen previously, came from</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pauper inmate at the Union workhouse of Bow. I know Ploughman by being in the house—on the afternoon of 5th Jan., I came up from Bow to the Board room at St. Mary Axe, with the bread van, and remained there for the purpose of taking back Mr. Saunders in the bread van; he came towards the van, and when I looked round I saw the prisoners knocking him about—Mr. Saunders was standing up, but when I got out of the van he was on his back, and they were striking him with their fists; he was all over blood—I went to get assistance.</p>

I was in St. Mary Axe, about half past 4 o'clock, and saw Ploughman hit Mr. Saunders on the eye—the two men gave him a black eye each, and I saw them both kick him once—I wrenched Mr. Saunders's walking stick out of Willcox's hand, they were going to strike him with it—I held Ploughman till a policeman came—I saw a good deal of blood on Mr. Saunders' face—I knew nothing of the parties before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was sent for to attend the prisoner—I found his face very much swollen and lacerated, and the eyelids closed—he was in a state of great nervous excitement, and from the pain in his side he had great difficulty in breathing—I examined his side, expecting to find one of the ribs broken, but that was not the case, he had injured his ribs a few days before, in falling from a ladder, and had a very strong pre<lb></lb>ventive bandage round him, otherwise he would have suffered more—the blows were not more violent than could have been effected by a fist, but as to the ribs I do not know, because I did not like to take the bandage off—consideringthat he was protected by the bandage, the kick must have been a very violent one—the skin of his face was broken.</p>

She had told me, that if she did not get a situation in a very little while, she did not know what she should do, as she was in distress. The evening that she left me, I saw her bring in a very large bundle. On Thursday, I missed two 5l. notes and 2s.6d. in copper, in a brown paper, and one yard of sprig muslin; I should not know my notes again; I suspected her, and got an officer, and sent for her over to a public-house, opposite to where she lived, and told her I had been robbed - I neither promised or threatened her. She seemed confused for a short time; I told her I had every reason to suspect her; she denied having any knowledge of it for sometime. I gave her in charge, she then confessed she had taken them. The constable did not promise her, she said she had taken the two 5l. notes; I asked her what she had done with them, she said she had laid them all out; I then told her I had lost one yard of sprig muslin, she said she took it, and had torn it up one day while she was with me; I then told her I had lost half-a-crown worth of halfpence; she denied it for some time, and then said she took them before she took the notes, and begged I would forgive her; I had not done anything to induce her to think I should forgive her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. She confessed every thing - I gave her in charge before she confessed it. I did not say it would be better for her to confess.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge on Monday, 30th June; Mrs. Smith took me to the public-house, saying she suspected the prisoner, who lived in Seymour-place, New-road; she sent for her, and when she came, she said,</p>
               <p>"you are the person I want;" I have been robbed, and you are the person who did it; she denied it at first. Mrs. Smith asked her how she came by her new linen and bonnet; she said, she could not give any account. Mrs. Smith said she should give her in charge - I shut the door - She began to cry - I neither promised or threatened her. Mrs. Smith said,</p>
               <p>"you are the person and no one else;" she then confessed taking the two 5l. notes, and asked me if I could forgive her - I told her I could not - She said she had changed one of the notes at a linen-draper's in Holborn. Mrs. Smith and I went to trace it, but could not trace either of them. I am quite sure that I said nothing to induce her to confess.</p>

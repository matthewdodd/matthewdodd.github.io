                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 487, New Cross Road, Deptford—on the night of 14th December, about 1 o'clock, when in bed, I heard a slight noise at the iron shutters in my dining-room, and armed myself with a revolver and looked out, but saw no one—I then dressed and called my son, and we went downstairs undressed without our shoes—I was in company with the Inspector, and we found a large space in the roof, of about a yard square, and in the side of the house four large holes were drilled, as if to effect an entrance.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house at about 20 minutes to 2 on the morning of 14th December, and found a great number of tiles removed from the roof, leaving a space of about a yard square—I placed several constables round the place in case thieves were inside, but we thoroughly searched the premises and found no one there—I found on the roof this chisel and these two knives, and a hat was picked up by a sergeant who was in the garden.</p>

I was on duty in Waterloo Place, New Cross, close to the prosecutor's house, and saw George Costin trying to get over a fence into a garden, and into the passage where I was standing—he was about five yards off—as soon as he saw me he fell back again—I directed another constable to remain at that spot—I got over the fence, but could not find the prisoner—he is the man I saw.</p>

               <p>from the inspector, I went to the prosecutor's premises, where I saw Abbott—I was left there by myself, and saw the prisoner, without a hat, walking on a wall about nine feet high, and took up my stand, thinking he would come over where I was, but he absconded, and I saw no more of him until I took him at Blackheath—the prisoner is the man I saw.</p>

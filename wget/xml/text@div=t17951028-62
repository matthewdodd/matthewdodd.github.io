Then after that, this here man that is at the bar now took the young woman from me, and took her out of the path; then one of them put his hand down by the side of him and drew out a case knife,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280098"></xptr>a black handled case knife, immediately he made a job at me, as he had got hold of the collar of my coat with his back hand, and I put up my hand, and stopped him, and I said, I will be d-ed if I do deliver either, and then he jobbed the knife at me, and I gave him a blow and knocked him down immediately; and then the other man came up and gave me a blow, immediately after I had knocked the other down; he did not knock me down; I recovered immediately, and then afterwards I gave him one and knocked him down, and then they both got up and ran back immediately, and said to this Sylvester Hill, let the young woman go; she tried to run away, and screeched two or three times, and then he gave her a blow and knocked her down; it was the prisoner that knocked her down; they all three ran away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu did not part with your money at all? - No, nor my watch; I had a watch in my pocket; I would not let them have either.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was a case knife? - Yes, it was, I am sure it was; it was a black handled case knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - Between Newington Green and Kingsland, not in the high road, just in a path across a field; it was very moon light, and I thought it was safe enough to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been always certain? -As to the person of the prisoner I am certain it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not point out somebody else to the magistrate? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing about his face? - Yes, he had something about his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a round hat? - A flapped bat, and an handkerchief up here, not quite so high as his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had never seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not under four degree of terror and fright? - I was in her at first.</p>
               <p>Q. What you bold? - Yes, I was, after heat them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then never having seen this man, and seeing him for so short a space of time, and being alarmed and having the handkerchief up and the slap hat, do you mean to swear to him? - I do; I have an undoubted right to do so, because I am certain he is the man and no other.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you it was moon light? - It was moon light as day, a finer evening there could not be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know whether there is any reward attending this conviction? - I don't know, I never enquired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear there was a reward for conviction of a highwayman? - Yes, I have heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think is the reward? - I don't know; I never did convict one, nor I do not wish to convict him, unless he is deserving it; but I think this man is thoroughly deserving it; if he is convicted it is no more than what is right.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the second indictment you have preferred against him? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are sure he is the man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would say so if it was till to-morrow? - Yes; if it was till next week, or seven years, or twenty years, I would say the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any lamps near you at that time? - No, there were not.</p>

            ? - I am his wife now. We were walking between Newington Green and Kingsland, and this field was the nearest way to Kingsland; these three people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280099"></xptr>overtook us, this one and two others, between eight and nine; they demanded watch and money, and then this one led me out of the path while the other two were with him; I went to screech, and he stopped my mouth; I went to screech a second time, and he stopped my mouth; and then the other two that were with him said, let her go, let her go; and then he let me go. Then I went to run away, and he ran and overtook me, and caught me, and I went to screech a second time, and he stopped my mouth again, and then the other two said, let her go again; and I fetched a very violent screech; and the instant I fetched the screech, he knocked me down, and then, when I was on the ground, he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was done to William Spice? - I observed that one of them had the knife in his hand; I observed that they were tusling with him, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the prisoner, can you speak to certainly as to him? - Yes; not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are the prosecutor's wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married to him? - A month the 1st of next month.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not married to him when I see you at Bow street? - I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. You say when they demanded the money of the prosecutor, the prisoner was engaged with you? - No, I did not say so. They were altogether when the demand was made of money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he laid hold of you two or three times, and you could not fetch a screech at first? Now where did you fetch a screech? How long was the prisoner engaged with you? - Ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you edeavoured to resist being much frightened? - My resistance! What is a woman against a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to make any resistance at all? - I endeavoured to screech if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently I take it for granted that you was more occupied about your own safety than the person of the prisoner? - I see him among forty people and fixed on him immediately, before I came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no you was not more occupied about reicuing yourself than observing the man's person? - I am confident it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed? - In a blue coat and striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a handkerchief over his face? - No, only came up over his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. And a round hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you venture to swear to him? - Yes, and I would again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard any thing about a reward for apprehending a highwayman? - No, I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband never told you? nothing about it? - No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep a secret so strict as that? - I don't know what you mean about reward; I have heard of such things, but I had not the least idea of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your husband told you? - I have heard such things from him and others.</p>

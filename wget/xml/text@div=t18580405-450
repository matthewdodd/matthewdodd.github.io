                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Johnson; I live in West Ham Lane. On 26th Jan., I went to the Victoria Hospital—I left my house fastened up; the door was locked, and every thing was safe—I went out about half-past 11 o'clock, and returned about 20 minutes past 5—I found my house fastened, just as I had left it—I missed four shirts, four sheets, two pillow-cases, a coat, a table-cloth, and other things; this is my table-cloth, here is a place in the middle which I darned; I know it by that—all those things were safe when I left, and were gone when I returned.</p>

On 20th March, I took the prisoner into custody at her house—when I told her the charge, she ran up stairs—I ran after her, and saw her go to a cupboard—I said to Mrs. Johnson, "See if there is anything here belonging to you," and she identified this table-cloth—theprisoner said, "Mrs. Johnson, you can't say that I robbed you;" and she said the table-cloth was her own, and she had bought it at some place some time ago—Mrs. Johnson said, "No, it is mine."</p>

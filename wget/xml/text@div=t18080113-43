Esdaile's house, bankers, and asked me to give him change of a fifteen pound note; I gave him fifteen pounds in paper and cash; he ordered a chaise; he left his horse and whiskey at my house, and went off with the chaise, and his two sons with him; about four hours after he was gone there was a hue and cry after him.</p>

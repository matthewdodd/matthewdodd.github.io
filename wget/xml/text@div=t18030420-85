            .(The case opened by Mr. Gurney.)</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAMPSON Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman; I was employed upon Williams's wharf, it is next to Anderson's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q.On the night of the 3d of March last, were you upon Williams's wharf? - A. Yes, I was; it was a moon-light night; I saw two men take a skiff from Anderson's wharf; they were of different sizes, one was a good deal shorter than the other; I took them to be two big lads; it was about seven o'clock in the evening; they unloosed the skiff from her moorings, and carried her off.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give any information to Anderson's servants, and how soon afterwards? - A. It might be twenty minutes; a servant enquired whether I saw any thing of the skiff being carried away, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the two prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you have any knowledge of their persons who took away the skiff? - A. I cannot say; by size they appear to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.You are the watchman at Williams's wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is that distant from Anderson's? - A. There is a brick wall between them; not more than two yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen this skiff before? - A.I never had, to my knowledge, she was a new skiff.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you saw the skiff put off, had you observed her at all? - A. No, I had taken no notice of her.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether she was moored or not, you know nothing about? - A. I know she was moored, by seeing them cast her off; I saw them undo her, and push her off, and take her away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You say it was a skiff that was taken- you don't know who it was taken by? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whether there were any sculls in the boat? - A. Yes, there were sculls, but they were fastened to it.</p>

             and Jannet Johnstone.</p>
               <p>Q.Are the same persons who are proprietors of the wharf proprietors of the skiff? - A. Yes; the last time I saw the skiff was about eleven o'clock in the morning on the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you see her? - A. On the premises of Mrs. Andersons wharf; it is called Anderson's coal wharf; I moored her myself both head and stern.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that in the City of London? - A. Yes; I missed her between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I made enquiry of the last witness, Mr. Sampson; there were a pair of sculls in her, secured by an iron bolt, and that bolt fastened by a chain; I went in pursuit of the skiff, in consequence of the information I had received, and in about an hour after I discovered her going by Queenhithe; she was coming from Blackfriars-bridge towards London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in a direction from Anderson's wharf? - A. Yes; I pursued her, and caught them on the Surrey side of the water; I found the two prisoners at the bar on board.</p>
               <p>Q.Any other persons? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the two sculls on board? - A. I did; the two prisoners had each of them one in their hands; it appeared to me that the eye of the bolt had been cut, or forced off, by that means the lock got off; I brought them to the wharf where the boat had been taken from, and a patrol was sent for to take charge of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.When you saw them, they were rowing on the North side? - A. The tide was running up.</p>
               <p>Q.How would that have been for making their way to Horsham stairs? - A. It was almost in a direct line; the tide would not have answered completely to have fetched her there.</p>
               <p>Q.Would that have been a course much out of the way? - A.They were rowing against the tide.</p>
               <p>Q.How far were they got over the Thames when you overtook them? - A.The nearest landing-place was at Bank-end.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were they rowing in a direction to Bank-end? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How is the skiff constructed? - A.She is made in the same form as other boats are; what we call lightermen's skiffs.</p>
               <p>Q.She is a boat that was used at Anderson's wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you saw this skiff, what had she on board? - A. I found a bed there, and a large bag, but what the contents were I did not look.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you first come to the wharf after that? - A. I think it wanted about twenty minutes of eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you know who this bed and bag belonged to? - A.No, not of my own knowledge; they did not belong to any body at the wharf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Did the persons in the skiff do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200100"></xptr>all they could to get away from you? - A.Apparently they did.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. This young lad and I happened to meet together in the City, and we went down to the water-side with intent to go by water, and there was nothing but this skiff, and a man was standing by her, and he said he would give us a cast over; he said, if we would row over, he would meet us on the other side.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. I have nothing further to say than the other young man has said.</p>

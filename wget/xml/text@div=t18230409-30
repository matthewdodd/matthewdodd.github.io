John said he worked for his mother next door, and not for him. We then went to his mother's, went up stairs, and began to search the room. The prosecutor went up to the soot room with John, the mother, Thomas, and another boy - I heard the prosecutor say to him, if he would tell the truth and give him his money, he would give him a crown, and would not hurt him; he had charged Thomas with stealing the money when he first came in, and he said he had not seen it. I went up, and told the prosecutor he was doing wrong in making promises, and threatened to take Thomas away, and then Thomas said, when he sifted his soot, he found this bag in it, and that he had done two more jobs that morning, and could not tell who it belonged to; that his brother had taken it to take care of for him, and he meant to advertise it. John then went out, and fetched the bag and money in, and I took them both into custody. When I got to the office, I counted the money, and found twelve sovereigns, five guineas, four half guineas, a crown piece, and six shillings.

I did my work and went away, and in quarter of an hour, he came, and told my brother, he had lost some money, and a boy named Fletcher had done it; my brother said he knew nothing about it, and directly he sent for an officer. My brother made me go up and search the dirt - I went and found the bag, and when the gentleman came again I came down, and he said it was me. I took him up to the room where the soot was, and he said he would give me a crown to say where it was - I then said I gave it to my brother to put away safe, and my brother fetched it.</p>

When my brother found it, there was a crown piece and six shillings among it - before that he had said there was only a few shillings among it.</p>

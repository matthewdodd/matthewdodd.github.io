                  </hi>. I am master of a merchant vessel. On the 29th of January I was going down to my ship, and went to the Golden Anclior at Woolwich, to get refreshment at noon—I met the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040242"></xptr>
               <p>there, and treated him with a pot of ale—being intoxicated myself, I asked him to accompany me down to my ship—I was able to walk—he took me to a brothel in Woolwich—I do not know the name of the street—two girls came down stairs—I wished to retreat, and moved towards the door—the prisoner came and shoved me down on the floor—I received no bodily injury—when I was down, he put his hand into my pocket, and took 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my right hand breeches pocket—I am sure I had full that, and I might have had more—I made no resistance, further than taking his regimental cap off his head and I kept it—I called, "Police"—a woman appeared from an adjoining house, and called the prisoner by name, "Waller" as he was making his escape—she said something to him besides calling his name, but I cannot say what—I did not hear him make any reply—he went away with my money—I took his cap to the Arsenal the same night—this was between five and six o'clock—I had been in the prisoner's company all that time—I believe he was drunk too—be had some gin beside the ale I gave him—I was not drunk when I first met him—I am quite sure that the money was taken from me—I received no hurt—he bad three comrades with him at the Golden Anchor, but we left them there—I only gave them one pot of ale—I missed a bunch of keys, besides my money—I have not seen them since—I had got 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Woolwich. I let the house next door to me to a tenant—about six o'clock in the evening of the 29th of January, I was sitting in my own house, and heard a dreadful call of "Police" and "Murder" in the adjoining house—I beard a second call, and then I went and saw the prosecutor on the floor, and the prisoner on the top of him, but in what exact manner I cannot exactly tell, as the fire was low and there was no candle—I called out, "What in the name of goodness is there amiss?"—the prisoner jumped up, and I could see by his clothes that he was a gunner—the prosecutor lay still, as if confused or stunned—I called for a light, which was brought in a few moments, and two or three persons came—the pro<lb></lb>secutor still lay on the floor, and then I could see the prisoner who was</p>

               <p>standing on the floor by him—I knew him directly the candle came, and I said, "I know you, Waller, you good-for-nothing man"—he said, "No, you don't know me"—I said, "Yes, I do; and you will find that to<lb></lb>morrow"—when the prosecutor got up he said he had got the cap of the soldier who had ill-used him—a gunner came in after the candle was brought—I did not know him.</p>

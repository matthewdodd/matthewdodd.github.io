                  </hi>, I am the wife of Henry Budd, and keep a shop in the general line at No. 5, Crown-street, Whitechapel. The prosecutor occu<lb></lb>pied one room on my first floor—he and his wife and two children all slept in that room—they occupied it two years and a half—I remember the Friday his wife left—it was last Friday week—I was unwell at the time, and was lying in my bed—my bed-room door faces the prosecutor's—on that Friday morning I saw a man named Barefield, who frequently visited the house, come up stairs—he searched for a key in the stair-case window, where it was kept when they were out, and went and opened the prosecutor's room door—I was sitting up in bed and saw this, the door being left open—I saw him go into the room, and the door shut to after him—after that my husband came up stairs to get his work, and as he went out of the room again I saw Barefield with his face to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's door, and his back to my door—my husband shut the room door, and I saw no more—about ten o'clock in the morning, before I laid down, the prisoner's father came to inquire for him—I told him he was not within—I knew the prisoner was Mrs. Soswinskie's cousin—his father tried the room door, and searched for the key, but could not find it—at twelve o'clock I came down stairs—the door was secure then—at two o'clock I went up to lie down again, and found the door had been opened, and the key left in the lock—at six o'clock in the evening Barefield came again—I did not see him go away—he appeared rather in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas James, and live in Thrawl-street, Brick-lane, Spitalfields.

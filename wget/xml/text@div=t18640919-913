                  </hi>. I am a journeyman, working in the Dover-road, and living at 7A, York-road, Albany-road, Old Kent-road—on the evening of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August, I had been to visit some friends in the neighbourhood of Blackfriars-bridge station—I went to meet my wife—I found she had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190096"></xptr>
               <p>gone by train to Camberwell-gate, and I then walked home—I had gone into the Old Kent-road, lower down than the Bricklayers' Arms Station, when I was seized from behind by two fists—whether it was one man or two, I can't say—they wrestled and tripped me up by my heels, and got me into the gutter—or in the road; and no sooner was I down, than one of them took my watch I took hold of his wrist, and said, "Not quite so fast"—I had no sooner said that than I had a tremendous blow, which knocked six of my teeth out; at least, loosened them, not knocked them out—I can't Bay what the blow was with; it was with some heavy instrument—it cut a piece out of my mouth—the doctor said, had the blow been a little higher, it would have killed me on the spot, and if a little lower, it would have broken my jaw—two of my teeth are loose now—I got up on my hands and knees, and was knocked down again—I did not see any one there, only the prisoner and two more in advance of him—I got up, and called, "Stop thief!" and followed him—as soon as ever he got on to the pavement, I kept calling out, "Stop thief"—I very nearly overtook him, not quite, but he was taken by police-constable 114—I was getting up to him fast, but I was completely covered all over with blood—the prisoner is the man I followed—I never lost sight of him after I got up on my hands and knees—I could not say who knocked me down the first time, but I believe it was him who knocked me down the second time; I am sure it was, because there was no one else there—as soon as he got on to the pavement, he started running, and I after him, calling "Stop thief," and I never lost sight of him—I lost a silver watch—I have the chain; the swivel and all was taken—I can't say where the other two men were when I was first knocked down; I received two blows all of a sudden—at the time the prisoner ran away, I saw two men in advance; one crossed the road, and the other went another way, by the Deaf and Dumb Asylum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been visiting some friends that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had been to meet my wife between 9 and 10 o'clock—I did not call at the house where she had been—this happened about half-past 11—I had had one glass of stout at a house at the side of the church in the Black-friars-road, and I called at the King's Arms, I think it was, and had a glass of stout there—that was all I had from 8 o'clock—I was on the opposite side to the Bricklayers' Arms station when this occurred, on the right-hand side as you go from London, on the same side as the Swan public-house; perhaps two hundred yards or more below the Swan—the first thing I felt was being suddenly struck behind—I was on the pavement when I was attacked—I got into the road afterwards by some means or other—I was suffering a good deal from the blows I received—the first blows were struck behind under the ear—I had never seen either of the men before, to my knowledge—I think there is a turning at the aide of the Swan, and opposite that another turning, called Swan-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the South Eastern Railway Company, and go with a van to and from the station—on the night of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August, I was with the van coming out of the station, on the tail of the van—as we came out of Henry-road, by Edgington's tarpaulin manufactory I heard, Mr. Jackson cry out something about his watch—I turned round my head and saw the prisoner and another man strike Mr. Jackson with some<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190097"></xptr>
               <p>—I can't say what it was—they were about three yards from we—I looked at them again, and then they kicked him as he was getting up—the prisoner kicked him—I called out "Police!" and "Stop thief!"—there there were two others ran away—the prisoner started to run—Mr. Jackson was getting upagain, and the prisoner kicked him again in the side, and knocked his hat off, and he then ran away the same way the others bed gone—I never took my eyes off him—he turned back to run the other way as soon as he saw the policeman, and the policeman caught him, and I said, "Hold him tight, that is the one."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

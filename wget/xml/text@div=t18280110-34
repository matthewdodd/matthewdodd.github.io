               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The first smoke you observed was about six o'clock in the afternoon? A. Between six and seven; there was not so much then as afterwards, but it was enough to make us search the house - Smith went to the house before me, but could not get in - I went about ten o'clock - the fire must have begun about six - it is a very crowded neighbourhood - a fire breaking out at that time would have collected a number of people - the prisoner broke the sash as soon as he could - he fetched the water.</p>

            . After smelling this fire in my house, I went out about half-past nine o'clock, having perceived the smell first between six and seven - I had not got the watchman when I first went out - I knocked at the door several times, and kicked; I could see through the shutters that the gas was burning - I remained at the door a minute and a half or two minutes, knocking - I could not get in, and called a constable from the opposite side; I took the watchman into my house - he smelt the skirtingboard - I then sent for the constable of the night - it was nearly an hour after my first going, that I went to the door with them - I have heard Mr. Allport's statement about the door being opened - I waited till it was opened, and did not go in directly - the prisoner said it was locked, but he had not got the key, and could not open it; Mr. Roberts, the next door neighbour, had gone to the door, knocked at it, and told him to open it, for there was a fire - a voice inside said, "I can't, and I shan't - I don't know who you are;" I said, "Mention your name, Mr. Roberts, he will know it better than mine;" he did so, and the prisoner said he could not open it, and he should not; that it was locked - I said I would go and get a crow-bar, and break it open, for there was a fire - the shutter was afterwards taken down by the patrol; I did not go in directly myself; I sent for an engine, and when I went in I met the prisoner in a little room, and went with him to where they get the water from - he had a pail in his hand, and said there was no cistern, which was true - he put the pail under the water-cock; I went up stairs, and saw where the fire had been - it was then put out - the water had been taken up - I saw the riser of the stair was broken - a man was using the crow-bar - in the hole were several pieces of wood, part of them burnt - the parts not burnt appeared to be fresh split; some of them were long pieces; and there was a bundle of matches, with a little sulphur on one end, the other end was burnt; I saw some rags in a basket, but no wood in it; I do not recollect seeing any rags out of the basket - there were two pieces of cotton, something like the wick of a candle in the hole with the matches - the matches were tied together - there were five or six: when I went down stairs, after this, I saw the prisoner sitting on a flour-bin - Everiss came in at that time, and said to the prisoner, "There was likely to have been a pretty job;" I could not exactly understand what answer Castle made - he said, "There had," or something; I then thought proper to give Castle and Everiss, who is Rowley's foreman, in charge - they were afterwards allowed to go at large for the night; when the prisoner was getting the water I asked the reason why he did not open the door - he said he was not going to let a parcel of thieves in - I said they were neighbours, and not thieves - I then asked if he did not know there was a fire up stairs - he said, "No, I never was up stairs in my life;" I asked who had been up stairs; he said the last that were up, were the apprentice and foreman, and that they went out between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you knocked at the door, do you mean with the knocker? A. No; I thumped with my hands, and kicked - I do not know whether the patrol who came was sober - I had never seen the prisoner before; I had seen Everiss before; I once had an occasion to send for Rowley about a wall, and Everiss came in; some of the houses there are very old - the wall is only nine inches thick; I do not know whether it is called a party-wall; I know nothing of the prisoner having any ill-will towards me; I understand Rowley had another shop in the London-road - I cannot say whether he knew who was at the door, when he said he would not open it.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the district. On Sunday, the 9th of December, I just came up at the time the mob was at the door - I was quite sober; I broke the sash of the door, and got in; there was no glass in the sash, only frames; I had heard the prisoner say the door was locked, that he had not got the key, and could not open it; when I got in, I saw the door was not locked; I looked at both bolts, and found the bottom bolt bolted; I opened it directly - there was a brilliant light from the gas in the shop; a person could see it was not locked; I asked him for a candle; he said he had none; Mr. Roberts, of next door, said, "I will fetch one," and went to his house for it; whether the prisoner brought one before he returned I cannot say; when the light was brought I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100035"></xptr>"Go back to the bake-house, and see if any fire is there;" the prisoner said, "There is no fire backwards; I have just come from the bake-house:" I said, "Then let us go up stairs;" he did not go up with me - he said nothing - he did not seem as if he knew the way up; I told him to follow me; I opened the sitting-room door, on the ground floor, but he did not come up at that time; when I got up, I said, "Here is the fire - don't be alarmed;" somebody said a pail of water would put it out; I afterwards saw the prisoner in the shop, and heard him say to somebody, that Jones (meaning me) had said he had unbolted the door; I replied, "I did say so;" I do not recollect his saying any thing particular to that; I think he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner assisted to break the frame in the door? A. That I cannot say, but he unscrewed the shutter inside; the staircase door leads from the private room - you go from the shop to the bakehouse, without going through the private room - the private room is on one side, and there is a kind of passage leading from the bakehouse on the other; the staircase is so concealed that a man might be there some time, and know nothing of the stairs; he did not misdirect us at all; I went into the bakehouse afterwards - the sponge was set; I do not know whether there was a fire in the oven; the bolt that was fastened was within a very few inches of the floor - he might have kicked it in the hurry, and fastened it, without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The lock was higher up? A. Yes; the light would show that the bolt of the lock was not in the staple - it was not even on the single catch; I understood from him that he had set his sponge, and fallen asleep on the board - he had his coat on.</p>

The first floor back-room; I took a candle with me; I did not remain there a quarter of an hour; I brought the candle down; I observed nothing on the stairs; the rags which were found had been kicking about the floor for a week or two, loose, not in the basket; I never touched them; I did not perceive any hole in the riser of the staircase - if there had been such a hole, I must have seen it; I put the candle out, and left it on the parlour-table when I went out; I suppose I remained down stairs for a quarter of an hour, or more before I went out; we were talking in the parlour, and were going to have tea; but, finding none in the house, I proposed to go to the coffee-shop; there was a fire in the parlour; we left the gas burning in the shop - I saw the prisoner in the bake-house when I went out, and spoke to him - he was reading a book; I asked if he was going out - he said he was going to lay down; he had a candle; he would lay on the boards, where he generally lays every evening, till eleven o'clock, which is working time; I slammed the door after me, and left it on the spring-lock - I did not lock it - I could not bolt it outside; I think I tried it to see if it had fastened, but will not be positive; the door generally stuck so that if it was not slammed very hard, the lock would not catch; there was no hook to fasten the spring back; I returned about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock; I had not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100036"></xptr>near the house from the time I left it - I went from Shoreditch to Bishopsgate, stopped there till past nine o'clock, and went from there over to the Borough; we bake sixteen or eighteen sacks a week at the house in Shoreditch; our returns were between 40l. and 50l. a week, on an average; I generally settled with master on Monday; I had settled with him on the Tuesday, and had all the money in the house which was taken after that; it was better than 27l.; that money was in the cash-box, in my box; I found, when I returned, that the keys were in the box, but I did not know I had left them there; I usually lock it; I did not go to the box till after two o'clock in the morning; I did not look for the money till nine next morning - when Mr. Rowley called; the money was then gone - I had not taken it; I did not know the prisoner till he came to work at the house - some furniture had been moved to the house in the London-road - he had moved sufficient to make the house comfortable - two beds were left there - the apprentice had slept in my bed the night before, and the girl in the other, which is a story higher - Rowley's sister was there when I came on Sunday morning; Castle never slept there - he left on Saturday afternoon, as soon as he had done work; I did not leave till nine o'clock in the evening: when I went out, I took the key of the door in my great-coat pocket; but am sure I did not lock the door; I never use the key when I go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had no acquaintance with the prisoner till he came into Rowley's service? A. No; I received the money from the customers - I never told him where I put it; I do not believe he knew whether I locked it up, or paid it to my master; I do not think he was ever up stairs - he had no communication with the house; the passage runs on the other side of the little room - a person might go down the shop, and not see the stair-case; there is no lock to the stair-case door; it is in the little room; we always sit in that room when we are not serving: the prisoner never comes into the shop, except to bring the bread and bakings; he is not a man that made himself officious at all; I am not related to Rowley; the apprentice is his wife's brother; he slept in my bed on the Saturday, and might have seen the rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Had all the best of the furniture been moved? A. No; there were some very nice mahogany chairs in the first floor front room, which they occasionally used on Sunday, when they had friends; all the best beds were moved - only one table was moved, I believe; and that was from the little parlour - I left a middling fire burning in the little room when I went out - it was near five o'clock; we went to the coffee-shop, had tea, and staid there some time; the apprentice looked at the paper, and it wanted five minutes to six o'clock when we came out; I told the prisoner I was going out, and should return about the old time - he knew I had returned about eleven o'clock the Sunday before; he knew I must have the key to let myself in - he knew I let myself in; I did not miss the money till the following morning; the house was full of people when I came home; I did not go into the bed-room - they only showed me the stairs, and took me off to the watch-house; there were people all the way up stairs - I will not be positive whether any were in my bed-room - I saw several in the shop and little room, and on the top of the stairs; my bed-room door was open, and people close to it, on the landing; I never saw the prisoner and Rowley speak together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Rowley a key of the premises, so that he could come in while the prisoner was asleep? A. There was no key but what I had; Rowley was himself committed for trial.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How soon after the fire was the prisoner examined at the office? A. About eleven or twelve o'clock on the Monday - I was examined at the same time; I was examined three times, and discharged at the fourth; we did not inquire the prisoner's character when he came.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged at the prisoner's house. In consequence of something my wife said to me I told the prisoner that various articles were missing, and it was very mysterious—I mentioned a child's frock and a sheet—she said it was very alarming—the man, called her husband, came down and said it was a false charge; and he did not think we had lost them at all—I got an officer—the prisoner denied all knowledge of these things—the officer searched her, and found a number of duplicates—this was on Mon<lb></lb>day, the 20th of April—the next day we went to the pawnbroker's, and found the articles.</p>

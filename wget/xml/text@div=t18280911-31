The prisoner was eleven weeks in our service; my husband gave her notice on a Saturday, to leave on Tuesday, for getting tipsy - I had a dream on the Tuesday morning and awoke at a quarter-past six o'clock - I got up, and saw the prisoner leaning with her hand against the door full dressed; this was at a quarter-past six in the morning - I asked what she wanted there full dressed so early - she said she had let somebody out; I went to bed again and slept till half-past seven o'clock, and then awoke with the same dream - I came out into the front room, which is the prisoner's, and saw a small drawer lay on the floor, and the other drawers were half open - a silk shawl lay on the floor; there was nothing in the drawers but one short window curtain - the things were entirely cleared out; they before contained sixteen shifts, four bed gowns, six gowns, twelve yards of black bombazine, eleven yards and a half of black stuff, three tablecloths, two pairs of sheets, eleven yards and a half of lace, six pairs of worsted stockings, three pairs of silk stockings, three pairs of silk gloves, ten napkins, five shawls, several tax papers, 11s. 6d. in money, three lace caps, four lawn caps, a pair of stays, a brooch, and a pair of cuffs - the value of the whole is more than 10l. - 40l. would not pay me; I had been to one drawer the day before, and every thing appeared safe, when I took out two pairs of sheets, at half-past eleven o'clock - every drawer was locked, and the keys in my pocket, which was under my bed; I found three of the drawers had pieces broken out of them - they were wrenched; an oyster knife laid down by the side of the door - the prisoner was gone away when I got up the second time; I did not see her again till that day week, when she was in Spitalfield's watch-house - I did not make her any threat or promise; she immediately fell on her knees, and said, "Oh! mistress, pray, for God's sake, forgive me, forgive me;" I went to her lodging with the officer, and found a shawl hanging on a line - that was on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110029"></xptr>same day and the officer found an apron there; I found on my own floor a large silk shawl - I am sure the shawl and apron are mine.</p>

In consequence of information I went to a house in Popham-court, St. Dunstan's-hill, and found the prisoner lodging there; I found her on the third floor, and told her I wanted her on suspicion of robbing Mrs. Willocks - she then said, "I took nothing but two gowns and this apron," giving me the apron; I asked her what she had done with the gowns - she said she had sold them to a person in Rosemary-lane, who she did not know; I brought her away, gave her in charge, and went to the room with the prosecutrix, and on a line, tied to the bed-post, hung a shawl, which she claimed.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and asked what she had done with the property - she said she had but two gowns, and sold them in the lane; I examined the drawers - they appeared to have been opened with the oyster knife - it fitted the marks.</p>

On the morning in question I went through the prisoner's room at half past five o'clock - she was in bed then, and the drawers seemed all perfect; my niece, who is seven years old, was in bed with her - I must pass through her room to go out; I returned at half-past eight - the drawers were then open, and my wife in great agitation; the prisoner was bired by the week - she was paid weekly, and had her board; the property taken away is worth 40l. to me.</p>

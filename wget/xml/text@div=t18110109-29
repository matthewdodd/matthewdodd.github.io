On the 3d of January last, about two o'clock, the prisoner and another woman came into the shop, they asked for a piece of print, they looked at it, and desired me to cut off two yards of it; after I had cut off two yards for the other woman, the prisoner look at a print and asked me to cut off two yards; I did, and while I was in the act of folding up the print, I saw her rise from the ground and put her coat around her; then two other women came in, I rang the bell for the other men to come down, the prisoner paid me for the print and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her rising up in this way, and putting her coat about her raise suspicion in your mind - A. It did; I went over the counter and watched her, she had not gone above the next door to one, before she let a piece of print fall of twenty-two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it fall by design or by accident - A. I think by accident; she picked it up and went on; I pursued the prisoner, she went into a court near Middle-row, and from there she went to a gin-shop, at the corner of Middle-row. I left the witness Lambert there while I went and fetched my hat; when I came back she was just coming out of the door of the gin-shop, the wind blew her coat of one side, I distinctly saw a piece of print; I pursued her and took her at the top of Gray's-inn-lane; I asked her for the print, she let it fall on the ground, I picked it up by her feet; I took her back to Mr. Webb's, and a constable was sent for, he took charge of the prisoner and the print.</p>

            . On the 3d of January, about two o'clock, I was coming by Mr. Wood's shop, I saw her drop a piece of print about five or six yards from the door; I saw her stoop to pick up the print, and she stumbled over it; I thought the prisoner was in liquor, that made me follow her; she got up again and run with it, and stopped at the corner of a court in Middle-row, and as I was going back I saw Strong looking back, I went into the shop and asked whether they had lost any thing, I told them I had seen a woman come out of their shop and drop a print; then Strong and I went and saw her in the same court where I had left her; she turned down Middle-row and went into a gin-shop, she staid there about three or four minutes, while Strong went and get his hat, she came out and went over to Gray's-inn-lane, Strong saw the print and went and took her. When she was taken I saw her drop the print from underneath her coat down by her feet, and Strong picked it up.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WOOD. On Thursday, the 3d of January, about two o'clock, I was coming down Holborn, I went into Mr. Webb's shop; I saw the prisoner there, whom I knew; the prisoner and the cotton were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this gentleman's shop, I bought two yards of cotton, when I came out of the shop they dropped a bit of cotton, I picked it up and followed them; I thought they were in that court; I called after them, this gentleman came after me and said it was his cotton; I said he was very welcome to it.</p>

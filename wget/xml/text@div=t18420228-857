                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Anti-Dry-rot Company, and reside in a house belonging to the Company, in Lime-street. The secretary of the company pays the rent and taxes of the house—I occupy it merely as a servant. On the 18th of February, about half-past two o'clock I found the private door leading to the upper part of the house, ajar—knowing my next door neighbour had been robbed, I went up stairs to my bed-room—I found no one there, and returned to the office—in about three minutes after I heard the private door shut—I immediately looked out at the office window, and saw the prisoner go down the steps of the house—I made inquiries of the servant, and immediately went out and followed the prisoner down the square, through Lime-street, till he came to the comer—he then ran across from Lime-street into St. Mary Axe—I there saw him just about to converse with another boy who I had seen playing about in the square—I beckoned to my porter, who I saw just by, to catch hold of him—he did so, and brought him back to the office—he denied having been into the house, and said I must be mistaken—I sent one of the clerks for a policeman, and whilst he was gone, the prisoner of his own accord, said, "I may as well show you what I have got"—he took out of his pocket the articles stated in the indictment, which are</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in Mr. Thomas's service, and live in Brown's-buildings, St. Mary Axe. I was standing in St. Mary Axe when he passed me—he beckoned to me there, and I laid hold of the pri<lb></lb>soner and took him back to the office—he there pulled out this property—I told him to lay it down on the stairs—he afterwards pulled out the loaded pistol, and kept it in his hand till the policeman came.</p>

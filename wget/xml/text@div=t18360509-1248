                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to John Ratcliff and others; we do business with Delarue &amp; Co., ribbon-dressers. The prisoner used to bring goods from them—he came to the warehouse on Friday morning, May 6, for goods to take to his masters—he emptied a basket of goods into one of his own, which basket he brought, as if he was going out at the door, and put it on the counter in the middle of the warehouse—he stood for three or four minutes—I observed that he did not go out, and having nothing to detain him, I turned my head to see what made him stop—I observed the basket-lid go down suddenly, and heard the rustling of paper—after he was gone, I went to the spot, and missed a roll of goods, from a parcel of five papers which had been brought to the house the day before—they were dressed satin ribbons—I missed two pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ribbon-dresser, and live in Bunhill-row. The prisoner came to em as a workman, and occasionally went out for goods—when he returned from the prosecutor's I had information, and called him into the counting-house—he was told he had stolen some ribbon; and I said, "You had better tell"—he said it was in his hat, in the ribbon-room up stairs—I went and brought his hat down, and found the ribbon in it in his presence.</p>

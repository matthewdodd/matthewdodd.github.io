               <p>Q. Do you know what errand she came in upon. - A. Yes, a halfpenny worth of beer, she was served with the table-beer; she drank it and was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing as she was going out. - A. There was some cheese in the shop that stood at the shop window; when I turned round, I missed one cheese, and I suspected her to be the person that had taken it; she had a long cloak on, I went and put my hand outside of her cloak there I found the cheese, it was under her long cloak, she had it under her arm. I took it from her; she denied taking it, and she said I did not take it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cheese. - A. Ten shillings; it is my cheese.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hoxton Old Town. On the 28th of August I was driving a cab which stood in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, waiting to take a gentleman in it—It is a four-wheeled cab—my box-coat was on the dickey—I was called in-doors by the gentleman, but I saw the prisoner come up, turn his head round, and then take my coat off—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Holloo! drop that"—he threw it down and ran by—I followed calling "Stop thief"—he was brought back within five minutes—I swear he is the man, I saw his face distinetly—there was a gas-lamp directly over him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> People both before and behind him told him I never touched it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is false; there was nobody near him but some boys who pursued him.</p>

               <p>duplicates on him—I asked what he had been doing—he said he had been doing nothing—I asked him what he ran away for—he said because the men hallooed "Stop thief."</p>

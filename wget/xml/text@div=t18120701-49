I led the horse out, and shewed it him: he said, it was a very fine horse; he liked it very well: he asked me the price. I told him, seventy guineas. He, said, if he bought the horse he would pay the cash down. When he took him away, he asked me, if I would allow him to ride the horse, to shew his partner, Mr. Coulson. I allowed him to do so. When he got upon the horse, he went the wrong way to go to Bread-street. He said, is not this the way to Finsbury square. I said, no: he then rode towards Finsbury-square, with my saddle, bridle, and horse. He had not gone far before I heard that I had got into very bad hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got the horse again - A. Yes; he rode off with the horse, and sold the horse for forty pounds to Mr. Abel, of the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Coulson present when the horse was taken away - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, Coulson was not present - A. No,</p>
               <p>Q. He never mentioned a wish to buy a horse of you - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, Coulson said, he would give an acceptance for the horse - A. Yes. I did not sell

             the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, that you sold and delivered this horse to Morris - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing - A. It has every appearance of being my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said, and sworn, that you delivered this horse to Morris - A. I wanted my horse or my money. I do not think there was any horse mentioned in that oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gelding taken out of your possession, except the very gelding that is now in question - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. If ever you sold and delivered to him a gelding, it must be that gelding: must it not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Answer the question, whether you ever swore that you sold this horse - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you swear - A. It was for obtaining. I did not want to lose my horse, if I could obtain it in a fair way.</p>
               <p>COURT. I will tell you what you swore; you swore, that

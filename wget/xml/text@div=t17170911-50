             deposed, the Prisoner came to her, telling her she was ill, and had not the conveniency of lying down on the Bed at her Lodgings, it being a Press Bed and turned up; and therefore desired leave to lie down upon her Bed; which she granted. That she lay there five or six Hours, during which time she went in several times, and asked her how she did, and she said she was very ill; that she did not perceive her to be with Child, that she went out, and when she came home found her sitting upon the Bedside; that she said she was very ill; and she taking notice that her Sheets were in an odd pickle, asked her how they came so: she made her an Answer as proper as the Case would hear without telling the Truth, and took the Sheets away with her, wash'd them and brought them again the next Day. But suspecting there had been a Child born, search was made, and the Child found in the House of Office. The Constable and others deposed, that at her Apprehension she first deny'd the Fact, but afterwards owned it: and being asked why she put the Child there, she replied, Because she did not know where else to put it; that she did it to conceal her Shame, and that by so doing she had brought her self to more, and was now heartily sorry for it. The Prisoner pleaded that the Child was Still born, and came before its Time; and that she had made her case known to a Midwife, and several other Persons, and that she had provided Necessaries for it. There were some Persons that confirm'd these Circumstances; a Midwife, an experinc'd Nurse, and some other Women, who saw the Child, gave their Opinions that it came four, five or six Weeks before its full time: and a Bailiff's Wife deposed, she came to her about 4 Months since, giving her 3 s.6 d. for a Writ to arrest one who she said she was with Child by, in order that having by that means secured him she might oblige him to provide for it. The Jury considering the whole Matters, <rs id="t17170911-50-verdict259" type="verdictDescription">

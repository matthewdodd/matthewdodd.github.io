                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased Robert Bridge Langham. He was a stableman—we occupied two rooms over the stable in Davies'-mews—the prisoner was coachman in the service of Mr. Wilson—my husband and the prisoner had their carriages in the same coach-house—my room commands a view of that coach-house—it is not directly opposite, but I could see it plainly. On 19th October, my husband came up-stairs to change his boots, and put on his wooden boots—he wears wooden boots when he washes the carriage—when he went down, the prisoner was there, washing Mr. Wilson's carriage—I heard a conversation between my husband and the prisoner—my husband said he did not wish to have any masters work there—he said he did not go to his master when he had an accident, and the next time he would not settle it so—my husband walked away from him to the coach-house—he went into the coach-house—the prisoner said, "That is your game, is it?" and under the wheel of a carriage there was a setter—the prisoner went to the setter—he unfastened the chain and took the pin out—he took out the lever and went into the coach-house, following my husband—he raised the lever with two hands, and struck him a violent blow—my husband reeled out of the coach-house to the back of the carriage—he had his hand to his head, and said, "Oh, dear!"—I saw the blood flowing most profusely—I ran down-stairs, and, as I went, I took off my apron and put it to my husband's head, to try to stanch the blood; but it was impossible to do so—my husband went to Mr. Ritcham, his master, and spoke to him—the prisoner went to his work—I went with my husband to the surgeon—he went to two doctors before he went to Mr. Bloxham—my husband went home with me, and finished his work—he did a little now and a little then—he did his work—that was on Tuesday—on Wednesday, he went to Mr. Bloxham—he was not at home—my husband went to the hospital on Friday—he died on the Monday—I had some con<lb></lb>versation with the prisoner on the day that he struck my husband—I told him it was a cruel blow—he said, "You did not see <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> hit me"—I said, "No, Mr. Brown, he did not: there was no blow struck when you hit my husband"—he said, "I don't say there was"—I said, "If there had been, it did not justify you in hitting him"—he said, "Yes, it did," and if I did not get out of his way, he would serve me so—"You won't do that," I said, "I have got the medical certificate in my hand which Mr. Bloxham has given me; and I will let Mr. Wilson know what a wretch of a coachman he has got" street police-station—he repeated then that I did Dot see my husband hit him—I said, "No, I did not; and if I had, it did not justify him in taking his life"—he said, "No, I don't say it did; I am very sorry for it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I recollect the deceased coming to me about 11 o'clock—when he entered my surgery, his face was covered with blood, and he had his hand to his head—I placed him in a chair, and proceeded to examine the wound, and dressed it—it was a straight wound, about two inches in length, extending up to the hair and down to the fore<lb></lb>head—it was partly incised and partly contused—the scalp was not penetrated by the blow, neither was there any depression of the bone—I dressed the wound in the ordinary manner—it was a blow which might have been inflicted with the straight part of this weapon—this was on Tuesday—I saw him again on Thursday—he complained of a little stiffness about the dressings, but they were undisturbed—he seemed slightly feverish, which induced me to ask him if he had been drinking—he said, "Yes"—I directed him to continue taking some medicine which I had prescribed on the first day, and he said, oh he had had enough of that—he went to the hospital on the following morning by my advice—he was in such a state that I thought it necessary—I did not see him after his death.</p>

On the morning of 19th October I saw the deceased about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock—I did not observe what state he was in—I was not near the coach-house door; I was by the stable, which is at the top of the mews—I saw the prisoner and Langham's master outside the stable-door—I heard the deceased say to the prisoner, "You are a b—y liar"—the prisoner was in the stable, the deceased was outside—I heard Mr. Ritcham say to the prisoner, "Go and get your carriage done, and I will make <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> ay for it"—<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> was the name the deceased was known by in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—<hi rend="italic"> Bob</hi> said the prisoner was a b—y liar; and he said, "If you say that again I will take your b—y life"—I can't say where the prisoner went, for I went home to breakfast; I did not return till 11 o'clock, and then I heard what had happened. I then saw Langham cleaning a brougham in the coach-house where this had happened—there was a man there washing a gig, whom I knew by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Tucker. I asked Langham what had been up, and he told me he had knocked Brown's head against the wall, and then he struck him with the setter—on Thursday the 23d I went to Dr. Bloxham with him; he went in to Dr. Bloxham, and he came out again, and told me Dr. Bloxham had ordered him to go home and keep himself quiet, or else it was very likely he would have a severe attack of erysipelas, but he would not dress his head that day—I remember he had a black eye—I do not know how long that was before this.</p>

               <p>the coach-house where this happened—I was passing the door—I did not go to it—I heard very high words—I know Langham and the prisoner by sight—I saw them both—the prisoner had a cloth in his hand cleaning a carriage—Langham was standing still—the very first word I heard Langham say was, "You must be a pretty b—r to go and tell your master, of the carriage last night"—the prisoner replied, "Yes, and I will do it again"—the deceased seized him—the prisoner ran twice round the carriage—the deceased followed him, and seized him again by the hair and shook him—the prisoner replied, "I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to stand it <hi rend="italic">no</hi> longer"—they were at that moment between the carriage and the coach-house—I saw the deceased catch the prisoner and knock his head against the coach-house door—I saw Brown fetch the setter and hit the deceased, and the blood came—I went away about my business—I was examined before the Coroner and bound over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did this take place outside the coach-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, between the carriage and the coach-house, outside the coach-house door—the deceased ran round the carriage and seized him by his head with both hands—he struck him, and the prisoner replied, "I am not going to stand that"—I did not see him take the chain out of that instrument—the chain was not in it, it was lying down by the sink—the setter was not under the wheel of the carriage—he did not take the chain off, and draw the pin out, it was lying down in the sink—the deceased had not gone inside the coach-house before he struck him; it was outside—this looks to me like what he had—I did not see Mrs. Langham or Mr. Miller there—I saw no one there—I have lived with a man seven years, and have two children—I have never been married—it is not true that Miller was there with his carriage, that I swear—he could not have been there sitting on his carriage without my seeing him—I saw him pass when I was putting my bonnet on.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the Tuesday morning when this happened—Brown came to me, and made a complaint of the breaking of Mr. Wilson's carriage—I went to the carriage and Brown complained to me in Langham's presence, that Langham had broken Mr. Wilson's carriage down the edge of the spoke of the wheel—I have been coachman to Sir James Clark for five years—Langham was employed under me—when I saw what was done I said he must be more careful, and I told Brown to get the carriage mended and I would make <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> pay for it—Langham denied doing it, but he used no offensive language—Brown called my attention to the carriages—they were jammed into each other, and that led me to believe that Langham really had done this damage—it was Langham's duty to put the carriage into the coach-house the night before—I was not there when the blow happened—Langham was a drunken man—I gave him notice to leave five times; he was a very violent man—he worked for me something like eleven months—I have heard him challenge the whole mews that he would fight any man in the mews—he professed to be a fighting man—I have seen the prisoner about the mews—I believe him to be a sober, steady, inoffensive man, so far as I know him.</p>

I remember 19th October, I was at the door of my shop, which is over the coach-house where this happened—I saw Brown, and Ritcham, and Langham together—Brown complained to Mr. Ritcham of his carriage being injured—Mr. Ritcham told him to get it repaired, and he would make <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> pay for it—he said it was his carelessness and told him to get candles for the future when it was dark—I had occasion to go out—I put on my coat, and Langham came down the mews and said to Brown, "You are a b—y liar, if you say I did it, I will knock your b—y head off"—I interfered and said, <hi rend="italic">"Bob</hi>, there is no occasion for any quarrelling, that won't mend it"—I did not say any more—I went away about my business, and when I came back this had happened, and the man had gone to the doctor—I had known Langham about the place since the time he has been there at work—I should think he had been drinking from my own impression, but still I should not call him drunk.</p>

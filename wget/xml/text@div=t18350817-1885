I call this a good piece of lead"—ne said, "Take it, and say nothing about it"—he then said two per<lb></lb>sons gave it him—I said, "Where?"—he said in the field—I went and returned in a quarter of an hour, and said, "I cannot find any body else, will you come to my master's?"—I went with him to my master—the prisoner laid down in the yard—he then got up and ran away—I followed him, brought him back, and then the constable came and took him.</p>

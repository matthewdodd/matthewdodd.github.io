On Wednesday, the 21st of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for - I went to the house, found my box broken open, and missed a purse, with five sovereigns in it, which I had seen there the night before; I also missed a waistcoat, a shirt, and a silk handkerchief. I left my box locked when I went out that morning; the prisoner had slept there on Tuesday night, and I dined with him there at one o'clock on Wednesday, but when I was fetched he was gone - I was informed he had been gone about half an hour. I went in pursuit, and found him on the Friday following, in Essex, about sixteen miles off; I detained him, and sent for a constable - he had my waistcoat and shirt on, and the handkerchief he had in his hand, when he came into the house where I was; I saw him put the purse out of his hand, and give it to a young woman, whom he was in company with - I took it from her, telling her it was mine; it was the purse my sovereigns had been in - there was only 2s. in it then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any money on him except the 2s.? A. None; the clothes he was wearing had been in my box; I swore to the purse at the office by its being broken at one end - he was out of a situation, and slept in a bed in my room, which a person had left. - I mentioned the sovereigns at the office. I never offered not to prosecute if I received 10l.</p>

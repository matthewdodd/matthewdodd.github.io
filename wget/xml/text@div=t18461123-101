                  </hi>. I am a tailor—I live in Peter's-court, Rosemary-lane. On Sunday night, 16th Nov., I was in a public-house, and quarrelled with the prisoner—I remained there some time after, and went away to my lodging—we lodge in the same house, and sleep in the same bed—I rapped gently at the door, went up stairs, took off my hat, and laid it at the foot of the bed—I was taking off my coat—I did not' think anything of what was done in the public-house—the prisoner got out of bed, struck me a blow with something, threw roe down on the side of the bed, came down on me, and was punching me—I made an attempt to strike him in the breast—whether I struck him or not I cannot say—he threw me down, and gave me a severe cut—I am not aware what with—there were three persons in the room—a man got out of bed to save me, but the prisoner said he would serve him the same, and he ran away—he was beating me till the police came—the room was full of blood—I was taken to the hospital—I have not been able to find out what he cut me with—it was not with his list, but with some sharp instru<lb></lb>ment.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time had you any particular ear rings - A. Yes, twelve pair that I bought, and never shewed them to any one. I put them in a drawer underneath the window; nobody in the shop knew any thing of them but myself and wife. I never had any ear-rings of that pattern before nor since. I missed a pair of these ear-rings on the 7th of March. I accused the prisoner of taking them. I asked her to let me look in her boxes, she has two boxes; she brought forth a box with a broken lock upon it, and the things were all turned out, there was nothing there, she unlocked the other box and the first thing that she bid her hand upon was a bit of paper in the middle of the box, she turned the things out with her left hand, I asked her what she held so tight in her right hand, she said, they are my own, I have had them some time, with that, one of the ear-rings fell on the floor I picked it up, I said, these are the ear-rings that I am looking for, they are mine, she then turned round and cried and said she would fetch her father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe her father came and was too warm, and that induced you to prosecute - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been some difference between you and her father - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did some work for you, you thought he charged too much - A. I told him if he would go to any shopkeeper, and the price they would charge I would give him; he had charged me a great price.</p>
               <p>Q. She went home to her father and came back with her father; no officer was fetched until her father had been - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She was taken before the magistrate and was bailed and appears here this morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time that you charged the girl with this had you settled with him - A. I had not, but he came to me afterwards to settle her wages and I settled it with him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was present when the prisoner's boxes were searched; we found nothing in her first box, in the second I observed her take out a piece of paper which she kept in her hand. I asked her what she had in her hand, she said they are not yours, I have had them some time; one of the earrings fell on the floor, Mr. Steele picked it up, and it proved to be the pair of ear-rings that we had missed. She began to cry and said she knew nothing of them, and never saw the ear-rings before, she said Mr. Steele must have broke open her box and put them in to make her out a thief; she would go and fetch her father, which she did; her father came and abused Mr. Steele very much, and said he must have put them in the box; the constable has got the ear-rings</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The constable was not fetched till after the father came - A. No, he was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's servant. On the 27th of this month I was at the Blue-coat Boy public-house, in Dorset-street, Spitalfields, sitting in the tap-room, smoking my pipe—I had seen the prisoner in front of the bar—he came into the tap-room, and asked me whether I worked at Trueman and Hanbury's—I said no—he then asked whether I knew a person called <hi rend="italic">Long Dick</hi>—I said no—I did not wish to have any conversation with him, and went to the other side of the room—he came to me there, and forced his conversation upon me—I joked with him two or three words—he made use of some horrid vulgar expression—I did not know what it was, and he asked whether there was a poker in the room—I saw him stoop towards the fire-place, in the act of taking it up, and I almost instantly received a tremendous blow over the head—I was sitting with my hat off, leaning on the table, and did not perceive it coming—I lost my senses inconsequence of the blow—after I came to, I found myself all smothered in blood—I went to a surgeon—about nine or ten weeks previous, I had turned the prisoner out of the house for abusing the landlady—that was the only offence I had given him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you not sitting in the middle box in the tap-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no middle box—there were two men sitting on the opposite side of the room, not behind me—I was on one side the fire, and they on the other—I have lived about seven years with Messrs. Trueman—I did not insult you in any way—I joked you-you were making remarks about Mulligar in Ireland-you forced your conversa<lb></lb>tion on me, and I said you had better go to Mulligar—he kept teasing me—I said he had better go into Angel-alley, and tease the girls.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Blue-coat Boy public-house, and saw the prisoner standing at the bar, between nine and ten o'clock—when I went in afterwards, I saw him in the tap-room, and saw Tucker sitting on one side of the tap-room—he afterwards shifted to the side of the fire<lb></lb>place—the prisoner asked him about some of his men who worked with him, and asked him some of their names—Tucker would not tell him, and then I heard the prisoner call him a b——three times, and the third time he told him he was a b——by nature—he then said, "There is a b——in the room," and in about a minute he took the poker from the fire-place and struck Tucker on the bare head, as he laid with his head down—Tucker had said he wondered how an old man like him should go among a parcel of girls—that was before he called Tucker this name—after that he took up the poker and struck him on the head, and Tucker fell on the seat covered with blood.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday the 26th of June I had been into Fore-street upon some business, between four and five o'clock; I went into the King's Head opposite Cripplegate Church; the prisoner and another man came in and called for a pot of beer; they sat down and drank. I observed the prisoner had something under his coat, which he frequently attempted to secrete; when he took out his money to pay for his beer I observed he had a large brass cock under his coat, what they call a stop cock. I suspected he had stolen the cock. I asked him what he was? He said he was a labourer. I asked him where he worked? Then he said he worked with Mr. Beardmore, did I know him? I said Beardmore and Reynolds in Barbican I knew very well. I went up to the landlord and told him my suspicion of the prisoner; then I went to Messrs. Reynolds and Beardmore and brought their clerk, Mr. Wilkins, with me to the publick-house. I showed him the prisoner and said that is the man. He said Richard, what is the reason you have not been at work? The prisoner said he had got too much liquor. Mr. Wilkins asked me if I was sure the prisoner had got the cock? I said he had. I went up to him and said, Friend, you have got a cock under your apron unless you have given it to the other person. The prisoner immediately took it from under his apron and laid it on the table. Mr. Wilkins asked him where he got that? He told him had it from the shop. He asked him what business he had with it? He said he had no particular business with it; he had taken it from the shop, and they might do what they would with him for they could not hang him.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober at that time? - He might have drank some liquor, but he was far from drunk at the time. Mr. Wilkins went and got a constable, and I stood with the prisoner while he was gone; some thing in his right hand coat pocket struck against the legs of a corporal in the militia. He said he had something else, and took it out of his pocket; it was a piece of metal; when that was taken out of his pocket I told the constable I thought it was his duty to search him; he was searched and we found another stop cock in his left hand pocket; then the constable said he thought it was necessary to send for his master, which we did. Mr. Reynolds came and talked to him about it; the prisoner again said, he had taken them; he might do what he would, he could not hang him.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; the prisoner was stopped. I found a large cock on the table; the other cock and this piece of metal I took from him. (They were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Reynolds. A piece of metal was found upon him which was broke off another piece which fitted exactly.</p>

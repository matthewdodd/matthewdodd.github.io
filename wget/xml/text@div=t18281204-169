            . On the 11th of November, about a quarter before three o'clock, I was passing the prosecucutor's yard, and saw the prisoner go down by the side of a shed, where there is a small pool of water; I saw him drive three drakes and the duck from the pool into a dark corner of the field - I said, "What are you doing?" he said driving them home; I said, "Are they yours?" he said Yes - I said, "Do you work for Mr. Salmon?" he said Yes; I said, "You must go to Mr. Salmon's;" as we went along he gave a signal to some persons, but a person came by with a barrow, and I kept the ducks - (two of the drakes wese stolen last Saturday:) it was a foggy day, and I was obliged to keep close to him to see what he was doing with them - he used some very bad language, and when we got near the watch-house he got away, and got to White-street, where he made a stand, and said to some persons, "Now you b-rs, begin to mallet him;" some persons came up, but I got assistance, and secured him - he had no bag, but the persons that came up had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a violent pain in my inside, and was making my way to the corner of the field; this gentleman came and said, "What are you going to do with these ducks?" I said Nothing; he then said he should lock me up, because I was saucy to him.</p>

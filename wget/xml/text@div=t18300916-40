The prisoner was in my employ on the 16th of July; I had a box in my bed-room, which ought to have contained money: I found it empty - I had missed money from there before; I then put eight marked shillings into it - I went to it the next day, and two shillings were gone; I went down, and accused my servants, who all denied it - I sent for a Policeman, and desired him to search them, but he would not; I then desired the prisoner to go about her business - she at first refused, but at last she went out, and as she was going she spoke to my errand-boy; he then told me to go into the candle factory, and I there found the two market shillings, in a black glove, with a key, a knife, and some other things - the prisoner was not searched that I know of.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the day stated he charged his servants with this- the Policeman was sent for, but he would not search the prisoner; she was afterwards going out, and as she was going she told me to go down to the candle-factory, and under the candle-mould I should find a glove with 2s. in it, and I was to take them out; instead of that I told Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent him down for my box - I had not had the money. Witness. She did not send me for the box, but for the glove.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had she an opportunity of going down after she was charged with this? A. No - she told me of it in the street; another officer came afterwards.</p>

            . I was sent for, and took the prisoner - she begged of me to speak to Mr. Armstrong, and said she was never guilty of any thing of the kind before, and she had two children; we took her to the station, and found some other money, which the prosecutor could not identify - here is all the money found in the glove.</p>

            . That is the money I found; he swore to the two shillings which are marked - I have had it locked up in my box, and am sure there is no mistake; the 7s. which were found on her we gave to her at the office, but this money was in the glove.</p>
               <p>MR. ARMSTRONG. In the money produced before the Magistrate there were two shillings which had a scratch on the top of the crown, but they are not here: I marked eight shillings and two sixpences, and two shillings of it were gone.</p>

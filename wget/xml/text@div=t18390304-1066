                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Bennett France; he lives in Davies-street, Berkeley-square. On the 23rd of February the pri<lb></lb>soners rang the door-bell—they said they wanted to look at the apartments I had to let—Berry said she wanted them for a single gentleman, who had lodged with them for five years—I showed them a room on the second floor—there was a tablecloth on a caddy on a table in that room—I then showed them a room on the first floor—Berry went into an adjoining bed room—there was a handkerchief in that room on the floor—I saw her stoop, and pick up something—I told her I begged her pardon, but I should like to see what she picked up—she said she did not pick up any thing—she had an umbrella and a handkerchief—she showed them to me, and said they were her own—I said no, the handkerchief was mine—I took it from her—she said she was very stupid, and very foolish, she ought not to have taken it—she said I was a very good girl, and asked me to let her out—I said I would, but I detained them, and found the tablecloth on the top of the stairs, which had been in the room up stairs—they had both been in the room where it was—I had no means of seeing how the cloth was</p>

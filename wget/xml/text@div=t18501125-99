                  </hi>. I keep the Oxford and Cambridge stores, Oxford-street. On Saturday evening, 9th Oct., between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner was in my parlour; I heard the bell ring, and my servant went in; she came out and made a communication to me—I went in with Carrughi, and saw the prisoner lying on a woman, with his arm on her bosom, and her hand on his thigh—the table had been removed from its proper position in front of them—I put the table in its place, and the prisoner called me a d—d scoundrel, and other filthy words—I said, "I will tell you what it is, if you cannot use better language, the best thing you can do is to drink up your grog and leave the house"—he said, "I will do no such thing; I have paid for what I have had, and I will do what I choose in your house"—I said he must leave the room; he declared he would not leave until he chose, and he should do as he liked in my house—the woman got up, approached me, put her fist in my face, and said, "You b——y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>, I will put you out of the room myself, and punch your head"(I did not know either of them before)—I said, "I see what you are by your language; if you don't behave yourself, I shall certainly put you out of the house"—she repeated the language again; I laid hold of her gently by the sleeve, I neither touched her arm or any part of her; I took her to the door leading to the passage, and desired my man-servant to put her out—I used no violence whatever; if any damage had been done, her dress would have been torn—the prisoner got up stealthily behind me, I neither saw or heard him; the first notice I had was a severe crash on my head with a large glass—he then <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> it into my head, and the third time he threw it at my head, which smashed the glass to atoms; this is the foot of the goblet—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is no vestige of the rest—I was stunned, and nearly overpowered by loss of blood—he was not con<lb></lb>tent, but when I turned to close with him, he inflicted several severe blows on my head with this stick ( <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my clothes were saturated with blood, I could scarcely see—that is the only public parlour I have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an optician, of Holborn. On 9th Nov., in the evening, I went to Mr. White's, and found him about to go into the parlour—I went in with him, and saw a female sitting opposite me, and the prisoner lying down on the bench, with his body lying over the female, and his arm round her neck—Mr. White removed the table towards them—they both said, "What do you remove the table for"—Mr. White said, "it is time you should behave yourselves a little, and the sooner you drink your grog and go about your business so much the better"—the</p>

               <p>prisoner said he had paid for the grog, and they had a right to stop as long as they pleased—Mr. White said, if they stopped there they were to behave more decently—the woman got rather angry at some words which I could not catch particularly—Mr. White said, "Come, I know you, and the sooner you go out of my house the better"—she got up, stamped with her feet wildly, and said, "You say you know me, you b——y <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>, I will punch your head, and turn you out"—Mr. White said, "This won't do," took her very gently by the arm, and showed her out of the room—the prisoner was sitting quiet, but all at once he took up a glass nearly full of gin and water, and I could see by the action that he was going to throw it on Mr. White; he got out into the passage, and I heard the splash of water, and blows struck—I went out as quick as I could, and saw the prisoner strike Mr. White on the head with this broken glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), he was bleeding profusely—he then struck him two or three times on the head with a stick—I tried to assist Mr. White, and Cobbett was scuffling to secure the prisoner; a policeman was sent for, and he was given into custody—he appeared sober, but much excited—at the station he said he had not done with Mr. White yet, he would swear his life against him—no one struck the prisoner in my presence.</p>

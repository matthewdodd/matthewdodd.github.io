                  </hi>. I live at No. 102, Cheapside, and am a book-seller. In July, 1837, the prisoner came to my house, and did business there—he took my first floor—at Christmas last he brought in his furniture—he brought his family with aim at that time—the first floor consisted of two rooms on the front of the house, and one at the back—the staircase is between them—he was not to occupy any other room—I occu<lb></lb>pied the shop and the rest of the house, the second, third, and fourth floors—it is four stories high above the ground floor—in the cellar there is a water-closet—be merely used that himself, his children went up stairs—his family consisted of three children—he is a widower—he bad no right in the cellar, except to have access to the water-closet—on Friday, the 22nd of June last, I ordered my apprentice, Bolster, to turn off the gas, as he generally did—that was at half-past ten o'clock, after shutting up the shop—he went down the cellar to turn off the main, but I did not see him—after he came up, we shut down the trap-door, and immediately pro<lb></lb>ceeded up stairs to the second floor together—I then read prayers to my apprentices and servants—while I was reading prayers, I heard a noise on the stairs, and requested one of the servants to shut the door to—it was like a person going up and down stairs—I should think it was not more than one person—the person appeared to be going up aid down, from the first floor below me—my family had retired to bed—about a quarter of an hour after hearing the noise, I proceeded to my bed-room—I have a workshop on the fourth floor—I directed Bolster to go up and close that door—on his going up, he suggested to me that there was a smell of fire—I imme<lb></lb>distely ran up stairs, and found that it was not in the workshop—I smelt to as I went up, but could find none up stairs—I immediately ran down stairs—we had got about half-way down, and the smoke was excessively powerful—it ascended in such quantities as to prevent my going down stairs—I ran back, and the bells began to ring—the house-bills, front and back—it alarmed my wife, who jumped out of bed, and I ran and took two of my children, one under each arm, and my servant took two, and got them safely out of the house—they were conveyed to a neighbour's house—I went through the house, I saw my wife and family aafely placed elsewhere, and returned to the premises—I found the engines there, and the firemen and Mr. Braidwood at the head of them, and after some time the fire was extinguished—I went up stairs, and there was a strong smell of turpentine in the back room on the first floor—the fire was then out—I had ob<lb></lb>served, before the fire was extinguished, that it was in the back room of the first floor—I saw it from the outside of the house, and I thought it had made progress from the lower part, as I saw fire in the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could not see it in the back room from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I did, as there is a court goes down by the house, named Freeman's-court—when I returned from placing my family in safety, I found the fire out—I went into the back-room and smelt the turpentine—I did not find any thing in the back-room that night, but I did the next morning—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me during the fire, and said to me, "Mr. Ewins, what has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183807090042"></xptr>
               <p>James Bolster being doing?"—(that is my apprentice)—I said, "I am afraid he has dropped a spark among the shavings when he went to turn off the gas"—at that time I had no suspicion there was any thing wrong, but thought it purely an accidental fire—the next morning, which was Satur<lb></lb>day, some gentlemen came to inspect the premises—MR. Braid, wood was among them—a carpenter was sent for—I saw him take away the skirting of the back stairs where the fire had been—the prisoner was present at the time—when it was taken away there was a quantity of can dies and pieces of fat found, and one candle partly burnt out—I said, "it is a terrible thing"—the prisoner said, perhaps somebody in my emply might have taken the candles and secreted them there, to wait an oppor<lb></lb>tunity to carry them away—the pieces of fat were not tallow fat—I think one or two were pieces of pork fat—on finding this, I was induced to make a minute search in the cellar—I called Bolster down stairs—he and I went into the cellar together with a light—the cellar had had a new ceiling a few months before—I found there were some holes made in the ceiling and some thing dropping from the holes—I applied a candle—there were pieces of paper in the holes wrapped up and tied round with thread—some was brown paper and some printed paper, of various descriptions, tied round with thread and saturated, some with Venice turpentine and some with some kind of sulphur, a lump of which is in court, and the paper also—Venice turpentine is more glutinous than the other—I gave that sulphur to Mr. Baldwin—I made a further search in the cellar after the officers re<lb></lb>turned from taking the prisoner into custody, (which was done in conse<lb></lb>quence of a communication from somebody) and in a recess in the celllar was found a quantity of paper shavings, apparently saturated with turpen<lb></lb>tine—part of them were such shavings as would be produced in the business of a book-binder—paper cut off the edges of books—the rest was brown paper—I am a book-binder—they were such shavings as I should have occasion to make in the progress of my business—I kept my shavings in a tub in that cellar in front of the house—anybody going into the cellar could have access to that tub—there were upright pieces of wood which directly communicated with the hole in the ceiling—they were placed under the hole where the paper was—they were propped up by one another—then were shavings piled up between them, and between the shavings pieces of bro wn paper and thin mill-board spread with Venice turpentine, andapparently a light had been applied, but it had gone out—there was one or two patterns of pocket-books among the paper—I had nothing to do with the pocket-book patterns—nor do we use any mill-board so thin—but some of the mill-board there, I believe, is mine—a quantity of the wood which was piled up near the trap-door in the ceiling had been burnt—it appears there were two or three distinct portions, but that I have described had not been set fire to, but under the stairs there were other pieces of wood completely burnt—there were several heaps of wood in different parts of the cellar, some of which bad been burnt and others only partly burnt—there had been some near the trap-door, directly under the steps—that had burnt part of a pair of steps leading into the cellar, and another loose pair of steps under these steps, and other wood had been consumed also—the ceiling of the back-room was not at all affected by the fire—the trap-door was very much burnt, and the beams of the cellar—the part of the trap-door was burnt which would be inside the cellar when shut—when shut, it forms part of the flooring of the back-room—I gave Mr. Baldwin the first paper I found—several pieces—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183807090043"></xptr>
               <p>gave the pieces of pocket-book and other things to the officers—after searching I went into the prisoner's rooms two or three times with the officers—on the Saturday after the prisoner was taken into custody, we proceeded from the cellar to his back-room—I had not been in the cellar, it may be for two or three days before the fire—I seldom went—I had another convenience—I did not notice any pieces of wood when I was last there—then I went into the back-room, first-floor, with the officers, I saw some straw lying down in a kind of recess, and there was a pipkin near the re<lb></lb>cess, with a kind of paste of turpentine in it—it was a thick paste, corre<lb></lb>sponding with some we found in the cellar—it was on the wood and on the piper—I think the officers took the pipkin—I also found a broken bottle with about half-a-pint of turpentine in it—I should think the property in the prisoner's rooms worth nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made any observation about the prisoner going into the cellar before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was surprised at his going down so much—I saw? him go down oftener than I thought necessary, and he remained longer—I had noticed that for about a month before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the firemen any thing to drink at the time they came there, did you go and fetch any spirits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the fire was over, the street-keeper suggested they ought to have something—he said they were fatigued, and wanted refreshment, and I gave them some at his suggestion—I do not think the prisoner's property was worth so much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were presses there—an embossing-press and a stand and frame—I do not believe it was worth more than 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had some dies and metals, for press-work, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they not worth more than 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I cannot say whether I saw all that he had—there were small blocks and paper patterns—I did not see many of them—there was a small portion, worth.

               <p>was half a quire of cartridge-paper, not half a hundred-weight-there were a few pocket-book clasps and locks—the prisoner received goods from other persons to do work upon—he would not be answerable for those goods if consumed, for I have seen the policy—he had no annuals at this time of the year—he has pocket-book annuals when the pocket-books come out—I am quite sure it was turpentine I found—I know what naphtha is—I believe there was not any of that, but there is a chemist here—the prisoner brought his goods into the house on Christmas-day—I saw his children on the night of the fire—two of the younger ones were undressed—I believe they had their night clothes on—his eldest daughter, I believe, had bon<lb></lb>net and frock on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Ewins—he married my sister—I am also his apprentice—I reside with him at the house, No. 102, Cheapside, and sleep in the back shop over the cellar—the trap-door which leads down to the cellar is in that shop—on the night of the 22nd of June about half-put ten o'clock, I went down to turn off the gas in the cellar—I had a light with me—J noticed nothing whatever particular in the cel<lb></lb>lar—after I had done it I came up the cellar steps, and shut down the trap-door—I had fastened the shop and doors previous to going down into the cellar—after closing the trap-door I went up stairs with Mr. Ewins into the kitchen, on the second floor, where we went to prayers—I did not hear any noise anywhere while my master was reading prayen—after prayer I went up stairs, by master's direction, to lock the workshop—on getting up there I smelt fire—I came down and spoke to my master, and he went up stairs with me—we then both went down together to the lowern part of the house, but finding the shop was full of smoke, he ran up stairs to his bed-room and fetched down two of his children—I ran up to the top shop, waited there some five or ten minutes, and then came down stairs again, and saw Mr. Peacock's front-room door open—at that time the fire<lb></lb>men were down stairs playing, on the fire in the cellar—they were inside the house—I went into the prisoner's room, and looked out of his window, and on Mr. Wilson's leads, under the window which joins Mr. Ewins's leads, there were four bundles—this was on the first-floor—the leads are on a level with Mr. Peacock's window—I got outside on the leads, and brought three bundles in—the other one being very large, I could not carry it in—I lifted it up—it was a bag tied at the mouth, but I did not bring it in, being so heavy—Mr. Peacock was not there when I got out and brought the bundles in—after the fire was extinguished in the cellar, he came into his own room, and I told him I had brought three bundles in, and left one out—he made no reply to that—the leads run under the first-floor window of Mr. Peacock's room, and then Mr. Wilson's, and so on up the street—a person could run along two or three houses on them.</p>

I am apprentice to Mr. Ewins, and have been so about five years and a half.

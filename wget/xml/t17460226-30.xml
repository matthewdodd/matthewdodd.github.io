            (to Holmes) Did you lose at any Time any Damask : And when?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yesterday was a Week, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lose?</p>
               <p>Holmes. About Two Yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Out of my Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your Shop?</p>
               <p>Holmes. In East-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suppose the Prisoner at the Bar took it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. My Lord, one of my Servants catch'd him .</p>
               <p>Ruth - I saw the Prisoner put it into his Bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Ruth - I ask'd him what he took it for, and he told me he took it out to see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whence did he take it?</p>
               <p>Ruth - Out of the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Compter shut?</p>
               <p>Ruth - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What else?</p>
               <p>Ruth - Why he took it to make him a pair of Breeches.</p>

            (to the Prisoner) Would you ask the Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it in my Hand upon the Compter. She came up and said , what are you doing, you are about to put that up. No, says I, Ruth, I am not. Upon that I took the Stick I had there and went home. The Maid sent for me at Night. I did not know what it was for, I said, I would go. I have been up and down there these 20 Years. They never found I had any Thing in the World, nor wrong'd them of a Farthing .</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Body to speak to your Character ?</p>
               <p>Holmes . I have known this Man 22 Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, except in this particular Fact, what Character does he bear? Did you ever hear that he had been guilty of any Thing of this Sort.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I have entrusted him with 100 l. worth of Things.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Reason to suspect his taking any other of your Goods?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No. my Lord.</p>

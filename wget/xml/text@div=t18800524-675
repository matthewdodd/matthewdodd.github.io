                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Pettit and Co., wine and spirit merchants, 71, High Street, Borough—the business was purchased about five years ago—the prisoner has been in our employment since that time—for the last 18 months he has been in a higher capacity than previously—his duties were to call on customers to solicit orders, to collect account, to pay the money or cheque to the cashier next morning after he has received it—he had never been authorised to sign the name of our firm on Friday, 7th May, my cashier pointed out to me several over due accounts—one was that of Mr. Downton—the prisoner was present—the cashier said, "Mr. Downton has lost a deal of money lately"—the prisoner said, "Brock's, the firework people, owe him a deal of money, but the account will be paid almost immediately"—I called at Downton'i that same evening; I had a conversation with him—on the Saturday I went to my place of business about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was standing at the door—he asked to speak to me—he said, "I understand you hart been to Mr. Downton's; I hope you will have mercy on me," and he confessed to having taken several sums; he gave me a list—I never received this cheque from the prisoner—I never authorised him to sign the endorsement.

Coleman the same day, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Stone—I do not expect to make the bankers pay the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of the endorsement—the prisoner confessed he did not intend to pay the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was after he was indicted—he said he should not have paid that money of Keym's unless he was found out—he did not say he intended to put it to Downton's account—he did not bring the money the next day—I do not see that I am the better off for his bringing it—I simply wish to lay the facts before you for the law to take its course—the prisoner does not admit the forgery, and I simply say it is a forgery—I do not want him punished separately for that—I do not know that he intended to apply the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in covering previous defalcations—if he had not been found out he would have kept the money—his bringing it back was possibly a purchase of my leniency—that is my idea—he said that he intended to apply the moneys received from Reym to cover other</p>

               <p>moneys that he embezzled from other persona—I had not suggested that according as the money was brought to me I would consider his sentence—I never asked him to bring in moneys and I would consider his case more leniently—I do not know what his motive might have been—I did not suggest to his wife that the more money was restored the more lenient I would be—that suggestion in no way emanated from me—he was very much affected when he stated that he had robbed me—he said it was entirely owing to betting; that it had been going on for more than a year, and that he had gone on in the hope of recovering himself—bis wife appeared affected too—I saw her afterwards—he has been in custody since 10th May—when I discovered the defalcations I immediately went out statements to all the customers that he called upon—I have no knowledge that he intended to pay the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at all—I believe he changed the cheque on purpose to keep the money for himself—I had not seen my cashier when I saw the prisoner waiting for me.</p>

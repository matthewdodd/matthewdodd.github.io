                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Whitbourne's employment. On 2d Feb., about twenty minutes before five in the morning, I saw the prisoner come across the yard with a sack on his shoulder—he went to the warehouse where the meal was kept, opened the door and walked in, and when he came out he had a quantity of it in a sack on his shoulder—he carried it out of the yard, and pitched it down against the gate-post—I was going after him, when he turned back, and met me—I said, "What have you done with that sack that I saw you have on your back just now?"—he did not answer—I asked him several times, and at last he said, "It is down there"—I said, "Where is down there, you must show me"—he then showed me the sack—I asked what he was going to do with it, and said, "I suppose you were going to carry it home"—he said he was, and begged me not to say anything to my master about it-in consequence of some suspicion I had put two pieces of paper among the meal—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

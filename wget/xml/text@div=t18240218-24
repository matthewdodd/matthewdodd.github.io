I left town on the 4th of November last; before that I locked up several valuable articles in different wardrobes on the second floor of my house. I came to town in December, and saw all the property safe on the 13th of December, where I had placed it. Some repairs were to be done in the breakfast-room, in which part of the articles were; the others were in a room adjoining, and all were under lock and key. My jewell-case was in a third room, in which no repairs whatever were going on; the jewel-case contained a pearl necklace. The prisoners were at work at the house - they had the key of the two rooms, but not of the third. I left two female servants in care of the house; the dirk was in one of the wardrobes in the breakfast room, and my clothes were in another wardrobe in the same room - the wardrobes have a drawer in the centre for papers; these two centre drawers have better locks than the doors; my snuff-box was in the upper division of the same wardrobe as the dirk - the lace and ladies clothes were, I believe, in the bed-room. I employed Mr. Hudson, a builder of respectability to do the repairs. I left town on the 18th of December - returned on the 15th of January, and on Saturday, the 17th, I had occasion to unlock my writing-desk, and found the key go stiff. I unlocked the desk, but could not relock it, but had no suspicion. I took no more notice of it on that day, but on Sunday the 18th, in consequence of information, I tried the lower part of the wardrobe, where the dirk was, but could not open the lock, I then tried the upper part, in which the snuff-box was, opened it, and missed the snuff-box; and hearing that goods to a considerable amount were missing, I sent for an officer, and on further search, found the jewel-case had been forced; the lock was a patent one, and the depredators being unable to force it, had wrenched the lid off; various articles of jewellery were missing, among which was a necklace of seventy-eight large pearls, with a diamond clasp in the centre - the centre diamond was a large, and a remarkable one, yellow, and set in gold; there were fourteen other diamonds in it. I also lost an amethyst and topaz head ornament, a pair of ear-rings, of amethyst and pearl - that is all I missed from the jewel-case. On examining the drawers in the sleeping-room, we found they had been opened, and many of the locks injured; (there were twenty-six locks in all opened.) I then went to the wardrobe, and opened the place were the dirk was, and missed that. I opened the place by force - the lock was immediately taken off, and the bolt had been sprung, by the application of a false key, and could not be opened again, and to that I ascribe the safety of a number of valuable articles which still remained there. I went to the other wardrobe in the same room, and missed a blue dress-coat and from the appearance of the drawer, I am certain other things were taken. I found a remnant of lace severed from the rest of a large piece in the bed-room. I missed a coronation gold medal, two other snuff-boxes, one tortoiseshell and gold, and the other a remarkable tortoiseshell, with a Scotch pebble on the top of it; and next day, in looking over another part of the room, I found the medal and snuffboxes in the drawing-room in a china dish. The value of all that I lost was 7 or 800 l. I have recovered the pearls since. I have received the dirk from Inderwing.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Macqueen. I was left in the house when he went from town - the three prisoners were employed to paint the breakfast-room, on the ground floor; it looks into Park-lane, and there was a little job in the bedroom - they had nothing to do higher up in the house than that bed-room. One day while they were there, (it was three or four days after they came, or more than that) I went up the back stair-case, to go into the back drawing-room, and found some resistance behind the door - they had no business in that room. I opened the door a little, and somebody pushed it back. I was frightened, and ran away. I went up and mentioned it to Joseph Thompson, and asked him to come down into the drawing-room, and as we came down we met his brother James - he had come up a fight of stairs higher than the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180015"></xptr>drawing-room - he said he had been into the room by mistake, to look for a crack. I said the crack was in the dining-room, and not there; a young man came to the house once or twice afterwards, and one day, I saw an old man in the house; he asked me which way he should go out. I told him to go out at the front door, and soon afterwards I went up to let my aunt out, and found the door open. I went up to one of the prisoners. I think (Joseph), and asked him who it was that went out - they said their master or governor, or something. I took no notice of any thing else, till master came to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. - Q. Who else was at work there - A. Mr. Stubbings and his two sons, and two carpenters, while master was away.</p>

            . I am nephew to Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, Wardour-street. (Looking at the dirk.) On the 18th of December, I took a dirk in pawn exactly resembling this of the prisoner William, for 1 l. 1 s. The duplicate of it was lost; and on the 9th of January he applied for the form of an affidavit of the loss of a duplicate, which I furnished him with. The affidavit was afterwards brought to me by one of the other two prisoners, but I do not know which. I saw William sign the affidavit. The one who brought the affidavit paid me the money, and redeemed the dirk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You attended to him yourself - A. Partly; I have known him several years, and am certain of him - he brought it in the day time - he came into the boxes. I am not certain of the value of it, but should fancy that I got a good price if I sold it for two guineas, as a fancy article in trade; it might cost ten guineas to make it - I never saw such a thing before. He came for an affidavit on the 9th of January, alone. It is usual to make an affidavit when a duplicate is lost - I produce it: it is sworn before Mr. Conant; one of the other prisoners redeemed it. I have a counter-part of the duplicate.

            . I live at No. 23, Jermyn-street. I bought this dirk about a month ago - the prisoners James and Joseph were together when I bought it. It was on a Monday, about three weeks before I went to Bow-street, about twelve o'clock - I gave them 30 s. for it; one of them had been to my shop and bought a travelling cap, and before he left, asked if I bought anything in the fancy way; he said he had a Scotch dirk, that he bought at the time he was in Scotland, and was of no use to him now, and three or four days afterwards he brought it; I gave 30 s. for it, and sold it to a person who came from Norwich, for 2 l, on the same day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have the goodness to tell me the day of the month - A. It was about three weeks before I went to Bow-street, which was last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>MR. MACQUEEN. This is my dirk; the chasing and binding have been taken off - it is an old family one; in 1816, I sent it to Edinburgh to have it ornamented - I paid for the ornaments and a pair of buttons, 39 l. odd. I can conscientiously swear that it is worth five guineas. I believe if I went to buy one, I should he asked five guineas for a common one, without the carmagoran ornaments.</p>

             since that; he gave me one which I destroyed. I saw Joseph with a carved tortoiseshell snuff-box in his possession; (looking at one,) I know this to be it by the coat-of-arms inside it; I went with him when he had it as far as Vinegar-yard, and he went into a Jew's shop - I saw him next day, and he told me he had sold the snuffbox for 30 s. I heard James mention once in a public-house, that he had sold a chain or necklace in King-street, and passed himself for a jeweller, but he did not say which King-street, or the person's name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you in employment - A. I work with my father. I have had situations at different times; I live by trade, but have been with my father for many months. I had the coat in my possession about five minutes. I looked at it, and noticed its curions make. I saw it again at Bow-street, about three weeks after; there was a warrant issued for me; I was in custody from Saturday till Monday morning, and then gave this account to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have worked at your trade, and got your living honestly for the last six months - A. Yes. I have known the prisoners three months; not more than four. The conversation about the necklace was at the Fleece, public-house, Windmill-street - nobody but myself was present with them. I mentioned it to nobody till I was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You was in custody a whole day before you made a disclosure, why not make it immediately you were taken - A. I thought it best not to make it till I was before the Magistrate. I told all I knew at the first examination. I never was at Mr. Macqueen's house, nor did I know that they were at work there.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Carnegie, No. 57, King-street, Soho, a refiner and dealer in stones. I saw the prisoner James at our shop with a pearl necklace, with a diamond snap; I did not have it in my hand. The pearls were about the size of a cherry-stone; (looking at some,) they were about this size; the snap had a good many diamonds in it. I saw Mr. Carnegie take them out; there were several; I do not know what he did with them - they were weighed; he sold them to Mr. Carnegie: I left the place before the money was paid - he was to give him 3 l. per carat. I do not know what they weighed.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the gold they were set in - A. I do not know. I saw the pearls afterwards in Mr. Carnegie's possession - I do not know what became of them. Mr. Carnegie has a crucible.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is generally warm - A. No. We put the gold together, and melt it in a week or a month; this gold was melted in a lot, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was - A. Not that identical gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this melted within two hours - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Within twelve - A. I cannot say. I do not know what the pearls are worth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was anybody present but you and your honest master - A. No. My master was apprehended and taken to Bow-street. The pearls were brought to us in the form of a necklace, in the evening, after dark. I think the prisoner separated them. I had seen him once or twice before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before that had he been at your shop - A. Perhaps a month before; it was only James; he brought some hits of gold, and old jewellery. I do not know what sort.</p>

            . I live at No. 57, King-street, Soho, and am a dealer in gold and silver. I buy diamonds and pearls, and anything in the jewellery way - I melt gold and part a little, but do not refine. I have been in the house about twenty-two years. The prisoner James has been to my house three times as well as I can recollect; he always said he bought the things which he came to sell - he has brought in little his of gold and silver, and a pair of broken ear-rings - I bought a pearl necklace with a diamond snap of him; the snap contained better than three carats of diamonds; the center one was larger than the rest, and a very discoloured, a very dark one. I took them all at 3 l. a carat. I paid him for the gold they were set in, and melted it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you melt it - A. It might be eight days; I bought them on the 26th of December. I may have melted them within four days after, on perhaps a fortnight; he asked 2 s. each, for the pearls, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the lowest value of them - A. I cannot say, for I never had to do with such large ones - we have them at 1 d. and 2 s. each. I have bought some at 4 s. 6 d. and 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that they were worth 15 s. each - A. When they were new they might; I should think the fair trading price now would be 15 s. each. There were seventy-eight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave 2 s. each for them - A. Yes; but I did not set the price; he shewed me an amethyst center of a brooch or necklace, but I did not buy it, and I think he shewed me something of a painting. I cleaned the diamonds, and put them into my diamond boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them - A. The officer has the largest ones mixed with my own; the small ones are sold.</p>
               <p>Q. For how much per carat - A. Five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not so valuable as the large ones - A. Yes; for the large ones were discoloured.</p>
               <p>Q. When this matter was talked about what was done with the pearls - A. My wife took them to her mother's at Westminster, and afterwards sent the servant to fetch them - they were brought back to my house, and given up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you ever tried here - A. Never. The moment the solicitor for the prosecution came to me I acknowledged that I had bought them.</p>

James Thomson gave me a bunch of keys, a bow, and three glass feathers, and told me to give them to Mr. Beer, who keeps a book-shop in Little Windmill-street; (looking at the keys.) these are what he gave me.

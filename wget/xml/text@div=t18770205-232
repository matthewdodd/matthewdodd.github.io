I keep the Royal Oak public-house, South Woolwich—on the night of 16th January, I was at the bottom of the Minories with my brother-in-law, Bostelman, who had a dog—some one struck the dog, and my brother-in-law went up and asked him the reason—the prisoner said "For two pins I would serve you the same"—they then struggled together, and the prisoner threw Bostelman on the pavement-Bostelman said "James, my leg is broken"—the prisoner also kicked Bostelman whilst he was on the ground—I caught hold of the prisoner; we struggled; he pinned me, and then hit me over the head, and knocked me on the ground—I got up, and he ran away—I have a wound on my head; he hit me with a stick—I followed him as well as I could—he went into a baker's shop where I next saw him with a constable, and gave him into custody.</p>

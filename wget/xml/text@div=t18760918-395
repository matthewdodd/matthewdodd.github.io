               <p>Gardeus—on Friday, 21st July, about 1.15 a.m., the prisoner said she meant to pay me for tearing her cloak—I said "I did not tear your cloak," and laughed—she said a second time "I mean to pay you"—I said she was not able, and walked away—she said "What do you say?" and immediately stabbed me in the eye with a penknife; I felt a very sharp pain in the eye, and I felt that I was blind directly—I saw the prisoner put her hand in her pocket and take out the penknife; it was open—after striking me, she said "Now take it out of me!"—I held her two hands for nearly ten minutes, till a policeman came up—my eye bled very much—they said at the station it was only a slight cut, but when I wiped my eye, some of the eye-ball came out on my handkerchief—I was taken to the hospital; I have not been able to see out of that eye since, and the other eye is affected—I can't say how long I was in the hospital—I discharged myself on account of my mother being without a home—I went before the Magistrate the morning after I came out of the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. and M.R.C.S. at Kensington. On the morning of 21st July, I was called to Vine Street station, and examined the prosecutrix—I found an incised wound in the eye-ball and a cut over the forehead—the cut across the eye-ball was about one-eighth of an inch in extent—some sharp instrument must have been used, a penknife would do it—the wound has subsequently healed, but the sight has gone—the other eye is suffering from sympathy, but I think it is rather better than when I last saw her"; the danger would be from inflammation.</p>

I was on duty at Vine Street station when the prisoner was brought in—I took the charge against her—after Mr. Hemsley had seen the prosecutrix, I went to the prisoner and said "Hawkins, the doctor says the girl will lose the sight of her eye, and I am going to send her to St. George's Hospital"—she said "I am b——glad to hear it; I hope I shall live to see her stone blind, walking about the streets of London with a dog leading her"—she had had a little drink, but was not drank by any means.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She said nothing about a knife at that time—she simply charged you with striking her—no knife was found on her.</p>

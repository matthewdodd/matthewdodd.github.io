On the 17th of March last, I lost a coat, a shirt, and a table cloth; I lost them from my house on Sunday night, I put them in my box, and the next day they were gone; the prisoner she lived next room to me. I found the property at a pawnbroker's, the 18th of March, and that led me to suspect the prisoner. The things are here.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I took in these things, on the 17th of March, a coat, a shirt, and a table cloth; I took them in of the prisoner at the bar; the other young man, who was in the shop, first looked at the coat, I was by, she then offered me a shirt, and I took them both together, after he had offered money that she would not take, he said it was a coarse cloth, she said it could not be so, for the man that made them would not make them of a coarse cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tribeck. Are you the master of of this shop? - I am the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You always said that you knew who it was brought these things to be pawned? - I always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did the prisoner at any time come to your shop with a Mrs. Hill and with Sullivan? - They did come, I believe, the day after the things were missed, the morning after.</p>
               <p>Q. You always said that you was sure it was the prisoner at the bar? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master's name? - Windsor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not sometimes angry with you for making a mistake about the business of the shop? - No, sir, not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that was the woman that pawned the goods? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master did not swear to you and was angry, and did not say, you are always making mistakes? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner at the bar in the shop, before you said it was the woman that pawned the goods? - I said it directly she came into the shop, the instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master there? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you recollect the prisoner? how was she dressed when she came? - I knew her person perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she in the shop? - She was in the shop twice, she took the things away once, and returned with them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your master? - He is at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he never applied to to come? - He never was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300122"></xptr>Q. He knows of this transaction, does not he? - He does.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you never seen this woman before? - I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Where? - In Fetter-lane, I lived there two years and upwards, I had frequently seen her there.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the day, what hour did she bring in these things? - I cannot recollect, I believe it was between two and six.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to her character.</p>

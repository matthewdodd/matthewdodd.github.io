               <p>Could you swear to that half guinea as seeing it in your possession that night? - I swear to this halfpenny remarkably, I had it in my hand an hour one night, and it was put into the bason among the half-pence; the bedchamber was on the ground floor, it was a large sash, I found it wide open in the morning, the prisoner had left my house then, the last word I spoke to him was on the Saturday night, I said, John, go to bed, because somebody must be up in the morning; he must get in at the window, otherwise he must be concealed under the bed, one way or the other; there were the marks of feet in the yard, and the mark of a foot on the chair.</p>

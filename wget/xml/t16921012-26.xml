Mary Dyer, adding that he was not willing to give the Court any further trouble as to that; and that he went into Ireland, about Michaelmas 1686. and therefore it could not be supposed that he should Marry the first Wife Bredy; this he strived to affect the Court withal by some Witnesses he called on his side, who were not Sworn, who gave account of it was plainly proved as to the Marriage of the first was plainly proved as to the Marriage of the first Wife; so after a very long Hearing, the Prisoner was found <rs id="t16921012-26-verdict130" type="verdictDescription">

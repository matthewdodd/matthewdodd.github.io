                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer of 78, Long-alley, Worship-street—on 28th January the prisoners came, and Perry asked me if I bought old furniture, as his mother had some old chairs in a cellar which she did not want—I asked him what he wanted for them—he said, "Four shillings"—the back was off one of the chairs, but he said that he could bring it to me if I bought them—he asked Murray if he should take 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murray then asked me if I would give 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6d—I said, "No," and they went away a little way and came back—Perry then said to Murray, "Shall we take 4s?" Murray said, "Yes, we may as well take four," and I bought them—next day Perry came alone, and on the day after that, January 30th, they both came, and Murray said, "What did you give him for those three chairs last night?" alluding to three which Perry had brought the day before, and which I had let him have 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, and was to let him have more if it turned out that his mother had really sent him—I said, "I gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but what made you run away, Perry, when you got the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because you were to show</p>

               <p>me where your mother lived?"—he said, "I will go with you now and show you where my mother lives"—they both went part of the way with me, and Murray said, "You can go and show him where your mother lives; I have no occasion to go with you"—he took me into a place where there was hardly an article of furniture, but his mother did not live there, only an old woman and a girl—he ran up the stairs and got ahead of me—I went and told the police-sergeant.</p>

On 30th January I took Murray in London-wall—I told him that I took him for being concerned with another in selling some chairs—he said, "Very well, I will go to the station with you"—he said at the station, "Why do not you go and apprehend Perry? I do not think I ought to be blamed for all; if you do not know where he is, I will show you"—he then went with me to Mr. Keaney's house, 7, Half-moon-alley, and said, "If you go up-stairs to the top you will find Perry there"—I went up, but Perry was not there—I told Murray so—(I had left him in charge of another constable at the door)—when we got to the station he said, "Well, I will tell you as far as I know; I went with Perry to sell some chairs in Long-alley, and we took them from Mrs. King's; I had nothing to do with stealing them.</p>

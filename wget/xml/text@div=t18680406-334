I keep the Rose and Crown, Wentworth Street, Whitechapel—about three weeks before Christmas, the prisoner and two women came in, and one of the women asked for a pot of beer, which came to fourpence—she gave me a bad florin—I told her it was bad, and she said, "This woman gave it to me," pointing to the prisoner—they said that if I would not lock them up, they would pay me that night—I put the florin on one side and lost it—at the latter end of Christmas week, the prisoner came again for half-a-pint of beer, and gave me a bad sixpence—I told her it was bad, and that if she came again I should lock her up—I kept it upstairs—I recognized her, but said nothing about paying for the beer she had had three weeks before—she came again on 24th February for half-a-pint of beer—I recognized her as soon as she came in—she gave me a bad shilling—I said, "You know this is a bad one, and it is not the first, nor yet the second one you have given me"—she said she did not know it was bad; she got it on Saturday night—I gave her in charge, with the shilling and sixpence.</p>

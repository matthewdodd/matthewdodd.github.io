On the 24th of July, in the afternoon, I found she was in liquor; from information of my daughter I watched her, she was in the kitchen; I observed her stooping by a pail in the sink; I observed her stooping by a pail in the sink; I observed something red on her stocking; the pail was covered over with a tin cann; I found, underneath, a bottle with a piece broken out of the side; there was some remains of cherry brandy in it; I asked her what she had been doing; she said nothing at all; she said one of the children had broken the bottle in the morning; I told her to go about her business, she had robbed me long enough; she packed up her things and brought down one bundle, she asked me if I chose to look at them; I told her no, to get out of the house, that was all I wanted.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200056"></xptr>She came back again and went up stairs: I saw her afterwards go out with two large bundles; she was afterwards brought back by Mr. Bell, with the Bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was she brought back - A. In the course of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that belonged to you - A. Yes, a sheet, a pair of stays, a sampler of the little girl, some part of a bed furniture, and a curtain; as to the sheet I am sure it is my property.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. These things we have understood from my learned friend were found at one time; when they were taken it is impossible to know, they might be taken at different times for what you know - A. They might; she had lived with me nine months, and she had not done any thing amiss before as I know of, excepting I detected her in liquor two or three times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have a sister, have not you - A. Yes; she is in the country now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These things that he accuses me of is his property. His daughter took six napkins; she said she would return the value of them; she gave me the sheet and the curtain; I said Betsey, I would rather have my own, she said she could not give me my own. When I was going away I said sir, will you be so kind to examine these things for fear he should say after I was gone I had got things that were not my own; I asked him three times to examine them; he would not.</p>

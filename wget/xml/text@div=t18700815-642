I am a grocer and wine merchant, at 62, Portman Square—I knew the prisoner by the name of West—she had been a customer of mine two or three years—I have known, her as Mrs. Lewis for sometime—I supplied goods for the lodging-houses she kept at 12, Portman Street, and 70, Welbeck Street—she was indebted to me in the beginning of the present year in about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was unable to get the money, and I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against her and her husband;</p>

               <p>hat was done, and a judgment was obtained—on 15th April an arrange<lb></lb>ment was entered into with Mrs. Lewis and her husband by which 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week was to be paid to me—two sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were paid, and then there was an irregularity in the payments—a sum of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid off altogether—I made many communications to the prisoner throughout the time the payments should have been made, and were being made—I had interviews with her—I told her I should press my judgment unless she made up the difference—she called at my shop about 27th May, gave me a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked if I would take an acceptance if a lady would give her one—she named Mrs. Saunders, who, she said, was living with her in Welheck Street, at that time, but she resided at Torquay when at home with her mother, and that she had a banking account at Messrs. Childs'—I said I would give her an answer when I had made inquiries at the bankers'—she said that the lady knew her; that she had explained that she was hard up, and owed me an account which was due, that I had threatened proceedings, and that the lady had promised to give her a bill if I would accept it at pay<lb></lb>ment—I made inquiries—I was satisfied, and accepted the bill—I drew out a bill for acceptance and gave it to the prisoner—I received these two letters, marked "A" and "B," from the prisoner—they are in her writing—I have seen her write frequently (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "70, Welbeck Street, Friday morning. Dear Sir,—When I got home Mrs. Saunders was out, and did not return till past six this evening, and when I named to her that you would have to forward the bill to her bankers, she objected to it, but pro<lb></lb>posed another plan, which I will show you in the morning, E.

Dear Sir,—Can you do the bill; the lady is going out to lunch, and I shall be glad to get it clear before she goes; I have sent a bill if you will draw it, and send it back by bearer, to accept, E. West")—This is the bill I drew—I saw the prisoner after the first letter was sent, either the same evening or the next morning—the wording of that letter refers to a misunderstanding about the bill being presented it the bankers'—Mrs. Lewis understood that I should present it at the bankers', and she stated that Mrs. Saunders objected to that, and I was to accept the bill and present it at Welbeck Street; and I informed her that the bill would be presented at Welbeck Street by my own bankers—after I had drawn up the bill I sent it to the prisoner by a messenger, and it was endorsed by the prisoner in the name of West, and by her husband—I asked her why she did that, and she informed me that Mrs. Saunders did not know she was married—I knew she carried on her business as West, and she endorsed it as West—she brought the bill to me in the state it is now—(<hi rend="italic">The bill was dated May</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">drawn by Laura Mary Saunders</hi>, 70, <hi rend="italic">Welbeck Street, payable to Mrs. West, or order, for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">one month after date, and endorsed James Lewis and Ellen West</hi>)—I received information respecting the bill from Mrs. Saunders—I went to her, and in consequence of the communica<lb></lb>tion I received I took proceedings against the prisoner for forgery—I saw the prisoner, and spoke to her on the subject of the forgery, the same day that I heard from Mrs. Saundors that she had not signed it—I did not tell the prisoner that I knew it to be a forgery, but I asked her if the signature was given as Mrs. Saunders', and she said "Yes"—I told her I suspected that it was not, and I should take it to Childs'—she said "Don't take it down to Childs', because I signed the bill, and I forged my husband's name at the back of it"</p>

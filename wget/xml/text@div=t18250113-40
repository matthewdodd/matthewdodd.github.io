            . I am one of the City patrol. On the 16th of December I saw a cart going down the Minories, and two persons following it - I went after it to East Smithfield - I then missed the cart, and the persons who were following. I turned round, and saw the prisoner with this basket on his shoulder, which he said some man gave him to carry to a Mr. Davis - I asked him if he had a bill of parcels - he said No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A person came to me, and asked me to carry it to the Four Awls, public-house, Four Awls-court, and the man took my hat - the witness then stopped me, and asked me who I was carrying it for; I pointed to the man, but he took me to the Compter directly - Witness. I do not recollect his pointing to any man: there were five or six persons round him. He used to drive the Woodford coach.</p>

            . I am carman to Thomas Grace and Joseph Freeman - they are white lead manufacturers. I was sent with some oil from their premises to Lower East Smithfield; I got there about five o'clock. I had ten bottles of oil and two of turpentine - I had seen them all right at the top of the Minories; when I got to East Smithfield one of them was gone.</p>

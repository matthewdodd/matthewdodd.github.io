On the 27th of February as I was coming from Old Burlington-street, to my lodgings in Marybone-street, between twelve and one at night; I went down Wimpole-street; the prisoner and other men followed me; when I came to Queen Ann-street, two of them went down Queen-Ann-street to the right; when I got down almost to the bottom of <placeName id="t17730626-33-crimeloc180">Wimpole-street</placeName>

The watch came up that moment; I told the watchman I was robbed, and described the man; he had a blue great coat, a coloured silk handkerchief about his neck, and a little hat slapped before; he went after him; I told him they ran up Wimpole-street.</p>

            . I was sitting in my box at the head of Welbeck-street; I heard the other watchman ring his rattle, and call out stop thief; I ran down the street towards the rattle; the prisoner ran by me on the other side of the street; I pursued him and ran him into Little-Mill-hill-meuse, at the head of Welbeck-street; when I saw him in the Meuse, then I rung my rattle, and cried out stop thief; he got up in a dark corner and set himself down; I followed him and took him; by this time my brother watchman came to me; we took him to the watch-house; when we had got him to the watch-house they told me a gentlewoman was robbed; we went and brought the gentlewoman up with us from her lodging, and she swore to the man immediately.</p>

As I was walking backwards and forwards in Welbeck-street, I heard the child cry thieves and murder; I put the child into his lodgings; then I went to his mother; I found her just at the end of Wimpole-street, turning to Great Marybone-street, which runs across the end of Wimpole-street; she said she had been robbed of seven-pence, and described the prisoner to me. I went and brought her to the watch-house when the prisoner was taken.</p>

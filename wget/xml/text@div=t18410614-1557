                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and am in the employ of Mr. White, a newsvender, in Devereaux-court, Temple. About a quarter to eight o'clock on the morning of the 31st of May, I was in Bouverie I street, and saw the prisoners in company—I saw Watson walk into No. 4—Cemble waited outside—an old lady answered Watson, and he said, "Thank you"—the prisoners then walked four or five doors lower down—they went to No. 9—Cemble went to No. 9 1/2, and waited on the steps of the door—Watson went in—he came out in about two minutes, and spoke to Cemble, and then went in again, when he came out the second time with something under his coat—he spoke to Cemble again, and ran up the street—Cemble came to me and asked me which was die way to the Tem-ple—It hen went to a policeman, and went with him after Watson—he was stopped in Johnson's-court, and this time-piece found on him—while he was being taken, I saw Cemble in Fleet-street—I pointed him out to the policeman—I went to the station in ten minutes—I saw Cemble there on the Wednesday after—he is the same person who was with Watson, and talking to him.</p>

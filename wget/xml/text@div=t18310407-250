            , a carrier, brought this trunk to my house, directed for Mr. Henry Turner, to be left at the Bell and Crown, public-house, Hoxton, until called for - on the Saturday morning the prisoner came and brought this note, (read) -</p>
               <p>Mr. Turner will thank the landlord of the Bell and Crown to let the bearer have the box left by the Hoxton carrier - I consider him very neglectful in not leaving it at my house yesterday, as the young man told me it would be delivered by one o'clock yesterday.</p>
               <p>Bath-street, March 24, 1831.</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Walker, Bell and Crown, Kingsland-road. I said I thought it very strange, as two persons had been for it before, I would go and get the carrier - I went and got an officer, and when I came back the prisoner was gone; I saw him again in company with the officer - I let him have the trunk, and charged him 5s. 3d. for it; he said he was going to take it to the corner of the mad-house, but he wished us to go with him - I went on with him and the officer: as we were going on I said to the prisoner,"Suppose you don't meet the person you expect at the corner of the mad-house, where are you going to take the trunk?" he said, "I shall take it to No. 22, Bath-street, and ask for 1s.:" there was no man at the corner, and we went to No. 22, Bath-street - they said they knew nothing of the trunk nor the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He never varied in his account of the transaction? A. No - he said the man had given him 5s. 6d. to pay for the trunk; it was a half-crown and three shillings, and I gave him 3d. change; the trunk came on the Thursday; I had two persons apply for it on Friday - the prisoner came on Saturday; it should have been left at Hoxton before it arrived at my house - the prisoner did not state to me, on leaving my house, that he was going to get a bit of steak to have it dressed at the house; he did not return till he was brought back by the officer - I had told the officer a man had come for the box, and I told him to go and take care of it; I understood when the officer went there the prisoner went out, and he went after him - he found him about one hundred yards from the house; I saw him find him - he had no meat with him; I suppose I was about five minutes gone for the officer - I did not leave any one to take care of the prisoner; I said I was going for the carrier - the box was in the house at the time, but I believe the prisoner did not see it; it was before the box had been delivered to him, that I went for the officer - I then delivered him the box, for the purpose of seeing where he would take it; he then said he would not take it unless some one went with him.</p>

            , and the prisoner lived at my house-they lived together, and were in the habit of quarrelling and fighting. On Sunday, the <rs id="t18171203-41-cd214" type="crimeDate">6th of October</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18171203-41-off212 t18171203-41-cd214"></join>, I heard a great noise, and went up and broke their door open-the prisoner stood against it - I saw the deceased leaning on the table with his hand against his left side-the prisoner had a chopper in her hand; the deceased appeared very bad, and could hardly speak - He said Mrs. Cooke had hit him with the hammer; she said," you should let me alone then; "he told her she hit him with the tongs on the side, and on the head with the hammer in two places - She said it served him right, he should have let her alone.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she say whether he struck her - A.She said he struck her on her left arm - He made no answer, he must have heard her; she gave that as a reason for striking him with the tongs - I did not notice her arm - I noticed two places on his head and one on his thigh; I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of them in liquor - A. Both, I believe; it was about ten o'clock - She showed me her arm, but I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONST. I am a constable. I was called in about ten o'clock, and found the deceased sitting in a chair with both his hands pressed to his left side, and bending towards it; the prisoner stood in the room, with her clothes very much deranged, as if from scuffling-his shirt was torn to ribbons; the whole of the room was strewed with pieces of his clothes, and all the glass and crockery about the room, and two panes of glass, were broken. I asked him what had been the matter - He said his wife had been shamefully ill-using him, and had struck him on the head with a hammer until the head of it had flown off, and then she had recourse to the tongs - She went to the opposite side of the room - He said," what, are you hiding the tongs? why do you not give them to him?" - She turned round, and gave them to me; he said they were bent with giving him the blow in the ribs - She denied that, and said they had been bent with her trying to open them with her hand; they were bent-the head of the hammer was in one part of the room, and the handle in the other. The deceased denied giving her any provocation whatever for striking him - He repeatedly observed, "you have done for me at last!" She persisted in saying he did strike her, and pulled her gown up to show me her left arm-there was no mark whatever on it - I particularly observed it. I asked him if he had struck her in the scuffle - He said he had not used any other violence but what was necessary to preserve his life. Whenever he denied using violence she as strongly asserted that he had. I examined the body of the deceased, and observed his ribs were broken, which I considered fatal; the contusion on the side was about half the size of an hen's egg; he told me to take her away - She said, "Tom, you will not let me be locked up, will you?" and then told me it would be of no use to take her, as she knew he would not appear against her. At last he consented to let her remain, and said he would forgive her if she promised not to use him so again; I was going away - He said, "for God's sake don't leave me, or she will murder me;" I asked him why he did not give her in charge if he was afraid of his life? - he made some observations as to her cruelty; she said it served him right, he should not have aggravated her. I took her into custody ten days after, on the Coroner's warrant; her arm was then black all round, as if it had been grasped by a man's hand; it was the same arm that she had shewn me before, and in the same place where she said she was hurt.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say how he hurt his side - A. She said he fell against a box or table; she then said she was going to take the things out of his hand when he was going to strike her, and he said so to. He said she struck him with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030017"></xptr>the tongs while he lay on the ground, and that she knocked him down with a hammer - She denied every assertion that he made.</p>
               <p>Q.Would the head of the hammer have given such a blow as would have laid him on the ground - A. Yes. I saw the deceased after he was dead, but saw little or no appearance of the tremendous bruise which I saw at first on his side. I should not have thought either of them to be in liquor.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell; the deceased was in my employ. On the Tuesday morning after he had received the injury, he came to the workshop, there was a great alteration in his countenance - He held his hand to his left side, and had a great difficulty in standing or speaking. I saw the prisoner the morning that he died, there appeared a large bruise on her left arm, about five inches round, she said the deceased gave it her with the bellows-it appeared to have been a violent bruise. The deceased said he had been fighting with his wife, and his landlady was the cause of it - He appeared unwilling to enter into particulars. On the Wednesday or Thursday after he received the blow he was at very laborious work for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM ERASMUS HARDY. I am clerk of the papers in Newgate. On the 6th of November the prisoner was brought in, I observed her left arm a few days after, it was black nearly from her elbow to the shoulder, it appeared the effect of a severe blow, and not of a grasp; I should have judged that she had received material violence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STREATING re-examined. When I saw the prisoner's arm it appeared to be more likely to be the effect of a blow than a grasp of the hand.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS SPENCER. I am a surgeon, and live at Islington. On the 4th of November I examined the body of the deceased, the seventh and eighth ribs, on the left side, were fractured, one was united-there were no external marks of violence-the contusion had disappeared; there was no appearance of inflammation either external or internal, on that side of the body. No mortification had taken place. From what I saw that would not have occasioned death without some other causes; the fracture would occasion immediate pain, but without immediate danger. I found the right lung had been in a deseased state for months, or even for years-it must have been above a month. This deceased part had been recently attacked with inflammation, and that inflammation had terminated in an abscess on the root of the lungs, and an effusion of a large quantity of blood in the cavity of the chest, which occasions death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that the blood in the cavity of the chest would have occasioned death - A. I cannot judge what occasioned the inflammation; it might have been occasioned by a variety of causes, such as cold or drinking; or the injury might, possibly, indirectly occasion it.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, which was most likely to have caused death - A. I think drinking more likely to have produced it than the injury; but external cold was the most probable cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider it as a matter of serious doubt in your mind whether the blows were the cause of his death - A. I do think other causes as likely; a slight cold, in addition to the deceased state in which he was, would be the most likely to have caused it. From his situation I think he could not have lived long if he had not received an injury. The laborious exercise of his trade would increase his previous indisposition. If had received a fall it might have inflamed his lungs - A cold might inflame them more.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STREATING re-examined. He worked laboriously on the Wednesday, which put him in a violent perspiration, but I do not recollect whether he went out in a perspiration. About six or eight weeks before this he fell down some stairs, and was laid up for six or eight days.</p>

I could not re-place it for less than 1 l. Williams was three weeks in my service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Styles keeps a general tool mart - A. Yes; it is a very extensive warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the open warehouse - A. No; I went in, and asked for a rest - this was placed on another; several were shewn to me. I said I wanted one of great power; this one was not with the others, but stood on a lathe in the shop; there was nothing to conceal it, but it was not were the others were kept; it was shewn to me at last.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not bound over as a witness against Williams - A. He was bound over in bail to appear if a bill should be preferred against him, and if not, to give evidence. I told him I must indict him - he called me all the d - d rascals in the world, and said he had got out of my hands.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Levy. I saw the rest safe about a fortnight before it was lost. I went with him to Styles's; Williams was then in custody - I waited on the opposite side of the way, with the constable, and afterwards went over - my master asked to look at several tools; I saw the rest on a lathe in the middle of the shop, and knew it. Styles said he bought it of Williams (mentioning his name,) for 2 s.; my master could not get one under 1 l. They are often sold without a lathe. It stood by itself; the others were another lathe or two off. He asked my master 12 s. for this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Without a lathe it is of no use for general purposes - A. It cannot be used without a lathe, and is of little use without one, but is valuable as it is difficult to get one to fit; he might have it on hand for years. The foreman attended to us, but Styles was just by; the foreman said to him, "This has been stolen;" he said, "I am sorry for it, I know who I bought it of" - he crossed the shop then, and came and told me the name.</p>

            . I am a constable, and went to Styels's with a warrant. The foreman called Styles, who came - I told him I had a warrant to search his place; he exclaimed against the person who sold it him. Levy was in the shop ten minutes before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You allowed him to go up stairs to dress - A. Yes. The Magistrate permitted him to go at large from time to time. He said Williams told him it was his father's property, and Williams did not deny it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM'S Defence. I asked Styles 2 s. 6 d. for it; he said it was not complete, and gave me 2 s.</p>
               <p>STYLES'S Defence. This is a wicked and unfounded charge. I have been thirty years in business, and conducted it in an upright manner. The prisoner came and said he had an old iron rest which belonged to his father, who was dead, and he had had it twelve years. I said he might bring it, which he did in quarter of an hour. I have people to prove it can be manufactured new for 5 s. I told the prosecutor I was an honester man than ever stood in his shoes - he said, "I'll work you for that, I'll stick to you."</p>

            . I am foreman to Styles. I was present when Williams brought this rest into the shop, and asked Styles 2 s. 6 d. for it. Styles asked if he was sure it was his own; he said it was, that he had it before he was apprenticed, and had it twelve years, and it was his father's, before he died. Styles gave him 2 s. for it; it is old cast iron and not complete without the lathe, and is incomplete as a rest; there is no tye screw to it, which would cost three or four shillings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did it cost to make it - A. About 4 s. 6 d. He brought it between three and four o'clock in the day - it was put on a lathe in the middle of the warehouse, every body must see it; it was the first one I shewed to Levy when he came. I produced the book in where I entered it; when we bought it we did not enter the persons name, as we did not know it till Levi told us. I shewed him several rests, at 8 s. and 10 s. each, they were complete. I asked him 12 s. for this, but then we were to make it complete. I should not have asked him so much but he was a Jew, and has bought things of us before, and I have lost the sale of goods, because I did not ask him a price that would allow beating down. I cannot say what articles he has been for; there is the entry of it in the book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you buy nothing but on Monday, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250044"></xptr>no article is entered on any other day - A. He entered the whole week's purchases under Monday - we bought these on Monday.</p>

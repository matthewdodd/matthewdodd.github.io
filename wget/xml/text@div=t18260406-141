               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had he been in your employ? A. About twelve months - I never gave him, or any of my men leave to take bits of wood as fire-wood - I have heard of men doing it, but it is not allowed - I had nearly a sovereign in my hands belonging to him for the time he had worked - he had told me, two or three weeks before, that his daughter was going to be married, and that he would leave 10s. a week in my hands - I went with the officer to his house - I found there a bit of board, about three inches square, which corresponded with some I had at home - there were other pieces there but none I could swear to; I have the fellow-piece to one of these - I cannot swear to any other.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were offered half a crown for this wood would you not take it? A. No; they were in the same state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060062"></xptr>when on my premises, except this one, which was joined to another - this piece cost me 1s. 2d. a foot - no one was at work there but him.</p>

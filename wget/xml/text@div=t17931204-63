               <p>Q. You are clear the other prisoner was not with her at that time? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had the two shillings did you object to them? - I did not, but I see the shillings were bad when I took them; I put them into the till amongst others because I had not time to detect the defendants at that time, there were no danger of passing them shillings they were so very bad, I could swear to the silver at night when it was taken out of the till. The prisoner Harley went away, and in about a quarter of an hour after the two prisoners came together, and Donahough wished to have a shawl of the pattern that Harley had taken away that day; I shewed the shawls and cut one off, the price was three shillings and nine-pence, Donahough gave me a shilling earnest and told me she would come on Saturday for it, but she came in the course of a quarter of an hour; she had then to pay two shillings and nine-pence, she gave me two counterfeit shillings, one good six-pence, and three pennyworth of halfpence, the same as the other woman had done, I put them into the till among the others, they were all alike, all bad; there were then five shillings bad in the till, two passed that day by Harley and three by Donahough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them so as you could swear to them again? - I did, they went out after that, I would have taken them up then but I suppose there were ten or a dozen customers in the shop; but I was determined to take them up the next time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that money? - At night when Mr. Herd came to take the amount of the till, he had taken out about five or six shillings out of the till, he said, here is a bad shilling, I said if you look further you will find four more, for I put in five to my certain knowledge; he looked and could find but three more, one I concluded had been passed in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end to the first count of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Eliott. They came together the next day to the shop about a quarter before two o'clock as near as I can recollect, they both seemed in haste to be served, Donahough asked for some cloth which Mr. Herd shewed to her; and at the same time Harley asked for some stockings, which I shewed to her; after finding a pair of stockings, she gave me a shilling and was to call for them on Saturday, this one shilling was a counterfeit. Donahough after she had looked at the cloth had two yards and a quarter at fourteen-pence a yard, which came to two shillings and seven-pence halfpenny; when she tendered him three had shillings; I was standing as near to her as Mr. Herd, he objected to them, she took these bad shillings out of her breast not out of her pocket, after we had objected to this silver and told her they were had, she said, they were good; then after some time they both<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040160"></xptr>began to be somewhat frightened, and began trembling; Donahough then pulled a paper out of her pocket, in which she had two half guineas; and I believe, either half a crown, or three shillings good silver, I believe it was three shillings; then Mr. Herd was going to give her change, and he went up stairs for the four shillings, that she had given the day before; he laid them down on the table, and she objected to them, and said, they are bad.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other four shillings which she gave this day? - When we threw them down on the counter, I put all the four shillings together, with the four shillings she gave me. There is one that I can positively distinguish; Mr. Herd then went between them and the door, and told them, that he neither liked them nor their shillings; then they pushed towards the door, and we stopped them; when we stopped them, they had the shillings in their hand; the prisoner Donahough had them. Then I went round to the other side of the counter, and told them, they were the same I had taken of her the day before; Mr. Herd went between them and the door, to stop them from going out; I then told Mr. Herd to go for a constable, then they both went down on their knees, and begged for God's sake to let them go, and they would give us the half guinea, and all the silver they had got besides, for they should be ruined; I then seized Donahough, and seized five shillings out of her hand; she had then got eight.</p>
               <p>Q. In those four shillings taken that day, is there any one that you can swear to? - There is.</p>
               <p>Court. It is of no import, if they are all bad? - One of them, that I took out of her hand, which were all bad, I can swear to, that day I took it of Donahough. When the constable came, he searched Donahough, and found the other three shillings, which I take my oath they had; I gave the money to the constable, he has it now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Who was it took up all the money? - Donahough, I see her take up the whole eight shillings from the counter. On searching her, the constable found no more bad; he found the half guinea, and three good shillings; Harley was searched likewise, and one shilling, and some bad halfpence were found on her.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, you can speak to one shilling, which you received of Donahough that day, if I understand you right, you did not receive any thing of her that day? - Mr. Herd received it, but I was near to him, and saw the money as soon as he had received it, they were paid to Mr. Herd; I swear to one that Mr. Herd received.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Mr. Herd went up stairs, and brought down four bad shillings, which he had taken the day before out of the till? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You put them into the till? - But I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were brought down the second day, and she expressed a surprize, that you should give her the four shillings? - She did not. She said, they were bad.</p>
               <p>Q. She would not take them? - She did take them, and was going away, but we would not let her.</p>
               <p>Q. The first day's money was put into the till with other money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were five shillings put into the till? - There were.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you looked into the till there were only four.</p>
               <p>- HERD sworn.</p>
               <p>I manage the business for Mr. King. I was in the shop the second day, when the prisoners came in. I was standing in the middle of the shop door, they came in both, and accosted me, Master we come to see you every day now; she in the blue cloak, Harley, asked Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040161"></xptr>Elliott for a pair of stockings; but she in the big cloak, Donahough, said, that she was very big with child, and must be served immediately, and she wanted a piece of cloth to make her a shift body, and after shewing her two or three of the cloths, she agreed for one, and I cut her off two yards and a quarter, at fourteen pence a yard, it came to two shillings and eleven pence; while I was folding of it up, I was standing close to Mr. Elliot, I took particular notice, as I had reasons for it, and I saw Harley take out of her bosom a shilling, and give it to Mr. Elliott, and Mr. Elliott looked at me, at the same time and smiled. The other tendered me down three shillings, out of which, I was to give her a penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Harley give that shilling to? - To Mr. Elliott, I took particular notice of this shilling. What Donahough gave me, were all three bad ones; and Mr. Elliott's was a bad one. I had them all four in my hand, and kept looking at them a considerable time; Mr. Elliott gave me the one shilling in my hand, after I had received the three from Donahough; and I went round the counter rather, and told her there were some of these shillings I did not like very well, she said, they are very good shillings upon my soul, they are good ones; I have got no other, I never took a bad shilling in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that they had no other? - Both of them. Donahough said, she had nothing more, except it was a half guinea, I told her then, I would thank her for that; I then went up stairs to bring down four shillings, which our people said, they took of them on Wednesday; I brought them down, and lard them down on the counter before them; Donahough looked at them, and said, Master, I think, I don't like these; I told her, I neither like them nor you, when I spoke these words, she ran to the door, and had got at the first step going down; I stepped after her, and catched her by the arms, and she cried out in great agitation, for God's sake let me alone, for I am ruined; and she would give me the half guinea, and all the silver that she had got; and kept continually crying that for the half hour that they were in our house; I told her, I could nor possibly think of it. Mr. Elliott immediately sent for a constable, he was some time before he came in again. When the constable came, I gave charge to him, and ordered these two women into a private room, to be searched; I was not present.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 14th of November, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoners; and I went to Mr. King's shop; the two prisoners were in the shop, Mr. Herd gave charge of them; they immediately went down on their knees, and begged of him to forgive them, for they were ruined; I took them down into the kitchen, and searched them as far as decency would permit; I searched Harley first, I found in her pocket, two shillings and six-pence in good silver, and some halfpence, and I found no counterfeit money at all; I searched Donahough, and in her pocket I found half a guinea, and three shillings in good silver, and some halfpence; they then went down on their knees again, and begged Mr. Herd would forgive them; Mr. Herd delivered five shillings into my hand, which has been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner Donahough did not make any sort of resistance to your searching her? - She made the most resistance, and the other made none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you had searched her, you found half a guinea in good money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040162"></xptr>and three shillings in good money, and still she resisted you in searching her? - I am sure, I cannot tell the reason, why.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Did you receive of Mr. Elliott, or of Mr. Herd, any shillings? - I think it was Mr. Herd, that gave me the five shillings counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen to Elliott. You said you could take on you to swear to one of the particular shillings taken of Donahough? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know one shilling? - There is a Grat on it, and the head is the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any of the remaining four shillings, that you can swear to, as taken the second day? - No, there is not; this is the same shilling, I can take my oath, it was tendered by Donahough the second day.</p>

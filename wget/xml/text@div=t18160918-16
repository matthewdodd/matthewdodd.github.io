Then he struck me violently on the stomach, which took away my breath, and broke the busk of my stays and he took from me my shawl and handkerchief; he struck me very hard; he struck me twice on my side, once in my stomach, and several times over my head, when I fell to the ground. I can't say how many blows. I had received when I fell; the blow that broke my busk knocked me down, and I could not speak any more; I fell to the ground before he got the shawl; he had not got it, before I got the blow that knocked me down. I am sure he continued striking me after I was down; and as I rose up and ran after him, I saw him throw something away: I had not lost sight of him; I was more enraged with the bows to be after him: and I am sure I did not lose sight of him; and I am sure the person whom I saw run away, was the person who knocked me down, and took my shawl away; I heard a rustling before, as if somebody was going to stop him. I hallooed out stop thief, stop thief, and the watchman replied, I have stopt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him then - A. No. I saw he was stopped when I came up, and I am sure the prisoner is the same man; I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the parish of Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening on Wednesday the 31st of July last - A. Yes; at about half past twelve I was on my watch; I was about to leave my box when I heard the cries of this girl; I immediately repaired to the spot that the sound came from, and I had got one third of the distance up one side of Montague-square, when I met the prisoner running at full speed towards me; I bid him stand, or I would knock him down; he did so, and I collared him immediately; I immediately sprang my rattle for assistance; I gave him in charge of a watchman until I returned from fastening my box, which I had left open. The woman came up immediately after I had taken him; she said, have you got him, or you have got him, and I said, yes, is this the man? and she said, he was. Then I went down to the watchhouse with the prisoner; I did not see any shawl or handkerchief produced; I don't recollect a shawl being brought back. There was nothing found on the prisoner when I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember or not any young woman bringing any shawl to the watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had brought the prisoner - A.It was in the course of the time that the charge was taken; it was while I was given the charge to the watchhouse-keeper; I forget to whom it was given when it was brought; I did not take the custody of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say, she would be well paid for her shawl and her trouble at the Old Bailey - A. I never uttered a word of the sort.</p>

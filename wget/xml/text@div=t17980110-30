             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Robert Harvey: Between four and five o'clock, on the 2d of January, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop with a young man, and asked me for two squares of muslin for cravats, I shewed her them; the prisoner had the same cloak on that she has now, with a white shawl under it, and by the motion of her arms, I had a suspicion of her; she bought two squares of muslin, and the young man gave me 15s.; when the prisoner went away, I went after her, and just as she was going out at the door, about forty feet from the counter, I told Mr. Harvey, in the hearing of the prisoner, that I had a suspicion of her; he desired me to take her up stairs into the drawing-room, and just as she was going upon the first step that separates the shop from the house, I saw her drop two pieces of muslin from under her cloak; as we were going up stairs, I saw another piece, a small quantity, drop from her clothes behind her; and in the drawing-room, she dropped the piece mentioned by Mr. Harvey; she had her hand under her cloak, or somewhere behind her, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you saw four pieces drop? - A. Yes; and then the constable came and found upon her two pieces more, he took them out of her pocket; he has got them, I have got the rest. (Produces them).</p>

               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. A Frenchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure that you observed the motion of the prisoner at the time that you suspected her? -</p>
               <p>Court. There is an end of the capital charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I am satisfied, my Lord.</p>

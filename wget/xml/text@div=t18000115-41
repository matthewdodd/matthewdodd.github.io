               <p>Q. Did you see any sacks in the cart when he set out? - A. No; Jones brought the sacks, and then I called the watch to my assistance; the watchman was within ten yards of me, and no watchman came to my assistance; I got a constable, and gave charge of Jones; he had a hearing on Monday at Hatton-garden, and because I would not swear positively that he had any property about him, he was discharged; a day or two afterwards the prisoner came, and voluntarily surrendered himself up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, from the appearance of the cart, that there were any grains missing? - A. Yes, there were; he came and said he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. I told his brother I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what he said. Were the grains in the cart all your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Ever since the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you buy the grains of? - A.Mr. Tickler.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of grains he received? - A. I know what I must pay for; I am obliged to take all that they bring.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not measured at the time they were delivered to him? - A. No; but I can tell by the look of the cart whether any grains are gone out of the cart or not.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cart is pretty full, the shaking of the cart may throw a little out? - A. Yes; when they have gone a little way over the stones, they sink, and get lower; but if a shovel or a bushel is taken out of the cart, it may be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner delivered himself up voluntarily? - A. Yes; in consequence of my saying I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know Jones is upon bail now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

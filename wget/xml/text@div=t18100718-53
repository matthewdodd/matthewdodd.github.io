On the 9th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner and her child, and a man, came into our shop, and wished to look at some gingham handkerchiefs. I shewed them some; I think they bought two; they were in about a quarter of an hour. On the part where I shewed these pocket handkerchiefs there was about a dozen or fourteen pieces of cotton bed furniture: I shewed them the handkerchiefs upon the cotton bed-furniture. The woman went out first, and she left the man with the child to bring out; the man stopped behind, and asked me to give him something to drink. I did not altogether like the idea of the man asking to drink, having only laid out three shillings, so I walked to the door to look after the woman, the woman was gone half a dozen yards from the door. I observed from the inside of her apron the end of a piece of furniture; I called into the shop to

            ; I just lifted up her apron, I perceived there were two pieces; then James Hayes came. I think that she gave him one piece, and I took the other. He brought her into the shop; she said, it was the first time that she had done the like. I fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What because of the man - A. I do not know. I believe the woman was making towards the liquor-shop. I think the man went in there.</p>

This young gentleman followed me; he said, I had something that was not my property. I said, he might take them. When I was brought before the magistrate he was asked, if he could swear to them; he said, he could not, because there was something cut off them; at the same time he put a mark on them, then he said, he could swear to them.</p>

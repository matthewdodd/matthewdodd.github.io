            . Q. You are an assistant elder in the East India company's warehouse - A. Yes. On the 20th of February I was employed in their warehouse in <placeName id="t18100221-104-crimeloc614">Old Gravel-lane, Ratcliffe Highway</placeName>

At two o'clock, when the prisoner was quitting the warehouse I rubbed him down; I took him by the collar; he said, Oh, Lord, I am done; I took him to the accompting house; he unbuttoned his trowsers and took out the indigo, and gave it into my hands. It has been weighed; it is three pound, worth twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. In the warehouse where he worked was there indigo - A. Entirely. At the time that he was sitting in the counting house he said he had not got any thing for his family without taking that. He had lost his hammer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Stirling said I had got something; I gave it him before I went out of the warehouse. I have seven children; I am half starved; and so is my children; they have not got bread to eat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLOTTE ALSOP</hi>. I live at 5, Providence Place, Limehouse, and am in the service of John Cox—the female prisoner is my brother's wife—I was not present at the marriage, but he brought her home, and I saw this mar<lb></lb>riage certificate, or this piece of paper, which looks like one—I also saw it at the Court of Queen's Bench, when it was put into Mary Cox's hands—I cannot swear that it was the same paper which I saw brought home—Mary Cox was a witness, and I heard her admit that it was true—the name on it is Mary Tonnage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RICE</hi>. I obtained this certificate of the first marriage at st, John's, Bethnal Green—I compared it with the books, which are in Court, and the defendant admitted it before Baron Bramwell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 369). I apprehended Cox on a warrant on 19th August—I read it to her, and she said "I did not know that I was doing any wrong; I am very sorry for it"—she said that she had married in her maiden name, and did not know she was doing wrong—I took Fletcher the next morning at Chigwell, and read the warrant to him—he said "I thought this case was done with; they are only doing it to get money out of me; I have been frequently to Rochester, and they would have known that if they wanted to find me"—he used the words he had got married, and did not know under the circumstances that he was doing wrong.</p>

I am a publican at Chesterfield in Derbyshire—on the night of 31st July, I was in town, and about 11 o'clock was returning home with my stepdaughter—we went into an eating-house in Ship-alley, St. George's in the East, to get some refreshment—the prisoner and another man Game in—he asked my daughter to go with him—she said, "I am going home with my father"—he kept enticing her, and I said, "This won't do, she is going home with me"—he said to the other man, "We will try our best to get her away"—the other man reached over the table and gave me three or four blows on the head—the prisoner had a knife in his hand—</p>

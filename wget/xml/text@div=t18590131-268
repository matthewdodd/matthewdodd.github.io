I am in the employ of Mr. Pritchett, a brush manufacturer—on Saturday, 22d May last, the prisoner came to our place—I did not know him before—he presented this order as coming from Mr. Harding (<hi rend="italic">this was dated 31st May, and signed G. Harding, 15, White-street, Borough</hi>)—I had partly made up the order when Mr. Pritchett came in.</p>

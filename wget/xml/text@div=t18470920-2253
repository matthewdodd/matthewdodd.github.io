On the 27th of Aug., I was called by Mr. Cook, and went with him to No. 3, Smith's-place, Gibraltar-row—we found Bowley sitting there—Mr. Cook pointed her out as the person who had offered the spoons—I asked her if she wanted to say anything about the two spoons that she had offered—she said, "Let me have them, I will take them home to my master"—I said, "Where does he live?"—she said, "No.9, Avilla-road, Regent's-part, and his name Jenkins"—I took her to the station—I came back to the house, and asked Ashberry if her sister had left any duplicates there—she said, "No"—I saw her give something to Mr. Cook—I asked what it was, and he gave me a duplicate for two spoons—I said to Ashberry, "Have you any more?"—she handed me a duplicate for two spoons, pawned on the 1st July—she then said, "I have given all I have got, you may search if you please"—I said, "I will not take you, as you have a family; come before the Magistrate to-morrow morning"—I went to Mr. Jenkin's, and found three more duplicates for spoons pawned at Mr. Attenborough's—I went the next day to Ashberry's, and asked why she was not in attendance before the Magistrate—she said, "I went after my girl that pawned the two tea-spoons.</p>

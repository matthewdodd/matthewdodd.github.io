             sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 9th of December, the prisoner came to me about two o'clock in the morning, and asked me to go with him and drink; I said, I would not: he said, if you will go with me, I'll give you a shilling, but I would not; about a quarter before three, I heard a noise in Bowler's shop, and there was the prisoner with the door wide open, and coming out of the shop with three pieces of park; when he saw me, he chucked them into a tub; I laid hold of him, upon which he said he wanted to case himself; I let him stoop down, and he slipped under my arm, and ran away, but left his hat and shoe behind him; he was found in the morning, and three pieces of pork were found in a manager.</p>

            (To Bowler.) How can you swear to the pork that was found? - A. I can swear to one out of the three, because it has got a scratch on the rind, and is the very same piece I told him to cut a piece off for his supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I got up at four o'clock to go to work, and going down the market, I saw this watchman and a girl; I asked him to go to Drury-lane to have something to drink; he would not, but I went, and when I came back again, I was going to ease myself by the door, and he came and laid hold of me; I went to work till eight o'clock, and when I went to the public-house, they took me; I should not have gone there if I had stole the pork. <rs id="t18020113-61-verdict325" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to the last witness's on the 6th of this month, I went to Mr. Page's shop, I found the prisoner there. I searched the prisoner, going across the road I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190014"></xptr>him putting his hand into his side pocket. I found something against my own, and in searching him I found this silver mug.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Page.) What is the worth of the silver mug. - A. I should not hesitate to give three pounds for this mug to melt, it is very heavy indeed.</p>
               <p>MR. STRONG. I know the mug belongs to my father, I have no doubt of it. I can swear to the mustard spoon, and as to the rest, I am sure they are my father's property, I have seen them often, my father's crest is upon them. I know the mug by the initials upon it.</p>

I found the things in the wash-house after the other servant was gone in the morning, and after I found them, the other servant came back into the house. I put them into another place of the wash-house, and the next day I was going away, and when I came at night I brought them away.</p>

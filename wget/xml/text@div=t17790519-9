On the 27th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was informed that a person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190012"></xptr> who had been in the shop, had taken a piece of cotton off the counter; we were very busy. I said to the young man who was serving, where she was, why do not you follow her? he said, he did not know which way she was gone; a lady, who was in the shop said she was gone up the yard; I went after her, and passed her, and saw the cotton under her cloak; on my passing her, she looked hard at me, and turned back; I did not speak to her, not being willing to make a noise about it; I thought I would let her walk back quietly before me; she went into the shop; she went in at one door and I at another; I met her, and demanded the cloth of her, and she gave it me from under her cloak, and then wished to run away. I secured her, and took her before a magistrate; the cloth (producing it) has my master's private mark upon it; I am sure it is his property.</p>
               <p>Did you observe it on the counter that day? - Not in particular.</p>

               <p>I went to the prosecutor to buy two yards of ribband for my mistress; I had a gown in a bundle I was going to carry to the Mantuamaker; I took up the cotton by mistake, instead of my bundle; I found my mistake, and went back to the shop.</p>
               <p>To Hawley. Was there any bundle of her's left? - No; she said nothing about any such thing; she was kept in the house I believe two hours after she came back.</p>

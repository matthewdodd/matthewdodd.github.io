                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of 3, Coombe's-street, City-road—on 19th April, about nine o'clock, I was passing the Quadrant in Regent-street, when the prisoner accosted me, and said, "Oh, Stanley, thank God you have recovered from your serious illness, I never expected to see you out alive again"—I said, "You are a perfect stranger to me, I do not know you"—he said, "Oh yes you do, you were with our old friend in Oxford-street the other night, shake hands"—I said, "I am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers"—he then said, "Let's come and have a glass"—I said, "I am not going to drink with strangers, you are a perfect stranger to me"—he said, "Oh, now, don't be cross, don't get out of temper"—I said, "Get away from me, don't molest me in this way"—he left me and came back again, and said, "Now look here, I want some money"—I said, "I have no money to give you"—he said, "Give me a half-crown, that will satisfy me to night; if you don't I shall expose your vile and infamous conduct, which will seriously injure you in your occupation"—I said, "Get away from me, don't talk such stuff to me"—he then put his hands in my breast, and said, "You know you are entirely in my hands if you don't give me some money"—I moved away to Piccadilly-circus to look for a constable, but not finding one, I got into a '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi>; the prisoner followed me—I said to the conductor, "This man has been molesting me for some time; I have no wish to be in his company, therefore I shall ride outside if he intends riding inside"—the prisoner said, "Then I shall go outside too"—the conductor said to the prisoner, "Are you prepared to pay your fare?"—he said, "I am"—he paid his fare and got into the '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said, "Old fellow, I shall not part with you until you part with some money"—I said, "I told you I had no money to give you; you must wait until I get home"—he said, "Oh you do mean to act honourably towards me"—when I arrived at the Circus in Oxford-street, I gave him into custody—I had never seen him before, and did not owe him any money—he touched my pocket several times.</p>

            .) Mr. Lewis, look at the Prisoners at the Bar; do you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There were five of them when they robb'd me; I believe them to be two of the Men.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The 22d of July, as I was going home.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence?</p>
               <p>Lewis. From London to Hendon, In <placeName id="t17460903-31-crimeloc119">Hall-Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17460903-31-crimeloc119" type="placeName" value="Hall-Lane"></interp>

               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I turn'd back, and said, what do you want; before I turn'd myself again, there were four of them that struck me; I believe they gave me four or five Strokes before they beat me off the Horse; they took hold of me, and tore my Shirt; one took hold of my Legs, another of my Head, two held my Arms, and carried me into the Field, and there they rifled me; they took from me a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, one Guinea, Half a Guinea, twenty-Shillings in Silver, an Handkerchief, five Pounds of Sugar, two Ounces of Green Tea, a Steel Breeches-Buckle, a Pair of Knee-Buckles of White Metal, and a Pair of Buttons out of my Sleeves. After they had done this, they lifted me about three Poles farther, and with that I begg'd of them my Hat and Wig; I begg'd of them my Wig to cover my Wounds: One of them clapt his Hands to my Throat, and almost strangled me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they mean by carrying you further in the Field?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe they heard somebody coming along the Highway. When they had almost throttled me, I ask'd them of what Service it would be to them to kill me? and one of them tied my Hands, and the other my Legs, and bid me hush: They tied my Hands behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. After they had done that they said, Your Horse is in next Field, and away they went.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The 22d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the Prisoners at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was some Time before I could get myself from being bound, and then I had four Hedges<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030029"></xptr> to go through; I made Leaps, I did not care to go the Road. I went home on Foot, and rais'd all my Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you to say the Prisoners at the Bar committed this Robbery?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Sir Thomas De Veil sent to me, to let me know he had got the Sugar and Tea that they had of me. [The Sugar and Tea was produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, Is that the Sugar and Tea you lost that Night?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was in a Handkerchief; I believe this to be the Sugar; it was all in one Piece, or there might be a Bit laid at the Top to make up Weight; also the Hat is in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the Hat?</p>

               <p>Lewis. Yes, I was a Month before I got to Town.</p>

They sat down, Sir, and drank six Pots of Beer and 5 Pint of Cyder; one of them (which I can't swear to) ask'd me if I wanted any Sugar; I said, No; the Man said that he had bought a Quantity of Sugar for a Shopkeeper in the Country, and said he had this over and above upon his Hands; he said it cost him 10 d. a Pound: I said I could buy it cheaper of my Neighbours, so I gave him 8 d.

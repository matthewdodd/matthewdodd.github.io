            </rs>. He was also indicted upon the Coroner's Inquest, and the Statute of Stabbing. It appear'd by the Witnesses for the Queen, That a Warrant being issu'd against Roberts, it was deliver'd to a Constable, who commanded the Deceas'd to assist him in the Execution; That accordingly they, and the Woman who had taken out the Warrant, went to Bannister's House, where the said Roberts liv'd; and as soon as they came in, Roberts call'd out, and Bannister came with great Rage, threw the Woman down, and drove them all out of the House. That afterwards they went again, and then Bannister call'd for his Sword (which was brought by Roberts) and gave the Deceas'd the Wound as aforesaid. Two of the Witnesses swore, That after that he gave the Sword (or Hanger) into Robert's Hand, and said, I have kill'd one of the Rogues, do you kill another; and that she afterwards flourish'd it, and struck at one of the Constable's Assistants. There were several who heard the Deceas'd say, Bannister had kill'd him; and all of them agreed, that he had neither Sword, Stick, Knife, nor any other Weapon. The Prisoners call'd several Witnesses to disprove the others; some swearing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17130225005"></xptr>Deceas'd had a Stick, others a Knife, and one swore he had both; as also, that he came into the House, and no Warrant was shewn, and that he fell very violently upon Bannister, and cut him with a Knife. He had several to his Behaviour, who gave him a good Character; and one or two who said the contrary of the Deceas'd. He alledg'd for himself, that what he did was in his own Defence, for that the Deceas'd put him Danger of his Life. The Jury having consider'd the Evidence on both sides, found him <rs id="t17130225-28-verdict129" type="verdictDescription">

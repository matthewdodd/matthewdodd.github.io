After which the prisoner and Hall went out. I had pull'd out my pocket-piece and believe they had seen it. I went out again about five or six minutes after them. Going into my own door they stopped me. George Hall put his hand to my eyes and mouth, and swore they would blow my brains out if I resisted. The prisoner took my watch and money out of my pocket. There was a guinea and six shillings in silver, some half pence, and a silver pocket piece.

We saw the prosecutor sitting there by the fire. He pull'd his watch out to wind it up. In pulling out his money he took out this pocket-piece, and throw'd it down. I said to the prisoner, that gentleman will do for us ; he went out of the house, we watch'd him, he came in again with his cap on, then we came in again, and had another pot of beer. We went out and parted with Roberson. The prosecutor came out, we ran over to him, I put my hands round his neck and said if he stirred we would blow his brains out; the prisoner stood right before him, he felt in one pocket and said there was no money in it, then he put his hand into another, and took out a guinea and a pocket-piece. We went away and went round Stepney-fields, then to a house in Whitechapel. there we heard people were after us. Knowing him we were willing to keep out of the way. The next day we went to Stratford. There we heard more of it, that they were after us. Then we sent for one

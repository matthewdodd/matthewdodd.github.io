                  </hi>. I live at 15, Little Newport-street, Leicester-square, and am a tailor—on 27th February, shortly after 12 o'clock, I was in the inclosure of St. James's Park—I had got over the railings to look at some boys who were jumping over a sand-hill—I had some friends with me who said they would go and jump too, and asked me to come—I said, "No"—I stood there, and the prisoner came and stood by me and snatched my watch—I laid hold of him, and said, "You have stolen my watch"—he said, "It is false"—I said, "It is in your hand, I shall give you in custody"—he had his coat sleeves up, and his hand clenched; but I did not see any part of the watch—he snatched his hand away, put it behind him, then brought it back and said, "Now you may search me"—I saw some parties behind me, and one of them stooped right down—I said that</p>

               <p>a constable should search him—he tried to get away, and struck me and another party over my shoulder—he fell into a hole and I on top of him, and held him till the park constable came—it was a silver hunting-watch—I felt it in my pocket five minutes before, but had not seen it since a quarter past 10 in the morning.</p>

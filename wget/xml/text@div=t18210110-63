On Tuesday, 5th of December I left these things locked up, returned on Saturday, and heard they were stolen - I found the place locked as I left it, but some boards taken out. I heard Leake was in the habit of sleeping there.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMSON. I am a constable of Acton. On Friday evening, the 8th of December, I heard the prisoners had offered a saddle for sale - I went out and found them - they were both in company - I asked how they came by it. Leake said he found it, as he came from Uxbridge, in the middle of the road, and Meads said he saw him pick it up, and he promised him he should share in the profits of what he sold it for. I examined the saddle, found it quite clean and dry - It was a dirty night. I suspected them and took them in custody - I found the bridle on Meads. I took them before the magistrate, I have discovered that they were in distress.</p>

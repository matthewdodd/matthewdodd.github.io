            . My father is proprietor of the Royalty Theatre. The prisoner was engaged to work the gas works, belonging to the theatre - he was to find his own tools, such as stocks and dyes, in case of any accident occurring to the pipes - I did not see him bring them, but I heard him acknowledge he had brought them on the 4th or 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the poor man been employed in the gas works for some time? A. I do not know - he said, the stocks and dyes were his own property, and he brought them there for his own use - he said, his brother was remaining as his substitute in the gas works, and he was to give in his resignation on the ensuing Saturday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they all appear to be of use at the Theatre? A. Yes. I have been two or three years in the Company's service - the prisoner was there before me, and he lately quitted them to go to the Royalty Theatre.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police - I found three locks belonging to the Company, at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The pipes are very tender, if a little thing touches them, they break in half, and being called out frequently at night, I got those things to do what was necessary - they were given to me by a person named Jones, who is now dead, to prevent the gas smelling in the street. Being in some distress at home, in consequence of a child dying, and my wife being but four weeks out of her confinement, I had not returned them, but I told them where I got them, and gave them up.</p>

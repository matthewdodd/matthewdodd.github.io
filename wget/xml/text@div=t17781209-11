               <p>I am a chairman; I ply at Drury-lane play-house; I was walking in Bridges-street after the play was over, and I saw the prisoners go to the coach door; I did not know that Burnett was asleep, his legs were hanging out; they staid at the coach about two minutes, they came back to the playhouse and sharpened a knife, then they went back to the coach and cut the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Which whetted the knife? - I do not know her name, that is her, (pointing to Reading) they call her Prologue; the other asked her if she should do it, she said, no, d - n you, I can do it better myself, and then went back and cut his pocket; I saw Reading cut his pocket and take something out, I do not know what; as I was walking past, I walked towards the Rose door, they followed me, and said, d - n him, we have done him; they said they had only four shillings in money, and asked me if I would have one of them.</p>
               <p>How came they to tell you? - I suppose because they perceived I saw them in the very act.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing about the watch? - No; they asked me to have one of the shillings; I said I would not have any; they begged me not to say any thing of it; I said I would; I went to call the coachman, and they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take them? - I did not know that I was to do that without an order from the justice; I waked the coachman immediately; he was some time shaking himself, or he might have caught them.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer, (produces a pick-axe;) I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Clarke.) In this service, do you allow your workmen to take home their tools? - A. We suffer them to take their own tools home, but not ours, without our leave.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. On the 15th of March, the prisoner was discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first apprehend him? - A. The 9th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the prisoner from the 15th of March to the 9th of June? - A.I believe he was employed on the docks, but not on my works.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him constantly during that time? - A. I have seen him during the time; I had met him on the road.</p>
               <p>Q.Many times? - A. I cannot say, I never saw him walking.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you never any dispute with the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Thatcher? - A. I have had none; I cannot say what Mr. Thatcher has done.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, do not you know that he had a dispute with him, and that the consequence was a summons to the Court of Conscience? - A. Not to my knowledge, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that a person of the name of Stint summoned you to the Court of Conscience? - A. He did, for ten shillings, I attended there.</p>
               <p>Q.How long ago? - A. I should suppose a month or six weeks back.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you apprehended the prisoner? - A. Not far from that time, but I cannot say exactly, it might be before or after, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In what month was it that you went to the Court of Conscience? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the month of June? - A. I believe it might be.</p>
               <p>Q.Try if you can recollect whether it was before or after you were summoned to the Court of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090021"></xptr>Conscience, that you apprehended the prisoner? - A. I cannot say whether it was before or after, for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not an account between you and the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor between Mr. Thatcher and the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What work was he engaged in? - A. The excavation.</p>
               <p>Q. That excavation would require a pick-axe? - A. Certainly, we supply the men with these kind of implements.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You were summoned by Stint, not by the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though the prisoner was not apprehended till the 9th of June, did you go as soon as you received the information? - A. Yes, the same day; we missed this and a considerable deal more property about that time; we have lost from time to time, upwards of two hundred pounds.</p>

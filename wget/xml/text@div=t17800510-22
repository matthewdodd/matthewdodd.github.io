On Monday the 1st of May, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, a girl came to my door and said, a woman was gone out of my house with a bundle of linen in her apron. I pursued her, and the little girl along with me, into Blackmore-street. I took her there with the linen in her apron (producing it.)</p>

               <p>I live opposite Mr. Parry's; I was at work at the window, I saw a woman go in without any thing, and come out with a great bundle; she went into the next house first, and then went in there; she staid in the house about half an hour. I sent to Mr. Parry's to know if they had given that woman a bundle of linen?</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman? - I believe she is, I cannot be positive; I described her gown and bonnet and cloak,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100031"></xptr>to Mr. Parry before he went after her; I believe they are the same she has on now.</p>

               <p>As I was going to see an acquaintance I found this bundle at the door; there was nobody in the street at this time. I took it up and put it into my apron; as I was walking along a little after I was taken with the things; I did not know they were stolen till I was taken.</p>

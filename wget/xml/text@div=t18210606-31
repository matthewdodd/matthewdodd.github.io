About nine o'clock at night, on the 14th of April, the prisoner came in and asked for an iron centre-hook. I took him to the end of the shop, and showed him some - he asked the price, I said two-pence. He said he had not money enough, but he would return in a few minutes. At that time a Captain came in, and I went up stairs with him; I was called down again, and found the robbery had been committed.</p>

            . I am watchman to the Goldsmith's Company. I was on duty, and heard the cry of Stop thief! some people ran to Mr. Payne's, I went in, and the prisoner was given into my charge. I searched him, and found two bed-hooks on him. As I took him to the Compter the people picked up two locks - they said,</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Payne. The prisoner came into the shop, and while he was being served by the shopman, with a hook and eye, which came to 2 d., I saw him take a brown paper parcel off the counter, and put it under his coat - my master was up stairs then. As he was going out I asked him what he had got - he made no answer. I lifted up his coat, and he ran away. I did not see him drop any thing, as it was dark; the locks were brought back - the paper was found close by them.</p>

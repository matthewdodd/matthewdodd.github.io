            . On the thirtieth of January my chimney was on fire, and I got the Prisoner to help put it out, and in a few minutes time she took the coral and necklace out of my room: She owned she pawned the necklace and locket to Mr. Paine for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say they were yours?</p>
               <p>Cole. I fetched Mr. Paine, and she said so before him; he is not well, and could not come . The Prisoner said she gave her mother the coral to sell, and she sold it to a silver-smith in East-Smithfield for twelve shillings and nine pence. She paid Mr. Paine the money for the necklace , and she said Mrs. Sanders pawned it again to one at Greenbank for fifteen pence; the pawnbroker delivered me the coral necklace, and did not take any thing for it. I do not know his name. Mrs. Sanders is not here; she said she would come if there was any occasion. The Prisoner owned she took these goods out of my house on the thirtieth of January, when my chimney was on fire . and that she gave her mother the coral to sell. I saw my coral hang up at a silver-smith's in West-Smithfield with my name upon it; I asked the gentleman whether it was to be sold, he said yes, and he told me he bought it the day before: I asked him what he would have for it, he said he would have fourteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174802240012"></xptr> shillings ; I asked him what sort of a woman it was that brought it, he said a comely lusty woman , who said that a child was dead, and she sold it that the child might not lie above ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the silver-smith here?</p>
               <p>Cole. No, but I can fetch him. I paid the silver-smith for the coral again, for he said he bought it at a market price.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cole. The Prisoner was at the fire; (she is an acquaintance a few doors off;) I missed them out of my drawers, and found the necklace and locket pawned at Mr. Paine's for a shilling. She owned she took the coral and necklace the night the fire was.</p>

            . I believe it was her mother's fault more than hers, and I desire the Court and the Jury would be merciful to her.</p>

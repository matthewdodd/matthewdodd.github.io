             lost something. Mrs. Marshall can speak to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he loose these - A. About the 27th. I did not miss them until we received the duplicates from the prisoner. She was a servant to us. The prisoner absconded from us. These articles were taken at different times from us, as the duplicates will specify. On the 23d of November, I was informed by Mr. King, who keeps a tavern in the street, that our servant had been running up a bill for liquor to the amount of one pound. On the 24th I have reason to apprehend that she discovered that we had found out that she had been running a bill, by her leaving the house the next morning; and as I found that she had run that up at the public-house, I enquired at other places in the neighbourhood. I discovered that she had ran up other bills. I found out where her sister lived. I went to her sister, and after I left the sister I went home. I had not long been at home when her sister came with a letter, and fourteen duplicates. I heard, after I received the duplicates that the prisoner was in the workhouse. I sent the officer to take her.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to a pawnbroker. I produce two pair of women's shoes, three shirts, two waistcoats, two tablecloths, and a child's pelisse. I advanced a guinea and three-pence upon these goods. The prisoner is the person that pledged these things with me. I perfectly recollect the woman; she frequented our house two or three times a-day.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where were these things kept - A. In different parts of the house. Some of the things were dirty linen. One of the pair of shoes is mine, and one my brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>MRS. MARSHALL. I have examined these goods. I had seen them in the house before the prisoner was apprehended. I know Mr. Marshall's goods, and the other property I know to be my brother's.</p>

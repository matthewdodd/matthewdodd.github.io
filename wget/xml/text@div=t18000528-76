I am engaged in the mill business with my brother: I went with my brother, in consequence of Bryan's information, to the stable; we had not waited in the stable above ten minutes before I saw the door open, and two men enter, who they were I did not know, being at the furthermost corner of the stable I could not see then, but I heard one of them get into the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were two men? - A. I saw them both come into the stable; I had seen the sack in the hay-lost, Bryan shewed it to me; it contained about five pecks of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of five pecks of flour? - A. About seventy pounds; I heard them whisper, and then I stooped down behind the horse to conceal myself; about a minute after that, I saw somebody go out at the door, and shut it, but I supposed there was only one, upon which I did not immediately get out of the stable, but made up towards the door; when I got to the door, I whispered to my brother, but he was not there; I then got out at the window, but before I got out, I heard an holloa, which I supposed was my brother, as a signal that they were that way; I then jumped out at the window, and before I had got ten yards, I saw Warren running, he was then about ten yards from me; I called to him as loud as I could and told him, if he did not stop I would shoot him; and, as he did not stop, I fired a pistol, thinking to frighten him; he ran about twenty yards after that, and then I collared him, and brought him to Bryan's house; Sharp was in custody at Bryan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any account of himself? - A. I never heard him speak a word; we delivered them both over to Bussey, a constable; we could not find the sack afterwards; Agar absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Agar you have not been able to find? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no observation upon the sack? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What its contents were you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your sacks marked? - A. What we have bought since we began partnership are marked J. and I. Surrey; before the partnership J. Surrey.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Those sacks that were marked only J. Surrey, do you use them in your partnership? - A. Yes.</p>

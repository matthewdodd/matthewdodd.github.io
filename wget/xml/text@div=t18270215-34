               <p>JOHN WALPOLE. I live in Fitzroy-street, St. Pancras; I have known the prisoner nearly two years. On the 17th of December, 1825, he applied to me to discount him a bill, which he produced; I gave him a cheque on my banker for it, deducting the discount; this is the bill(looking at it) - I paid it away, and it was returned to me dishonoured - the prisoner then kept a lodging-house in Thayer-street, Manchester-square, and continued to live there till lately - I saw him after it was dishonoured, and asked him where Jones, the acceptor, was; he said he should be able to find him by and by; he represented him as living at Deal; I went to Deal on the 20th of January, this year, and could find no person of that name; I found Walmer-cottage, at Walmer, which is three-quarters of a mile from Deal, but no Mr. Jones lived there.(The bill was here put in and read).</p>
               <p>London, Dec. 26, 1825.</p>
               <p>Two months after date, pay to my order the sum of forty-eight pounds fourteen shillings, for value received.</p>
               <p>W. JARMAN.</p>
               <p>To J. W. Jones, Walmer cottage, Deal - Accepted, J. W.</p>
               <p>Jones; payable No. 136, Regent street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At the time you received this bill, you were supplying the prisoner with goods? A. Yes; I believe a great many persons came to board at his house, and left quickly - I made no inquiry at Deal till last Monday.</p>

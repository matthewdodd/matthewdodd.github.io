Ever since I have been from that unpleasant situation in Woolwich, I have been in his Majesty's service in the Isle of Man, stationed under lieutenant Clark; and by my wife being taken remarkably ill, I came to see her. I was in a vessel, laying along with the Princess in the river; I received a letter from my wife, I went to see her; in consequence of that, a bosom freind went and sold me to these gentlemen. I was a midshipman under lieutenane Clark, and that your lordship will see. (A letter was handed from the prisoner, to the court.)</p>

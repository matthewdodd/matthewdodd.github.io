               <p>Q. Where did the handkerchiefs lie?</p>
               <p>Graham. They lay in the window under the shew-board, with another parcel, three in a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the window was she?</p>
               <p>Graham. She was standing by the compter, close to the window.</p>

               <p>Graham. I was on the other side the compter, close to the window; I looked at her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Graham. No, but I saw her put down her apron, and I missed the handkerchiefs directly; I asked my sister, that waits in the shop, after the handkerchiefs. she said she had not seen them; then I asked another gentlewoman that stood near the prisoner, she said she knew nothing of them. I was not willing to charge the prisoner with them till I was sure. She said, Mistress, do you think that I have got them. I pulled her apron back, and saw the corner of one; then I said I believe you have got them; upon which she took them from out of her apron, and flung them at me, and d - d, and called me names; (the handkerchiefs produced in the court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before?</p>
               <p>Graham. I had been shewing them to a customer not five minutes before.</p>

            . I was in the shop at the time, I did not see the prisoner take the handkerchiefs, but I saw her take them from her apron. Mrs. Graham asked her after them, the prisoner said, are these your handkerchiefs, d - n you, you bitch, and flung them at her. Mrs. Graham had called to her husband, who was above; she took up the handkerchiefs, and laid them on the compter; the prisoner ran out of the shop, but was soon taken, and brought in again: then she went on her knees, and said it was the first fault she ever did.</p>

               <p>I was coming home, and went into this shop to buy a stomacher, and brushing against the things, the handkerchiefs fell down; the woman said she missed her handkerchiefs, I look'd down, and saw them lying on the ground; I stooped down, and took them up, and gave them to her.</p>

            . I am carman to the prosecutor. On the 3rd of November I was taking the load of hay to London; I was coming up Windmill-hill, on the other side of Kilburn; I saw the prisoner, who said my master and he had dealt for that hay, and that hay he could have drawn where he liked, if he gave 50s. for it; I said my master had not said any thing to me about it - I then went on to the Black Lion, at Kilburn, where I generally stop - I set off again from there, and overtook the prisoner again near the Bell, at Kilburn; he called me, and said I was to go along with him and unload it; I said I did not know what to do, but if he had bought it I supposed he must take it, but not to bring me into any trouble; I went with him to Lincoln's Inn-fields, where I helped him to unload it - when I got home my master was very angry with me; I saw the prisoner the next day, and told him my master wanted to see him, if he pleased - he said he would go that night to my master's, but he never came - I saw him again the day following; he said he would come, and pay my master for it; I went home, and told my master - he desired me to go and fetch him; I went to him on the Sunday morning - he would not come, but he told me to tell my master to come to him; I told my master, who said he should not go; I went to the prisoner again on the Wednesday morning, and he gave me a sovereign to take to my master, and said he had no more then - I took it to my master, and he refused it.</p>
               <p>MR. TOMLINSON. I had not made any bargain with the prisoner about the sale of this hay, or any other - I knew him before; I had never authorized my servant to sell it- I would not have sold it for 50s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me that if the load of hay would do me any good at 50s. I might have it; that was the last word that passed between us the night before.</p>


               <p>S. TOMLINSON. No such word was ever mentioned; he never proposed to buy it - we were at work in our yard, and the prisoner was going by; he came into the yard, and said,"What do you ask a load for your black hay at Harrowweal" - I said 50s. at the rick; he said, "I can buy it cheaper of your salesman" - I said, "If he sells it under price, he shall never sell another load for me;" he then turned away - this hay was no part of that; I sent this hay to be sold at the market price.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was a load of hay from the same rick.</p>
               <p>MR. TOMLINSON. It grew all on the same land, but was not all of one sort; we cut the rick in half, and half was saved, but the other half was damaged; the damaged hay we sold at 50s.</p>

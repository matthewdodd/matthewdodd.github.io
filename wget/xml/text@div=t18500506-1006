                  </hi>. I am assistant to my mother, who keeps a shop at Greenwich. On 13th Dec. Thomas Collis Sutton was in a cart coming from Woolwich—Mr. Martin, another young man, and I, were in the cart—when we came to the top of Hog-lane, the prisoners were coming up in a chaise—Mr. Sutton went to draw the cart past them, and they turned their horse's head to the left—Mr. Sutton asked them to allow him to pass—they used very bad language, and drew on very slowly—they would not allow him to pass—when they came to the dock-yard they stopped in front of the horse—Mr. Sutton called to the men in the yard—he then tried to go on, and the prisoners turned their horse's head one way and the other—after we had passed the dock-yard gate, there was another stoppage, and all the prisoners got out of their cart, and they came some on each side of Mr. Sutton's cart, and one of them, I cannot say which, struck Mr. Sutton on the eye—I re<lb></lb>ceived a blow on my left arm and Mr. Martin received a blow from the same person—Mr. Sutton received a blow on the side of the eye with something about a foot long—I cannot say who struck that blow, for when I saw the blood run I was afraid—I think Mr. Sutton fell out of the cart—he was down in the road when I saw him—all the prisoners were then out of their chaise—they then got into their chaise and drove off—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Thomas Collis Sutton—I saw him at the Yorkshire Grey on 13th Dec., about seven o'clock in the evening—his head was bleeding very much from a recent cut on the cheek bone—the three pri<lb></lb>soners were there—Walsh said he was extremely sorry for what had occurred, and Grant held up his right hand, and said to the prosecutor, "This is death to you, you dog"—the prosecutor appeared to have been drinking, but he was greatly excited—there was much blood, and I lent him a handkerchief to wipe his face.</p>

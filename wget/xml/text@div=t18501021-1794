                  </hi>. I am single. In Aug. last I lived at 8, Green's-court, St. James's, with my sister—the prisoner also lodged there—I went to a situation, at 8, Leicester-place, Leicester-square, and left my box in my sister's charge—it contained seven dresses, five petticoats, two dozen pairs of stockings, four sovereigns, a scarf, and some caps and collars, altogether worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I had been a week in my place I went back for my box, and it was gone—I had not sent the prisoner for it, or seen her since I left my sister's—I afterwards met her in Seven-dials, and gave her in charge—I asked where she had taken my box to—she said she brought it to the door, and gave it to a woman, where I was living in my place—I saw a pair of my stockings taken off her feet at the station—they had been in my box, which was locked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John M'Nally, and sister to the prosecutrix. She left her box in my charge when she went to service—it contained the things she has stated—it was locked, and she had the key—the prisoner came up to me on Friday morning, while I was in my confinement, and said, "I saw your sister, through the area where she lives, and she hallooed up to me to bring her box to her, as she has no clothes to put on in the evening"—I said, if she wanted her box she would come for it herself—she then went out, and returned in about an hour and a half, and said, "Your sister says she wants the box very particularly, and if she does not come for it at four o'clock, I am to take it to her, between six and seven"—she took the box there and then—she came back in about half an hour, and said, "The box is all right; I left it with your sister at her place, and she will come out on Sunday for two hours"—she said she had taken my boy to help her with the box—she stopped in my place that Friday night and Saturday, and both days she was drunk, and it was little I thought it was my sister's money and clothes she was drinking—she went away on Sunday evening, without a minute's notice.</p>

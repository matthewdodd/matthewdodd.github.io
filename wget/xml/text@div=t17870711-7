               <p>On Monday the 30th of April, about ten at night, I was conversing with a person about two yards off, I saw the prosecutor coming across with a basket on his arm, and I saw a person that just passed me, in light coloured clothes, give him a most terrible shove amongst some fish-baskets and radishes; he was down almost, directly he recovered himself and said immediately, I am robbed, you have stolen my watch; he set down his basket, he pursued M'Cowl into Blackmore-street, and I saw the prosecutor have hold of him; I immediately left my acquaintance, and went and pursued M'Cowl, he made a blow at my head, I tripped up his heels and down with him on the curb pavement; there I kept him and called out the watch; I saw a man, as I thought, come across to my assistance, and he came up, and made a sudden stoop down, and I saw the watch taken from M'Cowl's hands, by this

               <p>Court. You are quite sure when they brought the man back again, you knew it to be the same man that you saw stoop to M'Cowl? - The very same, and so Johnson said; I never lost sight of him; it did not take five minutes; Johnson said, he has not the watch, it is dropped, and a young man has picked it up, and a young man that was close by, who is here now, said, I have the watch; his name is Graham; I assisted Mr. Johnson to take him to the watch-house near the New Church in the Strand; for I saw he was very powerful; the constable of the night came in soon after; when I got him secured, I ran to the watch-house in Portugal-street, where the other prisoner was that I took first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. We have not seen you some time? - You may have seen me possibly; I am in a public line, I am a cutler.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I keep a manufactory in Martlet's-court, Bow-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Then your's is not a licenced house? - I do not want any licence for my house.</p>
               <p>No, it is only licentious? - Martlet's-court never was known for any harm here.</p>
               <p>Why it is what they call a case? - No, Sir, I deny the words.</p>
               <p>Oh you know what I mean? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Jury may not; you mean it is not a notorious common bawdy-house? - Do you know any body that can prove it such; I have never any more than two lodgers in my house; I have a manufactory there.</p>
               <p>Yes, so I understand; lodgings for single men, sometimes single women, and men and their wives; what is the stock at present? - I have but one person in my lodgings at present.</p>
               <p>A woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Sometimes single, and sometimes married? - That I do not enquire about; I never trouble myself about that, while there is no scandal attending it.</p>
               <p>How long has the other lady been gone? - What other lady? I believe about a fortnight.</p>

            ? - No, very little; I believe I do not go to sit in a public house once in a month, very seldom.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110026"></xptr>Did you ever sit down there? - These gentlemen know me for no harm at all.</p>
               <p>You said he gave this prosecutor a terrible shove? - I said a bit of a shove, or a bit of a posh.</p>
               <p>Then you did not say a blow? - No, I said a terrible push; it was such a push that it set him almost down; I dare say he felt it, and I dare say he has told you so.</p>
               <p>Next to hearing who you are, and who your lodgers are, let us a little into your studies; you study the sessions paper a good deal? - I never read them, that is idle pence that I never throw away.</p>
               <p>You take it all by hearsay? - I never trouble my head; I never was here but once, and that was on account of the election; I was subpoened when Mr. Sheridan was here.</p>
               <p>You was a witness on that occasion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you come on the part of the prosecution? - I was subpoened by Mr. Sheridan.</p>
               <p>Since that, it is a common thing when men come here once, they are fond of it? - I hope never to have the trouble again; but still if I found any individual served in that manner, it certainly is my duty to take his part.</p>
               <p>Have you had any talk about this indictment, or how it was best to charge it? - No never, I never took any trouble how it was to be found, nor which way to lay it, or how it was to be done; I was only an evidence or a witness, and I left that to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Then you mean to swear that he gave the instructions to the clerk of the indictments for it? - There was a conversation took place at the office; I took a part in that conversation.</p>
               <p>Who told you what would make the difference between a highway robbery and a simple larceny from the person? - No person in the world.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to swear, that you have not said to any body, or have not heard from any body, that in order to prove this indictment laid, as it is (that is your phrase I think) that it would not do unless you was to prove a violent shove before the watch went? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Why you never heard of it perhaps that that makes all the difference about laying it? - My using that word was mere accident.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know, that the question whether you are to have part of eighty pounds or not, depends on whether the Jury believe there was a shove or not, before the watch went? - I have always heard so.</p>

            ? - Why perhaps, yes; I believe naturally where one uses a public-house; I first heard it at the Rotation-office in Litchfield-street, of the clerk when I went there; I said to the clerk I do not wish for any such thing; I have not done it for any such thing; I did it to save my fellow-creature; says he, in case they are convicted of the robbery, there is that; says I, I hope no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did not he say also, but if they are only convicted of the larceny, there will be no reward? - God knows that.</p>
               <p>So this you knew before the indictment was preferred? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How was it you told me this moment, why, perhaps yes, most likely, it is natural, when one uses a public-house, if the Justice's clerk told you? - I do not know that ever I had any conversation in the public-house about it.</p>
               <p>First you said you never had had any conversation about it? - I did not say so, I have heard so many words about it, that I hated to hear of the thoughts of the reward.</p>
               <p>So you have heard a great deal about the reward? - It was spoke of to be sure.</p>
               <p>Who have you had words with about it? - Why Mr. Atkins, who is here in Court; he is one of the Bow street officers.</p>
               <p>Have you had conversation with Atkins about it? - I have had some little conversation with him, I begged him not to speak of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110027"></xptr>Have you never had any conversation with Townsend? - No, Sir, nor nobody else.</p>
               <p>Did not somebody say to you, why Mr. Pawson, you must be a bad man, you do this for the sake of the reward; to which you answered, no, I do not do it for the reward, for my share of the reward, I shall give it to some public charity? - I said I never did it for the reward; I never said I would give the reward to a charity; Atkins said, if you do not like the reward, give it to me; I said no, I shall give it to charity.</p>
               <p>You did not know there were two rewards in case these men were convicted? - I have heard it spoke of; I said if it is so, but God forbid it should be so, I would sooner give it to a public charity than give it to you; the shove I have spoke, is that I saw very plain the man was almost down among the baskets.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you clear you saw the watch conveyed by one of the prisoners to the other? - I saw Brace take it from the hand of M'Cowl, as if he was stooping to buckle his shoe; Brace is the man that I thought was coming up to my assistance, he made a sudden stoop, and took the watch from M'Cowl's hand; the watch was dropped, and found afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see Pawson at the time? - I did not see him till after he laid hold of M'Cowl; one ran away, and I heard Pawson say, stop thief, that man has got the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Pawson. Have you never been indicted for keeping that house in Martlet's-court? - No, Sir, it is not in the power of mortal man to indict me, nor my wife neither.</p>
               <p>Nor your wife? - No.</p>
               <p>Not at Westminster session? - No, nor at any session in the world.</p>

            ; we then waited some little time for the prosecutor's coming; I took charge and locked up the prisoner, and heard what the other persons had to say that were concerned in taking him; Mr. Fleming described the watch which Graham had in his possession, Graham said he had picked it up, and he gave it into my possession; I have had it ever since; this is the same watch.</p>

               <p>Not unless you took your wife with you? - I should not chuse to take her there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Pawson in the watch-house with you that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brace. When the prosecutor gave charge, did he say he knew any thing of me? - He said he did know him to be the same person; I did not hear of any body that knew so much of the prisoner as myself.</p>
               <p>What do you know of me, I should be glad you would tell my Lord? - Only his living a servant to my next-door neighbour for two or three years, and I knew that he went abroad with Captain Holloway, to the West Indies, and remained there some time; his character was very good, I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I very much intoxicated? - I think he had had a little liquor, but he was capable of knowing right from wrong; a little before the peace he came back, then I understood he bore a good character, as he had done before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Smith, of No. 8, Martyr's-pasaage, Woolwich. On Sunday, 4th Feb., about half-past 10 o'clock, the prosecutor came to my house, and asked for a bed—I told him he could not go into one of my beds in the state he was; he was all over mud and blood, and rather intoxicated—I told him he must go away from my door—he said he wanted a bed to lie down on, pulled out eight half crowns, and said, "You think I have no money," counted them into his hand, and put them into his right hand waistcoat pocket—he had a watch, with a guard, round his neck—the prisoner Welch came up to the door, and caught the prosecutor round the neck at the time he was counting the half crowns—he kept hugging him, and put his hands into the prosecutor's pockets—I said, "Leave him alone; he is a stranger to you"—the prisoner said, "Come with me to a lodging; I will get you one," and he asked him several times for his watch—he said, "I will not give my watch up to anybody"—I ordered the prisoner away from the door—I then shut the door, and heard them wrangling very much—I went out and told them to go away, and they went away together—about half-past 12 o'clock I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, went to the door, and saw a constable and a young woman, who said that there was a person robbed of his watch and money—I went to the house, and found that it was the same man—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in the room together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of Robert-street, Plumstead. On Saturday, 4th Feb., I applied to the last witness for a bed—I took out some half crowns, showed them to her, and put them into this pocket—she refused to give me a bed, because of the state I was in—I had had a slip down, and was not quite sober—the prisoner Welch came up while I was speaking to her, and said, "I will take you to a bed," and I went with him—he wanted me to give him my watch, but I would not—he took me to a house, and I saw the female prisoner there—she went up stairs first with a light, and Welch went next, taking hold of me, and then he shut the door—no con<lb></lb>versation took place between me and the female prisoner—I was not asked a question—they knocked me down across the bed, with my legs hanging down, and my body on the bed—I was stunned; and as near as I can guess a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw Richards go down stairs—she came back in about three minutes—they then both came and stood together, and I got up, missed my watch and money, and asked them both for my watch and chain—they both said that they had not got them—I went to the door, saw a policeman, and made a charge.</p>

               <p>Sunday, 4th Feb., in the evening, Welch and the prosecutor came there—the prosecutor stumbled on his knee on the step, and the prisoner picked him up, and they came and sat on a form for twenty or twenty-five minutes—Richards and two other young women were in the room—the prisoners knew one another before—Welch said, "Martha, I have no money, but I have got a silk handkerchief, and I will give it to you; you can pledge it in the morning if I do not come and bring you the money for it"—presently the prisoner got up, and took the prosecutor up stairs with him, and Richards went up with a candle—I stopped down stairs, and presently I went up to the room door, and the prisoner turned round and said, "'It is all right, mother, you can go down again"—I went down, and about five minutes afterwards I heard a bustling up stairs; I went up, and found the prosecutor standing at the room door, bleeding from the nose a good deal—he said, "I have lost my watch"—I took hold of the key of the door, and said, "Nobody leaves this room till his watch is found"—Welch stepped up to me, spoke rather rough, and said that he would go—I said, "No," and he took the watch out of his jacket pocket, and put it into my left hand—the prosecutor was standing by my side, and I handed him the watch, but there was no chain on it—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a policeman came, the prisoner was given in charge, and I saw the policeman take eight half crowns from his hand?.</p>

On Thursday, the 16th of February, the two prisoners came in to pledge a shawl; I had some things laying at the end of the counter; I was busy for some time; I had just marked them ready for putting into the window, and I was at the window putting some things in when the prisoners came in; I took in the pledge of them; they went away. After they were gone, I turned round to put the other things into the window; I missed two pillow-cases. I understood from their discourse that they were going up to the Sessions House; I immediately went there; not finding them there, coming from Clerkenwell green, I met a constable that I mentioned the circumstance to, he said he would give a look out. I knew the woman before; I am quite sure they are the two woman; the constable found them on them, with my private mark inside, the ticket outside.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 16th of February, I met Mr. Wright, he told me he had been robbed of a pair of pillow-cases at home. As I came up from Clerkenwell green, I met the prisoners coming down; I saw they had got something looking at under a shawl; I saw something under the shawl; they went up a passage; I went up the passage; they were looking at these things; I went up to them, and asked them what they had got there; Deane said she was going to purchase them. I asked them if they were hers; she said, yes, and after that, she said they were her mother's, she had just fetched them from the manglers. I catched hold of them, and asked them to let me have a sight of them as they were going to sell them. I unfolded them, told them it was the property I was looking for; I detained them on suspicion of felony. These are the pillow-cases.</p>

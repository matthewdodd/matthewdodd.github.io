               <p>Court. What will become of you, if you swear falsly? - I cannot tell, I am sure; I do not swear falsly; I have heard people swearing</p>

               <p>Do you believe you are bound to tell the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. All that you saw them do, was to come there and go away? - They came down the stairs; they had a boat stem foremost; they might hand to one another, and so put anything into the boat; I went with a fair; and coming through the lower tier, Howard was crying stop thief! and the two prisoners before; I never saw Howard before; the prisoner had rowed away; I saw a boat going through iron gate tier; but whether it was them or no, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hopkins. My lord, on the Sunday morning, between nine and ten, I came down; and Howard was making a complaint to several people, how he had lost the copper; and that it was impossible for him to know the people, it was so late at night.</p>

               <p>On Sunday morning, after this copper was lost, I was on the causeway; and I saw Howard there; I am positive of it: it was about ten in the morning: the prisoners were both there; I think I saw Hopkins in the barge: there were a great many people there; and he was relating that he had lost his copper; and I said to him, do you think you should know any of the people? he began in his manner, as I do,</p>
               <p>"God d - n, - no - cannot know them - quite dark - rowed away directly;" I am sure Netherhood was there at that time; and I saw Hopkins go into his barge, and stow his copper in the presence of the old man; he said he knew nothing of the people; I am sure of that.</p>

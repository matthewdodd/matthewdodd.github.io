               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me these things? A. Never; I did not authorize you to pawn any thing - I never pawned the watch myself; I asked him where the duplicates were - he said he had left them at a coffee-shop for 3s.; I gave him 3s. to get them - he returned, and said the man was not at home; I slept with you one or two nights, but you did not support me - you gave me a breakfast when I helped you work.</p>

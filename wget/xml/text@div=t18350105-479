                  </hi>. I am wife of Samuel Woodgate, a victualler, who lives in Fryer-street, Blackfriars'-road. The prisoner was our pot-boy—on the 28th of December he asked me for change for two sovereigns, for No. 42, Union-street—he did not say the name—I told him it was very unlikely they would want change for two, and I gave him change for one—he went out, and came back with a crowd of people—I heard that he had been to some house, got the silver changed for a sovereign, and had drop<lb></lb>ped it, that a woman took it up, and he said it was his, and she came with him to see if it was so—that sovereign I got—about half-past ten o'clock that night, he came to me for change for a half-sovereign—I gave him one half-crown and some other silver—he went away, and I saw him no more till he was in custody.</p>

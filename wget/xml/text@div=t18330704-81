            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. On Saturday, the 22nd of June, a little after two o'clock, I went to <placeName id="t18330704-81-crimeloc410">Nichol-street, Devonshire-court, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What are you? A. A Thames police-constable - the other officers were in the room when I found the metal in the cloth; I cannot say whether they saw me find it - I have had it in my possession ever since - I gave Mr. Field the paper to wrap three pieces of metal in at the Thames police-office - Creber was the only person with me when I first went in and found the prisoners on the bed - he is not here - Mitchell and my brother came in, in a moment - Creber might have heard what the prisoners said if he had taken notice- he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. What part did Creber take in the transaction; I believe he found the money on Hill, but I am not sure.</p>

            . I am a Thames police-surveyor. I accompanied the other officers to the prisoners lodging - I and Mitchell went one way, my brother and Creber the other - as soon as I saw my brother go in at the door we entered - Chamberlaine was just then getting off the bed - he asked us to allow him to put his clothes on before we handcuffed him - I commenced searching the bed - pulled it off the bedstead, and at last (seeing a little hole in the tick,) I cut the tick open, and turned the flock and feathers out, and found a little bag containing forty-three counterfeit shillings - Mitchell has them, and in a paper I found six half crowns- I counted them in the prisoners presence, and gave them to Mitchell - Chamberlaine said he did not know they were in the bed - that he had been there two months, and knew nothing of them - he then said to the female "this will lag us all Sal," - that means transported - she goes by the name of Sal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anybody in the room when he said that. A. The whole of the officers except Mitchell who I believe went up stairs.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the mint- I have seen there articles - I know from my experience what they are for - this is a mould of plaister of paris - having impressed on it the obverse and the reverse sides of a shilling, of the date of 1817, which mould I believe from its appearance, has been used for casting shillings - two of the shillings produced by the officer which are unfinished, appear to have been cast in this mould - the whole forty-three are counterfeit, and are all cast in white metal - there are some pieces of white metal here, similar to what the counterfeit coin is made of - I have selected from among these pieces, two which appear to have been run in these moulds - they are called gets - it is the metal which fills up the mouth of the channel of the mould - I have no doubt they were cast in the channel of this mould - this shilling would be attached to the get when it is cast - twenty-eight of the shillings are not of that year - here is a tobacco pipe, which has a small portion of white metal in the bowl, similar to the metal produced- that would melt the metal, to pour it into the mould, and here is a file with white metal in the teeth - that might be used to remove the roughness from the edge of the metal - the bowl would hold about a sufficient quantity to form a shilling and the get - this is plaister of Paris in a powdered state - by mixing it with water, the moulds are composed - they usually have a hand to confine the plaister of parish into a particular form, till it hardens- here are six counterfeit half-crowns of the same metal.</p>

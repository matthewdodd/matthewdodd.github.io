                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 221.) I aprehended the prisoner, last Thursday, at his father's—(I had been there to look for him four times, and was not able to find him)—the prosecutor went in first—I heard the mother say, "Come from under the bed, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, it is no use"—I said to the prisoner, "Why do you hide there, if you know you are not guilty? we only want to identify you if you are the boy that took the clothes"—he strongly denied it—he said he would come down next morning to show himself—he did so, and the prosecutor identified him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the morning the gentleman says he lost his bundle I was at Covent-garden market from six o'clock till ten or eleven; I go there every morning ever since I have been out of work, to see if I could earn a few halfpence; last Wednesday night the prosecutor and a policeman came to where I live, and I asked him if I was the boy that took his things—he said yes, he thought I was; my little brother was standing there, and he said, "That is the one."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> In the first instance the prosecutor could not recognise the prisoner—it was by candle-light—he did look at the other boy, and said he was a great deal like the boy—when he saw the prisoner by day-light he said he could swear to him; but he was very reluctant to come.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said he did not think it was me; there was a witness there, who said he could not swear to me, and the prosecutor said he would make him; the policeman was by all the while. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not correct.</p>

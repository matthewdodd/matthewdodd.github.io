               <p>Q. Where is Princes street - A. Leading from Barbican to Bridgewater square.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been previously in before that time - A. I was an apprentice to a water gilder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in the watch line - A. Yes; such as gilding watch cases; I served my time in Charter house lane; my employer lived in Red Lion street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you during that time know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, perfectly well; he was a watch case maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and tell me whether you recollect him now - A: I do; he had a wen then upon the right side of his face; there is no wen now, there is a scar.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that scar appear to you to be where the wen was - A. Exactly so. On the 21st of November, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me at the Crown and Cushion, and he asked for change of a fifty pound bank note; he said it was for Mr. Richards of Bridgewater square; I knew Mr. Richards, he is a watch case maker; I told him I could not give him change; he went away; in ten minutes he returned again, I was in the tap room, Mrs. Baverstock called me out and told me the prisoner had come to; change of a check; I came out to him, he wanted he said change for a check of ten pound; he gave me the check, and I gave him a five pound bank note and the rest in cash; he produced a check upon Mr. Walpole's house. After he had got the cash he took a glass of rum and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some suspicion that you entertained what did you do - A. I went to Mr. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that check - is that the check that the prisoner presented to you - A. It is the check, this is my hand writing. In consequence of the enquiries I made at Mr. Richards, I went to Mr. Walpole's, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140027"></xptr>refused my presenting it, it was after hours, and they did no business; but when I wished to know whether it was a good one they took it very politely and told me; from that I went to Hatton Garden, knowing Trott the officer, to lay an information against him. I did not see him till about a month ago, then he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner at the bar whom you saw at the magistrate's, was the person that you had formerly known, that had the wen on his face, and is now the prisoner at the bar - A. I have not the slightest doubt in the world; I verily believe he is the man; at the time he came to me he had the wen on his face, which he has not now. I have no other doubt.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you have a doubt you must say it - A. I cannot say that I have; I really believe to the best of my knowledge that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have any doubt you must say it - A. That is all the doubt about it; I verily believe from my soul that he is the man, he not having the wen on his face is all the doubt I have about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you have a doubt about it.</p>

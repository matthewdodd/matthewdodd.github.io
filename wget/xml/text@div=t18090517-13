            . On Sunday morning, between two and three o'clock, I was returning from my shop in Fetter-lane to my habitation in Cold Bath-row. On the left hand side of <placeName id="t18090517-13-crimeloc79">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing - A. I lost my pocket book, various memorandums, also the copy of my freedom, and two five pound notes; I described Dennis at Hatton-Garden office, and Stanton, the officer, took him last Saturday night. Dennis is the person that took the pocket book out of my pocket; I have not the smallest doubt of either of them; the moon shone; I could perfectly see their persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You tell us this was between two and three o'clock in the morning - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say it was so light you could see clearly about you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. I was.</p>
               <p>- MOONEY. I am the constable of the night. When the watchman brought Crawley in on the 23rd of April the prosecutor was quite intoxicated in liquor. Crawley said to the prosecutor, you want to take my life away; the prosecutor began to look at him; he said you are the person that put your hand upon my mouth to stop me crying out. I searched him. I found a shilling, and a few halfpence, and a knife that he cuts his bread and cheese with; the prosecutor was dancing about, he was so intoxicated.</p>

             I am a watchman in Holborn. I was crying half past two o'clock when I heard the cry of watch; I came to Hatton-Garden, I there saw the prosecutor without his hat, he was expostulating with the watchmen on the other side of the way, blaming them for not coming to his assistance; he said he had lost his pocket-book and his hat. The prisoner Crawley came up and asked what was the matter; the prosecutor gave me charge of him; he said he was the man that put his hand on his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. I cannot say; he seemed to give his evidence very fair at the watchhouse; I have no doubt but he was sober; he told the same story then as he did at the office, and the same as he has told to day. When the prisoner Crawley came in the watchhouse, he applied to Mr. Mooney, the constable; he said to him, you know my father and mother very well; Mooney said he did, and they were very industrious people.</p>
               <p>Q. When this conversation passed, did any thing strike you to believe the prosecutor was in liquor - A. No; he delivered his story very clear, as ever I heard any man; I do not know him any more than seeing him that night.</p>
               <p>Crawley's Defence. I was coming along, this gentleman was in full discourse with a watchman; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170016"></xptr>came up, and there was a young man standing with an umbrella, he was blowing the other watchman up; he said you rascals you have not done your duty, he said he had been robbed; the man said he saw nobody coming along; he looked at the man with the umbrella very hard; I asked him what was the matter; he was going to give charge of this man, and then he said he would give charge of me; I never made any resistance.</p>
               <p>Dennis's Defence. I was never there at all; about nine o'clock I went to the Pickled Egg, I stopped there till about half past twelve, from there I went to my mother's, and staid till half past two o'clock; it was not five minutes walk from the Pickled Egg to my mother's, and from my mother's I went home.</p>

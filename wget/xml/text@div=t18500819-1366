                  </hi>. I lived with my aunt Josephine Lebas, at 58, Well-street, Oxford-street. On Wednesday, 12th June, there was a distress put in on my aunt's property—Moody and Jones were placed in possession—they came to the house about twelve o'clock in the day—they distrained the goods—they took the chairs and all that was in the rooms—my aunt occupied two rooms—I saw the things taken down to the cellar—they were the chairs, the table, the bed, the pillows and pillow-cases—after the things had been taken down in the cellar I saw a hat of Moody's, which was left on the floor in my</p>

               <p>aunt's front room—there was a table-cloth of my aunt's in the hat, which I had seen shortly before, in the next room—I took it out of the hat—after the things were taken down in the cellar, Moody took down two birds, and he told me if I went to the landlord, he would give them to me—I was gone a quarter of an hour, or half an hour—when I returned I noticed that Moody'a pockets appeared more bulky than they did before—I saw him go and look in the bed; there was an old black cloak, he said he should like to have it, and another article—I said they were not his to have—he said they were all his things—after that they went away, and locked the door, and told me to go away—my aunt was then in Paris—there was a lady who was sleeping with me—she came up into the room after me while the prisoners were there—she was not there while I went to the landlord to inquire about the birds—there was no one there then but the prisoners—next day I was passing along King-street, and saw some reels of gold in a little tin pan, in the parlour-window of Moody's house—I passed by, and when I came back they were not there—I went and asked Mrs. Moody where they were—she said the children had had them to play with—(she had seen me pass the house before, she was outside talking to a person in the street)—she said her husband would be there by-and-by, and if I liked to come in an hour or two, I should see him—I saw this book there, which I bought—I am not quite sure it is mine, but I really believe it is—I cannot read it—I can read but very little English—I got the assistance of Wood the policeman, and I went and asked Mrs. Moody where the reels were, and I saw she had a shawl on belonging to my aunt—while we were talking, Jones came out with a handkerchief belonging to my aunt on his neck—I told the policeman of it, and Jones went away into the passage, aod while he was away he changed his handkerchief, and appeared with another handkerchief on—after I had seen Mrs. Moody with the shawl on, she went in, and I stood amongst, the people.</p>

               <p>on, the pattern of which was very indistinct—he was asked what he had done with the other handkerchief, and was told he had got another handker<lb></lb>chief on—he said it was a lie, it was that handkerchief he had had all the day—at the station he was charged with stealing the handkerchief, and was locked up—when I went to the house the witness spoke to Jones, and while she was speaking Mrs. Moody came out, and said, "What is all this bother about?"—Jones said, "She has come about those reels of gold"—she said, "I told her the children had had them;"and she said, "I told you to come when Mr. Moody was at home, and he will account for them"—Mrs. Moody had a shawl, or neck-tie, round her neck, and the witness charged her with having stolen it from her aunt—I said I should be much obliged to her to account for it—she said she would not account for it to me, or to any human being—I said, "On that account, you must go to the station"—she said, "I will see you d——d first;" and she broke from me, and ran into the yard—she remained concealed for some time—after a time she came out, and ran into the first-floor—I went and fetched her out, and she had not then got the shawl on her shoulders—I said, "You must go with me to the station"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For that shawl you had on your shoul<lb></lb>ders"—she said, "You must be blind or a fool; I have had none on but what I have now"—she had not any on then—I went into the yard, and put my arm round on the bricks of the water-butt as far as I could reach, and in the angle of the wall I found this shawl—I said, "Here is the shawl that you had"—she said, "What about it?"—I said, "This girl charges you with stealing it from No. 58, Well-street"—she said, "She is a liar, I have had it in my possession two years"—I found it in the same yard that I had seen her go into—she then invited me into her house, and said, "There never was anything brought into my house from No. 58, Well-street, only these reels of gold, that were given to the children to play with, being of no value"—when I first said I must take her to the station, she broke from me; and Jones stepped between me and the door, and said, "I will see and prevent that; you shall not take her to the station"—I afterwards returned to the house for the handkerchief that Jones had round his neck—I did not find that, but I found several things in a large box placed on a shelf over the water-butt—there were these five neck-ties, this eye-glass, two salt-spoons, a pair of scissors, a small copper pan, and a toilet-cover—I afterwards went to Jones,' and searched there—Jones' wife went with me—I have seen her since at the police-court—the house is No. 21 or 22, Lamb's-court—I found there a card-rack, two brass padlocks, a steel bracket, a brass crucifix, a knife and fork, a piece of bed-furniture, and several other things.</p>

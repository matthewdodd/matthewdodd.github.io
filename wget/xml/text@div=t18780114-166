                  </hi>. I am a traveller, of 26, Burridge Road—on 11th September, about 6.15, I was at the corner of Lime Street and Fenchurch Street, a fire-engine came up very fast, and the street being blocked, one of the horses fell—a crowd collected, and I felt a pull at my watch-chain—I looked down, and saw the prisoner's hand letting it go—he was close to me—I laid hold of him, held him till a policeman came, and gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. My watch was safe when the horse fell—the fireman got down, and asked if I wanted assistance.</p>

I was eating the last one, and when the gentleman said "You have taken my watch," I dropped the last one because I was so struck. The boy said at the station that he saw me with the chain in my hand. I said, "I know nothing about your watch; I will not move from the place," and I stood there till the policeman took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Pickard, of 75, Devon-shire-street, Lisson-grove—he is a horse-Breaker—about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of 20th May, I was in Great Queen-street, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him to direct me to Gray's Inn-road—I took out my purse and gave him the direction which I had in it—he told me he knew where it was well, he would show me, and as he read the direction he passed a little way to show me—instead of showing me the right direction he took me quite the reverse—he walked with me, I should say, about five minutes, and then snatched my purse from my hand—it must have fallen on the ground—I can't swear that I saw him stoop down, or whether he ran or not; I was in a state of confusion—my purse contained 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I live at 11, Old Compton-street, Soho, and am a printer—on 20th last month, I was passing through Wild-street, between 5 and 6 in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner run past me very swiftly and cross the road—I did not look towards him then—I am quite sure he is the person who ran by me, by the peculiar coloured trousers that he wore, and his appearance generally-after he ran by me, I went up to the prosecutrix; she was, I should think, about twenty or thirty yards from the place where the prisoner ran By—one end of Wild-street runs into Queen-street, and the other into Stanhope-street, Clare-market, which is a con<lb></lb>tinuation of Wild-street—I was about the centre of Wild-street, about forty yards from the corner, when I went up to the prosecutrix—she was standing on the opposite corner of Wild-street to where I was standing, it a Buts on Great Queen-street—I saw a crowd round her and spoke to her—I put myself in communication with the police—I saw the prisoner about twelve minutes after, and pointed him out to the policeman as the man who had</p>

Q.</hi> I think you said, when you met the prisoner, you were coming up Wild-street, towards Great Queen-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was on the left side of the street coming from Clare-market to the City—the prisoner was on the same side, running from Great Queen-street—he crossed over the street to the right—he was not more than two or three yards from me as he passed me—he passed me in the road very close to me—I was on the pavement—I did not see anybody else running at the same time—I did not hear any hue or cry—I feel suspicious when I see a man running, especially if I see a crowd on the opposite side—there were from seven to eight persons round the prosecutrix at the time, or it might Be more—when I saw the prisoner again, he was at the corner of great queen—street; street, in dray-lane; that is about fifteen yards from the corner of wild-street and queen street; I should think about half a dozen doors—his trousers were a yellowish colour—the prosecutrix identified them after<lb></lb>wards—they were a yellow cloth, I should say, no pattern; plain yellow.; a sort of Buff colour—when I came up to the prisoner the second time, he was looking anxiously towards the crowd at the corner that were standing round the policeman—some of them had followed us—the prosecutrix had left the scene then—I and the policeman were walking together, and we met the prisoner just at the corner of Drury-lane—I cannot say which way he came, but I noticed him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a green-grocer's shop, at No. 26, Mason-street, Westminster-bridge-road. I have known the prisoner about four months—I have had no quarrel with him, but I certainly forbade him my house as I saw him idling about my premises in a way I did not like—that was more than three months before this—I was at home at half-past eight o'clock on the 25th of December, and the prisoner came into my shop and asked for a pennyworth of apples—I am sure it was him—I turned round to put my hand in to take some apples out of a sieve which was on my right, when I received a violent blow at the back part of my head—I did not fall—it stunned me—it confused my senses and took my sight away—I received several more blows—three cuts in the head, besides this blow on the left eye—I did not fall from the blows at all—I put up my hand to save my head, and had my middle-finger broken and cut very much by a blow—I think it is impossible the blows could have been so heavy if given with a fist—I had this hat on when I received the first blow (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is cut at the back—before that evening it was perfectly sound—my hat was knocked off by the first blow—I was not able to call for assistance—after I came to myself I called—I do not know what became of the prisoner—it must have been half an hour before I was able to call for assistance—after receiving the blows I ran into the back, par<lb></lb>lour and threw myself into a chair—I called for a policeman when I recovered and May ultimately came to my assistance—I have been forced to keep my bed till within the last four days.</p>

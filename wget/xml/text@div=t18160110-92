            . I am warehouse-man to Mr.Minier, who has a warehouse in Villier-street, in the Strand, situated about twenty yards from the warehouse of Messrs. Winchester. I was in my employer's warehouse at about twenty minutes before six o'clock; I observed a harkney coach, No. 333. at the door of Messrs. Winchester's warehouse, the door of which was open, and some men were putting paper into the coach I saw Cooper; he drove the coach; I followed the coach; it drove at the back of the New Church, and at the top of Hollywell-street, I lost it. Cooper was taken the next morning.</p>

We all helped to bring the parcels out of the coach. In consequence of something that was said, I expected the cart to come at half past six the next morning. It accordingly did so. They brought about the same quantity of paper then that they brought the night before, and of the same appearance; I observed the words "first class" was written on the parcels: that paper was put into my room. I did not see either of the others until the Thursday morning; they called me out of Mr.Thornton's factory, and asked me if I could get a cart to carry this paper away to where they wanted it: in consequence of that, I hired a cart; the carman and I loaded the cart; Jack, the Baker, and Pussey, packed the paper up. I understood there were forty-eight reams. I heard Possey, and Jack, the Baker, talking about it; they told me that they would meet me at the

Jack Winter, and I, and the others, were to meet again in the afternoon; but I was taken into custody upon this; I was locked up near where Cooper was, and I could hear a few words drop from him to the other three, who were locked up with him. Some of them asked him what he was pulled up for, and he said these goods; and said Jack Possey, and Jack, the Baker, were concerned, and he was taken up on suspicion. Jack Winter brought a newspaper to me, and read a statement that Cooper was apprehended upon this, and he said that Messrs. Winchester had offered a large reward, and he told me to keep my tongue quit, and all would be right.</p>

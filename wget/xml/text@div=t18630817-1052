                  </hi>. I reside at Boundary Cottages, Kensal-green, New Town—on Sunday, 5th July, I went with my brother, Henry Benton, to bathe in the canal—a pleasure-boat came by while we were bathing, and my brother said, "Keep in the water; there may be females in the boat"—I caught hold of the rope—the prisoner was with the boat, and he told me to loose the line—I left go directly—he said to me, "You ought to know better than to lay hold of the line, and if you had not loosed it when you did I would have given you a punch on the head"—we then got out of the water, and were dressing, when the prisoner came back to the iron bridge, and began at me, and wanted me to fight—I told him I could not fight—he said he would make me fight, and I pulled my knife out, and said if he came nigh me I would let him have the knife—my brother came up, and said, "What is the matter?"—I told him that Dixon was going to give me a smack on the mouth—my brother took up the quarrel, and said, "Fight me first"—they then fought together—my brother struck the first blow, under the throat; Dixon struck the next, on the lip—they fought for a quarter of an hour as near as I can say—they then shook hands, and my brother laid down under a hedge till the people went away—the last blow struck him on the nose—it bled very much, he could not stop it all day—he after<lb></lb>wards went home, had his dinner, and laid down a bit—he got up about half-past 5, and went to his horses—I saw him again about 8 or half-past—he seemed very well the next day, and went to a fair and a play in the even<lb></lb>ing—on the Tuesday he said "Good morning" to me just before I went out about 8 o'clock—he was then in bed—he sent for me about 2 or half-past, and they could not hold him in bed—he then was delirious—I stayed with him till half-past 6 in the evening, when he died—he never recovered his senses.</p>

               <p>have never seen bills up forbidding it—we kept as far as we could from the road—the prisoner challenged both of us—my brother took it up for me and challenged him singly—my brother was not generally in the habit of lying down on Sunday after dinner; he did sometimes—I did not go to the fair—I did not hear that my brother had had a fight there—he did not come home drunk—I did not see him when he came home—I suppose the prisoner was the boatman of this pleasure-boat—I had my shirt and stockings on when he came back—I never saw my brother drunk in my life—he was twenty<lb></lb>three years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Kensal-green—on Tuesday, 7th July I was called in to see the deceased—he was dead when I arrived—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the next morning—there were bruises under the ears, and a bruise on the centre of the nose—to these bruises under the ears there were corresponding marks internally, and still further within the cranium, were other marks corresponding with the outer marks—there was pus, the result of inflammation—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain—such marks as I saw would produce such a state of brain<lb></lb>suppuration was a mere consequence of the inflammation—that state of brain would give rise to the violent convulsions, under which he died—such marks would be caused by blows.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I do not understand you to say positively that the external marks caused the internal condition of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might—it might be attributable to other causes, falling on stones or anything of that sort—the brain was just as I should imagine it would be after injuries which happened a few days previous—the heart was empty, and thin, in a state of what we call fatty degeneration—he had disease of the heart—that was not the cause of death.</p>

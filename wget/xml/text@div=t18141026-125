            . I am a watchman; on Monday morning, the 3d of last month, I cried the hour of one o'clock, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. The prosecutor came to the door and cried watch. I went up to him directly; he said he had lost his watch, his silver snuff-box, and this handkerchief. I looked about the room; after I got the prosecutor dressed I took him to two or three different rooms; he said they were none of the girls that he knew. I took the prosecutor down to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse keeper; the watchman brought the prosecutor into the watch-house. I took down his place of abode; I and Cowley went and informed the landlord, if he did not find the women he would get into trouble. There were three apprehended. The prosecutor spoke to these two, he would not speak to the third. I shewed him the room; the prosecutor said that was the room, and the landlord of the house said they were the two women that were with him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COWLEV. I found the prisoners in Holborn, and brought them to the watchhouse; the prosecutor came and spoke to Gibbs sleeping with him, and Yeoman lighting the candle. I shewed the prosecutor the room; we searched it, and found no property at all; Gibbs gave me the key of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Were you sober - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the women at the bar - A. Gibbs is the woman I slept with, the other brought the candle.</p>

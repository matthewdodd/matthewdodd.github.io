               <p>Q. On or about the 2d of June last, did the prisoner come to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No; I never knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name did he come by - A. I cannot say, whether it was Shipman or Sheppard.</p>
               <p>Q. On what business did he call - A. To discount a bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he produce it - A. No; he wanted a bill of exchange discounted, accepted by General 
               <persName id="t18120916-84-person676">Phipps</persName>
            , payable at the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did he tell you where the bill was then lying - A. At the Marine Pay office. I said, I would make the inquiries at the Marine Pay office, and if I liked the bill, I would get it discounted. He said, I might at the same time get the bill at the Marine Pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the office, and get the bill - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill, Sir - A. Yes, Sir, this is the bill.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you or not say, to the best of your knowledge - A. I meaned to say, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you any doubt of that being the bill - A. No; I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had got the bill, did the prisoner come to you again - A. I met the prisoner at my office, on the same day or the next day. I told him it was not in my power to discount it. I would take it to Mr. Sears, close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner accompany you to Mr. Sears - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Mr. Sears for the discount - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discount it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. Because, I would not sign my name to it; he would not discount it unless I endorsed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that did the prisoner have the bill again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the back of the bill, and tell me, whether at that time, both the endorsements were there, or whether there was only one of them -

               <p>Q. You did not endorse the bill yourself - A. I wrote one letter upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What letter is that - A. J, at the back, under F. Sheppard. I was going to endorse it, but I stopped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. I think you told my lord, that you only speak to the best of your knowledge of the bill - A. Yes.</p>

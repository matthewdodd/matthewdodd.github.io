When we were at Santa Cruz, Richardson was in the hold when we were stowing rum; it is about ten weeks ago. The deceased was in the hold stowing rum; he was a little intoxicated in liquor. The man was not capable of doing his duty; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060024"></xptr>laying down on the puncheons. The mate told him to get out of the way: he took a billet of wood about twelve inches long and three inches square; he beat him shocking on the sides, shoulder, and jaw; he struck him more than three times; they were very hard blows indeed; he said, d - n your eyes, (while he was beating him) I will be your butcher. Richardson said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these blows any effect afterwards - A. Yes, the jaw was never proper afterwards; it was swelled; he could not eat his victuals, and on some day, in the homeward-bound passage (I cannot recollect the day) the deceased was at the helm. I stood on the larboard side of the windlass. I saw the mate take the main-brace, and beat him shocking. The main brace is a rope about three inches and a half round. It is not a usual rope to strike seamen with. The rope was just by him; he struck him with this rope over the sides and shoulders. Richardson stopped at the helm until he was relieved by another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he came from the helm - A. Yes, he was like a man out of Bedlam; he never had his right senses afterwards. I saw nothing at all afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive in the Thames - A. I cannot say the day of the month; it is about three weeks ago. I kept company with Richardson until the day he died. I was with him very often.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his health afterwards - A. Not the same as before; he was like a madman. Before that he spoke sensible to any man in the ship; afterwards he would chew tobacco of one side of his mouth, and eat his meat on the other side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you see the prisoner before the magistrate - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he come voluntary - A. I cannot tell. I saw him come in the first time I went. At that time the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to tell the whole before the magistrate - A. He did not ask me; he left me to tell my own story. I did not tell him all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any discipline from the mate - A. He beat me one, that was when I first came on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten to bring an action against him for that beating - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know why the prisoner beat Richardson at the helm - A. It was for something about the steerage. He struck him three times. I cannot say exactly where the blows fell.</p>

            . I was a seaman on board the Kingston on her homeward-bound voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Richardson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember anything happening between him and the mate while you were stowing the rum - A. Yes; while he was down in the hold he took a billet of wood that laid under the rum casks, and struck him with it. If it had been square all about, it was five inches round. Both ends of the billet of wood was not alike, one end about five inches and the other end three inches and a half. It was flat on one side, and corner-like on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Richardson doing when the mate struck him - A. He was sitting on the top of a cask. The hatchway was open. We were waiting for orders of the mate what we should do. The mate had given no orders. We were come from our dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in what manner did he strike Richardson - A. He struck him as hard as he could over his jaw and over his cheek. He struck him four or five blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Richardson at that time, was he drunk or sober - A. He was neither drunk nor sober; he was between both. He had drank half a pint of rum before it was served out to us.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he after this beating - 
               <persName id="t18140706-42-person393">A. </persName>
            He went working on a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Abbott by when this happened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man's cheek afterward - A. It was swelled up a little; he did not make much complaint about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, afterwards, about three weeks before you got here, do you remember anything happening at the helm - A. No, I was not up; I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the mate and him, and any thing happening to him at another time after that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Richardson when you saw anything happening - A. He was abaft the windlass. Richardson was working upon a platt, the mate came and asked him why he was doing the platt such a foolish way. He did not do the work properly. Richardson had not his proper senses, nor never had since he was driven from the helm.</p>
               <p>Q. Not having done this, what did the mate do to him - A. He struck him with a two and a half inch rope, with a foretopmast staysail halliard. He gave him six or seven blows, some over his arm, thigh, and backside, as the man turned himself about. Sometimes the mate held the rope with one hand, and sometimes with both hands. The captain came forward in the forecastle, and asked him what was the matter with him. The prisoner was not by at the time. I was not present when Richardson was driven from the helm.</p>

            . I was carpenter on board the Kingston.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day when anything happened between the mate and Richardson - A. I remember the event; it was about three weeks before we arrived at London. Richardson was at work; the mate came to him; the mate told him to go to work about the platt; the more he endeavoured to clear them the more he warped them.</p>
               <p>Q. To what was that owing - A. It appeared to me the man was quite delirious.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he always been so - A. No; a few days before we left Santa Cruz he was so, and continued so all the way home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that known by every body in the ship - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What day did you leave the country - A. I cannot say. We were six weeks coming; we got home on the 22nd of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you left the country did he become in this state - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man could not disentangle the foxes what did the mate do to him - A. He took up a rope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060025"></xptr>immediately, a three inch rope, and struck him over his back and loins. He gave him about a dozen blows altogether; they were heavy blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he after this beating - A. He was the same as before; quite out of his mind; he was quite sullen stupid; he never spoke anything to any one. He was about forty. He came on board a ruptured man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the coroner that he became ill after he received that beating, and remained so until he came on shore - A. Yes; he was the same before he was beat, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether that is not your hand-writing - A. It is, I told the coroner the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. It is here stated that he became ill soon after this beating, and continued so until he came on shore - A. That is not true.</p>

Yes; I cannot say exactly the day of the month; it was between two and three weeks before the ships arrival; it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning; as he was at the helm, the mate took up a three-inch rope, and struck him about eight blows, as nigh as I can tell; he struck him two or three blows over the head, and some more over the body. He took the rope in both hands. About two o'clock in the same day he received some more blows from the mate as he was standing on the larboard side, abaft the windlass. Some of the people were swinging the mast up; he was not to it; it was his duty to do it if he had been in his proper senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive at any time that he was not in his proper senses - A. I asked him several questions that day, and received no answer from him: he continued in that state until he arrived at home.</p>

            . I live in Bluegate-place, Shadwell. Richardson lodged in my house before this voyage, and when he returned home he came to my house as usual. When he came, he came to the window instead of to the door: he came as though his brain was turned, and his eyes were turned in his head. I sent for a tailor, and had him some clothes made, and a shoemaker for some shoes. He had his breakfast, and went to Shadwell office. I did not go with him, nor did I did I know of it until next day. As soon as he had been to the office he came home and went to bed. This was on Wednesday that he came home to my house; on Thursday he got up, and wanted to go out again; I took his hat from him, and told him I did not want any law work. On Friday morning I sent for a doctor; he was gritting his teeth as if in a convulsion fit. Dr. Ball came, and Mr. Rutherford likewise. Richardson never got out of his bed; he died on Monday morning.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I opened the body of Richardson. Upon examining the body I found several bruises; one on each of his sides, and on the left arm, and particularly under the left ear, and two or three slight bruises about the head. I opened the head, and perceived the man's death was occasioned from inflammation of the brain, the cause of which I cannot say. The bruises might be the cause of it, or might not. Principally an inflammation arises from excessive drinking of spirits.</p>

            ." I saw him after that at the house, I bought it at the same place where I saw him at, when I saw him he was acting as the master I believe; on asking for some of Mr. Paine's works he hesitated selling them, but after some little conversation he sold me some.</p>
               <p>Q Did any conversation pass between you at that time when you saw him with respect to the book you had bought? - He objected to selling me those I wanted, I wanted</p>

               <p>"The Address to the Addressers," I told him I had bought</p>
               <p>"The Rights of Man," there before; and his wife, I believe, or a woman that I considered to be his wife, said, that she had sold that gentleman</p>
               <p>"The Rights of Man," with some other of Mr. Paine's works, a little while ago, I believe he said, did you? after that he let me have the other books I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day you bought the Rights of Man? - The 17th of January.</p>

               <p>"Common Sense, and the first Parts of the Rights of Man."</p>
               <p>Page 18,</p>
               <p>"It cannot be proved by what right hereditary government could begin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290163"></xptr>neither does there exist within the compass of mortal power a right to establish it, man has no authority over posterity in matters of personal right, and therefore no man or body of men had or can have a right to set up hereditary government."</p>
               <p>Page 19,</p>
               <p>"Hereditary succession is a burlesque upon monarchy, it puts it in the most ridiculous light, by presenting it as an office which any child or an ideot may fill, it requires some talents to be a common mechanic, but to be a King requires only the animal figure of a man, a sort of breathing automaton; this sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the awakened reason and interest of man."</p>
               <p>Page 20,</p>
               <p>"A government calling itself free with a hereditary office, is like a thorn in the flesh, which produces a fermentation which discharges it."</p>
               <p>Page 21,</p>
               <p>"The hereditary system therefore is, as repugnant to human wisdom as to human rights, and is as absurd as it is unjust."</p>
               <p>Page 25,</p>
               <p>"Whether I have too little sense to see, or too much to be imposed upon; whether I have too much or too little pride, or of any thing else, I leave out of the question; but certain it is, that what is called monarchy always appears to me a silly contemptible thing. I compare it to something behind a curtain, about which there is a great deal of bustle and fuss, and a wonderful air of seeming solemnity; but when by any accident the curtain happens to open and the company see what it is, they burst into laughter."</p>
               <p>Page 26,</p>
               <p>"That monarchy is all a bubble, a mere court artifice to procure money, is evident at least to me in every character which it can be viewed."</p>
               <p>Page 27,</p>
               <p>"It can only be by blinding the understanding of man, and make him believe that government is some wonderful mysterious thing, that excessive revenues are obtained. Monarchy is well calculated to ensure this end. It is the popery of government, a thing kept up to amuse the ignorant, and quiet them into taxes."</p>
               <p>Court to Humphries. Was it the latter end of January or beginning of February that you bought this book? - I bought it the 17th of January, but I saw him at his house subsequent to this; I bought it of a woman.</p>

On Saturday the 16th of April, about two in the morning, the prisoner broke in at the sash window of my tap room; he broke the shutter and wrenched the bolt. I went to bed about twelve o'clock; when the shutters were wrenched, the sash would throw up; I did not observe whether it was shut or not; I observed the shutter wrenched and the bolt broke about the middle; I lost about twenty shillings worth of halfpence; there was about ten crown papers made up, and about four or five were wanting; he gave me one of the papers out of his pocket in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the halfpence that night?</p>
               <p>Watson. I had seen them the day before, and there had been none taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this boy before?</p>
               <p>Watson. No. The halfpence were in a bureau in the parlour, which was broke open; we found a hat standing full of halfpence, and a chissel, and a dark lanthorn; a small chissel was taken out of his pocket; the other lay with the halfpence and a dark lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Where did you find me, in the tap room, or was I brought in?</p>
               <p>Watson. He was taken out of another man's yard, and brought into the tap room.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I was sitting in my box about two o'clock; I heard a cracking as if something was a breaking: I thought I would give them time to get in; I let it alone till the clock struck two; then I walked up to this gentleman's house; I saw the shutter was broke, and the bolt wrenched partly off; all of a sudden two men jumped out of the window upon me; I plied upon them with my stick as well as I could, but them two got off; the prisoner got up into the window in order to follow them; he was inside in the tap room; I knocked him back with my stick into the tap room again; then I put the shutter to, and called to Mr. Watson; but before he came down the prisoner found his way backward, and got into the second yard, Mr. Cook's; Mr. Cook and his wife got up; Mrs. Cook called out, watchman, here he is; I ran into the passage and collared him; he put his hands directly into his pocket and took out a parcel of halfpence, which he scattered upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know when you saw him that he was the same person you knocked back in the window?</p>
               <p>Guest. Yes; I had my lanthorn in my hand; I know him very well; I took him up once before about a hat he stole. I took him into Mr. Watson's tap room; as soon as I got him there he said to Mr. Watson, here, take your money; he gave him some halfpence; I saw one handful loose; I took him to the watch-house and delivered him up to the constable of the night. In the tap room I found a chissel, a dark lanthorn, and a hat, and another chissel was taken out of the prisoner's pocket at the watch-house; I saw it taken out by the constable, and at the same time a tobacco box with tinder in it, and part of a bunch of matches.</p>

            . I live in Little Windmill-street, next door but one to the prosecutor. On the 16th of April I heard the watchman give the alarm of thieves, about two o'clock in the morning; that there were thieves in a house I could understand as I was in my bed; I got out of bed; my wife followed me; I saw the watchman at Mr. Watson's shutter, holding it; he said two men had got out; that there was one in the house, and he should not get out; he called Mr. Watson once or twice; in the mean time I heard somebody stepping behind me in the passage; I turned in to fasten the door and see who it was; I laid hold of him, and found it was the prisoner; he submitted himself, and said it would be a deal of charity, as he was a young lad, to let him out; I had no candle; it was dark; I had hold of his fingers; he made no resistance; my wife took hold of him while I went to the door, and told the watchman we had the thief; the watchman came and took him away; there were a good many halfpence dropped from him in my passage; they were picked up by the watchman.</p>

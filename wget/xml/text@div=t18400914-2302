                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 117.) On the 10th of September I was in Ratcliffe-highway. I saw the prisoner and another man going along, appearing to quarrel—the prisoner had something—I asked what he had got, he said, "Beer"—I pulled his coat on one side, and took a keg of wine from under his waistcoat—I took them, and then went to the London-dock, and found a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Florence,</hi> and there I found a cask of Madeira wine with two new spiles in it, and the place was wet—I took a sample from that cask, and it tallied with that in the keg—I found on the prisoner a gimlet.</p>

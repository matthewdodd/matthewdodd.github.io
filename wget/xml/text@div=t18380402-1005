                  </hi>. I live with my father, Thomas Higgin-bottom, in Charles-street, Lisson-grove. At a quarter past seven o'clock, on the with of March, I saw the prisoner go into No. 5, which belongs to my father—in a quarter of an hour I saw him come out with the range on his shoulder—I ran half way up the street, and stopped him—I told him to put it down, which he did, and told me to take it home, but I followed him—he struck at me twice with an umbrella—I then followed him to William-street into Stephen-street—where my father came up, and took him—he was then in the act of striking me.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was up the last in the house? - I believe it was myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you alarmed in the night? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get up in the morning? - At five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe when you got up? - I was not up first, when I got up I found the door was open, and from one of the windows, an iron bar had been taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bar in the window the over night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see that bar the over night? - I did not take particular notice of it that night, but I never see it out; it was in a very conspicious place, it stood by the door.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand that you was the last up in the house? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had made no particular observation about these bars before you went to bed? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in point of fact, whether it was there when you went to bed, you will not take on you to swear? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen this property before? - Some of it that day, and the whole, or the greater part of it very lately.</p>

               <p>I have known him about twenty-five or twenty-six years; I have dealt with him with cakes that I travel in the country with, and I always found him a very fair dealing man.</p>
               <p>HENRY LEMOINE sworn.</p>
               <p>I come to speak for William Clinch; I am a copper plate printer and bookseller, I employed him upwards of twelve months, from November 1792 to 1793; I can say, while he worked for me, he behaved as he ought to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clinch. The witness, Smith, I would wish to have him asked whether he did not deny knowing of me on his first examination?</p>
               <p>Smith. How could I deny knowing of you, when we were both taken in company together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Smith. Did you deny it, or do you not? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to know if any of the articles that Levy is supposed to purchase, was found in Levy's house?</p>
               <p>Court. No none of the articles found at all there. I ought to state that to you, that you find this Moses had immediate intelligence of these people being taken up, from the wife of Smith, she went to him immediately and told him; therefore it is not very unreasonable to suppose that whatever property he might have, that might serve for a conviction to himself, that he would dispose of it, as he had time to do it.</p>

               <p>- INGLIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Perry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having any spoons? - Yes, he lost one about the last of September, and I missed it the 1st of October, and I missed some before that, there were six in all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. From where did you miss them? - From the place where I kept them, below stairs in a cupboard; I had seen them on the Monday before they were taken, the prisoner was the only person that I thought could have them because she was a charewoman in the house, I went and found some spoons at a pawnbroker's in Berwick-street.</p>
               <p>- BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I have got two spoons, a table spoon and two tea spoons; I took the table spoon of the prisoner at the bar; I questioned her at the time she brought it, who she brought it from, she said from one Mr. Clark of Margaret-street. I had known the prisoner for years by using the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when that was? - On the 30th of August; I took in the table spoon, there was a tea spoon that was taken in the 9th of May; I did not take in the other tea spoon.</p>

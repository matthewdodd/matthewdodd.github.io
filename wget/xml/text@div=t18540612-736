                  </hi>. I arrived at Uxbridge on Saturday last, and went to bed at the Bell public house—I laid my trowsers on a table near the bed; in the pocket of them was a sovereign in a little book, 2 French sous, and two brass rings—I got up at 8 o'clock in the morning, and missed them—I told a policeman—these brass rings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ropemaker. On Saturday last I was at the Bell public-house, Uxbridge—the prisoner slept in the same room with me—he was not in the room when I went to bed—I awoke in the night, and saw a candle burning in the room, but there was no one there—I had put my candle out, and it surprised me very much—in about three minutes the prisoner came into the room; he looked at me very hard for about two minutes, but I pretended to be asleep, and he went out again, and pushed the door to—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he came back, and looked at me again—I pretended to be asleep, and he sat down on the foot of the bed, pulled something out, examined it, wrapped it in paper, and then put it up the chimney—he then put his hand to his tongue, and rubbed it on</p>

               <p>his trowsers—it was a little box of some sort that he had, but what was in it I could not see—he put something into it, put it into his left hand waist-coat pocket, and it seemed to rattle against something—when I awoke in the morning he was gone—I heard of the robbery, pointed out the chimney to a policeman, and saw him find there two copper coins and two rings—I did not give an alarm at the time, because I did not know anything was going on wrong, and I was in a strange place.</p>

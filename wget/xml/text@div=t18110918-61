That is my writing on the note, 31st of May, Postman. That is the note that I received of the prisoner to the best of my knowledge. He paid me a note. I wrote on the note he gave me 31st of May, Postman. I believe it to be my writing. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Q. You might have wrote one day for another, but no farther, and that is what you have no knowledge about - A. No.</p>
               <p>SARAH AKER. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I have seen him before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any direction about taking out of pawn - A. Yes. It was pawned for five shillings. He gave me a ten pound note to get it changed, and to redeem my ring.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you were to carry it to the pawnbrokers, take your ring out of pawn, receive the change and bring the change to him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the pawnbroker - A. Mr. Alder, Berwick-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the ten pound note to Mr. Alders for the purpose of redeeming your ring - A. I did, and offered it in payment of the five shillings, and desired change. The man went to get change, I believe; I delivered the note to a young man; he came back and said they could not change it; he did not exchange it, and I had it away again.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did the prisoner give you any other note by which you did get the ring redeemed - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the next day - A. I am not certain. I cannot tell exactly what day he gave me the ten pound note. It was soon after I got a one pound note of him, and I got my ring out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the ten pound note after you received it back from the pawnbrokers - A I carried it back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by the name of Beazely - A. The ring was pledged in the name of Beazley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Perhaps you go by many names - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot recollect what day this was - A. No I cannot.</p>

            . I live in Long-alley, Moorfields; my husband is a shoe-maker. I was at Highbury; I never saw the prisoner before that, nor the prosecutor. I was trying to get into the gardens. The prosecutor turned round, put his hand to his fob, and said, "I have lost my watch." He took hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have got my watch. He put his hand to his fob. The prosecutor appeared to be very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Very much so, did he - A. Yes, he smelt so, walked so, and could hardly stand. He called for an officer, who took the prisoner into custody. He said,"You have got my watch;" the prisoner denied it. He(the prisoner) never moved or struggled at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Not struggle at all - A. No; nor even attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you think the man was so drunk that he did not know what he was about - A. I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know where the prisoner lived - A. No, he was a perfect stranger to me; I did not know where he lived, nor do I know now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the prisoner where you lived - A. Yes, I told him at Islington where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at the time - A. At home-at Highbury Barn; I left him there, while I went up with the prisoner. My husband was in the gardens; he had been there about half an hour; I did not see him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk home with him - A. No, I missed him, and went home; but I did not go home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the spot where you left your husband from where the man was robbed - A. About four or five yards; I left him to go with the prisoner. I left my husband in the gardens half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the spot where the robbery was committed - A. Within one hundred yards. He got home before me, because I went before the magistrate at Islington; the magistrate was not at home. I saw nothing of my husband till I got home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer who first came up - A. Yes, he delivered him to another officer. The first officer did not go before the magistrate. I do not know his name.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I am not at all concerned in this case. I was at Highbury, on that day, with the Jewish free-school children. This accusation occurred about five o'clock in the afternoon. When I came out of the garden, I saw a mob on the outside of the house, and saw the prisoner; the prosecutor had hold of him. I knew neither of them. I asked what was the matter? He said a man had been robbed of his watch. I said is that man robbed? He said, No. The prosecutor put his hand down to the prisoner's trowsers.</p>

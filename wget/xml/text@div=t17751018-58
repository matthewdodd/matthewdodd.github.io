            . I am nephew to Mr. Morgan, a plaisterer, who lives near Lady Mostyn's house; we had care of the house while Lady Mostyn was out of town. Upon the 4th of October, I got up at six o'clock in the morning; while I was waiting at the door, Lady Mostyn's door opened, and Archer came out with a basket upon his head; Reading came out after him; I pursued Archer, and took him in Swallow-street, about two hundred yards from Lady Mostyn's house, which is in <placeName id="t17751018-58-crimeloc270">Hanover-street, Hanover-square</placeName>

After we had took them, we brought them back to my uncle's door, and informed him what had happened; we sent for a constable, he searched the prisoners; out of Reading's pocket he took a dark lanthorn, matches, a flint, and a couple of knives. Mr. Clarke examined the basket; the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of the basket. It was tied up with a cloth over it; we took them before the justices at the rotation in Litchfield-Street; both the prisoners were examined. There they were asked what they had to say in their defence? Archer said, they had little to say; Redding said, he never was in the house, but a dark lantern was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was Redding taken?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Directly too.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I believe the clock had not struck six; they were taken in five minutes after they came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. from Archer. Whether you saw me come from the door, or out of the house?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I saw Archer come out and shut the door; there were a couple of pieces of cork lay at the door.</p>

             again. I took it upon Archer. Mr. Clarke, the constable of the night, came soon after; I desired he would attend to the goods in the basket. I sat down and opened it; it contained the goods here produced. I took Archer to justice Mercer first to be examined; he wished to be an evidence. Justice Mercer did not choose to admit him: then I brought him back, and kept them in custody till the afternoon, when I took them to the rotation office in Titchfield-Street, before Mr. Mercer, and several other justices, and took the goods contained in the basket there.</p>
               <p>Court. Don't mention any thing he said, when under the expectation of being admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Cooper. I went to Lady Mostyn's house afterwards and searched it, and found the locks broke: the lock of the street door did not appear the least damaged. We found these picklocks of different sizes, and a tinder-box (producing them). I went up stairs and found a quantity of wearing apparel, and a great deal of table-linen strewed all over the house from the first floor up to the garret. I went into the rooms, and found every lock, I believe, broke open; I don't know that one lock escaped. Some clothes presses which they could not break open, the backs of the woodwork was broke all round, and they had eased themselves in both these rooms. I found these two tea-pots in the kitchen, and the two silver spouts which were found in the basket to fit them exactly.</p>

               <p>(The things found in the basket were produced in court, and deposed to by her particularly; several gowns, the stomachers of which were left in the house, which were produced; two silver boxes, and the two tea pots, the spouts of which were found in the basket.)</p>
               <p>I locked the tea-pots up in a little cupboard in the kitchen; that cupboard door was broke open, and the pots were left.</p>
               <p>Archer's Defence.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge their taking the basket from me; I found it with the things in the entry; the door was open as I went by in the morning.</p>
               <p>Redding's Defence.</p>
               <p>Archer came and called me up a little after five in the morning, to take a walk with him. I got up, and as we were going by Lady Mostyn's door, we saw the door open; we went in and found the basket in the passage; he took it up; there was a dark lantern in the basket; he brought out the basket, and I pulled to the door: the dark lantern dropped out of the basket. I took it up and put it in my pocket.</p>

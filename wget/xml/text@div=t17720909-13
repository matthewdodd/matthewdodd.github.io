               <p>Mr. Legh. On Wednesday the 6th of May, I spent the evening with some friends in Gate Street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I staid there till between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; there is a court yard before the house; the servant of the gentleman at whose house I was came out with a candle, and lighted me quite into the street. I went towards Lincoln's-inn-fields; when I came towards the end of the street, <placeName id="t17720909-13-crimeloc55">near Stonecutter's alley</placeName>

I called out for assistance, upon which I received some other blows upon my head, and was very soon brought to the ground; when I got up, I did not see any one; I saw my wig about a yard from me; I took it up and called for the watch; the watch came and went with me to my lodgings. I never saw or heard any person, I only felt them. I have not recovered the right use of my arm yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any injury upon your head?</p>
               <p>Legh. No; I was bruised on my right side by the fall. I believe the blows upon my head were given with a pistol.</p>

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. Giles, of the division which Lincoln's-inn-fields is in. I have known Davis eight years, and Poulton about three quarters of a year or a twelve-month. I know Poulton and Davis are intimate, they have told me so, and I have often seen Dixon with them.</p>

             an evidence about three months ago; I have never been in his company since. Why did he not tell of this robbery then? I never was in company more than meeting with him in a public house.</p>

            . I never knew any harm of Davis before; she has often pawned things at our shop; she has sometimes pawned things for other people.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Legh. Do you remember meeting any people in Gate Street?</p>
               <p>Mr. Legh. I think I did just as I came into the street but I cannot be certain.</p>

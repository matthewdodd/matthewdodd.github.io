                  </hi>. I am son-in-law of the prosecutor, and manage the business for him. The prisoner was in hit employ to overlook the men, and then afterwards to go round on Mondays, show samples of paper, and try to get orders, which he ought to enter in an order-book, and the price at which the articles were sold, and then at the end of the month I would give him invoices sealed up to deliver to the customers—it was his duty to receive money and hand it over to me, and checks also—here is no entry in the order-book of these twenty reams of paper to Mr. Simmons—this invoice to Mr. Simmons is not mine; I believe it to be the prisoner's—here is his name on the back of the check, in his writing—when the prisoner was first employed his wages were 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and after he began to sell 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and his expenses to London—that was what he was receiving at this time—I bad a conversation with him about the amount due from Spalding and Hodge; I asked him whether they had paid it, or when they would pay, on Friday, 6th Dec—I used to go down to the paper-mill every Friday to make up the time-book—he said, "On next Monday"—be has never paid me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on account of Mr. Simmons: I know nothing of the transaction; there is no entry of it in any book, I have only discovered it since his apprehension—it was his duty, when he received money, to hand it to me, and I would make the entry—I have never received this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor this 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the orders were supplied it was his duty to enter them in the day<lb></lb>book, in the excise-book, and the check-book—there is no entry of Mr.</p>

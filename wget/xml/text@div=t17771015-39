               <p>On Friday night, between 11 and 12, I saw a hackney coach stand at a house which was notorious for receiving stolen goods; I had a suspicion of the prisoners; Fry came out and opened the coach-door, and took out a sack with the sheeting in it; I asked what he had got; he said, what is that to you; I laid hold of the man and of the sack; the woman of the house took the candle away, and carried it into the back parlour; she put out the lights that were in the parlour; I asked Fry how he came by the things; he said, his wife, who worked for the people in the Tower, ordered him to pawn these things; this increased my suspicion: I put Fry and the sack into the coach; I searched Fry, and found this picklock key in his pocket (producing it); on Monday morning I went to the Tower to inquire into the matter; I tried the warehouse door with the key and that key unlocked it (the sheets were produced in Court).</p>

               <p>I am barrack-master, and have the care of the bedding and sheets; on Saturday last I went to try the barrack, and found it open; I suspected something was lost, and had the sheets counted, and missed 23 pair. On Monday the constable came, and asked if we had been robbed; I told him we had; he said he had stopped a soldier who was in custody: I went to the justice's, Fry was sent for, the sheets were produced; they are the same that are now produced, they are his majesty's property;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150048"></xptr> Fry owned he had been in the warehouse on the Monday before with a soldier of the first regiment, and said that the soldier had taken away two bundles of sheets; Fry was then upon guard, and so could not attend his accomplice out of the Tower, but he attended him to the gate, with the sheets in a sack; he said he had sold them, but would not confess for what money; he owned he had got in by means of that key. I was present at the examination of Price; he said he was called upon by Fry to assist him; that he went with him near the store-room, and held the sack while Fry put in the two bundles of sheets, and afterwards carried a bundle part of the way to the mint, where he employed him to call a coach; that he brought the coach into the Tower, and ordered the coachman to drive up to the mint; that he met Fry with the bag containing the linen; that he put the bag into the coach, and told the coachman he had no occasion to get off the box; that Fry got into the coach, and he returned to the barracks.</p>
               <p>[The lock of the storehouse-door was produced, and the key of that lock, and the picklock-key which was found upon Fry.]</p>

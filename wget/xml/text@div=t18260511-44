            . I live at Brentford. On the 14th of March I was at a public-house with Harris and Ayres - we left there about nine o'clock - Ayres proposed that we should get a few turnip greens; Harris said "Let us get something worth while;" we all went up Sion-lane - Harris and White got over some palings; Ayres eased me over - he and Harris got on the roof of a cow-house, and pulled the tiles off; I ran out and got on the other side of the pails - Harris called to White to ease the lead off the top, which he did - Harris and Ayres got off the tiles - White carried the lead on his back to Whale's-field - we broke it into three pieces, and left it till the morning - we all slept in the sand-house - Harris and Rowley went to the spot next morning, and the lead was gone; I was afterwards taken before a Justice, and made a voluntary confession.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge on the 18th of March, and told him it was for stealing lead from the Duke of Northumberland; I took him to the Black Horse public-house, and he there voluntarily told the landlady that he was let in for seven penny-worth - she said it served him right if he deserved it; he said "I do deserve it, for I carried the lead off the Duke's ground;" he said he should be transported for seven years.</p>

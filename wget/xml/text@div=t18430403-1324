                  </hi>. I live in Park-place, City-road. I was present at a marriage, between John Henry Bate and the prisoner, at St. Pancras-church, on the 25th of December, 1834—I witnessed the register—her name was then Georgiana Matilda Cartwright—the prisoner is the woman—Mr. Bate is now alive—they lived together about twelve months—I frequented their place after they were married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But you have seen them since then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen her above once or twice—I was in this box, I think, in April, 1839—I saw Mrs. Bate here then, and Mr. Bate was convicted and sent to prison—I heard he went to America some time after—I cannot say how long he re<lb></lb>mained there—I have not seen him till within these few days—I cannot say whether he married Elizabeth Chapman—I have not been to his house—I cannot say where he lives, nor how many children he has by this female—I do not know anything of his second marriage—I visited him and the prisoner about twelve months after their marriage—I do not know how he treated her—I never saw him use a poker to her—I do not know of her taking in wash<lb></lb>ing—I have heard of her applying to Cripplegate-work house for relief, but I do not know it—she has some imperfection in her speech which is very much against her getting her living—Mr. Bate stated before the Magistrate that he had been to America.</p>

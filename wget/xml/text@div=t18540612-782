                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 86, London-road, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. On the night of 27th April, I made the house secure about eleven o'clock—I was the last person up—I secured the kitchen window by a button—no one could get in there without breaking the glass—there was no glass broken then—I was alarmed about half past 2 o'clock—I got up and examined the premises—I found the kitchen window had been broken; a square of glass had been broken close to the button, and the window was open—I went to the parlour, and found the bureau was broken; I missed from there about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of copper, half a dozen spoons, a salt spoon, and a pair of silver shirt studs—they had all been safe the night before—I found on my premises a strong screw-driver, close by the bureau in the parlour, and under the table a piece of yellow taper, which had not been there the night before.</p>

On the night of 27th April, I went there at 11 o'clock at night, and stopped there all night—at half past 2 o'clock I heard somebody walking in the parlour, which is over the bakehouse where I was—I went up stairs, and saw a man walk from the parlour door round to the till—he pulled at it two or three times—he had a lighted candle in his hand, and I saw his face well—it was the prisoner—I was going to him, and I stumbled on the top of the stairs—I made some noise with that, and the prisoner saw me, and he went from behind the counter to the parlour door—I got up, and was going to take hold of him—he <hi rend="italic">banged</hi> the door in my face and went to the kitchen—I went to the kitchen door, and saw him jump through the kitchen window, which would take him into London-street, which turns out of the London-road—the house is the corner house—I made an alarm—I opened the side door, and called "Stop thief!"—in about an hour I saw the policeman with the prisoner—I knew him again directly.</p>

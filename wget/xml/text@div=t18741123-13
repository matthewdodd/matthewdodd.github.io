                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Moore and Prior, wholesale tea and coffee merchants, of Lime Street, City—many years ago the prisoner was in the employ of the prosecutors; he left, and went else where, and about 1st February, 1873, he returned to the employ, and was made warehouseman, at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was afterwards moved into the office—he conducted himself with great propriety—a vacancy occurred in the traveller's department, and he was appointed to that vacancy about the middle of April—his first journey was made about 23rd April; he commenced that duty at a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and seven guineas a week for expenses; he was afterwards advanced to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, at the end of</p>

               <p>the year—I had to make arrangements with the travellers—the arrangement I made with the prisoner was that he should return a full account of all monies be received daily, names, and amounts, at night by post, with any orders that he might take—he was to remit every night as nearly as pos sible—he was, from time to time, supplied from the office in London with the names of customers from whom accounts were owing—among other customers were Mr. Heath and Mr. Argyle, of Great Yarmouth, and Mr. Hickman—prior to Saturday, 26th September, a letter was sent to him—he came up on 26th September—I asked him if he was prepared with a statement of his accounts—he said "I shall be directly"—I left him and went into the office; he followed me in and asked me how much I made his salary due to him—I told him I made it 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went into the sale room to check the amount—it was the practice to pay him his salary monthly, and it had been regularly paid—his travelling expenses were paid weekly every Saturday, remitted by cheque; he said to me "You had better give me my cheque for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I said "No, I can't give you your cheque, give me your account first"—he said "I' am not prepared to pay you the full balance unless you hand me over my cheque"—I think he had shown me an account of monies received by him at that time; it is attached to the deposition; this is it—it is headed "W. F. Seobie, 19th September, 1874," and the total brought out is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that would balance it with the wages, which it would—I then said "I have an I O U here for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. lent you by Mr. Prior; you had better pay that; are you prepared to pay it?"—he said "No, I can't do it"—I said "Under the circumstances, you had better have some conversation with the firm, both members of the firm being on the premises at the time"—he saw them, and I saw no more of him that day—on Monday, the 28th, he attended at the premises again—he said "Well, I think, upon consideration, I had better pay that I O U of Mr. Prior's; are you prepared to receive it in full settlement; if I pay that can you give me my discharge"—I said "No, I can't, because you have not paid me the full amount, deducting is not paying"—he' paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said it must be left <hi rend="italic">to the</hi> firm," and it was left, the partners were then away—on the Friday following I went down to Slough and gave him into custody—he has never accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Mr. Heath and Mr. Argyle on 22nd August, or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Hickman—Mr. Hickman's name, with the amount, was forwarded to him on 12th September for collection—the prisoner has written against it "not due."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found him at home at Slough—I did not know at that time that he was in the employ of Messrs. Wyatt &amp; Edwards, of 66, Mark Lane—I know it now—they are in the same line of business as the prosecutor—there was a disputed claim between me and the prisoner upon what are called fictitious orders—they are orders returned by the traveller, not given to him by a customer—if there had been profits they would be divided between the firm and the traveller, if he was a commission traveller—the prisoner made a claim for it—I wanted to charge him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound on some of those fictitious orders—he had a verbal agreement with the firm—I did not make it with him, and was not present when it was made—I told him I thought he had better pay the claim on the fictitious orders before I paid him his salary—he said he would not do anything of the kind, because he considered the money was due to him—I have said when I was examined before that I felt that the claim was a little doubtful—I</p>

               <p>have known him about thirteen or fourteen years, or perhaps more—I have written to him—I did not call upon him for an explanation of these accounts from the Monday till I gave him into custody—I had not had any quarrel with him—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I do not consider that my master was getting childish, or that I am sometimes inclined to use the cane to him, or that I would have done so long ago but for the consolation of knowing that he could not last long, and that he was a regular old humbug—I am not aware that I have expressed myself in that way—about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed through the prisoner's hands in the fifteen months—I don't think he collected on an average from thirteen towns in a week—I would not say he did not—the whole of his defalcations amount to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This list represents the various towns he collected from, and the amounts of each—he sent up remittances from time to time—I had no idea he was in Wyatt &amp; Edwards' employ at the time 1 gave him into custody—I know now that he was not actually in their employ, but waiting subject to references being given—the fictitious orders were sent up by the prisoner from the country—as far as I could judge at that time, they were orders that had been given by persons—in some cases goods were supplied on the faith of those orders—the goods were returned to us in all the instances, after an interval of over a week—we claimed from the prisoner for the loss of profit—the prisoner did not claim anything from us for those orders—he disputed the firm being entitled to anything from him—I did not make any claim from him on the 29th for that—I asked him for it; it was not in the account at all—I considered the account a little doubtful, and I did not press it.</p>

I did not expect that the law would allow us to claim from the traveller the amount of profit that we should get if the goods were delivered to the customers—there were two or three instances where goods were returned, and we were at the expense of carriage both ways—I could not say whether in any case the goods were retained, although the order had not been given—there was no claim for part profit on such orders—the firm would not divide profits with the traveller in such cases—I have not said so; if I did it was a mistake—I could not have under stood the question—the prisoner was not a commission traveller—a commission traveller would have a profit in such cases—Argyle name does not appear in this list; that was an omission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't recollect his saying that he could not make his balance right at Yarmouth, and he did not know whether I had paid him or not—I remember his writing to me about a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asking me to tell him what it was that I had paid him last—that was when he was out on a journey between July 1st and August 9th—he said he had a cash balance at Yarmouth, and he could not understand it—he was in the habit of coming to me for orders about once in six weeks—generally the goods came after the invoice; if I accepted the invoice the goods were supplied.</p>

The prisoner came to our house in October last; it was in the absence of my husband; he requested to see Mr. Benham. On his being informed he was not at home he went into the back parlour; he staid there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then said he could stay no longer. He told me he had made an appointment with Mr. Benham. After he had sat there some time he went out. In about half an hour after he was gone I missed my husband's gold watch. I have no doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

Yes, I remember seeing him at my master's house on Tuesday the 5th of October; he came there; he asked me if my master was at home; I said, no, he was not at home, but he would be at home at five o'clock; he said, that was strange, he had promised to meet him there at half past two. He said no more to me, but walked down the passage into the back parlour. I am sure he is the man. The next time I saw him again was a fortnight ago last Saturday.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 5th of October, the prisoner came to me and offered a gold watch to sell; I asked him what he wanted for it; he told me eight guineas. I offered him six; he said he had been offered six in pledge. He agreed to take six pounds fifteen shillings for the watch; I gave him that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. No, never; he is the same man. When I gave him the six pounds fifteen shillings for the watch, he took out of his pocket three gold seals and a key. I gave him fifteen shillings for them. I asked him where he got the watch; he said he bought it of the maker, Mr. Watford, in Ryder-street, St. James's. He said he was going to Gibralter the next week, it was of no use his pledging it, he might not be back in time to redeem it, but if I had it when he came back he would purchase it again of me. I asked him his name, and where he lived; he said his name was

            , he lived at 54, in East Smithfield. On the Monday following, a hand bill came from Bow-street office, describing such a watch to have been stolen. I set out immediately to go to Bow-street; in my way there I learned that Mr. Essex of the Strand had been making enquiry about the watch. I went to Mr. Essex; he said it was his daughter's watch. I delivered the watch to Mr. Essex; he desired me to stop the man if ever I saw him. On the 22nd of January the same man came -</p>
               <p>Q. That is the prisoner - A. Yes; and offered me another watch to pledge. I looked steadfastly at him; he said, I sold you a gold watch a few months ago, have you parted with that. I told him I had, and I immediately sent for an officer; the officer came; I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY ESSEX. I received the watch; I gave my daughter the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Can you swear to the watch - A.No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Essex. I gave the watch to my daughter; I can swear to it; the number of it was entered in my book, and this watch answers to that number. I know the watch from the general appearance of it; the maker's name on it is W. Watford, Ryder-street, St. James's. I gave it to my daughter a long time ago; it is near three years ago.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

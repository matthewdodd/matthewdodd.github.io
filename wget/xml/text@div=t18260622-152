The prisoner came to my shop on the 30th of May, and asked to look at some paper; I shewed him several sorts, and he chose four reams - he told me to send them home with a bill and receipt, and he would send the money back - I sent my man about an hour afterwards, and told him to bring back the money - that was the agreement I made with the prisoner; I should not have let him have them without the money; they came to 35s.; my man came back without the goods or money.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Jeffryes. He gave me four reams of paper and the receipt, to take to No. 2, Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane; I had orders to get the money - when I got there the prisoner was not at home; I was told to wait, as he would be there presently - I waited some time, and, being impatient, I asked for the paper, back again; they told me to wait a little longer, and then he came, and said, "Oh! there you are - I have been and paid your master; have you got the bill and receipt?" I said I had; he asked if my name was to it - I said No, it was not necessary. I gave them to him, and thought he had paid master.</p>

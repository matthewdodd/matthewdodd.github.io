             wanted to make a will and power to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Speck. Look at that upper indorsement on the will, is that your handwriting? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Where did you take that information from? - From the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because these questions are always asked, and these questions I did ask him, this was taken from him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all of the will, I never produced it in my life, I deny that I am the person that produced the will.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Has there ever been any other claimant? - It does not appear, the wages are still unpaid.</p>
               <p>Fletcher. The probate was revoked the 10th day of this month, and administration granted to the brother.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character, and Mr. Finley, the surgeon.</p>

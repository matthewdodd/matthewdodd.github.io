                  </hi>. On the night of 8th Aug., about 10 o'clock, I was at the Star and Garter public house, near Ealing—there were several persons there, but they were not with me—I had no purse, but I took out my money to pay for what I had—I had just to look to see that I did not give a half sovereign for a sixpence—I took my money in my hand, and the persons who were there had an opportunity of seeing it—after leaving I went towards Acton, and when I got near the railway station, Sarah Paynter spoke to me—she said, "Are you going home?"—I said, "Yes, are you?"—I saw her face—we walked on a little further together, and shortly afterwards I was struck at the back—the blow knocked me forward to the ground, and stunned me—after I recovered I found my pockets turned inside out, and I missed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—in consequence of that I gave a description of Sarah Paynter to the first police<lb></lb>man</p>

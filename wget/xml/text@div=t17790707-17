               <p>Was your pocket-book in your coat pocket? - I had the same clothes on that I have now; it was in the inside pocket of my coat; the memorandum book was in the same pocket; they were both gone together, with a toothpick-case I had in my waistcoat pocket, the toothpick-case was found the next day in a place they put their coals in, in their lodging. I charged her with taking my things; she then gave me a multiplicity of words, of blasting and swearing, and said I should not stay there; I said if she did not discover the pocket-book to me I would call the watch. Finding she would not discover where the pocket-book was, I lifted up the sash and called out for the watch; four or five patroles I believe came; they felt about her with her clothes on, but nothing could be found, neither pocketbook, memorandum book, nor toothpick-case. I then directed the patrole to go for a constable, which they did. The constable came and I gave charge of the two prisoners; they were carried to St. Martin's-lane-watch-house; the next day, Wednesday, the 30th of June, they were committed by the justice.</p>
               <p>Was the pocket-book found again? - I have never seen any thing like it nor any of the contents; unfortunately the note for 18 l. belonged to a client of mine, which he gave me to sue for; I sued out a writ upon that.</p>

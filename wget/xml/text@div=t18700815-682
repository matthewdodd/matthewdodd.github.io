                  </hi>. I am undergoing a sentence in the House of Correc<lb></lb>tion, Clerkenwell—I was in the service of Mr. Bidgood, of 6, Vigo Street, Regent Street, ten years—I have known Musgrove about twenty years, and Isaacs rather more than three years—Musgrove was in the habit of calling at Mr. Bidgood's twice a day, from 12 to 2 o'clock, and from 6 to 7 o'clock, for goods to damp, for Joseph Sparrow—he introduced me to Isaacs at Mr. Bidgood's—in March, this year, I took forty-eight yards of cloth from Mr. Bidgood's to take to Isaacs—I stole it, and gave it to Musgrove, from 1.30 to 2 o'clock—I gave him a largo sheet of brown paper to wrap it in—this was at the back door, where the vans come—he had Sparrow's van with him, and I told him to take it down to Isaacs—he had taken goods before to Isaacs—he had other goods for his master there—Isaacs knew I was a warehouseman there—I went next day to Isaacs' house, 10, Commercial Street, Whitechapel, a little dirty tailor's shop—I told him I had sent him a piece of cloth, and he found fault with it being so thin, he also found fault with Musgrove for driving right up to his door with the van, and said he ought to have sent it by Parcels' Delivery Company, or carrier—we went out and had something to drink—he told me to meet him two nights after<lb></lb>wards in Finabury Square—I did so, and took him two vesting lengths, and two lengths of trowsering, which I had stolen from my master, for which he gave me a little parcel with eight sovereigns in it; that was for the piece of goods and the trowsering and vesting—he told me to give Musgrove 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and next day, when Musgrove came to Mr. Bidgood's, I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the evening—he said "All right"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the doth I took, and these other articles are the same pattern and colour—I was taken in custody on 16th May, and charged at Marlborough Street with stealing six yards of cloth from my master—I was sent to prison for six months with hard labour—I took the cloth to a little public-house where</p>

               <p>I used to dine, and in the evening I took it down to Isaacs, and told him what length there was, and he promised to meet me on Sunday morning, but I could not because I was in custody—I informed the police where the six yards of cloth was—I was fint introduced to Isaacs in the King's Arms public-house three years ago—Musgrove came into Mr. Bidgood's, and asked me how I was—I said I was hard up—he told me to let him have a piece of cloth, he knew where he could get rid of it—I refused, but on being asked two or three times more, I consented, and gave him 15 yards or 20 yards of cloth at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he came in the evening, he said there was a man in Warwick Street, Regent Street, at a public-house, waiting to see me—I went over there, and saw Musgrove come outside the door; he met me before I went inside, and told me he was not there but at the King's Arms, Glasshouse Street, as there were two or three people in the public-house in Warwick Street who knew me and knew Sampson, and he thought we had better not be seen together, somebody in our trade—I went to a public-house in Glasshouse Street, and saw Isaacs standing in the bar; Musgrove drove up with Sparrow's cart, pointed me out to Isaacs, told him I was the man, and drove away—Isaacs asked me to take a walk—we walked round the back streets in the neighbourhood, and I looked round to see if anybody was coming—he told me not to be afraid, as I was perfectly safe in his hands—we went and had something to drink, and he said that anything I could get he could do with—he told me to meet him two nights afterwards, in Jermyn Street, Piccadilly, about 7.30—I did so, and he gave me a little parcel containing 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me to give Musgrove a sovereign, and said he had given him one, or would give him one himself—I gave Musgrove I next day, at Sackville Street—there were never any bills in these transactions between us—I do not suppose that Isaacs knew that my name was Walker, at the first transaction—I also took 11/2 yards of figured velvet from my master, and gave it to Isaacs myself—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—no inducement whatever has been made to me to make this statement; I am telling the truth.</p>

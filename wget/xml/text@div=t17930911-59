               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant. On the 6th of August a pair of cotton Stockings were pawned; on the 7th a cotton petticoat, but it was not my taking in; on the 8th a black silk cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pawned these things? - The prisoner at the bar; I knew her person, I have seen her many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her duplicates? - I did. I have got the things here. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the cotton stockings by a dot upon the top of them put on myself; the black silk cloak has two sorts of lace on it, and a tare on the neck; I have had it five or six years.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH TURNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant; I produce a muslin neckcloth, it was pawned by the prisoner at the bar; I had seen her before; it was pawned the 6th of August. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine, I know it by some iron moles in the front of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the prosecutor's house six weeks; she had me first to wash, iron, and get up things, and she never gave me nothing at all but once a shilling, and two-pence and three-pence; I was with a lodger of her's ten weeks, and between them all I had about four shillings; that was all the money I had all the time I was there, and I asked for my money several times, and she did not pay me.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you owe her any money at this time? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These things were left in my care to wash, and I thought I would make some money of them till I was paid; I was ten weeks without money.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you give her any of these things either to pawn or wash? - I did not.</p>

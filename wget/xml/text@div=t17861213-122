               <p>I am a watchman of Hampstead; on the 14th of this month, between two and three I was in my box, and I heard something come padding down the horse road, between two and three o'clock, I saw two men and two asses; I asked them what they were going to do with those asses; the prisoner was driving one, and the other man was riding; one of them said, they were his asses; I cannot say which it was; I immediately followed them down the town for a quarter of a mile, or rather better; I overtook them, and the prisoner came from behind the ass to me, into the path; the man that was riding ran away; the prisoner said, they did not belong to him, but to the other man which ran away; I asked him the other man's name; he said the man lived in Kentish town, but he did not know his name, but his name was Tom; he said, he met with him on the road; and on the Thursday following he told him he had lost an ass between Holloway and Highgate, with hamper of apples and onions; and that he had been seeking it; but did not say whether he found it; here is the halter I took off one of the asses; and they had a halter on besides; I never saw the prisoner before I took him; he never was out of my sight; it was a star-light morning; I kept the prisoner in custody; I kept the asses till morning; I put them in a yard, and took them out next morning; they were the same asses; in the morning we found Mr. Upton's name on each of them: I informed him, and he came, and said they were his.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were my asses; I saw them in the field on Monday; and this was Thursday when I saw them before the Justice; my fence and gate were good; when I missed them I found the gate open.</p>

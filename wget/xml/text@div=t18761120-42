                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer at 1, Cambridge Terrace, and 2, Cam<lb></lb>bridge Road, Kilburn—I first made the prisoner's acquaintance about Decem<lb></lb>ber last when he came to me and delivered to me some iron work and building materials for sale, which were included in my December sale—they realised about two guineas—I had advanced him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so I had a charge of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think, against him on the first transaction—he came to me again in January and told me he had 40,000 bricks, a lot of timber, coal, a cattle trough, ehaff-cutting machines, and other things, making up a sale of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some place was mentioned for storing the goods and I introduced him to Mr. Richards, a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had some land to let, which land he ultimately took, I becoming responsible for the rent—nothing of the prisoner's but the bricks was put on the land—he began to put the bricks on the ground the first few days in January—on 11th January, I think, he came to me and asked me to advance him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I do not think there is sufficient on the ground "—I ultimately advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 13th, and he wrote out this receipt in my presence (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the next day I advanced him another 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at that time nothing whatever had been said to me about a reserve price at which I was to sell—I prepared a catalogue and posted one to the prisoner—he was examined at the County Court, and I think he said he had received a catalogue, but not a marked one—the sale took place on 31st January—I sold all the bricks, 21,800, they realised about 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my charges for commission and advertising were 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., leaving a balance due to the prisoner of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I heard him examined in the County Court, he was represented by a gentleman named Liggins—he said he had given me special instructions not to sell these bricks under 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1,000—he was cross-examined by my solicitor on that state<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200057"></xptr>

He said that he could not swear that the word "sale "was in his writing—the Judge said that it was clear that "sale "was in the same hand writing, and called his attention to that receipt—he still continued in his former state<lb></lb>ment without giving the slightest explanation—he said that he received 28,000 bricks from Mr. Newell, of Southall, and the rest he had from Waring Brothers, of Southall—he produced an invoice with no heading to it—the Judge said "I cannot tell where they came from, where is the heading to it?"—he said "They came from Waring Brothers, of Southall "—the Judge called his attention to a date in the invoice show<lb></lb>ing the bricks delivered to me under this trans<lb></lb>action with me and the trans<lb></lb>action to be subsequent to the delivery to me—he was asked whether he had paid for Waring Brothers' bricks—he said "Yes, I have the receipt at home on the file "—he was asked what he paid for them, and he said 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and notes, which he paid to Messrs.' Waring's clerk, I think he said in the former part of August—the Judge said "Will you swear that you paid the sum of 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for these bricks?" and he said "I will "—the ques<lb></lb>tions were put by the Judge himself, not by the solicitor—I had had no application for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and no application had been made to me by or on behalf of the prisoner before I was served with the summons in the County Court, nor did I receive any communication from him at alt—the reason I had not paid over the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before' I was sued was that a day or two after I got the money I took up the paper and found he was gazetted brankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was not the first of the periodical sales that I had had—I gave him notice of the sale by advertising in the papers and so on, besides posting the catalogue—he lived within thirteen doors of me—it is always usual to post a circular—there were bills posted up all over the place—I never delivered to him any particulars of the sale, or to any one else until the action was brought—I was examined at the police-court—I said at the County Court that about 22nd October I received a letter from Mr. Liggins; I gave an answer to it—I communicated with the trustees in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy after that—the reason why I did not pay the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was because I had application in writing by post for the judgment creditor, Mr. Newell, asking me to pay over to him or to give notice of any money of his I had in hand, I havenot got it here—I did not tell Mr. Liggins that that was the reason I had not paid Goodwin—I was not aware that on 28th June he had been six weeks discharged, I have heard so now—I heard that he paid a compo<lb></lb>sition to his creditors—it was pursuant to the Judge's order that I delivered particulars of this sale; I had given them to my solicitor—Mr. Liggins represented the prisoner at the trial—before the action commenced I, gave my solicitor all the documents in my possession relating to this matter, and amongst them this receipt—I heard Mr. Liggins open the plaintiff's case, I think he made some such observation as that after having seen this receipt, under an order of inspection, his client's claim as far as 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was con<lb></lb>cerned could not be sustained—in opening the case Mr. Liggins stated that he had a tantamount difficulty to get over which was that the defendant held in his possession a receipt to sell these goods unreserved, whereas Mr. Goodwin had made an affidavit quite contrary to the fact—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber</p>

               <p>everything that he said—I don't think such a proposition as a verdict for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. took place—the Judge pressed the prisoner as to whether he had given me directions not to sell at less than 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the Judge was very indignant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the sale I saw that the prisoner was bankrupt, and I expected an application for the money in my hands from the trustees—I never heard of the bankruptcy being annulled—I took the usual means of ascertaining whether I could pay the money over safely, and I was referred to Mr. Newell, the judgment creditor—the questions about pay<lb></lb>ment were put by the judge—he said "You see there is 'unreserved' on the outside of the catalogue."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, I have a considerable practice in the Marylebone County Court—I was the solicitor for the prisoner in the case of Goodwin v. Gill—before the plaint was issued, I wrote a letter to the defendant asking for payment, I received the letter before you from the the present prosecutor, stating "I have no balance in hand in the above bankruptcy case;" dated 24th June, signed by the prosecutor—I obtained an order for inspection, and inspected the documents in Mr. Simpson's possession, where I, for the first time, saw this receipt containing the word* "unreserved sale "—that was a day or two before the action came on to be heard, and having seen that I gave up claim for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked for a verdict for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I opened the case and said that, I had that difficulty to get over, viz., the receipt for "unreserved sale "—I had no receipts and Mr. Serjeant Wheeler said the defendant had behaved very badly in not giving us receipts, and the case must be adjourned for receipts as an auc<lb></lb>tioner should give receipts for goods received for sale—I asked in respect of the bricks for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether, in the plaintiff's presence and it was adjourned for the usual auctioneer's accounts, and when it came on on the adjourned hearing it proceeded on that footing, and when I only pressed for a verdict for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. claim was struck out so far as I know—I admitted the mistake in the affidavit, I distinctly referred the Judge to it—you know Serjeant Wheeler—he was very angry—it was after</p>

               <p>the Judge had addressed the prisoner, and after I had produced the receipt that, he was pressed whether he had given those directions for a reserved sale, for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. Serjeant Wheeler lost his temper—when he pressed the prisoner on this he still abided by what he had said—the prisoner was at that time very much excited—he had Mr. Serjeant Wheeler pitching into him, and Mr. Simpson too—he appeared extremely frightened and nervous like a witness who had rarely, or never been in a witness box, what he was doing—I was present at the police-court when Mr. Simpson made an applica<lb></lb>tion for a warrant, the. day after the trial, when it was refused by Mr. D'Eyncourt—he subsequently made an application to the Judge of the County Court, Mr. Serjeant Wheeler, in ray presence, to direct a prosecution and Mr. Serjeant Wheeler said—"Mr. Simpson, if you have that amount of experience which I credit you with, you will drop this matter. I have sat for fourteen years as the judge of a County Court, and I have never directed a prosecution, and I hope I never may do so, and I do not consider this a case," and he advised Mr. Simpson to go no further in the matter but to drop it—the summons was obtained the day after that before Mr. Mansfield.</p>

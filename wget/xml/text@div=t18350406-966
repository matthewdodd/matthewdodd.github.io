                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at No. 42, Hadlow-street, St. Pancras—I have known the prisoner between three and four years. On Tuesday, the 18th of March, he came to my house, and said something about the duplicate of a coat—I was to go with him to the pawnbroker's, to see it—my wife went out while he was there, and I left him in the kitchen while I went after my wife; I was absent about half an hour—when I came back he was gone—I had a box in my kitchen the night before, a silk bag in it with money in it, and fifteen duplicates, two gold rings and a gold pin—I afterwards missed the bag and its contents—there was about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bag when I saw it last—I had seen the property safe about three days before I left him in the house.</p>

I have fifteen sovereigns in my pocket, and I will give you one, if you will go to the station and make it all right"—I said, "I will do the best I can for you;" and with the one shilling he gave me, I left the cab, and went into the station—I ran into the station and called another man—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

                  </hi>. I lives in Norfolk-place, Isington, and me a cheesemonger, The prisoner was in my employ in April—I gave a shilling to George Barnett to purchase something—it was a shilling with a very peculiar mark on it—an "I" on the neck of the head, and another letter indistinctly marked—I watched a female going into my shop—I saw her coming out with some butter—on her coming out I went home and went to the till—the shilling I had given to Barnard was not there then—I took the first opportunity to send a boy (who had come that morning) for the constable—I then called the prisoner into the room, and told him I had lost a great deal of property—that suspicion rested on him—I asked him if he could give any account, and if he had any money about him—he pulled some out of his pocket, and I in a minute identified among it the marked shilling that I had given Barnard—the prisoner said nothing at the moment—he afterwards said that he had had it three days.</p>

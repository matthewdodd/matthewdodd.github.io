               <p>Court. Have you looked over the names of the several crew belonging to that ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have the names of all that belonged to that ship? - All that were entitled to prizes.</p>
               <p>Did he mention what situation he bore on board the ship? - I think he said boatswain's mate, or yeoman of the sheets, which I believe is much the same thing.</p>

               <p>Did you mention it to him? - No, I did not, the question I asked him was, if he had any certificate from his Captain or officers, to shew he was the person he represented himself to be; then I began to suspect him, and I warned him as I did the other man, to take care what he was about, I told him the consequence, and told him, there was a man to be executed the very next day for the same crime, at which he seemed to be shocked, as I thought; I told him, he must bring me a certificate from the officer, then he told me, he had been sick in the hospital; I then told him, to bring me his discharge from the hospital; the next day he came again with two more people, one of whom was very riotous, and called himself an officer, and required payment of the money to this man, I told him, if he would call on me on the Saturday following at twelve o'clock, and bring the other man with him, who had come with him at first, that was the man that has been convicted this sessions; I then possibly might pay him; they came at the appointed time and Captain Blythe was at that time in my house and saw the prisoner, and gave his opinion of him, then I had him apprehended; the other prisoner brought him first.</p>

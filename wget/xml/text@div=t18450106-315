I was out on duty on the 30th of Nov., at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, in Cannon-Street, St. George-in-the-East—I heard a noise, and saw a female, the two prisoners, and another, coming down the pavement—I was stepping up to them, Lucas turned round and committed a nuisance against a door—I told him to walk off about his business—he began abusing me very much, but I removed him at that time—I did not take hold of him—I told him to go about his business, and he went away—he came back a second time with the other three, and they began abusing me very much—a great crowd</p>

               <p>assembled round us—I took hold of Lucas, and said he must go to the station with me—without saying anything more, he drew his knife from his side, and was coming to thrust it into my side—he was coming direct to do it—he had it coming direct for my side—he struck at me—I pre<lb></lb>vented it striking me in the side by catching hold of it with my hand—I struggled with him till I got the knife from him—it cat three of my fingers severely, and I have been in the hospital ever since—Taylor came up behind me, pulled me back, and kicked me severely when I was down,—he was standing close by Lucas at the time Lucas cut me—I bad hold I of Lucas at the time Taylor pulled me back—I was pulled down, and they I got away—I went to Dr. Betson, who has attended me—I am obliged to I wear my hand in a sling still—I went next morning along with sergeant I Lee, and apprehended the prisoners—we found them both together in the I same house—I had never seen either of them before—I was present when I a conversation passed between Lee and Lucas.</p>

I went on the Sunday morning to apprehend the prisoners—I took Lucas first—I found him at No. 12, Back-road, St. George's—it is a sailor's lodging-house—I said, "You must go with me to the station-house"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "For cutting this man's hand last night," pointing to M'Gregor, who was with me—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he then said, "I recollect being in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> last night, and I am very sorry for it; I was very drunk, or I should not have done so, for when I am sober I am a different man'—we then took him to the station—I returned to the house a second time, about nine o'clock in the morning, and found Taylor in bed—I said, "You were in Cannon-street last night, were you not?"—he said, "Yes, I recol<lb></lb>lect being in a <hi rend="italic">scrummage</hi> last night"—I said, "Don't you know it is a serious thing to use a knife to any one?—said, "Yes, I know it is, but I don't think he cut him intentionally; I think the knife was out, and he must have cut his hand in the scuffle."</p>

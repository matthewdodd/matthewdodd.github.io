             and Prisoner were drinking together at the Black-Boy in Well-street; but Osborn and Longmore quarrell'd, and so the Prisoner and I left 'em. Afterwards we went down a Yard to the Prosecutor's House, where we took a Pane of Glass out of the Window, and cut the little Deal Bar, and open'd it. The Prisoner went in, and brought out a Looking-Glass and a Riding-Hood. He went in again, and brought out some Towels. Then I went in myself, and got a Box of Linen, and a Pocket which had two Keys in it. It was just Ten a Clock when we had done. When we got into the Street, I open'd the Box, and saw there was Linen in it, which I carried to the Prisoner's Maux's, lodging in Church-Lane, in Rag-Fair. We kept a Shirt a Piece, and gave her two Aprons for herself. She sold some of the Things next Day, in Rag-Fair, and the rest in Chick-Lane, for which she brought us 18 s. but I believe she sunk some of the Cole. I was afterwards taken up for a Street-Robbery with Osborn, Tripland, and Longmore, and sent for Mrs. Coniers, and returned her the Keys.</p>

Fleming has not put this Burglary into his Information, and I'll inform against him and others for this, and for stealing a Parcel of Hats on the Thames, and several other Facts. Indeed, I ought to be hanged for a Fool, for coming to Town so soon; for I had run away to Brentford, where I went to sleep under a Brick-kiln, and burnt my Thigh, so that I have been since.

               <p>Court. How came he to lodge in your Room?</p>
               <p>Dallison. Very odly. About 3 Weeks before, he was lying asleep upon a Bulk in Bloomsbury-market, with his Shirt hanging out of his Breeches. Some Boys pinn'd a Paper to his Shirt, and setting Fire to it, burnt his Back-side, upon which he went to a Constable to have them taken up; and it being said, that my Son was one of them, the Constable told me that I must take Care of him till he was well. Tho' I have since been informed, that he received but little Hurt by what the Boys did to him, and that he had got the chief Damage before, by lying in a Brick-kiln.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was Dallison's Son that pulled out my Shirt, and burnt me shamefully. If you please I can shew you the Marks. And when I first came up to lodge in Mr. Dallison's Room, he swore he would murder me, and he has owed me a Grudge ever since. <rs id="t17320705-6-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

On Wednesday 25th Aug., a few minutes before 12 o'clock in the day, I was on the canal bank, at Peckbam—I saw two lads exposing themselves on the bank—I was in plain clothes—they appeared to be from fifteen to seventeen years old—I spoke to them,</p>

               <p>and took them in custody—I took hold of one hand of each of them; while I had hold of them the prisoner Kimber came running up, and asked sme what I was going to do with the boys—I told him I was a police constable, and was going to take them to the station house—in reply, he asked me to let them go—he said, "We were lads ourselves at one time"—I told him I had taken them in custody; I could not let them go—he then told them to lie down—I asked them to go quietly to the station, as it would be better for them if they did—the boys then seemed to come along—Kimber then said, "D—n your eyes you shall not take them," and he caught hold of the boy that I had by my left hand and pulled him away from me—he next took hold of the collar of my coat with his left hand, and took the other lad with his right hand—several men who were in a barge very near the place called out "Down with the b—r; down with the b—r!"—Kimber then pot bis foot between my legs, and endeavoured to throw me down—I was compelled to let the boy go to defend myself—I then took took hold of Kimber, and told him to consider himself in custody for rescuing the two lads—he said, "I will rescue you, you b—r," and he threw me down—I believe we both fell at that time—I got up, and we fell eight or nine times—while I was down he jumped on me, with his knees several times on my bowels—he pressed very heavily—I called for assistance on Mr. Bourne, to aid and assist me, in the Queen's name; and he went to the station-house—I called on the men in the barge to assist me—they did not assist me; they said, "You b—r, we shall not assist you"—the last time I fell, I fell on my back, and Kimber jumped on me with his knees, and I was hurt very much at that time—when I got up I saw Pike, whom I had not seen before—he said to Kimber, "Run, you b—r, run!"—a lad came up, and I heard him say, "Here is a policeman coming!"—I then caught hold of Kimber by his coat, and Pike struck me in the breast with his right hand, and pulled Kimber away with his left hand, and said, "Let go, you b—r"—I believe it was with his open hand—Kimber then ran away—Pike struck me very hard, I reeled against the fence, and Kimber got away—I said to Pike, "I am a constable"—that was just after he had struck me—he did not strike me after I told him I was a constable, but he pulled off his jacket, and said, "I am enough for you, you b—r; you can have a <hi rend="italic">go</hi> at me if you like"—he was coming up towards me, and I pushed him away—I did not say anything at that time—after that he put on his jacket, I believe—he was advised to go away, and he went away, in a direction towards the barge, in which the men were who had called out to me—several persons followed him—I produced my warrant card—I went to the station—I had a violent pain in the bowels—I could scarcely stand or move—I then went home—I vomited and spat blood, and have done so a great deal up to this time—I have not been able to resume my duty—I have beenunder medical treatment.</p>

               <p>On 25th August, I was in the garden—I saw the policeman take two boys, and lead them along the side of the bank—I saw Kimber come away from the barge, and rescue the two boys from him—I saw him struggling with the policeman, and saw them go down, I did not notice how many times, I thought not above four or five—at the second fall that they had, I saw Kimber was undermost—and he kicked at the officer's head, but his head was down, and the kicks went behind his pole—he kicked at him three or four times—they struggled and got down again—they struggled three or four times before they got to the corner of my garden, and there they fell down very heavily on the footpath, and the constable was undermost—I saw Kimber get up and run away—Pike came up just at the time Kimber ran away—I believe there were some words between the officer and Pike, but there were so many people crowding round, and talking, that I could not hear what they said—Pike came up and prevented the constable going after Kimber—I saw Pike pull his left arm out of his jacket.</p>

On the day in question, I saw the officer on the bank of the canal—he was taking two boys, one in each hand—Kimber came up and told the boys to lie down—they did not lie down, and Kimber immediately laid hold of one of them, and pulled him away—the constable laid hold of Kimber with the same hand that he had held the boy, but he found him too strong, and he was obliged to let go the other boy—a struggle ensued—they were up and down several times, and I saw Kimber kneel on the constable several times—he usually kneeled on his bowels—Kimber was usually uppermost—I should say there were fifty or sixty persons round—Kimber ran away; I do not know why—I was fifty or sixty yards away—I saw the constable afterwards, he appeared to be very weak.</p>

I was sent for to attend the officer, Lane—I found him lying on a sofa—he complained of violent pains in the right side, and pains about the abdomen, but especially of the pains on the right side—he seemed very feeble—he vomited blood and passed blood otherwise, and he has continued to do so till within the last few days—he was in a dangerous state during the first eight days, since that he has progressed favourably, but it will be some time before he will be able to do his duty—the wounds were of an inter<lb></lb>nal character, producing haemorrhage from the bowels—to have produced such results the injury must have been very severe.</p>

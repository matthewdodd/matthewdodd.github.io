                  </hi>. I keep the Crown, in Ormond-yard. On Saturday, 2nd Feb., the prisoner came for a pot of porter, between eight and nine o'clock—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him two shillings and threepence back—I found the half-crown was bad, but I gave him the change, and I went round the counter, I had a great many persons there, and I could not get through quick enough to see where he went—I lost sight of him—I marked the half-crown—I had never seen the prisoner before, but on the Monday evening following he came with another man and tendered me a bad shilling—I am sure he is the same man that came on Saturday.</p>

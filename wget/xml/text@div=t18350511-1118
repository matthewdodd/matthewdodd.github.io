                  </hi>. I am parish-clerk of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. In consequence of information, on Thursday morning, the 2nd of April, I went to the church about nine o'clock—(Mrs. Browning is a pew-opener, and is employed as a char-woman to clean the church)—I entered the church by the chancel-door—I was in the burial ground at the time an alarm was given—I think it was Mrs. Carroll gave the alarm—I found the chancel-door open—I went into the minister's vestry, and found the drawers broken open, and the closet where the minister's robes are kept, likewise broken open—the surplices were strewed about the floor—I missed three keys from the drawers, two of them belonging to the registry, and the other was a key of one of the other drawers—I went from there into the churchwarden's-room, which is on the other side of the communion-table—I observed the cupboard in which the maces were kept had been broken open—they had silver heads—there were four of them—the sticks of them lay on the ground, the heads were gone—the cupboard where the sacramental wine is kept was broken open, and part of a bottle of sacra<lb></lb>mental wine was left on the mantle-shelf—there is a plate-chest in the churchwarden's room—the padlock was forced off that, and the chest had apparently been attempted to be forced open, but they had not succeeded in opening it—there had been an attempt made at the crevice of the lid to open it—there if a smaller iron chest fixed in the wall in that room, and an attempt had been made to open that—I believe it is used to keep papers in—I found a piece of iron lying on the ground of the church<lb></lb>warden's room, which appeared to be broken off a crow-bar—it was two or three inches from the plate chest—I sent for the churchwardens and sexton—I delivered the piece of iron to Mr. Chappie the churchwarden—I went outside the church while I had sent for the churchwardens, and observed one of the fire-ladders placed against one of the windows, which is very similar to the windows of this Court, with a ventilator, but it has no flap at the top; it shuts out instead of having a flap—I have no doubt a person of the prisoner's size could effect an entrance into the church through that trap by means of a ladder—I asked Mrs. Carroll to try it, and she got her head and shoulders through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you since seen any of the keys that were lost that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have seen all three, but I can swear to two of them which belong to the registry—I saw them in the possession of Bedford the Inspector—I have seen several keys in his possession—one of the church-yard and the burial ground-gate, as I believe—I have since seen a portion of iron in Bedford's possession, which has been applied to the plate-chest—it formed a crow-bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the chancel-door is secure, can the church be opened from without? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it must be opened from within.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you call a mace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A beadle's staff—when the beadles walk before the minister or chuchwardens</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110025"></xptr>
               <p>they carry the head and staff together—the head and staff together form the mace, I apprehend—the stick part was found in the church—I believe the heads were invariably locked up in the churchwarden's room, but I cannot be certain of that—I have seen them frequently locked up—a person of the prisoner's size could get through the space left by the open<lb></lb>ing in the window—Mrs. Carroll is not very corpulent—she did not stick at all in attempting to get through; she only did it to show me she could get through if disposed—the top of the pew under the window is three or four feet from the top of the window—the back of the window seat is not more than four feet from the opening, I should think—it is a lower win<lb></lb>dow—not in the gallery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could a party get down without treading on the window and breaking it as he came through the glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is an iron frame—I think the party might get out the same way they got in, but they could get out much more easily at the chancel-door—the iron I found by the plate-chest appeared to be a portion of a crow-bar—I do not remember whether any body else was present when Mrs. Carroll got through—she went up the ladder and put herself through—I believe there had been a meeting of the trustees at the church the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see these two women before? - A. Yes, I have seen them go into a chandler's-shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see them near Mr. Anderson's-house? - A. Yes, I think it was on a Tuesday, I cannot tell how many weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she open the door? - A. She lifted up the latch, and when she came away, she left it wide open, they both ran down the street, and round the corner; they came back again in about a quarter of an hour, and one of them said, here goes it again.</p>

               <p>Q.Which of them was that? - A. I believe it was the big one, but they went away and did not do any thing, there were some children about, and they went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen these women except going into a chandler's-shop before that day? - A. Yes, I have seen them a good many times, a long while ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they been washed by you? - A. Yes, all washed, and ready for sending home; I brought them between two and three o'clock into the front parlour, locked them in, and left the key in the door; I left one window a little way open, with a muslin curtain before it, to let the air in; I went out about four o'clock, and returned between eight and nine; when I got into my own door, I missed my things.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the door when you came back? - A. I cannot tell, I believe it was locked, but cannot say; I have seen one of the handkerchiefs at the pawnbroker's, and one at another, which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the house? - A.My husband, at work in the shop, in the back part of the house, in the back parlour.</p>

On the 22d of June, Sophia Blundell, in the morning, between five and six, knocked at my window, in the lower room, in the backyard, before I was up, as I was not then in place, and asked me for a light; I told her I had none; she asked me to strike one; I said I would; she asked me if I would have any thing to drink, but said, she had no money; she said, she had a white pocket handkerchief, and said, I should have it for sixpence; I gave her the sum she asked, there was a tear at the corner; I pawned it at Mr. Basson's, in Tothill-street, about seven o'clock, and Charlottee Wood pawned another article for nine-pence at the same place, and

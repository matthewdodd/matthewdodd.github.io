               <p>Q.Was it cut big enough for a man to open the door? - Yes, for them to put their hand in. I had not fastened that bolt that side; it was a separate door, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200162"></xptr>lock is a spring lock, and they pulled it back.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the India house. When I was coming home, on Tuesday morning, the 19th, there were two men at the end of the lane. It was just about a quarter before two; I did not altogether like it. I stepped up towards my door, and would not open it till they were gone by; No. 69, Fetter-lane, exactly opposite Mr. Rawson's, and I see the prisoner at the bar, and another taller man pass me as I was standing at the step, and directly as he had passed by, I opened my door and went in, and shut the door after me. It was where I lodged, I went up stairs. I struck no light; the window was open, and through the curtain, I saw the prisoner and this tall man, walk up and down four or five times; I thought they had no good intent. So previous to that, I had taken out eight marbles that I had in my drawer, and I tore the hole of the curtain bigger to look; it had a hole in it before; and they walked up to the door, and the shutter appeared to be down by the blackness of the glass. The tall man stood up against the side of the door like, it is a folding door. St. Paul's had struck two I suppose, about ten minutes before; the watchmen were crying two; they went off and came back again to the door, and they see all was clear, and they both went in and shut the door after them. Then the day was breaking, it was plain enough to discern any body then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish the features of a man's face? - I don't think there was, at least I could not discern it. I took three of the marbles and throwed them, in order to alarm Mr. Rawson, which missed the window, and struck the shutters, and alarmed them, and they paused then in the house. They were two minutes then in the house before they came out, and then I called out Rawson! Rawson! with the noise of my calling Rawson, they came out. The tall one took towards Holborn, and the short one towards Barnard's-inn. The watchman being by Barnard's-inn-gate, I called to him to stop him. There was no other person in the lane whatever, and the watchman took him about twenty yards from the door, by Mr. Langdale's steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watchman stop him? - Yes. He was not out of my fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see enough of his face from the window where you were, when the watchman stopped him, to say that was the same person? - I could not. It was such a person. Then a Mr. Blanchard, in Dean-street, and an officer came up likewise that there might not be any rescue, and after that I went down to the watch-house, and gave my charge; Mr. Rawson, the prosecutor, and the watchman desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told the judge just now that it was about break of day, you was up two pair of stairs, and looking through a curtain? - Through a window open, and the curtain tore down the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window a casement? - No, a sash.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see the person of any one of them? Could you know them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200163"></xptr>again? - I could know them again by not quitting them out of my fight.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any candle light? - No, but there is a light at out door, that shines directly opposite the way.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had been down stairs on the other side of the way, could you not discern their faces? - No, I don't think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was about day break; if I had been as near to you as I am now, could you have discerned my face by the break of day? - I might perhaps, I would not pretend to swear. I did not look at the man's face.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing you had chosen to lock at a man's face, was there not light enough to discern him? - I might.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was day break? - I did not; I said the day was breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if you had been in the street, instead of being as you were, up in the two pair of stairs, could you not have discerned his face? - I will not take my oath on that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness before? Did you ever hear of a crime of burglary? - Yes, I am not so void of sense, but I may know what a burglary is as well as yourself, though you are so high learned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about a reward on conviction of a burglary? - I come not expecting to be paid for what I do, and you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know there is a forty pounds reward on a conviction of burglary? - I do; but upon my oath I do not come with that intent.</p>
               <p>- CONNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was calling two o'clock on Tuesday morning, and at the same time one of the men that were there, that lived up two pair of stairs, he cried out, watch! watch! stop him. Accordingly at the same word, I laid hold of the young fellow,

            , as he was going by running; coming up Holborn way, going towards the Strand way on the same side of the street where the house was broke open. When I laid hold of the young fellow, he says, it is not me, it is that man that has gone forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other forward? - No other man that I see than this man that I laid hold of. I suppose it was twenty yards from the door where it was broke open, that I laid hold of the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you after you laid hold of him? - Called up Rawson and the patrol; and I went to the door and there was a mob inside of the door; and at the same time we thought it better to take the young man inside of the house, and to let the mob disperse, until such time as we see what was the matter. The patrol examined the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether it was light or dark? - It was break of day, just about a quarter past two, between there and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish the features of a man's face, to know one man from another? - Yes, there was.</p>

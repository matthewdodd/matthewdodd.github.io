                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 3, Parker Street, Newport Market—on Wednesday evening, 15th July, the prisoner came to my house—I had known him between three and four years—he asked me to have some drink with him, and I refused—he then left, and came back again the same evening, and asked to have the door open, and I think my little daughter opened it—he came and sat down in a chair, and said, "You are all b——clever"—we were all in bed, and had been for two hours—he began undressing himself—I Mid, "What are you up to?"—I told him to go away, and defied him to stay in the place—be had no business in my room—we had a few words, and then he said, "I will go, but you b——I will give you something first"—he hit me a blow with hit fists, and I fell down almost insensible—I called out "Police," and he got the poker and gave me a blow—my little girl came up, took the poker out of his hand, and threw all the fire irons on to the landing—he then took up a large knife, and said, "I will rip your guts up"—I saw the knife coming, and took the candlestick to prevent the blow, and the knife went into my mouth and then fell into the fender—he took the candlestick out of my hands, and beat me about the head and back till he broke the candlestick over me—I was covered with blood—I went to go to the door, and he seized me by the throat, and took the flesh out of it—I was taken to the hospital, but how I got there I don't know,</p>

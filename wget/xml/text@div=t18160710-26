In consequence of a letter from my brother. I went to the White Horse livery stables, in the City-road, on the 17th of last month, about ten in the morning;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100018"></xptr>I found the poney there; how it had been brought there, I don't know.

             M'GHIE ESQ. I am the brother of the last witness. I know this poney. I know where it was at grass; I saw it at grass on Sunday, the 16th, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw it on the Monday morning following, about half past nine, or a quarter before ten; I saw it at the White Horse livery stables, in the City-road, when I rode into Town. While I remained there, the prisoner at the bar came for the poney; the hostler said something to me. I then spoke to the prisoner; I asked him where he got the poney he rode on that morning; that was just at the stable door. I pointed to the poney; he must know what poney I meant; he then said, he bought it on the Hampstead-road. I asked him of whom; and he said, of a butcher. I said it was my brother's poney. I think he said he bought it that morning at half past five, or half past six. After we stood a short time, he offered to give it up, on condition of my giving him the bridle and saddle; I did not do that. We stood talking to the hostler; and then he said, he would fetch the butcher. I told him he had better stay until my brother came, because he knew more about it. He said, the butcher was a fat man, with a green coat; he did not know his name. I think that was what he said. I am sure he said, he did not know his name. I asked him how he came to buy a poney of a man he did not know; and he said, he bought it, cheap, and gave six guineas and a half for it. I asked him to stay until my brother came. When my brother came, he said, he would hang him; then my brother sent for an officer; he said, he would pay any man who would go for an officer; he said that aloud in the yard. Great numbers of persons were assembled in the yard at this time. I beeckoned the prisoner to go, as the people said let the poor fellow go. I did not wish him to be hanged. He went before the officer came; I did not see him go; in the crowd he went away.</p>

            . I am assistant to the hostler at the White Horse livery stables. I look at the prisoner at the bar; he brought the poney in question, himself, at about half past six o'clock; I had seen him twice before; he ordered a quartern of corn, and two pennyworth of beaus for the poney, as another person would do; he went awayin about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I never saw the poney before. I was there when he came back. The younger Mr. M'Ghie rode in about half past nine. When the prisoner first came in, I said, you have a pretty poney there; he said, yes, what do you think I gave for it; I said, I don't know. In the result he told me he gave ten pounds ten shillings for sandle bridle and all. I should think it was worth that. I had seen him twice in the week previous; he was in the Star public-house.</p>

               <p>JOHN-. I am hostler. I was not at the stables when the prisoner was taken. A person came into the yard, and said, a person wanted to see me. I went, and took the officer with me to the Angel in Tabernacle-walk, about an hundred yards across the way. I asked the landlord if any one wanted me, and I saw the prisoner outside the house in the street; he was going to speak to me, and then I told the officer he was the man, and he apprehended him.</p>

               <p>BERNARD GLEED. I am the officer that took the prisoner into custody. I asked him where he bought the poney. I told him what I took him for, on suspicion of stealing Mr. M'Ghie's poney. I asked him where he bought it; and he said, by Primrose-hill, of a butcher; he said, he gave six pounds ten shillings in the whole for it. I asked him if he had any receipt to shew for it; and he said, none I asked him if he knew the man he bought it of; and he said, no. I searched him, and in his waistcoat he had a few halfpence, and in his coat pocket I found a pair of spurs.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and I let of this man, and asked him what time the Yorkshire coach would come; and he said, he did not know any particular time. He was walking before me; and he said, are you going down to Yorkshire; and I yes; and he said. I had better ride the poney down, and I paid him six pounds ten shillings for it; there were plenty of people passing, and I paid him the six pounds ten shillings, and he did not tell me where he lived, and I did not inquire. I brought it to the White Horse, and put it up, and I remained there a little time, and the gentleman was there, and he said this is my poney, and he sent for his brother, and he came. The young gentleman told me to go away, and I went away, and when I came back, I was taken.</p>

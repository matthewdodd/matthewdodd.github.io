On the 27th of April the prisoner, Kelty, came to my premises, and looked out 12 veneers and five leaves of deal, which came to 1l. 12s. 7d. He said his brother, who had the money, was to meet him at my house, and would pay for them. He waited an hour and a half, his brother did not come; it got dark. I went into the counting-house soon after - He came into the counting-house, and said his brother would not come then, and he would call the first thing in the morning. He did not say he would take the deals away - I should not have let him. I did not know him. He did not say where he lived, nor did he tell his name - He went out. I went into the passage about half-past nine o'clock, and missed the wood. He did not call next morning.

            , JUN. I am son of the last witness. On the 28th of April I went to Trevilliam's workshops, and found the wainscot and deals on his stairs-anybody might see them. He said Kelty brought them there overnight. Four of the veneers were in the cupboard among waste wood. He said Kelty had hired a bench in his shop to work on. He did not deny having them.</p>

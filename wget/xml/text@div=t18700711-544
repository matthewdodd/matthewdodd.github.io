                  </hi>. I am an officer employed by the Mint—on 9th June, about 1 p.m., in consequence of information, I directed officers to go to Long Acre and keep a certain house under observation—I got out of an omnibus in the Strand, and saw Hinds and Miller with the prisoner in custody—I followed them to Bow Street—Miller took from him a paper packet, which contained several smaller ones, and Hinds took another packet containing a half-crown, two florins, and a shilling—the one Miller took con<lb></lb>tained sixteen florins, in different packets, and twenty-three shillings, one of which was bent, as it now appears—I said to the prisoner "Well, Mr. Carpenter, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession; this is bad; you will have to account for the possession of it"—he said "My name is not Carpenter, you never saw me before in your life"—I said I did frequently—he said "Where?"—I said "Close to <hi rend="italic">Blind Con's,</hi> in Golden Lane"—he said that the packet was given to him by a man to hold for him—I told him I had frequently seen him with boys and girls of tender age, and Miller said "I have seen him in company with a boy this morning, twelve or thirteen years of age, and two young girls, who ran away."</p>

               <p>to the back of St. Mary's Church, Strand, and saw him with two boys and a girl—we watched him some time—the girl went away, and the boy went with him to the Spotted Dog—we then lost the boy, and I went up to the prisoner and asked him what he was doing—he said "Nothing"—I said "You are suspected of having counterfeit coin about you; I shall search you; where has the boy gone?"—he said "There has been no boy with me"—I searched him and found this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I handed to Brannan—I afterwards saw it opened—it contained the coins which he has produced—I asked the prisoner what it was—he said "You know what it is; I have lost my tools, I must do something for a living—he was taken to the station.</p>

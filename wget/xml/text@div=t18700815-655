I took Ham—he gave me a wrong address at first, but subsequently I found he lived at 5, Fisher Street, Red Lion Square, and went there with Newnham—I took all the goods to the station, and showed them to Ham, and asked him to account for the possession of them—he said "I sha'n't say anything about them"—on the way to the Mansion House, next morning, he said "Those things were left at my house, by a man named William Gibson, to be taken care of"—he said William Gibson had been employed at Messrs. Crosse &amp; Black<lb></lb>well's, and had left about a fortnight—I asked him when he saw Gibson last—he said "Last Tuesday"—I then went with Newnham to Crown Street, Soho, where I saw Gibson—I said I was a detective officer, and had a man named Ham in custody—I said "He has been examined before the Lord Mayor to-day, charged with stealing cigars, and remanded; I have been to Ham's address with another officer, and searched it, and found a large quantity of essence of coffee, sauces, and other goods, bearing the name of Crosse &amp; Black well; Ham accounts for the possession of them by saying that you left them at his house to be taken care of; how do you account for them?"—he hesitated for a minute or two, and then said "I sold them to Ham"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "From Messrs. Crosse &amp; Black well's, I bought them over the counter"—I said "How did he pay you?"—he said "Principally in cigars; he still owes me a little money"—I said "He says that you called there last Tuesday, at his house, and you left two bottles of Madeira jelly; was he to pay you for those?"—he said "Yes, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he has not paid me"—I took him to Bow Lane station, and showed him all the goods mentioned in the indictment—directly he saw them he said "Why, he has kept all the things he had from me; he should not have had them if I had known this; he told me he had a customer for them"—Mr. Bell, manager to Messrs. Crosse &amp; Blackwell, arrived then, and he repeated that statement to him—Mr. Bell said "Can you name anyone who supplied you with such articles as these; you know</p>

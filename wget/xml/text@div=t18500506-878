On 11th March the prisoner took oat 41bs. of Cuba cigars—he had mentioned a customer at Vauxhall-bridge—I do not recollect that he mentioned any name—he took the cigars out that day, and returned without them—he said he sold them to Mr. Benson, at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—they were put down in my book in that name—he said they did not take any par<lb></lb>ticular credit, but they would pay for them in two or three weeks—I saw Mrs. Benson—I have not received a farthing of the money—the last time I saw the prisoner was on 13th March—I met him in Holborn—I said to him, "As I am at this end of the town, I think I will call on Mr. Jones for my account—he said, "I would not go there if I were you till Friday; he promised to pay on Friday"—I said, "Very well, I won't;" but I had to go up in the evening and called—I had an account against him of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

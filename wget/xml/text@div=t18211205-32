I had a gelding, I saw it safe on Thursday, the 15th of November, about nine o'clock at night, and saw my lad take it out of the stable, to take it to pasture, about fifty roods off - I came home at ten o'clock, and then the boy was at home and in bed. Next day, I went to the pasture, between one and two o'clock, and the gelding was not there then - I saw it on Saturday, the 17th, at the Nag's Head, public-house, Whitechapel, in the care of Gibbs, at Mr. Lewis's - I am sure it is mine, I took it home on the Monday, it knew the way home and the place; it had a white face, and its two legs were white up to the hock, and it had a saddle-mark on its back - it was not cropped, it was stiff and tired - I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I belong to the Bow-street patrol. On Friday morning, the 16th of November, at four o'clock, I was on the pavement in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner jogging on on a horse - I found it had no saddle, and I stopped him. I asked where he was going with the horse, he said. to Smithfield, to sell it. I said it was very early to take it to Smithfield, he said he did not know but it was - he said he brought from Attfield Broad Oak, and that he belonged to his master; I asked who his master was, he said, "

I said I thought it queer he should be sent so early - he then said he was going to Dorrington's brother, in Kingsland-road; I said I should detain him and the horse, he resisted a little, I called my brother officer, he said "You need not hold me, I will go." I took him to the watch-house, and searched him for tickets, but found none; I found 1 s. 9 d. on him, I took the horse to Lewis, the hostler, of the Nag's Head. public-house, and was there when Baldwin saw the horse.</p>

            . I do not know Attfield Broad Oak, it is not near my neighbourhood. I looked about the pasture, there was a gap in the field and more horses had got out and were found in a bye lane - I do not think it could have strayed, as it was used to the field. I do not know whether the gap was there the night before - It was worth about 7 l.</p>

            . I am the father of the prisoner, he is nineteen years old, he has been subject to fits from four years old. I live at Broad Oak, about seventeen miles from Chigwell, he worked for me at times, and at times ran away bird's-nesting, and is half silly. I could never make any thing of him, he was frightened at four years old by a hostler, who I had before the Magistrate for doing so - He did farming work, and would go away at particular times. I have worked for - Hampton, Esq. for thirty years. He went away about twelve o'clock last Tuesday three weeks, and was taken up on Friday morning - The fits caused a kicking and trembling.</p>

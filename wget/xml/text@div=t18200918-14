            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother, at Hackney. On Saturday, the 1st of July, I was crossing the London field from town to Hackney, at two o'clock in the afternoon, and met the prisoner - I am sure he is the man; he passed me, and as soon as he got behind me he laid hold of me, and snatched my watch out of my fob; he caught hold of my arm with one hand, and snatched it out with the other. He said, at the same time,</p>
               <p>"I'II cut your throat." I was frightened, which prevented my resisting. The watch was not gone from my person when he said those words. He let go of me, went a little way, and then stood still, and looked at me; as soon as he saw I went away home, he went towards town. I saw him again on the Friday following at the watch-house, where he was in custody on another charge, and am sure he is the person. I found my watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. You were too frightened to follow him - A. Yes. I am confident he is the man.</p>

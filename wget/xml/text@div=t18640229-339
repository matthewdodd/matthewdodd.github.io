                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and practice in the east end of London—I was called in to see the deceased on 26th December, about 5 in the evening—he had a lacerated and contused wound of about three inches long on the front surface of the left leg just above the ancle—he complained of considerable pain over the right hip, but there was no external appearance of bruise—the injury to the leg was such as would be caused by being run over; it struck me from what I heard, that the shaft of the cart might have struck him in the hip—I continued to attend him for nearly a fortnight—during the first two or three days he progressed favourably—I had known him for some years—his health was good prior to the accident—he was an active healthy man for his age—after the lapse of two or three days the wound assumed a very unhealthy cha<lb></lb>racter—there was effusion under the skin, and sloughing; erysipelas set in which extended up the leg to the knee, and ultimately to the hip, and from that time he rapidly grew worse day by day—I did not order the stimulants until after he became exhausted from the sloughing—I don't know the date of my last visit to him, but I think it was one day within the fortnight.</p>
               <p>

I am a member of the College of Surgeons—I was called to see the deceased on 8th January—I found him in a very low state, with excessive sloughing of the left leg, and extended erysipelas as far as the upper part of the thigh—I continued to attend him till 29th January, the day of his death—he was very low, and required to be sus<lb></lb>tained by beef tea and wine, and those kind of things—I made a post<lb></lb>mortem examination of his body—I found all the organs of the abdomen and chest in a healthy state, particularly so for a man of his age—there were some slight adhesions of the pleura, showing some former trifling mis<lb></lb>chief, but nothing of any consequence—upon examining the brain there was serous effusion to the extent of three ounces—I have heard the account of the accident from the witnesses—the wound and the subsequent conse<lb></lb>quences were such as I should have expected from such an accident—the effusion of blood on the brain, I consider, was the product of irritative fever, and mischief which he had been enduring for five weeks, as the result of the accident.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you able to form an opinion as to the length of time this effusion had lasted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it did not occur in the earlier part of his illness, because he was so extremely conscious of everything that was going on—he did not seem to labour under any bad effects—I should say it had been gradually coming on for three or four days perhaps—if I had not heard of any accident, I should have said it might or might not be attributable to natural causes—by serous effusion I mean watery effusion on the brain—that produces unconsciousness—for the last two or three days he required to be raised in order to understand, but at the first part of his illness he was clear and collected; the unconsciousness came on during the last day or two—I will not say that was entirely attributable to the acci<lb></lb>dent; it might or might not be—under the circumstances, I consider the serous effusion was attributable to the accident—if I had not heard of the accident, I should have said it might have been entirely independent of any accident—I am not able positively to say that the one was a natural sequence of the other—in a person of his age it would be more likely to occur from natural causes—it arises from weakness of the vessels of the brain; they grow weak as we grow older—I desired beef tea to be given—I did not order so much as a pint of wine to be administered, but a large quantity was necessary to sustain life with his feeble powers—both beef tea and wine were necessary—I did not attend him at the same time as Mr. Atkins—I desired him to continue the wine-glass of wine every four hours—if they had given him a pint a day it would not have been too much—if they had told me they had given him a pint and more, besides brandy, I should perhaps have said it was too much: if it was much more than a pint, a glass or two more would not have been too much, or a glass or two of brandy be<lb></lb>sides; in fact, he required the stimulant to keep him in existence—latterly, for the last few days, I believe he rejected almost everything—I don't think too much was given to him—too much stimulant might, in certain cases, account for effusion on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it account for serous effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—a patient suffering from sloughing might take with safety stimulants that would not be given to another patient—I had no reason to suppose, from the action of the pulse or the tongue, that he bad taken more than enough—the abdomen was in a healthy state, and also the chest—looking at that fact, and at the lacerated wound on the leg, I consider the serous effusion was the result of the accident—I should have said it arose from some accident even if I had never heard of this accident, and that the ordinary course of life had been interfered with by some calamity.</p>

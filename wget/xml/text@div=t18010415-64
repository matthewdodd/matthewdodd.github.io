             sworn. - On the 9th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, as I was returning out of the City, I met the two prisoners in the same street that the Royal Exchange is in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean Cornhill? - A. Yes; knowing Griffiths before, he shook hands with me; I told him he had met me at a wrong time, as I had no money in my pocket to ask him to drink, as I would wish; we went into a public-house and had a pot of beer, and a paper of tobacco; we stopped there two hours, and then Griffiths told me of one Gearing, and he went out to fetch him; I asked Hopkins if he was a <rs id="t18010415-64-deflabel362" type="occupation">lighterman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you partake of the gin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I was a little in liquor; we all four of us went out of the house together, I paid what little money, I had as part of the reckoning; when we got out, one of them, I cannot say which, called a coach, and we all got in, but where the coachman was ordered to drive to I don't know;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150042"></xptr>Griffiths sat opposite me on the starboard side of the coach; the coach stopped, and they had half a pint of gin more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you partake of that too? - A. I cannot recollect; the coach went on, and in Holborn Griffiths seized upon me all at once, and got hold of the chain of my watch; I called to the coachman to stop two or three times, and then he caught hold of me by the throat, and held me there while Hopkins and Gearing took my property; they took a silver watch, a silver chain, a gold and a silver ring, a silver key and seal, a pair of silver buckles, one of my shoes, and my hat; Hopkins and Gearing jumped out of the coach, and the coachman detected Griffiths before he could get away; they cut away the waistband of my trowsers with a knife, but I cannot tell who it was that cut them; an officer belonging to Whitechapel came by at the same time, and made him get into the coach again, and then we went to Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were not very drunk when you came out of the public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Only half and half? - A. No, I was not half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no money? - A. I had little or no money when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. As we are upon the subject of money, did you ever hear of a forty pounds reward? - A. Yes; but I don't look upon that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very drunk at last, after drinking the gin? - A. No; I was not so drunk but I knew what I was doing; I went the next evening, and found out the house again, to look for Gearing, and there we heard of him; he was taken up the same night, and admitted an evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to stop the third man? - A. Jumping out in that way, I thought they were going to leave a drunken man in the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. They were all very drunk, were they not? - A. I don't know; the waterman let them into the coach, I did not see any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sampson drunk? - A. I cannot say; after I had stopped Griffiths, I found Sampson almost throttled in the coach.</p>

I will take care to speak the truth; I am a carpenter and box-maker, I work in Finch-lane; I was going to carry a box home, and in Cornhill I met Griffiths; he asked me if I could tell him of a job, I told him, I had a brother better acquainted with the business, and I would ask him when he left work; I went with him to a public-house in Bell-yard, or Bell-court, Gracechurch-street, we had a pot of beer and some bread and cheese; I agreed to meet him there again when I had done work, and about a quarter past six he came to the shop where I work, he told me Sampson was at the public-house just by, and would he glad to see me; I knew Sampson before; I went with him to the public-house, and there was Sampson and Hopkins; I had never seen Hopkins before to the best of my knowledge; we had some gin, I cannot say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150043"></xptr>how much, I paid for one half-pint, I think there were three or four half-pints of gin, and some beer, but I don't know how much; while we were there, I asked Griffiths if he meant to go over to my brother's, to enquire for work, he said he did not mean to go that night, he had borrowed some money of his friend, that was Hopkins; he said, Sampson talked of going home, and he had borrowed money for a coach; I don't know who proposed having a coach; I told him I had a relation at the other end of the town, and I would accompany Sampson to Soho-square; they seemed to be all very agreeable to go together, and Griffiths ordered a coach; Sampson, Hopkins, and I, got into the coach, and Griffiths settled with the man where to drive us to; we went down Lombard-street, and after we had gone some distance we stopped and had some gin; we went on again, and I observed Griffiths and Hopkins whispering together; Griffiths then struck Sampson, and the other seized him; I cannot tell what they did, for the blinds were up; I asked what was the matter; one of them said, you shall soon know what is the matter, or we shall soon know what is the matter, I don't know which, and immediately the door was opened, and I was pushed out; I ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your running? - A. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nothing that was done to Sampson? - A. No; they were both upon the top of him, or nearly upon the top of him; I could not see what they did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did each of you drink his half pint? - A. We all drank round regularly, as far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the coach when you got out? - A. I believe somewhere about Middle-row.</p>

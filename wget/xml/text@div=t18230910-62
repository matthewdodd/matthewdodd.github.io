On the 22d of August, the prisoner hired a gelding of me, to go to Bromley, in Kent, and was to return next morning by eleven o'clock; he took it away, and never brought it back. On the 2d of September, I saw it in possession of Robinson's servant, who was exercising it in the City-road, and am sure it is mine - it is worth 12 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you shew him more than one horse - A. No. There was no conversation about selling it if he liked it - he asked the price of a small mare; I said I did not want to sell her. He was to pay 15 s. for the hire of it, and said he should return by eleven o'clock. I had a letter from him on Sunday, saying the weather was so bad he could not bring his wife home, and he should be back that evening or Monday morning; I have lost the letter - it was dated Bromley, Kent. I received no further communication from him.</p>

            . I am foreman at Mr. Osborne's commission stables. On Friday, the 22d of August, the prisoner brought this gelding to be sold, and entered it in his own name. It was sold to Mr. Robinson, a coachmaster, for 12 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Robinson yourself - A. Yes; it was a very wet day when he brought it. He first called about five o'clock, to say he had a horse for sale, and wanted Mr. Osborne to advance 5 l. on account; that he had money to pay, and wished to sell the horse. I said I could not advance unless I saw the horse then, he fetched it - he said nothing of a man stopping him for money.</p>

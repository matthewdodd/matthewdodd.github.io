               <p>Q. Was your house broken open at any time - A. Yes, on the night between the 13th and 14th of January.</p>


               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A. About a quarter before two in the morning, my husband and me went to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house shut up, and secured when you went to bed - A. Yes, there were three or four excise officers in the house when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they sleep there - A. No; there is always one or other of them there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your back parlour window - A. Yes; the back parlour window, I fastened myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you disturbed in the night after you went to bed by any noise - A. Yes, my husband told me of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210021"></xptr>Q. How did you fasten the back parlour window. - A. I fastened the parlour window with Iron bolts, I shut the parlour window myself; the staircase window was bolted inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you was awoke by your husband, and he said, there was a noise. - A. He awoke me, and said, there was a noise; I said, I dare say it was the excisemen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Did you hear it. - A. No; my husband heard the noise, I did not, we went to sleep, we were disturbed by Mr. Fox, the exciseman, at six o'clock we got some information that the house was broken open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it dark then. - A. Yes; it was dark, we got up immediately; we found the back door with the pully cut off, and thrown into the yard adjoining, that is White-Lion yard, the cell of the back parlour window, where the shutters slide in, was pulled entirely down; it is a very large window, one of the sashes were open, and the other shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you lost. - A. We lost a great many things; boots, shoes, and gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a great quantity of goods that have been produced to you. - A. I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many boots and shoes you lost. A. I cannot speak to them, my husband can better speak to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You did not go to bed till a quarter to two. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went to bed, there were three or four excisemen up - A. I spoke to one when I went up.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they all to stay there all night, or to go away. - A. One stopped so long, and went away, and then another came; they have all a key of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you in the morning perceive how they got in. - A. We thought they got in at the back door; we did not know till we heard the evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the excisemen any business to do in the shop. A. No; the shop is fastened, and then we go through a parlour to go where the excisemen are. The excisemen could not go into the shop without breaking the lock; we had the key; no locks were broke. The staircase window comes into the passage. They took the shutters down, and went into the parlour, and then they could go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The excisemen could not go into the shop. - A. No; not without they had done as these men had; what I mean is, there is a lock on the door where the excisemen passes. A person getting in at the back parlour window might get into the shop, without breaking the lock, but they could not get into the shop without they got in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself lock the door which leads into the back parlour - A. No; I never lock the door myself my husband always locked it; when I got up in the morning, I found that door locked.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers belonging to Worship-street office. - A. I am; in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Sinclair's house on Sunday, between one and two o'clock in the day. I went into the back yard, where there is a parlour that communicates to the shop, and joins it by a door and partition, and under that parlour window, the cell was broken down in crumbs, whether by decay, or by force, I could not say; I saw no marks of instruments; I then was taken into the shop, and saw where the goods were taken from. I came away after that, and on the Monday, I received information, in consequence of that, I and other officers went and apprehended the two prisoners at the Gold-house in Golden-lane, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, on the Monday night they were secured; and on that very night I went in company with Vickery and Bishop to Stanton's house in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens, there I found this pair of half boots, a pair of childrens pumps, six clouts, and two habit shirts. That is what I had from there; I took Stanton, and put him in the watchhouse that night. And these are the things that I found at Crutchington's house in Essex-street, on Friday, the 2d of February: here is a pair of sheets, a number of child's skirts, calimanco or stuff, these two silk gowns, a petticoat, a child's frock and a shirt; all these goods were shewed to Mrs. Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Court. You produce another parcel. - A. These are a pair of Hessian boots, three pair of shoes and a piece of cotton, they were found at the same time; that is all I found. I went with Cartwright, and searched Wheeler's house, Cartwright has that property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Mrs. Sinclair. Look at any part of that property and tell me whether you know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This a part found at Crutchinton's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sinclair. These are very much like my things; I do not see any marks.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any of your work upon it; look at the other things that you are likely to know. - A. There are some child's things. There is no mark on the sheet; that gown is like what I had in my shop; I had such a thing in the shop I know, but I might have sold it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at that sheet again, whose initials is that. - A. There is T. D. on it; I generally mark my sheets in the middle. This is a pelisse; it is like what I had in the shop, but I might have sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep. - A. A clothes shop on one side. That petticoat I think I have had in the shop; I do not see any mark upon it: I cannot say whether it was in the shop at that present time.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another sheet, look at that. - A. I cannot see any mark upon which I could swear. This is a child's morning gown; I have had this in my shop, there is some of my work about it; I cannot say whether I have sold it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you had last seen it - A. No, I cannot say. This is a petticoat that I never missed until I saw them; all the seven were together. I know I have had them in my shop. I cannot say whether I had sold them or not. I remember they were all in one parcel, over a vinegar cask.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the house was broken open, had you seen them - A. I do not recollect of seeing them a week before; but when I saw them, I knew they had been in the shop. This gown, I know I had this in my shop, because there is some of my work about it. I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210022"></xptr>seen it on the Thursday that my house was broken open on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your own - A. It was one in the shop. This is a child's petticoat. There are so many things alike of this kind, without it was marked, I cannot say I think I have had it; but I cannot swear to it. This is a boy's shirt; I think I have had this in my shop, but I cannot swear to it. This child's frock was along with the stuff petticoats the last time I saw them. I bought it with the petticoats. I had them about three weeks. I drawed the tape out of it. I know I had it in the shop. I have no doubt it was mine once; and this other frock was in a piece with the petticoats. I made it a frock at the same time I bought the petticoats. I had seen that a fortnight or three weeks before. These two habit shirts, I might have had them, but I could not swear to them; they have not my mark, nor is there any of my work on them. There were two dozen of these clouts together, I had in the shop the Saturday night before these were taken out; they were very much like these.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there now - A. Half a dozen. I bought them only on the Saturday; they are clouts or napkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the shoes and see, whether you see your husband's stamp upon them - A. There is his stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. These boots were found in Essex-street, at Crutchington's - A. They are stamped; these boys shoes, there are no stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. With respect to these napkins, there are no marks upon them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are upon your oath; your husband and you keep a shop, he sells shoes - A. Yes, and I keep a clothes shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you purchase hundreds of them articles - A. Yes; we buy at auctions some of them things.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not your husband have disposed of these things in your absence, he does sometimes serve in the shop - A. Yes, and sometimes I serve of his side when he is not in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not they common napkins - A. Oh, yes, they are. I have sold many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pretend to say, that these half dozen were half a dozen of the two dozen that you had in the shop - A. I have not much doubt but they were, but I cannot swear that they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time on the Saturday did you buy them - A. About ten o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you see them afterwards - A. I do not remember seeing them after ten o'clock in the morning. I recollect buying some. I do not pretend to say they are them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. (to Armstrong.) You forgot to state to his Lordship and the jury, that you searched Landers's lodgings - A. I did, I found nothing there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Monday, the 15th of January, I went to Mr. Sinclair's house, in company with Armstrong and Bishop I saw the situation of the premises, and after that we went and took the two prisoners at the Gold-house in Golden-lane; we brought them to the office; we found Stanton at home, and I found these two odd boots; these were up in the place where he kept pigeons.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix.) Look at these boots and tell me, whether they have your husband's stamp upon them - A. Yes; that is a stamp that we generally stamp them all with, because the men should not change the stuff; they are two odd boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined them with two odd boots that you had at home - A. I have not examined them, we often have odd boots. I never saw them matched.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you present at the time the officers matched them with two odd boots that you had at your house after the robbery - A. No, I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Vickrey.) Stanton is a lame man, is not he - A. He is, he could only wear one of them in the state they are now. The moment we came in the house Stanton took us up stairs, and shewed us the two odd boots.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I found these two black silk handkerchiefs Stanton's house, in company with the other officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now, Mrs. Sinclair, have the goodness to look at them - A. I lost two black handkerchiefs, one of them was quite a new one, it had never been worn, there was no mark upon it, I had it a month, I bought it for my own wearing, I saw it on Saturday night, I took it out to shew to a sister of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that you had shewn the handkerchief to your sister on the Saturday night, do you mean by that the night of the robbery - A. Yes, and I lost a crimson one, wrapped up with this.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that - A. I cannot say; this was in the shop as rubbish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You said you lost two black handkerchiefs, one of which was a new black handkerchief, and never worn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not they both been worn - A. Yes, and very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, from the appearance of them, do you believe them to be yours - A. I cannot pretend to say, whether they are, or are not; these were not found till a fortnight afterwards at Stanton's house. It is much the same size and quality, and the old one is like the one I lost; but it is impossible for any body to say.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Joshua Armstrong.) On what day did you find the two black handkerchiefs at Stanton's house - A. On the 2nd of February.</p>

               <p>Q. You produce something - A. Yes, some shoes and sheets; I took them from a house in Long-lane, No. 31, kept by a person of the name of Wheeler, in consequence of a search warrant. Wheeler was at home; one pair of shoes were upon Wheeler's feet, which the prosecutor owned to directly, and another pair of shoes in a box in the garret; then we sent for the prosecutor's wife, and shewed her a bundle of dirty clothes in the room; she picked them up herself, and said she could swear to them; they were shifts and sheets, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix) Look at these sheets - A. I do not see any mark. I do not doubt but I have had them both in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your own use, or articles in the shop - A. In the shop to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how lately you had seen them before the robbery - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Who picked them out - A. The officers picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210023"></xptr>them out. I said I knowed that I had had them in the shop; there is a shift, I have had this in the shop; how long I cannot say. I bought a great many shifts of this description on the Thursday. I saw it at Wheeler's when the officers pulled the things out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there identify it as your sheet - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these shoes and see whether there is your husband's stamp upon them - A. Yes, there is on these; the new ones have not, they have the stamp of a man that worked in the house, his name is Howard; he is gone from us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Have you not sold shoes with Howard - A. Yes, more than once, he worked for us a good while.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know the prisoners at the bar - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known them - A. About two or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean from the time that they were taken up, or from this time that you are now speaking; is it not above two or three weeks; you know they were taken in January, how long before they were taken up were you acquainted with them - A. It might be five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know White-cross-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being in company with the prisoners at the bar at any time in January last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet them - A. At the Gold-house public-house door, in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it - A. It was on a Saturday night, I think it was the 13th. I met the prisoners there; we might be there, in and out of the house, two or three hours in the course of the night; we drank together, and just by the time of the public house being shut up, that might be between eleven and twelve o'clock, we all agreed to go together, to go to Mr. Sinclair's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known Sinclair's house before - A. No further than seeing the house in the street, not to live in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that proposed that you should go to Sinclair's - A. I cannot say rightly, whether it was myself or either of them: it was agreed to go there. We walked about some time, and I think it was between two and three o'clock when we first went; then we got upon the wall, they two lifted me upon the wall at the back part of the house; when I got upon the wall, then Lander came up upon the wall after me, then we opened the stair-case window, I cannot say whether it was me or him, one of us opened it. How was waiting in the court on the other side of the wall. When the stair-case window was opened I got in, and Lander staid at the window while I went down stairs. I could not open the back parlour door, it was locked; I opened the back door on the inside and went into the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you open the door - A. I forgot whether there was a bolt or a latch; I do not think there was any bolt, only a latch. I unlatched it and went into the yard, and I opened the back door that leads into the court, that door is in the wall; then How and Lander came in, we then contrived to get the back shutters down in the yard of the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you manage to get the shutters down - A. We had a small piece of iron, and the ridge was all rotten, and then the shutters came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use the piece of iron then - A. Yes, by me and Lander, How standing by. When we got the shutters down, we opened the window and got in, it was a sash window that slides up and down; I got into the window, the other two staid at the window while I went in; when I got in I brought them out some things that I got out of the shop, a quantity of shoes, boots, and linen; I gave them to the prisoners at the window, and then we all went away together; then we took them to a house in Red Lion-market, Mrs. Jennings's, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Red Lion-market - A. In White Cross-street; we left them there, and came back again to the house of Sinclair. All of us went in at the back door into the yard, then I got in at the same window, and went into the shop and gave them more things, shoes, boots, and linen, some of all sorts; we went away to Mrs. Jennings's again, and when we went in Mrs. Jennings would not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her there the first time - A. No, I did not go in; the second time I saw Mrs. Jennings and Mr. Jennings too, they would not have them. We then brought them all out, the first parcel and the second. We went to try another house, we did not succeed in getting them up; we went to a house in Bridgewater-gardens, and there we left them. I do not know their names. We went back to Mr. Sinclair's again, we went in the same way at the back door, I got in the window again, I went into the shop and gave the things out of the window to them again, a quantity of shoes and boots, and a quantity of half-pence out of the till. I cannot say how many, perhaps there might be seven or eight shillings worth, and perhaps there might be more. I put some into my pocket. We then went into the house in Bridgewater-gardens again, and the people said, they did not deal in these things, they would not have them. Lander went out to see if he could get a place to put them in, or to see if his own place was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this return to Sinclair's house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you leave the house of Sinclair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210024"></xptr>the last time - A. Between four and five o'clock, I believe, it was not day light, it might be peep of day, it was not so dark but you could see. I cannot say whether there was any moon.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that Lander went out to look for a place to put these things in - A. Yes, he did not return for some time. I went out to look after him, I met him; me and Lander went down Long-lane, we went to knock a person up, we did not succeed, we came back and went to Stanton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for these things that you had lodged in Bridgewater-gardens - A. Lander went first and spoke, and then me and Lander carried the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you and Lander only carried the things, or was How with you - A. I went with the first parcel with Lander and staid with them, and then Lander brought them up stairs, who helped him I do not know; How was not there till the afternoon. We left the whole of the things at Stanton's, in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens; we took them up into the pigeon loft and looked over them; we put a few things of one side; some old things were given for the woman's children, and the rest we kept for our own use.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman's children do you mean - A. Stanton's children. After that we left the things there, and went to the Catherine Wheel, in Bridgewater-gardens, and found How there, that might be between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; then we had some rum and water and beer; and there we were in company with a man of the name of Banbury. Then me, and Lander, and Banbury, went to Long-lane to speak to this gentleman; I believe his name is Wheeler, he keeps a green-stall. We spoke to him; he said, he would come to us at the Catherine Wheel after he had his breakfast; we went back to the Catherine Wheel, Wheeler came about twelve o'clock; then I and Lander went to Stanton's and shewed him the goods that we had deposited there, he looked at them, we asked him nine pounds for them; he said, he must consider about it; he had two hours to consider about it; he did not come in the two hours. Me and Lander, and How, went down to his house, he was not at home; we went to a public-house and staid till he did come home, and when he came he would not give above five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it - A. It might be between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Then he came to five pounds ten shillings, and a crown to be spent, we agreed. We left the things till dark to take to his house; they took the things in a coach, and we went to Mr. Wheeler's with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take all the thinks - A. All the things, as far as I know. I missed of them, and when I came back to them they had the things in the coach. We got in there with the things. Mr. Wheeler then said, that he had but three pounds to give then; we were to call for the other the next day; we then came away and went to the Gold-house, and divided the three pounds among us; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you taken up - A. Between eight and nine o'clock that night, on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell this story that you have been telling to-day - A. On Monday morning I informed Mr. Armstrong of it, and then I went in and acquainted the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing that you forgot to state, recollect yourself - A. There was an old pair of shoes that were given to Banbury; whether he had them I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. My honest lad, this Saturday night you had received your wages, had not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A hard working lad, what business may you be - A. A watch-gilder.</p>
               <p>Q. You work regularly at watch-gilding, and you had received your wages - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your master - A. Messrs. Holloway and Gildi; they paid me my wages, one pound twelve shillings and two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you work of a Sunday - A. No; I never did any thing of my business of a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this public-house in Golden-lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about Mr. Sinclair's house before this night - A. No more than it has been mentioned by a good many, of going to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. Five or six might.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were hard working young men like yourself, were not they - A. I do not know whether they followed any business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it, a month, that you heard talking about this house - A. It might be three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And you do not know whether you yourself proposed it this night - A. I cannot say, I was mentioning it as much as them.</p>
               <p>Q. You just received your wages, mentioned this as a good thing; speak out, you know you are a good honest, industrious lad - A. I might have proposed it, and I do not know whether they mentioned it to me: it had been proposed by several of my companions.</p>
               <p>Q. This must be a new thing to you - A. Quite.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not seem to know any thing about it: you used, when you came to the house, a small piece of iron, you do not know the name of it, was it a jemmy - A. Something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. But you thought it to be a small piece of iron; upon your oath, had you never seen such a thing before in your life - A. Not of that sort; it was made of iron.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you had never seen one before in your life - A. Not of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You agreed to do this on the Saturday night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday you went to church and spent the day as you ought - A. Not on that Sunday, I did not go to church.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not sorry for what you had done - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were very sorry for what you had done - A. I have been very uneasy ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very sorry, and determined never to do so again - A. Never, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you taken up that very Sunday for robbing a man of a bundle in the street.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that.</p>
               <p>Witness. I was taken up for an offence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. Were not you taken on the Sunday, and taken before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You gave this account before the magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told this of your own free will. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was mere sorrow that made you do it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210025"></xptr>Q. Determined never to do the like again. - A. I never was convicted before.</p>
               <p>Q. No hope by telling this story you might not be convicted yourself. - A. No; I wanted to retrieve my character again, I did not think of myself, I was wishing to get clear of the company, and go to my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you mean to say, you had no hope of escaping yourself by convicting these men. - A. I was accused of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you keep very good company, do you mean to say that. - A. I have been drawn into company before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given evidence in any court before. - A. No; Sir, not before this here.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in a court of justice before. - A. Yes; when I was an apprentice, for running away from my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have learned from five or six persons that you were acquainted with, that their intention was to rob Mr. Sinclair's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these five or six composed off. - A. I know them very well by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoners at the bar either of these five or six persons that told you, that they were going to break open Mr. Sinclair's house. - A. I cannot be positive that they were in company then. Lander had heard it I was told.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know whether you did not take a fancy to these boots. - A. No; they would not suit me. I did not know then whether they were any body's else besides their own; no further, than I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not other things left there. - A. There were a pair of little shoes, and a pair of old ones, and a pair of half boots; them I gave to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Crutchington. - A. Yes; that is my brother in law. When they apprehended these men, I was fearful these things were not their own; I sent them down to my brother-in-law, because I would have no further piece of work about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate that you had sent the things to him. - A. I forgot it then; my wife sent the things to my brother-in-law; it is all the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith and silversmith, and live at No, 22, St. James's-street. In June last the prisoner was a shopman in my service—he had been so for several years—before he came into my service he had been a respectable tradesman in the same business, as I understand, in Regent-street, but I do not know—in June last I had occasion to inquire of him for a small portion of plate which had been given him to put away—he left me, and I understood him to say he was going for it, but I never saw him again that day—he absconded—he returned again after a day or two—(in the meantime somebody representing himself MI friend of his called on me—in a day or two after the prisoner came him<lb></lb>self,) and said that he had pledged my property in consequence of some bills be had accepted—he told me his wife had been confined two or three days, and he was going on his knees, but I prevented that—he said, "For God Almighty's sake do not prosecute me now, or it will be the death of my wife and child; I will deliver myself up at any time"—he said he would give me a faithful account of every thing, and that it did not amount to more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would send me the account—I afterwards received this list (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is in his hand-writing—it is a list of articles to the amount of about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the amount they are pledged for—they are worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and more—it consists of the articles stated in the indictment—when I found the amount out I reproached him for tellomg me it was only 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was very angry with him—I said, "You told me it was only 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Oh, sir! that is all yours"—I said, "So much the worse;" the rest had been left in my care and custody by persons, and it would bring reproach and disgrace on me—he said, the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth were articles belonging to me, and the rest were articles trusted to me, and which were under his care—I did not authorise him to pawn any articles.</p>

I produce twelve table-forks pawned on the 7th of December, 1836, for nine guineas, by the prisoner—that is more than they are really worth in the best market in London—it is almost 6*. an ounce—they would not fetch more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce—I did not take them in, and cannot say who pawned them—they would not fetch that money in the best sale room in London—they weigh 32oz. 5dwt—I have a tea-pot and bason pawned by the prisoner in the name of John Smith, Stamford-street—he had been a customer so long I did not inquire at every time he brought things who they belonged to—I have a cup and waiter which were pawned on the 7th of March for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a French watch on the 25th of March for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by the prisoner, in the same name and address—I have also a waiter and gold chain which were pawned on the 1st of April, but those I understand Mr. Lewis cannot swear to.</p>

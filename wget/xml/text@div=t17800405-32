They passed me about an hundred yards, and then came back and asked me if I had any money; I told them I had a little. Thompson came up and presented something to me like a pistol, and said, If I stirred or resisted he would blow my brains out. The others put their hands into my breeches pocket and took out a guinea and seven shillings and three-pence. I asked them to give me a shilling again, as I had no money in the world; the tall one (Thompson) bid the other give it me; the short one said, Did I resist? if I resisted they would kill me and throw me in the ditch! One came up to me with something in his hand; I thought he was going to kill me, upon which the woman who was with me said, you have got his money, save his life. They then went away, and we went to the Ship at Stepney, and asked if there was any body there to go after them; they advised me to go to Justice Sherwood's, which I did; I got there about eight o'clock; they were busy and could not go after them just then. We did not go after them till near nine o'clock. We took two of them going out of the fields into Mile-end road, about half a mile from the place where they robbed me. There was a skirmish; one of them flashed his pistol and the other two got away.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to know the people who robbed you? - Yes. When I passed them and asked what was o'clock, I had a suspicion of them, and looked particularly at them; I looked at them as they came back to me. Thompson had a brownish coat, a flapped hat, and a black handkerchief. The other prisoner was dressed just the same, only his hat was turned up and he had a yellow and red handkerchief.</p>
               <p>If you had not taken them that night, but seen them separate two or three days after should you have known them? - Yes, I should. They all spoke during the robbery.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the prisoners before? - No. I was going with a young woman, to see her safe to her mother's at Stepney, because she was belated; she had been with me at my brother's at White-chapel.</p>

I was too late for the carriage; I called at Mr. James<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050057"></xptr>White's in Whitechapel; the prosecutor went with me, to see me safe to my mother's who is nursing at Stepney.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the prosecutor? - I had lived servant with his brother. In the field we met three men, two short ones and a tall one; the tall one had a black coat and a black handkerchief; the other had a yellow and white handkerchief. We asked them what o'clock it was? They went past, and then came back to the young man, and asked if he had any money? He said a little. The tall one put a pistol to his head, and said if he stirred he would blow his brains out, and the two short ones put their hands in his pockets, and took his money out. One of the short ones had the guineas and halfpence, and the other the silver. I saw it in their hands; they opened their hands to look at it. He said they had got all his money, and asked them to give him a shilling. The short ones said, Do you resist? and came back and said, if he resisted they would kill him, and throw him in the ditch. I laid hold of one man and said, for heaven's sake, save his life! you have got his money. Upon that the tall man said, Do not burt him, consider the woman. I went with him to Justice Sherwood's office, and went with the runners, and was present when the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of them? - Yes, I am very certain to them? the tall one I think it was that had the pistol.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the pistol was snapped? - Yes; I saw the flash of the fire.</p>
               <p>Was you ever out with Sherwood's men before? - No, I never was, I did not know them before.</p>

               <p>I am one of Justice Sherwood's men. Last Saturday night White and the woman came down to our office, and said they had been stopped by three men in the fields, and robbed of a guinea and seven shillings; we got some arms, and went with them; some of us went the field-way, and some the roadway. Just as I got to the top of the New Road, I saw three men coming out of the fields; I went up to the tall one, and laid hold of him. Elby came up, and I delivered him to Elby, and secured one of the others; a skirmish ensued, and the other man made his escape. I saw a pistol slash in the scuffle, but do not know which had it: we took them to a public house, and the prosecutor said they were the men; we searched them, and found six shillings and nine-pence upon one, and about five shillings on the other. The next morning we went to see if we could find a pistol on the spot, suspecting they had thrown one away; we found there a piece of a broomstick, and this chissel (producing them).</p>

They said what was that to us, they were hardworking men. I laid hold of Thompson; I thought he had a pistol in his hand; I drew my hanger, and bid him keep his pistol off. The other prisoner coming up we secured them: the other man got off. The woman was about twenty yards behind, when we stopped them.</p>
               <p>How soon did she come up? - I cannot say; I did not see her again till we came down to the office; we went the field-way; she went with Farrell and the others the road-way.</p>

We took them down to the office, and the prosecutor and the woman both swore to them. They were committed for further examination on Wednesday.

               <p>Does she know either of these people? - No, she knows nothing of them at all.</p>
               <p>How long has she lived there? - I do not know; she was in the house when I came in. I have lived there half a year.</p>
               <p>Had you any thing to eat? - No, only a piece of bread and butter with my tea.</p>
               <p>Had not you some peppermint? - Yes, at a publick-house before tea. I do not know the publick-house.</p>
               <p>What time did they go away? - I have reason to believe it was past nine o'clock. The post-man never strikes out his bell till the clock has struck nine, and I heard him as they went away.</p>

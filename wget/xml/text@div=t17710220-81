               <p>Council for the prisoner. My Lord, I don't conceive that this evidence is now at liberty to go into evidence so late back as the year 1765; the day in the indictment is the 10th of June, I hope your lordship and the court will not allow Mr. Payne to go into such evidence. The indictment charges this on the 10th of June last; can you speak to any facts on that particular day?</p>
               <p>Payne. The day I can speak to in particular is the second of June, 1765.</p>

               <p>Council. Find him out.</p>
               <p>Saunders. I have seen a person I am told was he: I received a particular description of the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see this person? What have you got in your hand?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Only a memorandum of the particulars: I have the original in my pocket: I made the original at the time the affair happened on the seventh of January, 1770; here is the original: the day before that was Saturday. Mr. Payne asked me to go to that place; he said, Bishop Talbot was to preach: he gave me a particular description of his person, as a man well advanced in years, and a meagre thin countenance, and that he was to have a mitre on his head; it was in <placeName id="t17710220-81-crimeloc391">White's Alley, Moorfields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who did you say preached?</p>
               <p>Saunders. This person preached; when I came out there were a great number of people there besides their own; they said, that was Bishop Talbot; they told me so next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dressed that preached?</p>
               <p>Saunders. In a white robe.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the particulars?</p>
               <p>Saunders. He had a cap on when he came in, but he took it off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cap?</p>
               <p>Saunders. A blackish cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put any thing else on?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Nothing then, but preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at any other time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, at two other times, June the 10th; it was the same person, he preached and catechised three young children.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the same place?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. In the same manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on his head then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, nothing as I remember then.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200068"></xptr>Q. Was any thing else done?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I understand he confirmed three children; I am told since it was catechising; I do not know from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular ceremony used with these children?</p>
               <p>Saunders. After catechising of them he laid his hands on their heads and repeated some benedictions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mass that day?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. One Mr. Dilton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Talbot say mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, this was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further?</p>
               <p>Saunders. On the 24th of June the same person as before preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mass then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said mass then?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not know whether Dillon or some other person; I did not take a memorandum of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else done?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, nothing else whatever, only there was one thing last Thursday. I met a person, who is either a brewer's clerk or a cooper, who endeavoured to frighten me from coming here.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us any thing of any conversation that passed elsewhere. Did any body else say mass besides Dillon?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, one Fowler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Talbot say mass on the 10th of June: did you at any of these days hear Mr. Talbot say mass?</p>
               <p>Saunders. The person, called Talbot, said mass one day.</p>
               <p>Q. One day he did say mass; was it June the seventh?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I believe the 24th of June was the day: I know I made a memorandum of it (looks at his papers) he did not say mass, he only preached.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he administer the Sacrament any time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They administered the Sacrament to several people; the person called Talbot was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When w as that?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It does not mention the day; I believe it was on the tenth of June, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he administer the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After what form?</p>
               <p>Saunders. The form of the Jewish ritual.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about and see if you can see the person?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I do not see any such person here; the person was far advanced in years that I saw. I do not see any such person.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced a paper you made at that time: I suppose you took a minute of all that passed at that time?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you omit any thing?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was not in my power to remember every thing that was said.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said one, two and three Sundays?</p>
               <p>Saunders. June the seventh, one Wheeler said mass; the person called Bishop Talbot preached on these words, my sheep hear my voice. June 10, one Dillon said mass, and Bishop Talbot preached, and either catechised or confirmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put down these memorandums on those particular days, or put them all down together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I put them down on particular bits of paper, and put them on one afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When were these three put together?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They were writ a long while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this wrote last week, or the week before?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wrote this week or last; was it wrote this week?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it last week?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Possibly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is nothing here of any bodies administering the Sacrament at all; you thought it so immaterial you did not put it down?</p>

               <p>Saunders. I saw it administered there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. As you speak with great caution, for which you ought to be very much commended, was the person thus described to you; I will not ask by whom, on the seventh of January, tenth of June, and twenty-fourth of June, by the name of Bishop Talbot: was that the same person all these days?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes, that very same person that was described to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200069"></xptr>Q. What time was it you saw him?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was in the afternoon he preached; I believe all the times was afternoon: no, one was in the forenoon, from eleven to one, in the afternoon from three to five.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been there often?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I have been there many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you ever knew mass, except on one particular day in the year, last longer than twelve o'clock?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this was Trinity Sunday?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am pretty sure mass is not quite finished about ten minutes before twelve; what time might it begin?</p>
               <p>Saunders. About eleven; it takes up generally between forty and fifty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did preaching begin in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I believe it might be some little matter after three, and then vespers are said, which is done about a quarter, perhaps, before five.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose orders did you go?</p>
               <p>Saunders. It was by Mr. Payne's desire I went.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he to do in this matter?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I was, and am under pecuniary obligations to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What has that to do with your going to enquire after these catholicks?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Because, in consequence of my obligations I was under to him, I could not deny any thing he asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you gave him an account from time to time of what you saw?</p>
               <p>Saunders. I did; there may be many other things I had not copies of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they your hand writing (shewing him four letters.)</p>

               <p>Saunders. Yes; (they are put into court.)</p>

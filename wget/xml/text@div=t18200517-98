            . I am foreman at Mr. Brown's pot-ash manufactory, Bromley. On the 9th of May, about half past four o'clock, I was called up, and was informed somebody was robbing my garden. I live in North-street, Poplar, about 300 yards from the manufactory. I got up and went to my garden at Limehouse, about a quarter of mile off. When I got to the bridge, which crosses the water, I saw Daws going away with a bundle of wood on his shoulder. I immediately ran towards him - he did not see me - and he put his load down to rest. I asked what he had got there; he said, what was that to me. The place where he was is private property, and belonged to Mr. Gunn. It has an open footpath with a board up, stating that the grass is not to be trod upon. I told him he was trespassing, and then saw the load was staves and not my property. He had come out of a ditch which parts my premises from Gunn's. I said he must go with me - he was very impudent, and was going to make a start. I took hold of him, and he caught hold of me and tried to throttle me. I threw him down and secured him. I took him back to the bridge, and sent one of Brown's men for the staves he had left in the field. I had them in sight all the time. I was looking at the man who was bringing the staves to me, and saw Hill come out of the same ditch, and from exactly the same part - he was also carrying some staves on his shoulder - he was about fifty yards off. I sent the men to secure him, and saw them take him. We took them both to the watch-house with the staves, and about ten o'clock found they belonged to the prosecutors. Daws told me, that as soon as he got out of custody he would give me a pill, by day or by night, and when he came to the Bar, he hoped they would send him out of the country, for there were more Thistlewoods than one. He had five staves, Hill had three, and seven were left in the field - three of those Daws had were marked.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NEWPORT. I am a carpenter, and live at Poplar. At half past five o'clock I was going to work, and saw six or eight people in the road. I perceived Poulter had Daws, and he said there was an old man in the field. I then saw Hill come out of a ditch in Mr. Gunn's field with three staves on his shoulder - I secured him with them, and said,</p>
               <p>"You must come with me." He said he would not, a scuffle ensued, and he threw them down. We took the prisoners to the watch-house with them.</p>

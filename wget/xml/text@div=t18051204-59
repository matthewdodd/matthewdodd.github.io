             sworn. I am an officer of Worship-street. On Thursday the 7th of November, I was in company with Armstrong and other officers, in Spitalfields; about seven o'clock in the evening, as we were going up Raven-row, I observed the prisoner go into an old iron-shop, I immediately followed him in; I heard the man in the shop say, how many pieces have you got now; I at that time was behind the prisoner; the man that keeps the shop looked of one side and observed me, he said I will have nothing at all to do with them; I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and the pieces of canvas that was in his apron, and delivered the prisoner into the care of Bishop, and the canvas likewise; Bishop took them to the office, as I was going on other business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not seven o'clock, it was about half after five.</p>
               <p>Ray. It must be later than that, in was near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>- BISHOP sworn. I was in company with Ray on the 7th of September, I asked him where he got the canvas, he said he got it from Mr. Daker, buckram stiffner, in White-cross-street, that he took it out of some of the pieces, it was his master's property, he wanted to make a little money of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not say it was my master's property.</p>
               <p>Bishop. He did say it was his master's property. I produce it.</p>

             sworn. The stamp that is at the end of it has the apperance, that it has been in my possession. I cannot swear to linen.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no reason to suppose that he had taken any thing? - A. I had no reason to suppose so, he was a quiet, sober, inoffensive man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my master's employment on the 7th of November; as I passed through the yard, I wished three of the men good-night; I went home to get my tea, my wife was not at home, I had my tea with the children, a woman was at work in the room that I was in. I had nothing with me when I went in the room, nor when I came out. I was going down Grub-street to turn up Butler's-alley, I saw the bundle laying before me. I put it in my apron; when I came to Peter-street the person was not at home where I expected to find my wife; I then went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040079"></xptr>Long-alley; I asked at a shop there, if they bought any such things as them, they said no, there was a shop in Raven-row, where they bought such cloths. I went to Raven-row, I asked the man if they bought them, he said, how many have you got, I said there is four remnants: there are other dyers that work for the same houses as my master does.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Was it light? - Yes, the moon was at the full the day before. When I had got fifty or sixty yards lower down the wall two of them came forward. Russell was one, and I believe Milbourne was the other, but not seeing his face, I will not swear positively he was the man. The other two staid a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220031"></xptr> behind. I had some suspicion then that I should be attacked. I got as near the ditch side as I could, they were next the wall; when I came even with them, one of them put something out from him and said stop! whether it was a bludgeon or what I cannot say. He then said Your watch and your money! I said, gentlemen, I have no watch and very little money. Then the man who was next the wall, who I take to be Milbourne, seized me by the collar and turned me above half way round and set my face towards the field; then the prisoner took some weapon, or cutlass, out of his bosom; it was very bright, and had a picked point. He said, if your stir, or make the least noise, you are a dead man! and he pointed it to my left breast; then the other man, who I believe to be Milbourne, put his hand into my pocket and pulled out a shilling which I had had returned the day before as a bad one; and out of my right-hand pocket he took a shilling and sixpence more; by this time the other two came up behind me; they pushed my hat over my eyes. One of them asked me, what my shoe-buckles were? I said, plated. One said have them. When they asked me the question about the buckles, I pushed my hat on one side to answer them. I saw the prisoner then standing before me with the weapon as before. As I moved my hat one of the men behind me struck me with his hand, d - d me, and bid me keep my hat as it was. One behind asked what my stock-buckle was? I told him it was silver, and they took it from my stock. Then one of them put his hand into my side pocket, but finding nothing but a letter, he did not take it. One of them then said, d - n his eyes, have his coat; they pulled of my coat by force; as soon as they hat got off my coat, they

             the weapon across my neck, the back of it as I suppose, for it did not cut me; and then they left me. As they went away my hat fell upon the ground; I picked it up and a handbasket which lay about three or four yards from me, which I had before in my hand. I saw the four men going away together; when they were about thirty or forty yards from me, I heard my cane, which they had taken from me, drop; I went after them, and took it up, and then I returned towards home.</p>
               <p>Are you positive the prisoner was one of them? - Yes, I am. He stood right before me, and I looked him full in the face. I had my eye on his face all the time till the other came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise on his face? - None at all. He had a cocked hat; the other man had a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Could you see him perfectly plain? - Yes; he had a light coloured close-bodied coat and a great coat on. On Monday the 29th, having heard that some footpads were taken up, I went to Bow-street, and was informed they were to be brought up on the Thursday following. I attended on Thursday, and five men were brought up to the bar. I was asked whether any of them were the men who robbed me? I told them I could not be positive to any of the five. Then Russell was brought up; I said immediately, that is the man who robbed me. He had the same light coloured close-bodied coat on then which he had on when he robbed me.</p>

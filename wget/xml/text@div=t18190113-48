            . I am a sheep salesman at Smithfield-market; I know the prisoner. On Friday, the 30th of October last, about seven o'clock in the morning, he applied to me to sell 19 sheep for him; they were marked P in a circle. He said they belonged to Mr. Parish, a relation of his; in consequence of which I sold them for him to Mr. Fletcher, in the open market, for 46 s. each; they came to 43 l. 1 s. 4 d., deducting my commission, which was 8 d. on each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I first knew him on the 14th of September - I am certain he is the man, who ordered me to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. Some hundred of sheep are brought to you in a day - A. Yes; I am sure he is the man, he spoke to me once or twice in the day, before I had sold them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors' bailiff. On the 29th of October, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw all the sheep safe in my masters' field, at Sewardston, about ten miles from Shoreditch; there were 39 of them marked P in a circle. Next day between one and two o'clock I went into the field, and missed nineteen of them; I looked round the field, but could not find them; I did not examine the lock of the gate. I have since seen them at Mr. Fletcher's; they are the same that were stolen. The fences were in good condition; they could not have got out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I locked the sheep up; Fletcher lives at Erith, in Kent; I knew the sheep to be my masters' - I do not speak of them altogether by the mark, though I marked them myself; I should know two or three of them without the mark - I saw them two days after they were stolen.</p>

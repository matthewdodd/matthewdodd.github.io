On the 26th of July, (which was the first day of West End fair) between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was collecting money from different gates.

I received a blow from Henley over my hat, which cut my hat and head. He said,</p>
               <p>"You b - g - r, how are you off for old iron! Do you want to transport another man for stealing iron?" - the blow stunned me. Before I could lift my hat up they all got out of the cart, and hustled and throttled me, so that I was almost choaked; I felt them pulling my watch, but they could not get it out. Barrat and the prisoner took hold of me by my neck-handkerchief; I had 320 l. in my pocket, and put my hand there to secure it. My hand was cut by some sharp instrument - I have the mark of it now; it was either Barratt or the prisoner who did it. Some people came to my assistance, and they all got into the cart, and drove off towards the fair. I saw the prisoner and Barratt next day, and seized the prisoner, but he got from me. I did not see him again until the 9th of this month, when he was taken.</p>

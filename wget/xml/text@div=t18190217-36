            . In February, 1818, I was midshipman of the Magician frigate, which was stationed at the Island of Mauritius - we laid off port Jacutos. On the 21st of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we perceived a schooner standing off and in Suriac, which is a harbour of the island - the wind was against us; Mr. Evans, the master, ordered Mr. Jarrat, another midshipman, and myself, to go over land to intercept the schooner - we went with a party of seamen - we had to go eight miles. We got to Suriac about half-past four o'clock, and saw her endeavouring to get out of port, in so doing she ran on the reef of the rocks; we all boarded her, and found twelve or thirteen persons on board, among whom were the three prisoners - Phillibert appeared to be the master, and the other two mates. Phillibert gave the papers to Mr. Jarrat, and said they kept no log-book - they spoke in French. I went into the hold to examine the vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fitted up - A. With a loose deck, or platform, about four feet from the upper deck; there was no cargo on board, except water. I examined three of the casks, two of which were filled with salt water. There were above twenty casks on board, which was much more than sufficient to supply twelve men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did the ship appear to be fitted up - A. For the slave trade. The schooner went down before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170024"></xptr>we left her. On the 24th of February we searched a storehouse close to the bank of the river, and found yards and sails, and about a dozen pair of shackles, or irons, of different sizes, as if for women and boys; they were taken on board our frigate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before you boarded the schooner did you first see her - A. About an hour and a half, or two hours; she was about three miles off at sea, when we first saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have landed 92 slaves without your knowing it - A. I do not think they could, it would take a long time. I was never on board but one slaveship that had no moveable deck. There was not room enough to carry bullocks. The storehouse belonged to Madam Munroe, who has, I believe, about four hundred slaves. The island is about nine months voyage from here. We brought the prisoners home with us.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What ship did you return in - A. The Prince Regent merchant ship. The prisoners were treated kindly on the voyage.</p>

            . I was a seaman on board the Magician. I was one of the party on board the tender, on the 21st of February, we were directed to go by land to intercept the schooner - our party consisted of nine. When we got to Suriac we separated, one party went in a boat to go on board her, the other went on the hill, to fire into her. I went on the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you fire into her for - A. She tried to get out, and struck on a reef of rocks. We boarded her, and saw the three prisoners there, and eight or nine sailors - the prisoners appeared to be officers. The schooner went down in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoners - A. In confinement at the hospital of Port Louis. After the schooner was wrecked I went on board, and brought some spars and tackle away, and took them to Munroe's storehouse, where I found about thirty-six bags of stuff, like rice, and a bag of irons, large and small - they appeared to be for peoples' legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I found the things at the storehouse the first time that I went, which was the day after the schooner went down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you compare the tackle you brought from the schooner with that in the storehouse - A. Yes, they were the tackle of the same ship.</p>
               <p>LISE VICTORINE (through an interpreter). I was slave to Madam Lebrun, who lived at the Hermitage, at the Mauritius.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a quantity of blacks being brought to your mistress's - A. Yes, the prisoners and Le Tountaine came with them, and two or three sailors - they were put in the storehouse - there were men, women, and two or three children. They remained in the storehouse about three days. They could not speak French. There had been a hurricane in the island.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoners remain there - A. About three days; they lodged in mistress's house. They went out with about half the blacks, and returned with them, the same day, and put them into the storehouse again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Monsieur Cavilla - A. Yes, Quanto was his servant; they came in while the prisoners were there, and brought the provisions and clothes with them for the new blacks; they both slept at mistress's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a party of soldiers coming at night to the house while the prisoners and blacks were there - A. Yes, about three days after the blacks arrived, Cavilla and Quanto were also there - the soldiers were not admitted. Madam Lebrun said she would not open the door unless the Commissary came; he came next morning with Mr. Campbell, and the door was opened. The prisoners, Quanto and Clerensac, were marched away with the blacks - some of the blacks were left, as they were ill. I never saw the prisoners at my mistress's house before. Polydore, who is my husband, came to see me while the blacks were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoners came at the time of the hurricane - A. Yes, the hurricane began on the last Saturday in February, on which day the prisoners came - it lasted two days. My husband is his mother's property - he lived about five leagues from the Hermitage; he came on the Monday, and saw the blacks - he did not ask me about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Cavilla - A. He died in prison in the Isle of France.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your husband been made free in consequence of the information he gave - A. Yes.</p>

            . In February last I lived with my mother in the Isle of France, Victorine is my wife; I went to Madam Lebrun's, to see her, on Saturday - the prisoners were there. I walked about the yard, and saw the storehouse full of blacks. Cavilla asked me what I wanted with the blacks. I remained there till the next day, and then went and gave information to the captain of one of his Majesty's ships. The Governor sent me with Captain Campbell and some soldiers, to Madam Lebrun's house, we got there between ten and eleven o'clock at night. The soldiers surrounded the place where the blacks were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to any of the blacks - A. It was impossible, they could not hear me. I know they were Mosambique blacks.</p>

             were part of the detachment - Pollydore went with us as a guide, by the Governor's order. We arrived about eleven o'clock at night. He pointed out a wooden building, and two small huts about fifteen paces from the building. I divided my detachment into two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170025"></xptr>parties, and surrounded the wooden building with one, and the huts with the other. I had a lanthorn with me - I went into the huts, and found both of them filled with blacks; there were seventy-two men and boys, and seven women and girls - the greatest part of them were naked. Besides these, there was one dead, another dying, two were covered with the small-pox, and nine were so very weak that I could not remove them - they could neither stand nor move. The greatest part of them were covered with the itch. They appeared quite astonished when the soldiers surrounded the huts; they came up to us, and examined our clothes and arms - they appeared quite savage - they were Mosambique blacks. I spoke to them in the Creole French, which is the language we talk to the blacks in the Mauritius, they did not understand us, nor could I understand them. I am positive they were newly imported. I secured the huts for the night, and then went to the building, knocked at the door, and requested admission - a woman's voice answered, that she was alone, with her two daughters, and would not open the door at that time of night. I desired the soldiers not to allow a single person to escape from the house. I then went about the plantation, and found a hut some distance from the principal building, with eight or nine blacks in it - I spoke to them in French, they answered. They must have been sometime in the island, or they could not have understood the language. I returned to my detachment, and remained there till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any boilers near the huts - A. I saw three large iron boilers before the doors of the huts, which are generally used to boil victuals for a number of blacks - one of them had something like a decoction, which they generally give the blacks for the itch. Next morning, about eleven o'clock, Mr. Casso, the Magistrate, came in a palanquin. As soon as they heard the noise which the bearers of the palanquin make, they opened the windows and threw the doors open, which Mr. Casso and myself entered, and found the three prisoners, Cavilla and Quanto, Madam Lebrun, her two daughters, and Victorine. I shewed my orders to Mr. Casso, and told him I was to take the persons prisoners to Redwhee; he requested I would leave M. Cavilla behind with Madam Lebrun - I consented, as he said he would be responsible. I then took the prisoners, seventy-two of the blacks, and Quanto, to Redwhee. I left twenty-one negroes behind, as they were not able to march. Madam Lebrun's house is twenty-two miles from Suriac, and is in a large forest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the island governed according to the terms of the capitulation - A. I should think so. I had not been a fortnight on the island. Madagascar is five or six days' voyage from the island. The slaves on the island are constantly in the habit of seeing soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week did you go to Madam Lebrun's - A. On Tuesday - the hurricane had subsided on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a road from Suriac to Madam Lebrun's - A. Yes. There could be no difficulty in getting there in twelve hours.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the prisoners put on board to be brought there - A. On the 24th of April; we arrived on the 14th of January.</p>

               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. After you arrived, you went before a magistrate, and then before the Privy Council - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a private in the 22d Regiment of Foot. I went to Madam Lebrun's; the prisoners were there, and ninety-two blacks in the huts.</p>
               <p>PHILLIBERT and TRESGROSSE jointly put in an exceeding long written Defence, in which they stated that the ship was laden with a cargo of forty-eight oxen, which they lost in consequence of the severe weather, and the vessel was run ashore; the sailors came on board, and they delivered their papers, and advised them to sure themselves, as the vessel was sinking. They came ashore and lost their way, but meeting Clerensac, he took them to Lebrun's as they were fatigued; they meant to continue their journey next day, but the roads were so very bad, in consequence of the hurricanes and rains; that the soldiers surrounded the house and secured them. (The defence then went on to complain of ill usage in the island, and denying all knowledge of the blacks.)</p>
               <p>CLERENSAC'S Defence. Two days after the hurricane, I met the two prisoners, who appeared fatigued; I took them to Lebrun's - we found Cavilla there. The house was surrounded by soldiers that night, and next morning we were taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>- QUANTO. I am a native of the Isle of France. I was at Madam Lebrun's house when the soldiers came - the prisoners came there that evening alone - they brought no negroes - I never was there before; I cannot tell whether they were there before or not.

About nine o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Wake came up to me, I gave her the key; she said, she had been in the parlour. Between nine and ten I went down; while I was at supper, she wished me to set her watch by mine; I looked at the chimney-piece, and missed the watch; I went into the office, but all the men were gone but one. I printed a hand-bill, describing the watch, and a pawnbroker brought my watch; this was Tuesday; on that evening I wanted to go out, and then I missed the great-coat; I sent two of my men to see if they could not find the prisoner, and I heard they had all got together to a public-house; I got a constable, and took the prisoner to the watch-house; I asked him where he had pawned the coat; be said, in Newgate-street; he pulled out the duplicates of the watch and coat, and gave them to the officer. I made him no threat or promise whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged in the recruiting service at Woolwich. On 27th August I saw the prisoner at the New Gun, Woolwich—he asked me if I would enlist him for the 18th Royal Irish—I took him to the sergeant-major to know whether he would accept him—he did so, and the prisoner was measured and found to be admissable—I said, "Are you free and willing to join Her Majesty's service, and have you ever been in the army, navy, or marines, before?"—he said, "No;" that was in the presence of the sergeant, when I was giving the prisoner the shilling—he answered the questions both before and after he had the shilling—I cautioned him, there being so many persons going about the country taking money under false pretences—twenty-four hours afterwards, I took him away to be examined by the doctor, who examined him in my presence, and the letter "D" was marked on his left side; the doctor then told him to be off about his business, as he had been in some regiment before, and could not be accepted—I afterwards saw him outside the Hospital, and said, "What regi<lb></lb>ment did you belong to?" he said, "The 88th Connaught Rangers, and am free."</p>

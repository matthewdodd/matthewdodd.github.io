On the 7th of March, the box was opened; I examined the box to see what money was in it, we enquired for an acknowledgement of one hundred pounds which was lodged in the hands of Messrs. Calvert's the brewers; I enquired of the prisoner for that money, he said it was in the box, but it could not be found, in looking over the papers in the box, we there saw an acknowledgement purporting to be a paper of Messrs. Calverts, for sixty four pounds, that had been put in their hands about four weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether that is the paper that was found in the box - A. Most undoubtedly, I am sure it is; I was ordered to make enquiry at Calvert's, I went there and found our money was not in their hands; this money had been in the Bank of England, and sold out by the prisoner's order, and instead of his placing the money in Calvert's hands, he has kept it himself.</p>

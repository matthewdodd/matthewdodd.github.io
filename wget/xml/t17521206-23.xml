            . I let the prisoner a lodging on her own account; she was in it about two months; she left the lodging on the 31st of September, locked the door, and took the key with her. After she was gone three or four days, I had the door broke open and found the things gone. She left a man in the room, who went away after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see h er again?</p>
               <p>M. Alexander. I think it was on the 22d of September, I found her in bed in Hog-Lane; I took her before the justice, then she told where the things were, and went with me to Mr. Herring, a pawnbroker, and asked for them, where I found one sheet and the rug.</p>
               <p>Marphet Allen. I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, and was by when the prisoner was taken; she was asked where the goods were; she said she knew but of one sheet, and went with us to Mr. Herring, where we found one sheet and the rug.</p>

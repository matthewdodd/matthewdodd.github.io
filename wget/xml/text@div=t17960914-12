               <p>Mr. Knapp. Gentlemen of the Jury. The charge against the prisoner at the bar is a charge that you must have recollected in your experience in this Court upon Juries before, is a charge that affects his life, and if my instructions fail me not, you will find it is one of those cases of great importance indeed to the public state of society, of great importance to the unfortunate object of it, and it is of equal importance to the prisoner himself. Perhaps you are acquainted with the law sufficiently to know that there is an Act of Parliament which was passed for the protection of young persons, which makes it a capital offence upon children of ten years old; but that is not the circumstance of your present consideration - the age of consent is extended, by that Act, no farther than the age of ten-this unfortunate object is eleven, one year beyond the age in the Act; therefore the question of consent will be material for you to consider in the present case under his Lordship's correction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the prosecutor of this indictment is of the tender age of eleven years; she is the daughter of a publican, a person of the name of Homewood, who keeps the Golden-harp public house, Lamb-street, Spitalfields; the girl was employed as a <rs id="t17960914-12-viclabel58" type="occupation">pot-girl</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960914-12-victim241 t17960914-12-viclabel58"></join>, under her father; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17960914-12-deflabel59" type="occupation">dyer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960914-12-defend239 t17960914-12-deflabel59"></join>, and had used the house of the prosecutor; beer was sent to him, and one of the times that beer was sent to him, the present prosecutrix took the beer as usual to this man, the prisoner at the bar; after she had brought the beer to him, he desired her to put the pot down, and immediately, I understand, upon the 26th of May, pulled her back, shut the door, and laid her down, I think, upon a form with four legs to it; he immediately then put his hand to her mouth, to prevent her making any noise; she did call out without success; he again put his hand to her mouth, to prevent her repeating that noise; he immediately threw her down upon that form, two feet from the ground, pulled up her petticoats, she struggled with him, and from his superior strength she could not get away from him, and then, Gentlemen, what followed, I will not state from the regard I have to decency, and that I would not anticipate what a witness of this sort will prove more satisfactorily; but that after having so laid her down, the fact attributed to the prisoner was committed, and committed in such a sort of a way, if you believe the evidence, as no question of law can be raised upon it, for the ingredients of the offence are every one to be found in this case, and therefore the case will depend upon the credit you shall think yourselves bound to give to the story of the prosecutrix. First of all observe, she is of the tender age of eleven; we shall be inclined, perhaps, to hope, that from those tender years, her heart had not received any taint or corruption; yet, we know, in this great metropolis, young as that person may be, it may pass into the heart of persons, so young, to forget the duty they owe to society, and sometimes to have a very wicked intent at so tender an age. Gentlemen, that is the fact you will have to try; I desire, on the part of the prosecution, that you will watch her narrowly, and if you find, from the manner in which she tells her story, that she deserves credit, the only next thing to consider, and what will be very material for you to consider, is, the length of time that elapsed, between the time she charges the fact, and the time she complained of the violence. Gentlemen, it is my duty to state to you the fact; I understand, that three days elapsed before she said any thing about it, and that then it came out in this way; she was desired again, by the direction of the prisoner, to carry beer to his lodgings, and she was desired by her mother; upon which, she said, she could not take it to his lodgings; the mother asked her why, she said, that man,

             has hurt me, I cannot go to him; an explanation took place; she says, the reason why she did not mention it before, is, that she was afraid of being beaten by her mother; you will hear that, and do as you think fit with it; there is a fact behind, that is of a very important nature indeed, and such a fact, that if it is true, the prisoner cannot have a ray of mercy. I shall prove to you, that that too common idea of persons, having a certain disorder upon them, which they foolishly think they can get rid of, by having connection with a young person, or a person that never had connection with man before, they think, by that connection, they can cure themselves; that is the fact, that I understand; I shall prove to you, I shall prove it by his own acknowledgment; I shall prove, that at this time, when he had such connection with the prosecutrix, he was disordered, the effects of that disorder are upon the unfortunate girl, the prosecutrix, at this moment. These are all the circumstances I have to lay before you, you are to judge between your country and the prisoner; if you find that this comes out agreeable to the facts I have stated, I am afraid you will feel it your duty to pronounce the prisoner guilty, and be obliged to feel it to be an offence, for which he must answer with his life; if she should saulter in any part of it, if you shall find that she does not tell her story in such a way as you think deserves credit, you will acquit him, and by so doing, you will do your duty. Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses, and when I have so done, I am sure you will give that verdict that will satisfy your own consciences and your country.</p>

               <p>Q. By whose orders? - A. My father told me to carry it there, up two pair of stairs; there is a large area; they don't do any thing there, unless they dry the blankets out in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there? - A. Yes; and he told me to set down the beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your father tell you to deliver it to the prisoner, or any body else? - A. He told me to draw a pot of beer, and carry it to Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you carried it, what did you say to him? - A. I could not find him out for some time; I met a gentleman, one Mr. Emery, up one pair of stairs, coming down, and I asked him, and he told me he was up two pair of stairs, and I went up there, and found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when Emery was coming down stairs? - A. I was going up stairs; I said to Mr. Emery, can you tell me whereabouts Mr. Scott is, and he said, he believed he was up stairs, and I holloaed out, and he said, here I am, give me the beer here, or bring it up, and I carried it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him first? - A. I saw him in the room up two pair of stairs, where I carried the beer to; he told me to set the beer down, and I did put it down; I was turning back to come down, and he would not let me; he pulled me back and fastened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you, or you to him? - A. No; he did not say any thing to me, or I to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you then? - A. There was a large bench, and he chucked me down upon the large bench; he laid hold of me, and I called out, and he would not let me -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What would not he let you do? - A. He put his hand before my mouth, and would not let me call out for any body to hear, and he laid down upon me, and opened his breeches, and put something into my body, and I holloaed out several times.</p>
               <p>Q. And what became of your petticoats? - A. After he laid me upon the bench, he pulled up my petticoats.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you holloa before he opened his breeches? - A. I did not know what he was going to do.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was it he first put his hand to your mouth? - A. Directly as he laid me down upon the bench.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were his breeches open at that time or not? - A. I cannot tell, he pulled up his apron.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you called out, before he pulled up your petticoats? - A. Yes; and no body at all was about the neighbourhood, when he had one hand upon my mouth, and the other hand down somewhere; then he put something into my body, and I holloaed out, and he would not let me; and then I tried to get away, and he would not let me; I then said, "I will tell my mother, I will tell my mother;" he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140063"></xptr>asked me, if I would have any money, and I said, no; I did not want any money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You tell us he put something into your body; what did he put into your body? was it any part of his own body? - You must overcome all shame, and tell us the truth? - A. Something that he pulled out of his breeches.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it a part of his own body? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How long did he stay there? - A. It looked to be a long time; I thought it was a quarter of an hour; but I don't think it was so long.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you feel any thing come from him? - A. O yes, a good deal; about the evening it came from me very fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you feel any thing come from his body into your's? - A. Not before I was going to bed; it was all over my shift.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You felt him in your body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you feel him far in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he stay there till you pushed him off, or did he stay there as long as he chose? - A. I tried to push him off, but I could not; he staid there as long as he chose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before he got up from you, did you feel that any thing came from him in your inside? - A. No; not just then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he had done this did you get away from him? - A. I went home directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between you after he had done this? - A. He did not say a word, not before I was coming down; he called me back, and asked me whether I would have any money; I said, no, I would have no money, but I would go home and tell my mother directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then? - A. He did not say any thing, but made strait into the room again.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you crying when you came away? - A. Yes; I went away crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home to your mother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother at home? - A. Yes; she licked me for stopping so long; I did not tell her just then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you crying at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she took notice of your crying? - A. No, I don't think she did; I went up stairs, and about and hour or two afterwards I saw my mother coming up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your mother then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your mother say to you? - A. She did not take any notice of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go up stairs? - A. Because my mother should not lick me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out with any beer to any body after that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out the next day with beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a great many people then? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. I cannot rightly say; it might be about four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you so long after to mention it to your mother? - A. Because I was so bad I could not walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you bad? - A. All my private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell your mother? - A. I was in the kitchen with my mother, and this man Scott was in the tap-room, having a pot of beer; and I said to my mother, I will carry Scott no more beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell your mother why you would carry Scott no more beer? - A. I told my mother it was all through Mr. Scott that I was in the situation that I was.</p>

               <p>Q. You were not frightened then three days after? - A. Yes.</p>

                  </persName>
             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the wife of Thomas Homewood, and the mother of the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she? - A. Eleven years old, the 14th of last May.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life was she in? - A. We kept her at home to carry out beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a disposition girl was she? - A. A very mild, meek girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a girl of good morals, or otherwise? - A. I never knew her any otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you heard any thing about this business from your daughter? - A. I perceived her to walk very bad on the Sunday after the Thursday when it was done; she walked so bad, she could scarce put one foot before the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Sunday the 29th? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days was that after the thing happened? - A. Three days.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of making that observation, did you say any thing to her about it? - A. Yes; I asked her what was the matter with her, and she said she was very bad; I then examined her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say at all what was the matter with her? - A. No; she said she was very bad; I examined her, and found her very much swelled in her private parts, and very dirty indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you apprehend all this filthiness to arise from? - A. I thought she had over strained herself from carrying out trays of beer; and I told her to go to rest, and I carried the beer out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the conversation that took place? - A. I asked if any body had meddled with her, and she seemed very low in spirits and poorly, and said, no; and I thought she had over-lifted herself; I carried out the beer myself; and, upon the Thursday following, the girl and I were in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140067"></xptr>kitchen, I was ironing, and Scott came into the tap-room, and she went to empty some water and saw him there, I believe, and she said, I will not carry Mr. Scott any more beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if she had seen him between the time of this taking place and seeing him in the tap-room? - A. I do not; she said she would not carry him any more beer; I asked her why, and she said Mr. Scott had made her in the condition she was in; I asked her many questions, whether he had meddled with her, and she answered every thing; I asked her, and she told me where it happened in one of the rooms, and told me all that she has been relating to you now; at the same time I did not know that it was venereal; it went on so; I did not see any more of Scott till Saturday; he came in to pay his score; says I, be gone, you old villain, if you let me see you any more I will cut you down, or knock you down, or something of that sort, I was in such a passion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he go away? - A. No; he still stood in the entry; my husband then came out of the parlour, but what he said I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was the prisoner taken up? - A. I went on Monday to his wife, and to the Justice's on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the fact was done? - A. A week and two or three days; I did not know then that it was the venereal disease till I went to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice was it? - A. In Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Williams, was not it? - A. I believe that is the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get a warrant at the Justice's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day of the month that was? - A. No; it was early in June.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend the prisoner? - A. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - A. I cannot tell; it might be three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect what month it was? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not sign your examinations at the Justice's till he was taken up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. Whether, in consequence of the situation you found your child in, you applied to a surgeon? - A. He is not a regular bred surgeon; his name was Tibbins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That man attended her a considerable time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you employ a regular gentleman of the profession, Mr. Munn? - A. I cannot tell; Mr. Munn is here.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did Tibbins attend your daughter? - A. I dare say three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I need hardly ask whether you happened ever to see the child in the state in which you found her now before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. This girl is of a very quiet, peaceable disposition? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not require much correction from you? - A. No; only when she stopped of an errand.</p>
               <p>Q. You seldom corrected her with great severity? - A. I am very passionate to be sure, and sometimes gave her a very heavy blow.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had told you you would not have beat her, I dare say? - A. I wish I had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You see what you have brought upon the child by your passion; I hope it will be a warning to you.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the father of the girl? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child ever tell you any thing about what had happened to her? - A. No; not till after my wife had found it out; I asked her some questions, and she told me the same she had told her mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to get a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner before this? - A. Yes; on the Thursday we found it out, the Thursday after it happened; I called him into a back room and said, you villain, what have you done to my child; he stood for some time; at last he said, I don't know what you mean; I said, you villain, you have ruined my child, and I will let you know to-morrow what you have done; he then turned out of the room and went away; whether he stopped in the tap-room any time at all I cannot say; I dot't believe he stopped long in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the tap-room before? - A. I believe he was in the tap-room when my wife called me; I saw no more of him, and I returned in the course of a minute.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you go to the Justice's? - A. On the 28th of June, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time was it after the conversation with the prisoner that you went to the Justice's? - A. That was on the Thursday; on the Sunday my wife went to his wife; and on the Wednesday following I went to the Justice, Mr. Colquhoun, at Worship-street; there I gave information, and he granted me a warrant; he ordered me to send my wife and child; an officer went after the prisoner, but did not apprehend him for three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the time you told him you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140068"></xptr>would let him know what he had done, did you see him again before you went to the Justice? - A. The next day after I saw him at the dye-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any days after that? - A. I saw him at the dye-house, and went home, and said, I saw the villain at the dye-house, and would have him taken up; my wife over-persuaded me not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for not taking him up? - A. My wife persuaded me; I thought it would make an alarm in the neighbourhood, and disgrace the child's character; I thought he would go off to Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him afterwards? - A. Because I found he did not go out of the way; and as my wife had made it known to Mrs. Green, I thought we could but be disgraced.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw him in the dye-house, had you any more conversation on the subject? - A. I did not go near him; the next day there was some beer ordered in the dye-house, and they asked me to drink; I said, I could not drink there, there was such a villain in the dye-house; I saw him after that; he said, you must bring some beer to the dye-house; I said, you old villain, how can you look me in the face; and he turned round and went away; he came about five or six o'clock to know what he owed me, but I did not take it; the dyers said he should not come into the house again, and they discharged him, and he went off; I did not see him again till I saw him in the watch-house on the Sunday night as he was taken on the Monday before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him in the watch-house? - A. The officers asked me if that was him; I said, yes; that was all the conversation that passed; the next time I saw him was before the Magistrates, then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you employed some medical gentlemen to your daughter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards you employed Mr. Munn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You saw him frequently after this was discovered? - A. On Friday and Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had gone out of the way, you would not have prosecuted him? - A. Yes; if he had gone out of the way, so that it was not to be known, I would have put up with the misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you said, the dye-house men said he should not be there any more? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a surgeon? - A. Yes, in Spitalfields; I was sent for by the father of the girl on the 14th of July; I was introduced by the mother to the girl, and found her very ill; I found that she had been irregularly attended, and therefore I examined her myself; I found the private parts much swelled, and covered with matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had much experience in venereal matters? - A. I have; upon opening the labia and the vagina, I found it proceeded therefrom, the hymen had evidently been ruptured, and the internal parts were in a general state of inflammation; I then examined her linen, from the appearance of which, I have no doubt, it was the disease, called the clap, or gonorrhea; I ordered some medicines, which abated the general inflammation, and then omitted them for some days; at length it returned with similar violence, and then I had no doubt but it was the gonorrhaea; I ordered the usual medicines till she was perfectly well of that complaint; her present complaint is a fever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You have skilfully performed the cure on this girl? - A. She is now well.</p>
               <p>Q. She had been unskilfully treated, and from that unskilful treatment, and the violence of the disease alone, might produce that inflammation you observed upon her? - A. Certainly it will.</p>
               <p>Q. The hymen was ruptured; if the hymen had been entered, would not some blood ensue? - A. Some of course, no doubt; but it might not be much.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. The unskilfulness of the treatment, unless she had the gonorrhaea before, would not have given her that disorder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether the venereal disease may not be communicated without hurting the hymen, or entering the body, so as to commit a rape? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say that you have had a great deal of experience in these venereal cases, can it be any relief to a person that has the gonorrhaea to be connected with a young child? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It would, I have been told, do more harm than good? - A. It would.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can it be any relief to any person that has the gonorrhaea to be connected with a young child? - A. Instead of being any service, it would do more harm, and give more pain to the person that does it, because it encreases the irritation.</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be too generally known, that it does harm, and not good.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether, from the appearance of the child, you could judge, at that distance of time, whether any violence had been offered to the child? - A. I could not judge from that, the same appearance might have been from the violence of the disease.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Those appearances might have been from a man having a gonorrhaea, and having con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140069"></xptr>nection with a child, without entering the body? - A. Certainly they might, by entering the labia: and I don't think it could be done without that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of the facts stated against me; I was not upon the premises at the time that the girl has sworn this affair against me.(The prisoner called three witnesses, who had known him twenty years, and one who had known him twelve years, who all deposed that he was a humane, prudent, discreet man, and a good husband.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor never charged me with it; he said, I had injured his daughter, but would not tell me how; he spread it among the men in the dye-house to hurt my character; I told him I would prosecute him for it, and went to my attorney, and he sent him a letter, and then he took me up.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Homewood.) Did he threaten to bring an action against you? - A. No, he never did; he sent a lawyer's letter to me, and my wife said, she would have me go to the attorney, for his wife or daughter had done it; and then I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after he left the dye-house? - A. Two or three days after; he was discharged on the Saturday, I received the lawyer's letter on the Monday, and went to the Justice's on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, if I would give him twenty guineas, he would not trouble me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Homewood.) Did he ever offer you twenty guineas to make it up? - A. Never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to let him off for any money? - A. Never in my life; I never saw him after the Saturday, till I saw him in the cage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You told me in your own house, if I would give you twenty guineas there should be no more of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that true? - A. It is not, upon my oath. He sent his sister to my house, who said something to my wife about bearing the expence.</p>

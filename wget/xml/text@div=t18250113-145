On the 27th of December I went out at nine o'clock in the morning, and locked my room, which is a back room, on the ground floor; I had shut the window quite down. I returned at half-past eleven, unlocked the door, and missed these, two gowns from my box. I hallooed out that I was robbed, and at that time the prisoner ran out with the property - she was brought back by Cowderoy. Any person in the yard could open my room window and get in.</p>

            . I lodge at Taylor's. I was in my own room, with the door open, and heard her call out that she was robbed. I saw the prisoner running from the house, about ten yards off, with a basket in her hand, containing these two gowns; I ran out, calling Stop thief! Cowderoy went and took her, and brought her back; he took the gowns out of the basket. She said she was sorry for what she had done.</p>

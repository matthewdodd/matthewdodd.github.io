On the morning of the 21st of March, the prisoner came to the shop, looked at some boots, and ordered a pair to be put by for her, leaving three-pence as a deposit, she was to pay 6s. 9d. for them, and gave me the name of Bridges, James-court; soon after she was gone I missed a pair of boots, and went to James-court but could not find her; on the Tuesday following I heard she lived at No. 12, in the court, I found her there, and asked her why she did not come for the boots? she said she had bought a pair cheaper at Westminster; I asked her to let me see them, she said they were on her feet. I knew them to be mine. I have no private marks on them.</p>

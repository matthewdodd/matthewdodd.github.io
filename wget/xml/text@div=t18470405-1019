                  </hi> I am a sailor, belonging to a vessel lying in the Thames—I met the prisoner on the 31st of March, and went with her to a court ad<lb></lb>joining Gravel-lane—I did not like the place, and was about to return out again as quick as possible, but found the door fastened—she seized me by the hair of my head, and twisted it most tremendously, she then laid hold of the poker and laid on me—the poker broke with the first blow, and she <hi rend="italic">laid on</hi> with the remainder—I tried to get away, but could not, the door being fastened—I did not halloo, I never made any noise, no more than trying to get away—my head bled a great deal—the policeman came to me—a woman heard the scuffling in the room, and said to the policeman,, "If you do not go in, there will be some mischief done"—he came in—I was taken to a surgeon—I had done nothing at all to the prisoner—I had had no connection with her—she was not very sober—I was sober—I had had three or four glasses of ale—I suppose she was angry at my not staying with her—she did not ask me to pay any money first—I gave her no money—almost the moment I got into the room I did not like it, and proceeded to go out again, but could not get out.</p>

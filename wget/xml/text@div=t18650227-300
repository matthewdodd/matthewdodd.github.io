                  </hi>. I am cashier in the service of Mr. Charles Noah Foster, a builder, at New-wharf, Whitefriars—previous to 31st January, the prisoner was a labourer in our employ—when a labourer is discharged, for payment, he has a ticket given to him by the time-keeper at the job that he leaves, specifying the time that he has worked—I pay that on presentment—the amount I pay is regulated by the number of hours written on the ticket—I believe the prisoner was discharged on Tuesday, 31st January—he brought me this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on that day (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Ray-street, January 31st 1865; Roach, 17 1/2 hours; labourer, at 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I was a time-keeper in the employment of Mr. Foster on 31st January—on that day, I gave the prisoner this ticket—it was then for seven hours and a half—I know this to be the ticket—since I gave it to him the figure 1 has been added—he had worked seven hours, and we allow half an hour to go for their money.</p>

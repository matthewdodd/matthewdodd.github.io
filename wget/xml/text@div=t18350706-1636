                  </hi>. I live at 29. Cockspur-street. The prisoner lived with my father; his name is John Lambe—we had missed several things—I got a search-warrant—my mother searched the prisoner's box when she was going away, but she had taken away a bundle, and we went to her apartments—I searched that bundle—that was at No. 3, Marketplace—the officer, the evening before, watched her home—she came to our house the morning following—I went with the officer, and found the bundle there—I found a brooch—this locket is mine—It was found in her box at our house—the shirt was found at the pawnbroker's; it is mine—I missed both these articles.</p>

The prisoner had been in my husband's employ, and her wages are 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but she had received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the gentleman has confused my son from the truth—I have not paid her wages, because it is not my place, it is my husband's—I was present on the morning she came to ask for her wages, which were not paid, as there was some explanation necessary respecting the things found—the wages was not her first question—she did not say she would not go without her wages—I was present when my son and daughter were, when she came in, and said something about her wages—I declined to pay her, as I considered it was my husband's place—on searching her clothes, I found a locket in her box—she called it here sad used it as hers—she said she thought it was a button—I saw my daughter find the duplicate in her basket—It was an open basket, a kind of market-basket in the kitchen—I had found the duplicate before the officer was sent for, on the morning she came, and we gave her into custody—I do not think she demanded her wages then, but I mentioned to the inspector, that I owed her wages, and would she have them then—he said "No, by no means, she will lose it in the company where she is going; but I begged him to take two sovereigns.</p>

I saw him conceal one piece of ribbon in his hand. I thought that was for no good purpose; presently after that I saw him put it into his right hand pocket. I let him go out of the shop. I then told the young man who was in the shop, that I had seen that man take a piece of ribbon; when the prisoner had got about three doors off, I followed him, and brought him back; he was never out of sight; then he took those two pieces of ribbon (producing them) out of his pocket himself. These are our property; there is my mark upon one, and my master's mark on the other; they are very particular patterns; we had them a great while in the shop. He confessed he had taken one, he did not confess as to the other. The constable at the watch-house found three pieces of black ribbon upon him; but I was not then present; that is marked 15, the number of yards there are left upon it, the other piece I can positively swear to being my master's property; and, besides, I saw him take it; that is eleven yards.</p>

I said I did not mind. I saw him go down Old-change and go into Leaf's, and he came out with the parcel, and gave me directions to take it. I was going to ask the constable the way, and he charged me with stealing it I was going along Barbican, and the policeman took ma I gave him a straightforward ac<lb></lb>count When at the station-house they opened and found it was collars, and they were going to send two men round the City. I said, "I will save you the trouble; they came from Leaf's, in Old-change." Going along, I handed the policeman a bit of paper. That paper was at the station-house, and when I was at Guildhall I wanted that piece of paper produced, bat it could not be brought up.</p>

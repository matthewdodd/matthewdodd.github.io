I am the wife of William Osmond, a cooper, and live at No. 29, Berwick-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster—we occupy the front-room, first-floor—Mr. Watts is the landlord, and lives there—there is one street-door, of which we all have a latch-key. On Monday morning, the 6th of December, just after ten o'clock, I went down into the kitchen to get some water—I left my door ajar—I was gone it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I cannot exactly say the time—when I returned I did not observe any thing particular—I went out again in about a quarter of an hour—I locked my door then—I returned in about twenty minutes, and then went to the drawer for some money—I had not seen that drawer since ten o'clock—there was a bag in it contain<lb></lb>ing 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—there was two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I cannot say exactly how many sovereigns—when I returned to my drawer it was all gone—I also missed two half-crowns, a ring, and three spoons—I have seen the prisoner Rice, I think, twice in the kitchen, washing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave them lock'd?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I did, and found them lock'd again when empty. The two prisoners lodg'd there, and the boxes stood at their room door. I search'd their room and found two caps there, and a border of a cap, one of them, in their foul cloaths bag, and the other in a box in their room. They are my property, and were lock'd in my box when I left my things there. Produc'd in court, and depos'd to.</p>

            . The prosecutrix was oblig'd to quit her house, and she brought two boxes full of her things to my house, about a week and two days before the prisoners came to lodge at my house. They were put on the landing-place at my chamber door; I saw them open, they were full of cloaths. She return'd in about a month or five weeks, and then all her cloaths were gone. I was in the prisoners room, when the cups were found, which the prosecutrix swore to. We found a key of the prisoners that would unlock the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. from Fra. Jepson. Have not you a key that will do the same?</p>

               <p>THOMAS LEWIS. I live at Old Ford. On the 27th of February, I was at a public-house, and left at 12 o'clock at night. I had only drank one glass of liquor there, but had had a pint of beer at another house before. I had been drinking in the afternoon, and was not quite sober. I have to cross the fields as the nearest way home from the public-house. I saw the prisoner near <placeName id="t18250407-42-crimeloc218">Bow-fair field gate</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250407-42-crimeloc218" type="placeName" value="Bow-fair field gate"></interp>

I had a bundle and umbrella with me; I knew him before; we joined in conversation, and walked along the road together, and in the course of our walk, words ensued about an old grievance between me and him last summer - he challenged me to fight, and said he would fight me on any man in the parish I said, I should decline it for that time - I did not wish to fight. I walked on some hundred yards, and just as I got to the end of the last field, he struck me a blow with his fist - we fought and had two rounds, nobody was with us. I took the first opportunity to get from him, and run away leaving my bundle on the grass; I had put it down to fight. I went to the public-house where I lodge, the landlady opened the door; I then missed my bundle, and went back to look for it by myself; I went as fast as I could, till I arrived at the spot where I put it down - it was not there; by the time I arrived there King came up, he lodged at the same house with me - I searched round the field, but could not find the bundle. King went to the prisoner's father and mother's house just by; we could gain no entrance at the gate for some time; his mother said he was not at home. King got on a bank, and looking into an adjoining garden, called out,</p>
               <p>"Here he is." I told him to get over into the garden, he did so - the prisoner arose and ran away. I said,</p>
               <p>"Follow him King," I was at some little distance, the prisoner was running away, and as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070024"></xptr>ran, he threw away part of the bundle; I did not see him throw it away, but I picked some things up which were thrown over the hedge. I said to King,</p>
               <p>"This is not all, there is a silk handkerchief missing," in which a shirt and stockings had been tied. I made the best of my way over the bank, and said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I want my handkerchief." King was then near to him; and I took hold of him, demanding the handkerchief; we were some time wrestling. I do not know that any blows passed; we both fell on the ground, and as soon as I arose again, I found myself stabbed on the left arm, and the left side of my back; there were two wounds. I said,</p>
               <p>"King, I must go home, I am stabbed in two places, I feel the blood running." King said,</p>
               <p>"Are you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." The prisoner came forward with his arm extended, and said to King,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, I will serve you the same." King had my umbrella in his hand, and parried off the blow with it; we both got safe over the bank, the prisoner still remained in the garden; we went home as fast as possible. I had a doctor that night, and have been laid up ever since; nobody else was present.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what public house had you been drinking? A. The Three Tuns at Bow - I live at a public house nearly a mile off; we fought on the grass; it was dirty weather - I fell in the fight and believe he fell also - I believe he is a gardener - we got to the last field before the fighting commenced - Q. What had you been talking about in the mean time? A. Saying I did not wish to fight, as I did not owe him any animosity from the former quarrel; I had not applied for King to accompany me from the public house; the landlady sent him after me - I had not spoken to him - the garden is about ten yards from the prisoner's father's house; the prisoner was near enough to hear me desire King to get over after him; I was standing in a place called Sounding-alley, between the father's house and garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner retreat as you advanced? A. He did not; when I got over the hedge, he stood still - I demanded my handkerchief - he ran away from King, who pursued him; I was on the other side of the edge at that time - I came up to him, and asked for my property - he was standing still then; having been stopped by King; I and the prisoner took hold of each other, and down we came, and he stabbed me; I felt the blood running down my arm, and down my small clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not talking to a woman when you first met the prisoner? A. No, I had been in company with my relations that afternoon.</p>

            . I lodge at the same house as the prosecutor. On the 12th of February, about 12 o'clock, he came to the door; I heard him say he had lost his bundle in the field - he went back again; the landlady desired me to follow him; I did not overtake him till I came to the field where it happened - he was looking about for the bundle; I helped him, but could not find it, nor see any body; we went to the prisoner's house, knocked at the garden gate, his mother opened the window. I asked if her son was there, he was denied. I got on the bank opposite the house; there is an alley between the house and bank; I saw the prisoner laying under the bank, with this bundle. Lewis was in the alley; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is;" the prisoner immediately got up and run away with the bundle; I followed him, and got off the bank over into the garden, where he was. I followed him and saw him throw the bundle away; Lewis was on the other side, and picked it up; he said he had not got all, and told me not to let him run away; he made several attempts to run away; I said, if he did; I would knock him down. Lewis then came over and demanded a silk handkerchief of him; I believe he denied having it - a scuffle ensued between them; I did not see any blows given; I did not join in the scuffle - they were both down, and got up; Lewis said, he must go home, for he was stabbed in two places, and felt the blood run down his arm and back; I said,</p>
               <p>"Are you;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" the prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, and d - n your eyes, I will serve you the same;" he was coming up to me, holding his arm up with a gardener's pruning knife in his hand; I parried the blow off with an umbrella: Lewis then made the best of his way to go home - I followed him; the prisoner followed us both with the knife in his hand; Lewis got over the bank into the alley - I was in the field then, and the prisoner was standing about two yards off with the knife in his hand; I got over the bank; Lewis and I went home. On getting home, when I saw what mischief was done, I went for the doctor; I went with the constable to the prisoner's house; we knocked at the gate, his mother opened the window the officer asked if her son was at home, and demanded admission, and after some time she said he was at home; she came down, opened the gate, and shewed us where he was in bed. The officer told him to get up, and put on the same clothes as he had on before; and when he had done so, he searched him, and among other things found a small knife with two blade; I said, that was not he, and he must have another knife somewhere; the officer pulled down the bed clothes, and between the bed and sacking found a large gardener's pruning knife, which I believe to be the same; there was some blood on it; it was a moonlight night; we lodge with Mrs. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. I never saw him before; I was not long after Lewis - I did not see him till he came to the field, where he had lost his bundle; when I knocked at the gate, I asked if the son was at home - the mother said he was not, and she had not seen him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor say what he would do if he could catch him? A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did neither of you say</p>
               <p>"D - n his eyes, if we catch him we will be the death of him?" A. No, I heard nothing of the kind: after he was gone back, the landlady told me he had been having a scuffle, and left his bundle behind - she desired me to go and look after it - he did not tell me he had been fighting, or say he would do any thing to the prisoner if he caught him - he has not since told me that he offered five sovereigns to fight him - I have heard him say he had two rounds with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. He endeavoured to get from you, instead of meeting you? A. He made several attempts to run away - the hedge prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you got over the hedge to go home, he was within two yards of you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of February, between two and three o'clock in the morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070025"></xptr>I went with King to apprehend the prisoner - we found him in bed and apparently asleep - I awoke him; he said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter now?" I said he was charged with cutting and stabbing T. Lewis, and desired him to get up and put on his clothes - he did so, and I found a small two-bladed knife in his pocket; King said, that was not the knife - I said</p>
               <p>"August, you have another knife, have not you?" he said</p>
               <p>"No, if I have it is down stairs;" I then searched the bed and found this knife concealed between the bed and sacking, and, on taking it out of the case, King exclaimed</p>
               <p>"That is the knife;" it was bloody on both sides of the blade; I then secured him. I produce the prosecutor's clothes - his shirt is bloody, the arm of the coat is more than half cut - there is a stab in the back of the coat, and near the waistband of his breeches is a holo corresponding with it; he had a great coat and an under one on - both are cut through, and through the small-clothes behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you perceive some dirt on the knife? A. No, only blood - I did not examine the prisoner's clothes - it was not a very dirty night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the knife appear to have scraped dirt of his clothes? A. No, there was no dirt on it at all - it is such a knife as gardeners use.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person had such a knife in his hand, and falling with another person, he might inflict such wounds? A. I should think it impossible - it would rip a coat with great case.</p>

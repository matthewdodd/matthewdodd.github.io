               <p>WILLIAM MORE. On the 28th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was coming down <placeName id="t18290611-249-crimeloc1309">St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>DANIEL RIERDON. I was coming from our office - I saw the prisoner and three others standing on the curb - the prosecutor came by, and one of them, not now in custody, took up his coat, took out his handkerchief, and gave it to Jones, who ran off, and I took him; Moran was with them, and was close to the prosecutor at the time he was taken - he ran away likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JONES. The boy threw down the handkerchief at my feet; I did not run. Witness. Yes he did, to the end of Monmouth-street.</p>

            . I saw Moran in company with Jones and three others - I did not see Moran do any thing, but he ran to try to take up the handkerchief; I took him and the handkerchief - the prosecutor had got some distance before we could overtake him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>MORAN'S Defence. I was coming from my master's and met this boy, who was a school-fellow - we saw three boys take the handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, and then the officer took hold of one person, and let him go, he then laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Jones received a good character.</p>

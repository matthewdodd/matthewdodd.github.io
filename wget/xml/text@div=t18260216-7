            . I am shepherd to Mr. Partridge, who lives at the adjoining farm to Mr. Gilson. A man, named Sharp, came to me to look for a sheep - I looked into my flock, but it was not there - I then went away. I did not see the skin found, but he came to me afterwards on a Sunday, to help him to get a down sheep-skin out of a pond; I looked at the head, which was on the skin, the tail and the entrails were wrapped up in it. I have not seen the skin since that Sunday, when Sharp's son came and took it away. I am not sure I should know it now. Sharp is since dead - I did not see the constable.</p>

            . I am constable of Little Stanmore. The prisoner lived by the poor-house; I went to search his house on a Sunday in November, and found nearly a whole sheep in a drawer where he kept his victuals; it was undressed; it appeared not to have been cut up by a butcher, as they would have cut it more handsome. I kept it till it was quite tainted; the skin was afterwards brought to my house by Sharp; Mr. Gilson was not there when it was brought, but he came there on Monday, and saw the same skin and meat that were brought to me; I saw them putting it together to compare it, but I did not take notice of it. I heard the prisoner was at Paddington and went there on a Saturday night, five or six weeks afterwards, to apprehend him; I told him what I took him for - he did not say a word - I know he has worked hard and maintained his family.</p>

             re-examined. I went to the constable's house on the 30th of November, as near as I can recollect; I saw some skin and some mutton there - I assisted in comparing them - they tallied together in my judgment - the joints were not cut off as a butcher would have cut them; the joints of the legs and shoulders fitted with the parts left in the skin, and there was part of the fleece left on the breast of the mutton which was found; I think it was the sheep belonging to that skin - the skin was marked I. A. - the same as the sheep which were left in my field - it is here now - I had not missed the sheep, but the shepherd told me of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many sheep did Mr. Allen send you? A. Forty-two; I saw them all right on Saturday the 26th of November, in the evening; the shepherd told me on the 27th, that one was lost; I saw the skin and meat at the constable's house on Wednesday, the 30th; I counted the sheep on Monday morning, the 28th, and there were but forty-one. Mr. Allen lives about forty-six miles from me - I had none from him this season before this flock. I do not know whether there are any flocks in the neighbourhood marked in the same way - it was a Down sheep - there are other South Down sheep in the neighbourhood, but not marked in the same way to my knowledge, Sharp was Mr. Allen's shepherd - I should think the sheep I saw had not been killed within the time I had heard it was missing - I have no doubt that it was one of the forty-two.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What was the state of the meat when you saw it? A. It looked manled about, and did not appear very fresh; I kept it till it became rancid and bad - I saw it on the Sunday but cannot say when it had been killed.</p>

            . I am a shepherd, and have been so many years - I live with Mr. Jones. I compared some mutton, and a skin, at Mr. Tomlins' house - the meat fitted the skin exactly - every joint as firm as possible - I did not notice whether any of the fleece was left on the meat - it was a South Down sheep - there were the two legs, two shoulders, two breasts, and a piece of the loin - nearly the whole sheep - the head was along with the skin - there was a mark but I did not notice it. (Looking at the skin). I am sure this is it - the leg is cut off at the arm instead of the fetlock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a most unfortunate man; I have four small children. About fifteen months ago I lost an affectionate wife; I was very bad, and have the misfortune of a heavy rupture; I was at work on the Saturday and came home in the evening, when my eldest child, not twelve years of age, said "Father, some man has been here with a bag of meat, and he said he should call and see you again to-morrow or the next day;" I said"Pooh! pooh! he will call for it again;" "No, (he said) you are to fill our bellies." I gave them a part of it, and put the rest in the drawer - the constable knows I worked hard.</p>

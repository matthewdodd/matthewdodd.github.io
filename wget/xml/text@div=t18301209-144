               <p>COURT. Q. What was the fence composed of? A. Brick-work, and a door-way, that door was found closed - the persons who entered the tool-house did not go that way, they went across a ploughed field and then into the garden.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see foot marks at the back of the premises? A. Yes, of two persons - there is a ploughed field and a grass field at the back, and then an entrance into the garden; the door of the tool-house is at the back of the premises, and the footsteps were traced down the garden - the tool-house door was drawn too, but not locked; I pushed that open, and saw the lock hanging to the inner door, and the onions were gone; it had been secure on the Sunday - the onions had not been cut off, but drawn from the ties; I got a search-warrant, and went to Scate's house about eleven o'clock; we found the onions behind the shutter, in a suck - this prisoner did not lodge at Scate's, but Wilson, who has escaped, did - the prisoner and Scate were both apprehended, but the bill was thrown out against Scate - these are the onions, and these are my ties - this is the sack the onions were in.</p>

             - we live at Bury-street, Edmonton, half a mile from the prosecutrix's; I know the prisoner; Wilson is my own brother. On Sunday morning, the 5th of December, about four o'clock, my brother came into my room, and lit a candle at the rush-light I had burning - I was awake, but did not speak to him; my husband was fast asleep - I then thought I heard two persons in the house - I came down and saw Perry and Wilson there; they had some onions - they were picking off the ties, and putting them into a sack, which was afterwards taken by the officer - I said to my brother, "For goodness sake, what have you been after?"- he told me to go to bed again; I think my brother said they went after the apples, but they were gone, and they had brought the onions.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 5th of December, I went out between three and four o'clock, and saw Perry and Wilson, whom I knew, on a bridge near my own house, going towards Scate's - Perry had a sack upon his shoulder, three-parts full; it was about the size of this sack.</p>

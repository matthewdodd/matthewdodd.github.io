On the 7th of Septem<lb></lb>ber, I met the prisoner in Fair-street, Paddington, with another man—I took the prisoner and searched him at the station-house, and found 23lbs. of lead under his clothes, attached to a belt that he wore inside—a nail was stuck in the lead, and by that he carried it—I asked him how he came by it, he said he took it from No. 6, Cambridge-square—I found he worked there—I compared this lead with what he had been working at the same day, and found it to correspond in every way—I have no doubt came from the lead there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I was carman to Messrs. Harris &amp; Son, soap manufacturers, of 5, Gloucester Street, Curtain Road, for six or seven years—the prisoner Yeatts was in the soap cutting-room—it was part of my duty to go out with the cart to deliver soap—the cart has two black horses, and Harris's name is on it—I took with me invoices and a list of the places I was to call at and the quantity I was to deliver—on a Tuesday I took a load of soap from Harris &amp; Son's—I was to deliver two tons and a half—it is usual to deliver an extra quantity, 3 lbs. to every 5 cwt—there were nine boxes and one orange case—I went with that load to Pears', at Isleworth, and left a portion of the soap there, with the invoice—I did not go in, and do not know whether it was weighed there—I delivered the nine boxes, and kept back the orange case, which contained 1 cwt., or 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 cwt.—that was after dinner—I had called at the Red Cow as I went down, but saw no one in particular—I called there again as I went back—I <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> into the yard aft usual, and went and had my tea, and saw the two ostlers, Smith and Frogley—(Yeatts was with me, he had joined me in Piccadilly in the morning, and went with me to Pears &amp; Ca)—I told Smith what I had got, and asked him whether he would buy it—Frogley was then outside—I believe Smith wanted to know how I got it, whether it was stolen—I believe I said no, it was some I had got returned—after a deal of talking, he said that he would buy it of me—it was some time before we could agree about the price; he did not know and I did not know, and last of all we agreed for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar, and I took it out of the van and took it into a shed on the right side of the yard—Smith was present and I believe Frogley, too—I cannot say how many bars there were, but there were from thirty to thirty-eight to a cwt—Smith paid me the money—Yeatts was then inside the public-house—I delivered all I had kept back from Pears &amp; Co.'s, and then went home—on the next Tuesday, 2nd September, I had another load of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 tons to deliver at Pears &amp; Co. 's,—there were nine cases and two orange cases—I kept back half or three-quarters of a that of that, stopped At the Red Cow both ways, and saw Smith and Frogley—I told them I had got some more soap, and they said that they did not know what to do with it, but just before I came away they said that they would at the same price—both others took it out of the cart, and I believe Smith paid the money that day, but I won't swear it—the soap was put into the same shed—both these deliveries were primrose soap—on 16th September had 3 cwt. of skin soap to deliver at Golden Square—I don't know whether I had the ordinary excess—I kept back four bars of red soap, took it to the Red Cow at Hammersmith, and sold it to Smith—he gave me the</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father as soap manufacturers, at 5, Gloucester Street, Curtain Road—Yeatts has been in our service three years, and as weigher about twelve months—Spalding was our carman—we received information, and took certain precautions—it was Yeatts's duty to weigh the soap which was sent out, and to see it delivered into the van for the carman to take out—he weighed from this book (produced), and the next morning, when the van was loaded, he ought to check the lot with Burgess, the foreman—the carman also had a list handed to him of the customers he was to go to—Yeatts was responsible for the correctness of the weights—on 26th August Burgess made a communication to me in reference to Yeatts's absence from work; Yeatts should have weighed the day before for Spalding to deliver on the 26th—there should have been an addition of, 30 lbs. to the two tons and a half; it is our custom to allow that when a large order is given—we called in the assistance of detective officers, and on September 2nd a second parcel of soap was sent to Messrs. Pears—another communication was made to me about that lot, and on 18th September, in consequence of something the police told me, I called Yeatts into the counting-house, and had a conversation with him—he made a communication to me—Spalding had been called in first, and he also made a communication—in consequence of what they said they were given in custody, and I went with a detective to the Red Cow, Hammersmith, and saw Smith and Frogley down the yard, both standing together—Alday told them they were both charged with receiving soap from a carman, who was in custody, and that he should take them in custody on that charge—they said that they knew nothing about it, and offered to allow the police to search their premises—one of them produced the key of the coach-house, on the right side of the door, and said that that was in their occupation, and that the rest and the stable was in the occupation of Lucas Brothers—the detective told them who I was—Alday said that he had seen the van and a pair of black horses drive into the yard—the police searched the coach-house and one side of the yard, and found nothing—they did not</p>

               <p>interfere with the other side of the yard at that time—Frogley and Smith were then taken in custody—we afterwards went to Smith's house at Hammersmith; his wife is a laundress, and I noticed that the place was used as a laundry, there was a tub there with some clothes in it—a portion of a bar of soap was discovered before I was admitted to the house; we make similar soap to that, but I do not think we had supplied any of it to Messrs. Pears—it was not the kind of soap used for washing clothes—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of it—it is not the kind of soap I should expect to find in the house of people in that class of life; it is the best curd, which is expensive—we should expect to find mottled soap in a laundress's possession, in fact there was a small piece, wet, lying by the tub, which Mrs. Smith had been using—on leaving there we went to Frogley's mother's house—she keeps a laundry, and a number of women were there—I did not go inside the house, only inside the door—I went from there to Hayden's shop; it is a small chandler's or general shop, at the bottom of the garden of the Red Cow—some bars of the best yellow soap were in the window; the best primrose soap, very fine, and the same kind which we had been supplying to Messrs. Pears &amp; Co. just before, and the same character and class of soap which we were searching for—I went into the shop and asked Hayden to let me look at the soap; he took a bar from the window, looked at it, showed it to me, and asked me if it was good soap—I said "Very good"—presently we got it all out of the window, and he said "Is that your soapf—I said "It looks very much like it," and asked him if that was all he had got—he said "Yes"—the detective pointed to a bar on a shelf behind Hayden, and asked him to let him look at that; he did so, and it had our stamp on it—he was asked if he had any invoice—he said "No"—I said "Where did you purchase it?"—he said "Of a man at the Red Oow," and that he gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar for it two or three days previously—he was asked again if he had any more—he said "No"—I asked him if he had any mottled soap—he said "No"—I said "It is a very strange thing for you, in the very midst of London, to have no mottled soap, only primrose soap"—he said that he had out the last mottled soap that day—the detectives searched the place, and found four bars of red soap, which we call skin soap, under the counter—twenty-two bars of yellow were found in the window; the whole of that found in the window was unstamped; there was no red soap in the window—the skin soap was not stamped, but I identified that because very few makers make it—I identify a portion of a boil of soap which we only cut up on 15th September, the Monday previous, and sent out on the 16th—the soap found under the counter he said he bought of an elderly man two or three days previously; he did not say where—the primrose soap weighs about 3 lbs. per bar, and is worth a fraction under 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar wholesale, and the skin soap 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bar.</p>

Harris made to me, I watched the cart driven by spalding, as he was leaving the premises—he went to the Red Cow, Hammersmith; I saw Frogley and Smith outside there—I followed the van to Isleworth, and saw it go into the yard—I afterwards saw Spalding come out, and on his way back he called at Mr. Ray's, at Brentford—he then went to the Red Cow again, drove into the yard and stopped on the left hand side—it is the next building to the Red Cow, there is stabling there, and a trough outside for horses—he stopped there some time—the other prisoners were outside—I saw spalding come out at 5.45—he spoke to Smith and Frogley outside, and Frogley went into the house and came out directly—Spalding soon afterwards drove away with the van, which had been in the yard, I should think, two hours—a man named Payne was with me, not a constable—I did not see Yeatts that day—I followed the van home—the yard gates were open—on the 16th I went to the Red Cow, and saw Frogley standing outside—Payne ran across to me, I sent him back—I walked some little distance up the road—Payne came up to me and was about to communicate with me when Frogley came up; Payne went across the road and bought a penny loaf—I told Payne to go back; Forgley then came and looked me in the face and went back to where Payne was, and Payne came back and made a communication to me—I also saw Smith outside the house—I went round the back way and met Detective West, and saw Frogely drove away—I said that we were two police officers, and I did not wish then to criminate themselves in any way—I then asked them if they had bought any soap of Mr. Harris's carman—they said "No"—I said "The carman and Henry Spalding are in custody, did not you purchase and receive some soap of them on the 2nd instant, from a van with two black horses, which backed up against the gates of the coach-house? "—they denied all knowledge of it and said "We have so many vans call here in the course of the day that we cannot remember"—Smith said to Frogley "<hi rend="italic">Jack, open the gates</hi>"—Frogley undid the door with a key, and we went in and searched the coach-house, but found nothing relating to the charge—I asked Smith if that was all the stable they had—he said "Yes, that one on the other side belongs to Mr. Lucas, the railway contractor"—I took them in custody, and afterwards went to Smith's house, his wife was ironing, and I saw some wash tubs in the rear of the house—Smith gave me the address at Hammersmith Station—I searched the house and found this piece of curd soap in a cupboard in the parlour—no washing was going on, but she takes in washing I believe, I saw an enormous lot of things hanging on a line—Frogley gave me his address at the station—I went</p>

               <p>there, there was a deal of laundry going on, five women were washing—I searched and found about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2lb. of mottled soap—Hay den's shop is just at the rear of the Red Cow, in Church Lane—I went there and saw a quantity of soap in the window—I asked for it, twenty bars were taken from the window and the prosecutor identified it—I asked Hayden how he accounted for them—he hesitated some time and then said that he purchased it of the ostlers at the Rod Cow, a fortnight or three weeks ago, and the bar with the prosecutor's name on it at the same time—he said that he offered 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar, then 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if he had more—he said "No"—I took him in custody and searched his place, but found nothing—after he had for the second time denied having any more soap in the house, I saw West find four bars more under the counter—on the way from Hammersmith Station to Old Street Station he Said "Did not I say I gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bar for the soap?"—I said "You, did"—he said "I gave 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4 for it"—I asked him if he had any receipts or invoices—he said "No."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HOLLINGS</hi>. I was employed on five occasions to follow Spalding—he stopped at one place and purchased some whip-cord, but I saw no soap then—Payne is a printer, and I have known him about eight years, he has been useful to me in this case, and on one other occasion—I have never used him as a witness before—I did not know that Smith and Frogley were employed at the Red Cow till after they were in custody—Frogley gave me his mother's address, or I should not have gone there.</p>

                  </hi>. On 16th September I went with Alday to the Red Cow—the van was in the yard and I saw-Spalding, Smith, and Frogley together—I went with Alday to Hayden's house, and found four bars of glycerine soap, unstamped, under the—. counter—all the soap found was common primrose or skin-soap, except two bars, which Mr. Harris did not identify—when Smith and Frogiey were brought into the charge-room I said to Hayden "Do you know either of these men?—he said "Yes, those are the men that I spoke of"—they could hear that, but said nothing—when I searched Frogley at Old Street Station, Spalding, who had been searched, said "Don't shake, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—Frogley said "It is enough to make me shake, but I don't think it will amount to much."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 48, Margaret Street, Clerkenwell—on 2nd September I was with Alday, and saw Harris's van driven by Spalding; it stopped at the Red Cow, and on the return journey it stopped there again, and went into the yard—Smith and Frogley were standing outside the door—Spalding went into the tap-room, and Frogley went and spoke to him, and then he went and drew his van on the right-hand side, with the back to the coach-house door—Smith and Frogley were there, and Frogley opened the coach-house door with a padlock—the tail-board was put down—I did not see anything taken out of the van, but I saw Spalding go in and out of the coach-house—the tail-board was then put up, and Frogley went into the public-house and got change for a sovereign, and gave some money to Spalding—they were then half-way up the yard—Spalding then got up into the van and drove away—on 16th September I was at the Red Cow, and saw Spalding there with the van, he drove into the yard and Smith and Frogley spoke to him—I saw Frogley receive a basket of apples from a man which he held behind the door, and he said to</p>

I was not drunk—it is seven weeks since I was engaged in printing, that was by Mr. Dunlop, of Knight Rider Street—I have been doing nothing since that, but I have been every day to see if there was any work—I have worked for Mr. Dunlop twelve months when there was anything for me to do—I have known Alday eight or nine years—he saw that I had got a bad arm, and asked me to go with him to the Red Cow—I have also been to other jobs with him—he put me to watch this van—I have been examined here before, in a case of robbery; Alday had nothing to do with that, I was with Sergeant Smith—I hope Alday will pay me, for I have lost enough time over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, the prisoner was in my service. On 21st Feb., I watched him from the passage through a hole in the wains<lb></lb>cot—about ten minutes past five o'clock I saw him turn down the gas and go to the till, which was locked at four—he put his hand in the till, then in his pocket, pushed the till in, pressed on the counter, and walked away, he then came back, and pressed on the counter again—I called a policeman, then went inside, opened the till, and found a shilling short of the money that had been there at four—I had marked the shilling—I gave the prisoner into custody, and the shilling was found on him in my presence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 65). I was called, and asked the prisoner what money he had; after some hesitation he said, "A shilling"—I asked him where he got it—he said he found it in Cheapside that morning—I searched him, and found a shilling, a horse-shoe, and a knife on him—I took him to the station—I examined the till, and saw a number of marks, appa<lb></lb>rently made by the point of a knife—I tried the knife I found on him, and it would not open the till—I then saw a mark as if it had been made by the point of a horse-shoe—I applied the horse-shoe, and it lifted up the top of the till, and enabled you to draw out the till without unlocking it.</p>

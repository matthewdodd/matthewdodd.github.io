               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house. - A. Yes, she lived in another apartment. On the 14th of March about two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out to work I saw the shirt before I went out in the bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house do you occupy. - A. Two rooms on the ground floor. The farthings were on the dresser in a pot; there was forty three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your wife at home when you went out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock your door. - A. I do not think that I did. I returned about five, and I missed the key from the door; I went across my room, I saw my chest lid was open; my wife came home, she missed a sheet from the chest; I missed the shirt from the bed-room. I examined the pot, I found all the farthings were gone. On Tuesday morning after the sheet and shirt were found at the pawnbroker's, I charged the prisoner with it; I took her to the pawnbroker's he said she was the person that pledged them.</p>
               <p>MRS. ABBOT. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180704080027"></xptr> Q. Were you at home on Saturday the 14th of March, when these things were lost. - A. I was not; when I came home I looked in the chest, and there was a sheet taken out of it; the chest was not locked, I had put the sheet in the chest on the Sunday before. My husband counted the farthings the night before, there were forty three; when I came home there were none left in the pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mrs. Abbot told me she had lost these things, I said, do not be too sure; Mrs Abbot said she had lost her husband's silk handkerchief and he knows no other to this day; she told me she had got the money for it.</p>

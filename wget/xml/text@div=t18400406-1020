On Sunday morning, the 15th of March, about eight o'clock, I saw Jackson, with a bundle on his shoulder, nearly three miles from Mr. Bodkin's house—I asked what he had got—he said, nothing belonging to me; he had been to Highgate, and had got some candles, and was going to take them to his brother, who was at work on the Greenwich rail-way—I took him to the station-house, opened the bundle, and the first thing he pulled out was a bottle, then some candles, and two more bottles, and out of his pocket a pair of shoes and three small japanned waiters—I asked him where he got them—he said from his brother-in-law, who was living in a gentleman's house as footman—I asked him to show me the place—I went with him to Mr. Bodkin's—I went to ring the bell—Auger came to the door—I asked if he had given that man any thing—he said, "Yes"—I said I wanted to see his master or mistress—he offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. not to see them, then offered me one sovereign, then two sovereigns, and then all he had got—I pushed him on one side, and said I would go to the kitchen—I went—he got into the stable-yard, and then an officer brought him back—he had got the coachman's hat, and was going off—he asked me to take out the bottles, and put in three jars, but I would not—I then saw the lady of the house, who told me to take them into custody—here is one bottle of port, and two of sherry.</p>

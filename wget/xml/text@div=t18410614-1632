                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Hughes, of Queen-street, Ratcliff, a mathematical instrument maker—the prisoner was in our service. On the evening of the 19th of May, I observed her take out a bundle—I suspected she had something not her own, and said I would notice on her going out the next day—on the following evening I sent her out, and while she was gone, I examined her bundle, and brought it into the kitchen—I sent for my husband, who told me to replace it where I took it from, which I did—when the prisoner came back, I told her she might go home, and on her coming through the kitchen with her bundle, I said, "Margaret, what have you got there?"—she said, "My gown and apron"—I said I must see—I took it from her, and found this telescope in the bundle.</p>

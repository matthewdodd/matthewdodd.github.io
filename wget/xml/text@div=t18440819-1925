                  </hi>. I now live in Crispin-street, Spitalfields, with my father. On the 16th of July, I lived with Mr. Cummins, boot-closer, Dean-street, Soho, on trial—I have not remained with him—one Tuesday he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay to a loan society in Great Portland-street—I carried it in my hand—I went through Oxford-market—the prisoner came up to me in Great Titchfield-street, and said, "Halloo, young Cummins"—I said my name was not Cummins; my master's name was Cummins—she said, "Oh yes, I know you, where are you going?"—I was going to answer, and she said, "Oh, I know where you are going"—she said, "I have got four sorts of coloured beads for your mistress; I wish I could find a piece of paper to wrap them in "—she never offered to pull out the beads, but began talking, and said, "Let me wrap your money up; give me your money; I will wrap it up in this paper"—she took up my hand, opened my finger, and I then opened my hand; she took the money, wrapped it in paper, and asked if I had got any more money—I said yes, two farthings, one a good one, and one bad, which I had picked up; the other mistress gave me to make haste—she said, "Let me wrap those up"—she picked up another piece of paper, and wrapped them both in two single parcels—she kept talking, and said, "Where shall I put it?"—I kept saying, "Put it in my pocket"—she said, "No, I will put it in the corner of your handkerchief"—she took my handkerchief and put it down my bosom, then snatched it out quite quick, and said, "Come with me to No. 21, where I am going, I will give you the beads"—I went about half way, then she made a sudden stop, and said, "Stop, you had better run and pay your loan money"—I thought she had put it in my bosom, and she said, "When you come back, come to No. 21, and wait for me—stop, and see that turning that I go down;" and when she got out of my sight, I put my hand in my bosom for the money, and could only find two farthings—she</p>

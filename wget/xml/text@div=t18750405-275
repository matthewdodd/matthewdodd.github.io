                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Stephens, but I lived with the prisoner two years before this took place—on 23rd October, at 10 p.m. I was coming from King's Cross, along St. Pancras Road, past the Great Northern Hotel—I did not meet any one there—I turned to the right and went back as far as the gates leading to the Great Northern line, and the prisoner came across the road to me and said "What! are you waiting for him?" or "Who are you waiting for?"—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "You know what I mean, I have no doubt it is some one you have been out with many times while you lived with me"—I said "I don't know what you mean"—he said "Did you not see me standing against the policeman's box?"—I said "No;"—he said that he was there smoking his pipe when I passed—he then said that he had not had above two or three night's lodging all the week—I said that instead of paying by the night he should pay by the week—he said what was he to do for food—I told him he must be like me, he must do the best he could as he had thrown himself out of food, work, and good lodgings—I then felt him strike me on my left breast, and saw a knife in his hand—I dropped some parcels which were in my hands—I stooped to pick them up, and then he stabbed me very hard on the back of my neck—I felt blood running down my back and screamed "Murder!"—he turned and looked at me and went away, and a lamp-lighter came to me, who fetched a Great Northern constable; I then became insensible, and know no more.</p>

I am a lamp lighter, of 8, Pultney Street, Barnsbury Road—on 23rd October, about 10 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Murder!" near the Great Northern Railway—I turned round, and the prosecutrix came to me and said "I am stabbed"—I said "Who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it?"—she said "George</p>

I am a porter, of 32, Railway Terrace, York Road—I have known the prisoner for many years—on the afternoon of 23d October, I was standing against the Victoria public-house eating an apple, and he came up and said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, will you lend me your knife?"—I said "What do you want with it said "To cut my corns"—I said "It is no use for that job"—he took it out of my hand and said "I will sharpen, it, and I will give it you back in the morning;" it was a common pocket knife with one. blade; it was an ordinary blade, about 2 1/2 or 3 inches long—I have never seen it since.</p>

I am a surgeon of the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road—on 23rd October, about 11 p.m., the prosecutrix was brought there in a very excited condition and quite sensible—I mean that she was excited by the shock—she was bleeding a little—she had an incised wound about the breadth of my finger over her breast, going down to the cartilage of the rib, which was hard enough to stop it—it was about an inch deep, because it was partly through the breast—she had another wound at the back of her neck, about two inches deep, slanting inwards to the ribs—the wounds were caused by a knife—no large vessel was cut and there was no great loss of blood—any wounds on the chest are dangerous; it was close <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the heart, and we can never tell for a week or two how far the mischief may extend—there might have been pleurisy or the lung might have been wounded—she was in the hospital about a month, till No<lb></lb>vember 21st.</p>

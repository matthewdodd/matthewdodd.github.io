            . I am the daughter of the deceased Frederick Jacob Shubbert - I was not at home at the time the blow was given - I came home a few minutes after it was done - the prisoner was then standing in the Rents, using very violent expressions towards my father - she said she would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040038"></xptr>rest that night till she had his b - y life - I heard her say that as I was coming up the Rents to go home - I had left my father a little after six o'clock in perfect health - he had been to work that day at the docks - when I returned about half-past nine o'clock, he was in violent pain, and complained of being hit in his groin with a brick, which he gave me - he pointed to the lower part of his body as being in pain - there had been a quarrel that day, and the day before, between our people and the Brown's, but not between the prisoner and my father - he had never offended her - there had been a disturbance the day before between the families, and that afternoon also, about three or four o'clock, or it might be earlier - we were obliged to fetch a policeman to protect our lives - they came round the door with brink-bats and stones, and said they would kill us, and that very morning we were obliged to have a policeman to let me get out of the house - I never knew the prisoner till since Easter, and only knew her as a neighbour - I never quarrelled with her, only with her sister-in-law, who lived in the same house with her - that quarrel with her sister began on the Tuesday morning, and it lasted until the Wednesday night, when she threw the brick at my father - here is the brick (producing it) - my father gave it me - my father never ceased to complain of pain from the time of my coming home until he died - he went to bed that night, and never got up any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had not been living on very friendly terms? A. Until Tuesday morning we had - we had never quarrelled before, but on Tuesday morning a deadly quarrel began - the prisoner's sister-in-law began the quarrel - the prisoner had nothing to do with it then - she took part in it afterwards - the prisoner was the first to come out on the Wednesday morning - bricks were not thrown on both sides - I did not throw one - George and Charles Gowan did not throw bricks or tiles at the other party - they kept up the quarrel by coming to the door abusing us, putting their heads through the window and threatening our lives - no part of our family did any thing - I never spoke a word - in the morning my mother said,"Mrs. Brown, if my husband offended you last night, why not say so last night?" - she said, "I have come to abuse you now for it" - I never saw the prisoner's husband abused or ill-treated in my life - the deceased was a very stout man, but able to walk - he was not ruptured, as far as I know - he was a little troubled with gout.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before the Grand Jury? A. Yes; and gave this account - I am sure that is the woman I heard use the expression - when she threw the brick, she had on a green gown, which she always wore - I am certain she is the woman who my father told me threw the brick - I cannot say whether she was sober - I never saw her intoxicated.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend on the deceased - I cannot recollect the day, but I was informed he had received the accident the night before- I found him exceedingly ill - I found his disorder was in the lower part of the abdomen - I may say, over the whole abdomen - he appeared in very acute pain - I prescribed bleeding and what I thought proper - I first saw him about eleven o'clock in the morning - he died the day but one after that - there was never any appearance of amendment in him - I had no doubt whatever, when I first saw him, that he was labouring under some internal injury of the vital organs - violence might have produced such symptoms - after death I opened the abdomen, and discovered most extensive inflammation over the whole abdomen - the intestines were glued together in serveral parts, and an effusion in several parts of lymph in a small part of the contents of the bowels - I have no doubt his death was caused by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Might that piece of a brick, thrown by the hand of a woman, produce the appearance you found? A. I should think it might - the appearances corresponded with what might be produced by violence of that sort - I have no doubt the inflamation a was caused by internal violence alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The whole abdomen I think you say was affected? A. Yes; on my examination after death, it was all affected - but the worst part was the particular part about the centre of the intestines, towards the lower part, near the centre - the abdomen is not very large - I have not seen the same appearances produced by natural causes - I have seen appearances resembling them - inflammation may take place to a very considerable extent, if a person has a permanent obstruction of the bowels - in a rupture, where the gut is strangulated, we should have the same appearances as would arise from mechanical violence- old men are not particularly liable to such obstructions - we are all liable, but not old men in particular.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you heard the man was in perfect health at six o'clock, and was nearly bent double about half-past nine o'clock what should you think? A. I should conclude that arose from external violence, but I have been called to a case of persons complaining of violent pain, and found most excessive inflammation of the abdomen; but in those cases, there were other circumstances, such as a perforation in the intestines itself - ulceration might produce that, but the appearance on the opening would be different to this - I should have found a disease of the mucus membrane if it was caused internally.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know that he was at all a drinking man? A. No, never; I did not come out of my house during the whole quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. All you can say is, you heard stones and bricks passing from one house to the other? A. Yes; I could take an oath that the Gowans did not throw any of the bricks, because I was up at my garret window, two pair of stairs high, and saw the Gowans - I looked out several times during the quarrel - I cannot tell how often - I will swear it was twice, but it might be three times - I was in-doors for a long time together - I will swear the Gowans never threw a brick or tile - nothing further than using bad words.</p>

            . I am a gun-maker. I live in the Rents next door to where the prisoner lived - I knew the deceased by sight - I remember seeing him on Wednesday, the 9th of July, about six o'clock in the evening - I saw him about nine o'clock - he had a mug or jug in his hand, and was going out for some beer - he appeared as usual in very good health - I know the prisoner by sight - I saw her at six o'clock on the evening of the 9th of July, in the Rents, with her sister and brother-in-law, and her husband - when I first saw them, I heard a noise, and not being very well, I went to the staircase window - I saw her husband, her sister-in-law's husband, and two men stripped, as if to fight - there was a blow or two between the prisoner's brother-in-law and George Gowan, but not more - that might be about seven o'clock, or a little after - I saw the prisoner about half-past eight o'clock - she had nothing in her hand - I heard her say, "You German b - , I will serve you out"- I saw nothing in her hand that night, for I went in doors - I was examined before the Coroner about seven weeks ago - I am sure I did not see her with a brick, or part of one, in her hand that evening - I heard nothing more, and saw nothing more, than I have mentioned - I do not think she was sober - I really think they were all intoxicated - she, her sister-in-law, her brother, and brother-in-law, but I do not mean that the decased was so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were at the fight that you saw? A. It is impossible to tell - the court was full of people - I know there were four standing up to fight, but only two fought, there were so many round them I could not tell how many there were - I do not know how many of the Gowans were there - there was Gowan and his brother-in-law - only George Gowan and the prisoner's brother-in-law were engaged in the fight - George Gowan is Shubbert's son-in-law - her husband was present - he was on her brother-in-law's side - he was not engaged in the fight - I saw him strip, but there was no blow - I did not see her husband knocked down - I saw him shoved into the house with violence - there was a scuffle - I did not hear any body offer to fight the prisoner's husband - George Gowan was the party fighting with her brother-in-law - George Gowan said, "If you will listen to what I have to say, I will make it all quite" - he wanted to make peace - he was stripped to his shirt - he was not sparring - but her brother-in-law said, "No, you b - , I will fight it out," and he up with his fist, and struck him, and then they had a bit of a fight - there were no more of the Gowans there - her brother-in-law was stripped, and her husband, I believe, had his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up - I heard the prisoner say, "You German b - r, I will serve you out" - I did not hear her say, "I will have your life before the day is out."</p>

            . I did not see any thing done to my father-in-law myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you present at the fight? A. Yes, and took an active part in it - I saw the prisoner there - I did not put my hands upon her - I did not touch her in the course of the fight, I am certain - I will not say I did not put my hands upon her husband - I am not positive that I did - I will not swear I did not - I did not assault him - I did nothing at all to him that I know of- it was James Hicks who came up to me as I stood at my door in my shirt sleeves, as I usually do - he came up and challenged me to fight - I said, "It is a pity we should quarrel, we never had any words - let us make peace and quietness" - he said, "No; I will have it out," and struck me in the mouth - I put my hand up against him - the prisoner's husband was present at the time, and my brother-in-law - if the prisoner, or her husband, or her brother-in-law, were hurt in the fight, it was unknown to me - it must be very slightly - nobody but me was concerned in the fight - my wife's brother was present, but took no part in the fight - it was only a mere scuffle - I swear I did not challenge the prisoner's husband to fight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time in the evening was the scuffle between you and Hicks? A. It might be about seven o'clock, or a little after - the last time I saw my father-in-law was about half-past eight o'clock, before he was hurt - I did not see him again till he received the blow, which must have been about half-past nine o'clock - he was in perfect health about half-past eight o'clock - he had had some beer for his supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were two people quarrelling - I was standing with my hand to the wall, and he knocked a woman into the dust-hole - I said, "Do not ill-use the woman"- he immediately struck me a violent blow in the eye, and took and dragged me by the gown, and the hair of my head - I was a shame and scandal to be seen by and body - with that I went to my sister's for wearing apparel to put on - I went for my husband to come from work, and he wanted to go for a warrant to take them up - I said, "No, I will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040040"></xptr>it on myself" - when I came home the deceased stripped to fight, and was very much intoxicated indeed - I took my husband by the collar, and said, "Tom, come away, and we will go and see if we cannot get some redress" - we went to the office, and saw Mr. Prendergast, who told us to come next morning at eleven o'clock, but we did not - I was taken in charge the next day, and the magistrate said one party was as bad as the other, and discharged me - I went home to my husband, and then went to the Borough to my sister-in-law, who was taken very ill there, and could not go home - on the Monday my husband came and told me what had happened, and I went and delivered myself up to Miller, the officer of Lambeth-street - I am quite innocent of the charge - I never went home till five minutes to twelve o'clock - Gowan tore my clothes to pieces.</p>

             re-examined. I never laid my hands on her that day at all - on the Tuesday there was quarrelling and scuffling, and several of the party got my wife down - they were desperate, throwing brick-bats and stones - I got my knuckles sprained with a blow, and I did, (when I saw my wife ill-used, as they are a desperate set,) endeavour to get her out of the scuffle, and might have pushed the prisoner and struck her - I confine myself to the Wednesday - I did not strike her on Wednesday - I might have done it on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>MR. LIDDLE re-examined. I saw the deceased two or three times each day - he died at five o'clock in the morning - I saw him the evening before, about eight o'clock - I did not tell him he was in danger - I told his friends I had no expectation of his recovery - I cannot say whether he was aware of that himself.</p>
               <p>MARY GOWAN re-examined. My father-in-law appeared very sensible that he was dying - he said so a little before three o'clock in the morning - I sat up with him - he put out his hand to my mother, and said, "I shall never be able to earn another shilling for you, but Ann Brown is the cause of my death" - he had no hopes of recovery from the first - he said so - he died at a quarter before five - I did not tell him that the doctor had a bad opinion of him - his breath was very bad, and his feet were very cold, and he said he did not think he should recover - he said he expected he should die - about three o'clock he said, "That wicked woman, who I never offended in my life, who threw the brick at me, Ann Brown, she is the cause of my death" - those were the last words I heard him say.</p>

On 6th February I went to Eyre's residence, 49, Regency Square, Kennington Lane—I saw him and his sister together—I said, "Do you know Sydney Hawkins?" meaning Fry—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Has he given you anything to take care of, or have you removed anything from him?"—he said, "Yes, I assisted him with a box to the Railway Booking Office, Elephant and Castle, yesterday; I did not know where it was going to"—he then pointed to the pedestal cupboard, or box, produced, which was lying in the back kitchen, where we were standing, and he said, "This box was brought by Hawkins"—I said, "Have you anything else that he has left with you for he has committed a robbery not many doors from here, and taken a large quantity of things"—he said, "No, I have nothing"—on the 10th I went and saw Eyres again, with Sergeant George; I said, "Fry is in custody; he has made a statement that you have got a clock, a hammer, and some squares, at your shop in Warwick Street, Blackfriars Road"—he said, "Yes, there if an old clock there, but there is</p>

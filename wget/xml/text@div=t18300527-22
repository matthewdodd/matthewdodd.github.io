            . I am the prisoner's mother. I left her at my mother's on Friday evening, at tea; she had a shift to make for her mistress, and on Saturday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I met my mother on Towerhill - she said she was going to buy some meat; I went to different pork-shops with her, and was going home with her - she went into a grocer's shop, and told me to go on home before her; I went - the key was not in the door; I went to where she generally leaves the key, and got it - I went in, and laid the meat on the table; my mother did not come very soon - I went back to Dowgate-hill, and she was talking to two women; I asked what she did there gossiping - I had locked the door, and had the key with me; I came in with her, and had breakfast in her room - I stopped about an hour, and then went home; I met my mother coming down to my sister's house - she called me. and said, "Kute, I am robbed;" when I left her room she had not discovered that she was robbed; it was between one and two o'clock that I met her, and she complained of it - I had left the room about eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into her room with her did she make any inquiry about your daughter? A. She said, "I told her to make her bed, and I suppose she is gone to her mistress?" I said I would go and inquire - she said, "Stop, and have breakfast;" the box was under the bed, which came down close upon it - I never saw it but when I made her bed; my daughter had been in service at the Castle, in Lambeth-street - the box was not in sight; I saw her at work on some linen, which she said belonged to her mistress.</p>

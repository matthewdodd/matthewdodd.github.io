                  </hi>. I live in Castle-street, Long Acre—the prisoner is a dress-maker. On Monday, the 23rd of July, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I was with my sister in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner with her sister on the opposite side of the way, he hind me—she kept he hind me all through Drury-lane—I went into a shop to get some cheese, and when I came out again she was gone—I saw her again a few minutes after in belton-street, Long Acre, as I was going with my sister to fetch some beer—she seemed to he watching at the public-house door where I went in—she was then alone-when I came out I went on home, and she fol<lb></lb>lowed close he hind me—I then felt my back as if I was all in a flame of fire—I turned my head round, and she went from me to her sister, who was on the opposite side of the way, and said to her, "Come along, Hen<lb></lb>rietta, don't he frightened," and they walked away-when I felt the fire I put my hand he hind me, and felt the stuff; and my hand was all wet—it was liquid—it burnt my hand the instant I touched it—there was nobody about at all when she did it—I went home and took off my frock directly I got home—it all dropped into holes—the prisoner and her mother had made that dress—she seemed as if she had something under her shawl as she went along the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last-witness. She came in on toil evening between nine and ten o'clock—I saw her frock directly she came in—it is not here—it had several holes about the back, the shoulders, and the waist—there was a hole in her stays, and the shift was burnt—there was a hole in it—no harm was done to her person-her back was warm, I believe, as she complained—my husband put some soda-water to it, and that removed the heat immediately—the skin was not burnt through, and there was no scar—the prisoner and her mother had made the frock about a fortnight or three weeks he fore, and there was a little dispute about it—I thought it was much too small for her—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and stopped a shilling towards what I thought was missing of the stuff—she said all the stuff was there, and they had not any left, that it was a mistake of mine, and she desired to have the shilling—I said I would not give the shilling till she returned the stuff-a few words arose about it, and she came three times, and said her mother wanted the shilling—I said, "I will pay it when you return the stuff"—I thought her saucy to me, and put her out of the street-door, shut it, and went in-doors—she said, "I will have the shilling and I will he revenged," or something to that purport-but that was to me, and not to my daughter—my daughter and her were the best of friends—they always went to church together.</p>

I am ten years old, and live at home with my father—I know the prisoner—she has got a sister named Henrietts—she is younger than her—I used to go and play with her-about three weeks he fore this, I was playing with her, up stairs in her own room—there was a little bottle on the shelf, with something yellow in it—I took the cork out, and got playing with it, and it got on my hands, and burnt them a little, but I did not feel much from it—it made a mark, which went away in a short time, and it stained my frock a little.</p>

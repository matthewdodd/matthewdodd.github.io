                  </hi>. I live in Platt-terrace, Pancras-road, and have lived there nearly three years—the prisoner is a butcher—I dealt with him for nearly two years, and used to deal with him about three years ago—there was some dispute then—he said I owed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I did not owe it him justly—he claimed the debt, and I denied it in conse<lb></lb>quence of short weight—on the evening of the 31st of October, about a quarter to seven o'clock, he called at my house—I sent my servant girl down to him—(he was in the habit of coming two or three times, and cau<lb></lb>sing a confusion at the door, and raising a mob; and when we sent for a policeman he would run away)—I sent the servant girl down, and after<lb></lb>wards sent Charlotte Calnan down to him—I could hear her voice where I was, and, from what I heard, I went down myself, and saw him—I asked what he wanted—he said he wanted his money, and would not go away till he got it—I told him I did not think I owed him any, and if I did he must summons me—he then called me a d----d cowardly rascal, and, I believe, drew something, which I thought was a knife, but it was a steel—he made a stab at me with it in the left breast—it went through my coat and the lin<lb></lb>ing against a pocket-book which I had in my pocket, but it did not touch my person—I then pushed him off the threshold of the door, and off the steps, down into the garden, where he made another stab at me with the steel, which entered my eye-brow—I had hold of him at the time—the garden is in front of the house—we scuffled down the garden, and he stabbed me again, and hit me in the temple, which threw me senseless against the paling for a few moments—it entered to the bone—I then managed to wipe the blood out of my eye, when I came to myself—it was flowing down my face and breast—I looked up, and saw his hand raised up, with the steel in it, going to make another stab at me—a gentleman, at the same time, happened to be passing—he leaned over the paling, and caught his hand, with the steel in it—I do not know who the gentle<lb></lb>man was, he went away—I looked up, and the gentleman had hold of his arm—I had sent Mrs. Calnan for the policeman, who came—the gentle<lb></lb>man held him till the policeman came and took hold of him, and took the steel out of his hand—he said, "Take him in charge, he has stabbed the man;" and I gave him in charge—he was taken away by the police—I went to the station-house, and gave charge of him—I then went to the</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 31st of October I was at Mr. Tugman's—I went down stairs into the passage, when the prisoner called and found him there—he said he had come for the money for a debt—I told him Mr. Tugman said he was to go and summons him—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he wanted his money, and would not go—I told him Mr. Tug<lb></lb>man was out—he said "He is a cowardly vagabond—I know he is at home, and if he comes down I will stick a knife into his b----heart"—he pulled out his steel, which I thought was a knife—he pulled it either from his sleeve or his side, I do not know which—he made a <hi rend="italic">job</hi> and stabbed it into the wall, making use of the same expressions—I said directly," Good gracious me, you will never be so cruel as to stab any person;" and with that I drew back—Mr. Tugman then came down stairs and told him to go along for a vagabond, and to summons him—he made a thrust at Mr. Tugman's side—I went to fetch a policeman, by Mr. Tugman's order, as quick as I could run, and found one—when I returned I saw a great mob round the door, and a gentleman over the pales holding the prisoner's hand with the steel in it—I observed Mr. Tugman bleeding profusely, standing by the side of the pales—he was bleeding from the forehead and eye—he was stabbed in three places.</p>

            . I live at Brompton. I was sent for on the 29th of October, by Justice Durden; the messenger told me there was some lead stolen, which was supposed to be mine; I looked about my house, not having missed any, and found there was a piece of the bottom of a leaden pipe taken away; I went to the Justice's, and there I found a piece of a pipe that I believe to be mine; it was like the other pipes belonging to the house, there was something particular in the shape of it; the prisoner was there; he said he found it.</p>

            . On the 26th or 28th of October I was drinking with the prisoner till about five or six in the evening, at the Cow and Calf on Chelsea Common; he went out from me; after that I went to his lodgings; his wife told me he was not come home; coming back I met him with this lead on his shoulder, about 100 or 150 yards from his lodging; I asked him to go back to the Cow and Calf; he said, let me throw this away, and I'll go with you; the man along with me took it, and carried it into the house; I saw it was a pipe of lead; when we got in at the Cow and Calf, I challenged him with stealing it from Mrs. Mitchell, where he worked; he denied it at first, and said they gave it him instead of his money for his work; then he took it to his lodgings, and I went and acquainted a person with it, and he sent for the lead, and the prisoner to be brought to him; after that he was taken before the Justice, and committed; the next morning Mrs. Mitchell came before the Justice and owned the lead, (produced in court) there is four feet all but three inches of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far does the prisoner live from Mrs. Mitchell?</p>
               <p>Dock. It is a little mile distant.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Mitchell. Had you the lead fitted to the place to see if it answered?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mitchell. No; but I have eight or ten of the same sort belonging to my house.</p>

               <p>I picked it up near the Bell and Horns at Brompton, between six and seven that evening; I was going to see my brother that was very ill at Knightsbridge.</p>

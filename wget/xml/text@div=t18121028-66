On the 24th of September, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a pair of socks, and while the man was showing the socks, another woman came in to inquire for black stockings, which she said she must have in great haste, and while he was turning his back, the prisoner was looking at the socks. I was coming out of the parlour into the shop. I went behind the counter. The woman that looked at the black stockings, she went out dissatisfied with the price. The prisoner brought a pair of socks, and paid 6 d. for them, and immediately went out. My young man said he had suspicion of the prisoner. I went out after the prisoner; she was alone. I asked her to step back; she stepped back with me. She had a basket with her. I looked in the basket, and in her basket I saw one dozen pair of sandals, and a pair of worsted stockings. I sent for an officer and had her searched. She said she did not know how they came in her basket. These are the sandals and stockings; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have six small children. My husband has left me a great while, and has taken up with another woman. I had been to Rag-fair; I had about eight shillings in my pocket. I purchased an old coat, two pair of stockings, and several articles, which cost me fourteen pence, for my children; it was not in my power to buy any thing new. My eldest child is but six years old. My little boy had the measles; I bought him a pair of socks, which cost me sixpence. I came out of the gentleman's shop; he brought me back. He said I had got something; I said I had nothing. I knew I had nothing to my own conscience. He turned several things out of the basket. He took up two parcels in his hand; he said they were not my own; he said, send for a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

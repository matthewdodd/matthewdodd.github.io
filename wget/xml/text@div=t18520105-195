                  </hi> I am a clerk, and live at Helena-cottage, Kingsland-road. On 2nd Dec., in the evening, about half-past 8 o'clock, I was walking through Hoxton, and had a watch in my pocket—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I met a female, spoke to her, and walked 500 or 600 yards with her—a man came up, she ran away, and I found my chain hanging down, and my watch gone—I am quite sure I bad it safe before I met her—his is the chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the watch was in my waistcoat-pocket, and the key through a button-hole—the chain was attached to the watch by a swivel which is gone.</p>

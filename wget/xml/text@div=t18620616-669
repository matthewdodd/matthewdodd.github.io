                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Meacher, a chemist, of 105, Craw<lb></lb>ford-street, Marylebone—on Thursday, 13th February, the prisoner came; I do not know what she asked for, but she purchased a black draught of me—I do not remember refusing to give her anything, or that she asked for one thing and I gave her another—the black draught I gave her was one of many similar draughts; we keep them all ready made up in a drawer—the bottle in which the draught was, was brought back by a boy the same even<lb></lb>ing; with a cup or a glass; it was like an egg-cup—I have had experience in mixing medicines; there is nothing in black draught that would burn a person's mouth or a sheet—the result of mixing sulphuric acid with a black draught would be that it would cause it to become very hot about a minute after mixing—if you mix anything with oil of vitriol it becomes hot—it is a matter of common experience that if you mix water with sulphuric acid great heat is generated; it is sometimes almost hot enough to break the glass vessel containing it—I have had no experience of the effect of sulphuric acid on the mouth, but I have seen it on the skin—it burns the skin, and if thrown on linen in a diluted state it causes it to be destroyed; it leaves a kind of dirt-coloured stains, which become quite rotten, so as to leave holes in the place—the black draught that left our shop was one of the ordinary draughts; there was nothing in it to discolour linen or to cause a burning heat in the mouth.</p>

Q.</hi> When, the bottle was brought back to you by the chemist, did you taste it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—it did not burn my mouth—I both compounded and bottled the mixture myself—there is no recognised formula in the Pharmacopeia for black draughts; every chemist makes it up accord<lb></lb>ing to his own choice—it always contains sulphate of magnesia—I do not think that resembles any other sulphate when in small crystals—I know what sulphate of zinc is—I do net think sulphate of zinc and sulphate of magnesia, in small crystals, could be mistaken by a person who knew them both, but they might by a person who did not understand it—sulphate of zinc is poison—there were about a dozen. bottles of black draught in the drawer when I gave the bottle to the prisoner—they were all made from one</p>

I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">D</hi> division of police, and live at 77, Connaught-terrace, Edgeware-road—I have had experience in cases of administering poisons—on 15th February I was consulted by Inspector Burroughs—he was accompanied by Mrs. Carnell—I looked in her mouth; her lips, tongue, and the inside of her cheeks were covered with white patches, the probable cause of which was, in my opinion, sulphuric acid, which is commonly known as oil of vitriol, the effect of which upon the tissues of the mouth would be to produce white patches of the description I saw—they could not be produced by a draught containing sulphate of zinc, nor would that burn holes if brought into contact with linen, but sulphuric acid would, even if very much diluted, and the same if not diluted, only sooner—if sulphuric acid was thrown into a glass containing the ordinary black draught, the result would be that it would get warmer till it became quite hot—that is the result of the chemical combination—the sulphuric acid has a great affinity for the water, and, in the act of com<lb></lb>bination, heat is evolved—the inspector gave me some pieces of a sheet, which I analysed, and came to the conclusion that they had been rotted by sulphuric acid—I called next day to see Mrs. Carnell, and saw one or two spots on the fire-irons—they had a grayish rust, which, I think, was made by sulphuric acid—it seemed like sulphate of iron, which would be the usual result of throwing sulphuric acid on iron—from the inspection I made of Mrs. Carnell, I have no doubt what was the cause of the appearances she presented, and I thought it was that when I saw the sheets.</p>

               <p>mouth, but not many—the bowels being out of order would not produces them, though that might produce a very foul tongue and blisters in the mouth, but they would be a transparent white, and not an opaque white—nothing would produce patches like that—I know the disease called thrush, that sometimes appears in persons who are in a very low state of health—they have patches on the mouth—if a person has been greatly suffering from diarrhea, so that the stomach becomes lowered, thrush may ensue—sulphuric acid is colourless, and has no smell when pure—when it is thrown on anything, it smells—when thrown on linen, it decomposes it, and there is a sour smell—the linen brought to me smelt, not of black draught, but of sulphuric acid—I did not examine the whole of the sheets—a piece of a sheet was brought to me, and I saw the remainder of it before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—my opinion is that the inspector brought the whole sheet, and I took a portion of it, but it might not be so—it was in pieces, because it was rotten—I had never seen Mrs. Carnell before—besides sulphuric acid, there are a hundred things that would produce spots of rust on iron, all the mineral acids—I did not apply any test to those spots; they were of a grayish white.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to lead you to suppose that this was thrush from which the woman was suffering? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the sheets had not got the thrush—judging from her mouth, and from the sheet, and from the spots on the iron, I have not the least doubt that they were caused by sulphuric acid.</p>

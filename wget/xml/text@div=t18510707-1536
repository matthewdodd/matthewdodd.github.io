                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 52, Commercial-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth. My two sons work with me—the prisoner was in my service—he was at work in the shop on 4th July—I wrapped up six sovereigns in paper about 10 o'clock, and put them into a drawer under my seat, in the prisoner's presence—I remained there till a quarter to five, when I and my sons left the shop, leaving the prisoner there; and just as I came to the top of the kitchen-stairs, the prisoner was coming out of the door leading into the passage—he said, "I have bolted the street-door"—I said, "Very well"—he then left to go to his tea—he ought to have come back in half-an-hour, to finish his work; there was only five minutes' work to do, to finish it—he never returned—he used to work by the job—I missed my money between 6 and 7.</p>

On 5th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner in James's-place—I said I wanted him, for robbing his master of six sovereigns—he said, "Oh!"—I asked him how much money he had about him—he said, "I have 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

If he wished it—he gave me a shilling; I did not give him the change, as he had been out on the drink four days—he said, "Thomas, can you give me change for the shilling, because I have no more money, and I want to buy a pair of soles for some shoes?"—I gave him two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, as I had no copper, and that was all the money he had—I went with the police-man—he told the prisoner he wanted him for robbing his employer of six sovereigns, yesterday afternoon—he said, "All right, I will be with you in a moment"—he said, "What money have you got in your pocket?"—the prisoner said, "6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

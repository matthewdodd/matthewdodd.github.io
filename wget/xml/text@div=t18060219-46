             sworn. I live at No. 1, King's Head Yard, Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a waistcoat. - A. I lost a waistcoat about two or three months ago at the shop where I work; finding it too warm for me I pulled it off, and put it on a chest. On missing the waistcoat from off the chest, I made enquiry about it; the prisoner at the bar told me that there was a man in the shop that had a large family, very likely he had took it to make use of for his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work in the same shop. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your waistcoat again. - A. Yes, the prisoner told me that the duplicate of the waistcoat was in the till behind the chest; on the 19th of February, when he was at the

             for four shillings, I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the waistcoat by the make, and the pearl buttons, and likewise here is a piece of the same pattern I had left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark that you know it by. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been of opinion that this is your own waistcoat. - A. As soon as I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you this morning said that you could not swear to it. - A. No, to nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. If I should mention any person's name to whom you said it, you will recollect it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so to a person of the name of Stafford. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190041"></xptr>Q. Not this morning. - A. No, nor any other person, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>FRANCES WHITE sworn. I am a washerwoman, I wash for the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever at any time take that waistcoat to pawn for the prisoner. - A. I cannot say, because I was in the habit of pledging for them both; and whether the prisoner or the prosecutor gave me that waistcoat to pledge, I could not say if I was to die for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always deliver the duplicate to the person to whom you pledged it for. - A. Always, they desired me to pledge them in my own name, as they would get me to take them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had pledged waistcoats for each of them before. - A. Yes, all kind of wearing apparel; I pledged for them both in my own name by their direction. I never heard the prosecutor say he missed a waistcoat, it is nothing but malice.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prosecutor has been asked to look at that waistcoat, and whether he did not say that he could not swear to it. - A. Yes, I was present, and my husband, Mr. Stafford, and Mr. Townshend at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there more persons in court now who heard it as well as you. - A. Yes, and ready to come forward.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            .) What do you know of these four Pieces of Leather?</p>
               <p>Smith. I work in a Stall next the Street, and this Person (the Prisoner) came by me and stood a considerable Time; and said; Do you want any Thing I have got; I said, let me look upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. About five Weeks ago. I ask'd her what she would take for two Pair. She ask'd me 8 d. I gave her 7 d. I ask'd her whether she came honestly by them. She said, she did. She ask'd me if she should call again the latter End of the Week. I said she might. I never saw her 'till Thursday last; she came again, and ask'd me, do you want any more Leather. I answer'd I could not tell, it was so cold; but I carry'd one of these Soles to a Leather-Cutter's; and he told me, he was sure it was stolen; and desir'd me, when she came again, I would stop her: Accordingly, she came; but I said, go into the publick House and I will come to you. She went in and I bought a Pair of her mark'd 7 d. for a Groat: When I carry'd them to the Leather-Cutter, he bid me pay for them and he would come immediately: And when he came, he look'd upon the two Pair she had in her Hand, and ask'd her what she would have for them; 1 s. She ask'd, and he bid her 8d. With that, he just touch'd her by the Hand and said, How come you by these Goods: He insisted to know where she bought them : She said, she bought them of Mr. Jarvis's Maid on Snow-Hill.</p>

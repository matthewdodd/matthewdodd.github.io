               <p>six in the evening the prisoner came to my kitchen—I left her there alone—she went out—about eleven on the Wednesday morning I went to the box and missed the shawl—no one had been in there since the prisoner—I had some suspicion, and on Thursday I fetched the prisoner to my house—I asked if she had seen the shawl, and would give it me again—she said she knew nothing about it—I saw it in possession of Wood—this is it.</p>

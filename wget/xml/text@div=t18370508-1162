                  </hi>. I am a horsehair manufacturer, and live at No. 3, Cupid's-court, Golden-lane, in the parish of St. Luke, Middlesex. It is my own house—I occupy it—I keep my horse-hair in the lower room, on the ground floor. On the 18th of April two persons came to me—as near as I can speak, it was about half-past eight o'clock at night—it was dark then—I had a candle alight—they asked me if I had any nineteen-inch seating—I know one of the men perfectly well to be the prisoner Brand, and the other prisoner I know, though I will not take my oath to his features, but I will to his stature—I had not known Brandon before—they said, "Let us see what you have got"—I unlocked the room door, and shewed them a piece of seventeen inch, and twenty-four inch—I had no nineteen inch, and told them so—I kept my horsehair locked in a book-case in the room—I unlocked the book-case, and took it out before them—they both looked at it—Theodore said he had got a set of chairs to do, but they came to so much money, he would not have them done—they did not buy any thing of me—it was finally arranged that he was to call for the twenty-four inch in the morning, to have that instead of the nineteen-inch—I had an opportunity of seeing the persona of both the men—I stood alongside of Theodore, and had no opportunity of seeing his features; but the other was a good deal in the passage, and I thought be might be inclined to go up stairs, and I had a better opportunity of seeing him than the other—I swear to the height of Theodore, being every way the same—I will take my oath Brandon is the same man—after thy they went away—I lighted them down the court, and bolted my street-door, and went in and tried all the fastenings—the window, the book-case, and the escrutoire in this room Were all secure—the window-shutters were bolted inside—I cannot say whether the window-sash was fastened, but the shutters were bolted—I am certain the sash-window was down—I have a mode of sticking a piece, of wood in to fasten it, but whether that was in or not I do not know—I went up two Pairs of stairs after locking the room door, to go to my work—it then Wanted exactly a quarter to nine by my clock, and I think it was as nearly right as possible, it might be five minutes too slow—I was alarmed in about five minutes by a ring at the bell, and came down—I went to the street-door, unbolted it, and found several neighbours there, who gave the alarm of robbery—I did not see any body running away—in consequence of what I heard, unlocked my lower room door, and found my book-case forced open, the shutters were forced open, and the bottom sash thrown up—I found a piece of the twenty-four inch cloth standing up inside the room, underneath the ledge of the window that was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was one of the pieces I had been showing to the two men, and which I had locked up in the book-case—two chisels Bare picked up, and a bag, which did not belong to me, but I had seen it before—a man named Abbott, who works forme, used to bring that hag, and take his work home in it—he had lost it, and I was obliged to lend him one—it was not in the room at the time I was there before—I looked into the book-case, and missed a piece of twenty-six inch, about twenty-five or twenty-six yards long—there was a remnant with it, standing up by the side of it—It was lot rolled up with it—the remnant was also gone—the twenty-six inch piece was brought to me that night by Sarah Jennings, my daughter, in about a quarter of an hour—I have never seen the remnant since—the twenty-four inch and the twenty-six inch pieces were worth, as near as I can</p>

I am the daughter of the prosecutor—I live at No. 9, Cupid's-court, immediately opposite my father's, which is No. 3 On the 18th of April I saw two persons go to my father's house about half-past eight o'clock—I saw them at the door ringing the bell—I did not see my father with them—toe door was opened—I did not take much notice of the men, it being dark—I saw them again the same evening, when Goodall gave an alarm—that was about a quarter of an hour after I had Keen them ringing the bell—I got up, and ran to the door—I saw the prisoner Brandon outside the window with a roll of horsehair cloth under his arm, and I saw Theodore (as I suppose him to be, but I did not see much of him) nearly out of the entrance of the court—I and Mrs. Goodall called out, "Stop thief," and Brandon ran, and threw the roll down, and we ran after him—the other was nearly out of the entrance of the court, with a small remnant in his hand—I could see that quite plain by the gas-light—I could tell it was a remnant by its being in such a small compass—Brandon threw the roll of horsehair cloth at our feet, which prevented us from catching him—we were within two yards of him at the time he threw it—Theodore is exactly the same height, size, and look as the other man had seen at my father's door, from what little notice I took of him—he resembles the man in stature, appearance, and features—I could not see hit features in the court, because his back was to me—I observed his features when they were ringing at the bell—one of them had a brown snuff-coloured coat on, and the other had a dark frock-coat—I had an opportunity of noticing Brandon at the time I saw him with the roll of cloth—he is the man—I know him by hit person and features—I took the cloth up, and took it into my house, and afterwards gave it to my father—I looked at my father's premises when I saw the men outside—the shutters were wide open, and the bottom sash was put up, and I could see the book-case doors wide open—I could see that outside, as it is by the side of the window—Theodore is exactly the same stature and thickness as the man—Good-all is now lying in.</p>

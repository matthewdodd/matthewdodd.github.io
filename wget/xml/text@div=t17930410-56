               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your son's name is Jeremiah as well as your's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did he come home? - In less than an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this key of the wine cellar kept? - It was hanging up with the other on a nail in the shop</p>
               <p>Q. So that any body going into the shop might take the key and have access to the cellar? - Nobody, but myself and son went there.</p>
               <p>Q. She might have got to the cellar, and got brandy for your son without your consent; Did you never hear that she got brandy for your son? - She said at Bow-street, that my son was accessary to her robbing me, and Justice Bond said, that that was worse than the robbery itself.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had she lived with you? - Five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she conducted herself fairly? - I cannot mention any thing, but what is in the indictment, or else I could say a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman or a widow? - When she came to me, she said, she was a married woman, but I find it is no such thing; she had a child by a man she lived with.</p>

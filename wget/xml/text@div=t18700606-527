Q.</hi> Did Jeremiah come down for Denis after you got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he called to ask me out after I had done my tea, and we went out together—Denis did not go not with us—I lodge with him—I have known him five or six years—I heard of his being in custody the next morning, on this charge—I went to see him when he was before the Magistrate—I was in Court, and heard the evidence against him—I did not offer to say a word about what I have said to-day—I was not called on; it had nothing to do with me—I heard the officer of the Court call out for witnesses for the prisoner—I did not go forward—he did not call on me—I have been in prison once for the unlawful possession of a piece of rope, about eighteen mouth** ago—I had three months—I was in prison once before that, for the possession of counterfeit coin, and had nine months.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect seeing Bridget Hayes, on Easter Mon<lb></lb>day, a little after 10 o'clock—she was standing between Mr. Hayes' shop and his lodging-house—there were a lot of them together—about an hour after I first saw her, she was brought into her mother's house on a stretcher—I stripped her—she had a bruise on the right arm, and one on her chest—she had been drinking, she sicked on my apron.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that when she was brought in on the stretcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was with her till 3 o'clock in the morning—she was not insensible when I saw her—the prisoners are no acquaintances of mine—I had not seen Bridget Hayes drinking—I have been in the lane fifteen months.</p>

               <p>a jug in her hand—Mary Riley ran after her with the stick, and hit her on the head with it, and about the body—Mary Ann O'Connell knocked her down, and jumped on her—I know Denis Cailaghan and Patrick—they were not there—I was close <hi rend="italic">again</hi> my sister—I saw Kate there; she was alongside of us—I could see what she saw—if she says Patrick and Denis were there, it is untrue—it is untrue if Bridget Hayes says she was struck and kicked by Denis and Patrick Cailaghan—I did not see them there.</p>

Q.</hi> Who asked you to come here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My mother asked me to come, no one else—she told me to tell the truth—I saw her this morning—she is outside the Court—I had been talking to her just before I came in—she told me to say that I only saw the two women there—I did not tell Bridget that she was wrong in saying that Denis and Patrick were there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police. On the 29th of April, at a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Jubilee-place, Stepney -I saw the prisoner and another man, with each a stove; I followed them some distance, and asked where they were going to take them; they said they bought them at a sale, and were going to Brick-lane - they did not go that way, and I said I must take them to the station; they put down the stoves by the London-hospital, and the other man ran away, but I caught the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him to ask the other man to give him an explanation, as I did not know where they were going. Witness. No, he only said it was right, and when I had him he made a desperate effort to escape - I caught the tail of the other man's coat, and he left it with me.</p>

            . The house these stoves were taken from was let to me. I saw them all safe a few days after Lady-day, and I think I had called there on the 28th or 29th of April; they were then fixed, and the house was secure - I went a few days afterwards, and the lock of the street-door had been broken off, and the stoves were gone - I have no doubt these are the stoves; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in the Commercial-road with these stoves; he asked me to help him with them to Brick-lane; when the officer stopped me he ran off; I ran and called after him, but the officer called me back.</p>

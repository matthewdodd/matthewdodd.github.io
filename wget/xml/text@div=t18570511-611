                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living at No. 28, Crawford Street I sleep there—on the night of 1st May I saw the house safe at 10 o'clock—the windows and doors were fastened—after that I went to take my supper at No. 35, where I have another shop for stationery and toys—I came back about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, and undid the door with the latch key—it was latched as I had left it—I had a little dog with me, which barked furiously, and I saw a small shutter inside removed—it is a shop with two windows, with the door in the middle—on further examining I saw some boots lying on the floor of the shop, which were in their places when I went—from the noise of the dog it was evident to me that some one was in the house—I then shut the front door, thinking, "All that's in shall keep in," and struck a light, and found the locks had been wrenched off from the partition, and a great many goods taken out of the window and from the shop—I then opened the back parlour door, and saw the prisoner lying on a parcel of goods packed up—he saw me, and begged for mercy on account of his wife and children—I said, "<hi rend="italic">You're</hi> a pretty scoundrel to come here, and to beg for mercy; what mercy would you have shown me if you had taken my goods?"—he then got up, and followed me towards the door—I opened the door, and collared him as he was going out—we struggled together, and in the struggle we broke two panes of glass—I hallooed out lustily, "Police!" and a person named Coram came to my assistance—I examined the parcel of goods that were packed up—there were eighty-eight pairs of ladies' boots, and my blue bag, in which he had packed up some of them.</p>

I received information, which took me to Mr. Herriott's—I found the prisoner had been taken to the station—he was there given into my custody on the charge of stealing these things—I went to the house, and found the shop door had been forced open by some instrument—there were some marks on it—I went inside, and two large bags were picked up, both crammed full of boots, eighty-eight pairs altogether—three padlocks were forced off from the partitions in the shop, and were on the floor—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a mortise chisel, and there were marks on the door corresponding with those things—I put them together—on the prisoner, at the station, I found these two gimlets, two knives, and a new wedge (for which there is a use), two ropes, and a slip knot with a noose.</p>

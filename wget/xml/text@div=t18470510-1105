                  </hi>. I am the wife Walter Atkinson, of the Six Bells public-house, Queen-street, Hammersmith. On Tuesday evening, the 23rd of March, the prisoners came, with another person, about five o'clock—they called for a pot of half-and-half, which they drank in front of the bar—Knight laid down a sovereign to pay for it—I passed it on to my husband, who was in the bar, and went to the till to get the silver—I counted out the change for a sove<lb></lb>reign, the full change—Knight said, "Can you oblige me with a half-sove<lb></lb>reign?"—(I had laid the full change in silver on the counter)—I said, "Yes, I have one in my Pocket"—it was the only one I had—I laid it on the counter—Knight took it up, turned it round, and looking at the edge, said, "This is a light one"—I said, "I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—Smith said, "Yes, you had better have silver; you owe me a crown"—I then counted out a crown piece and two half-crowns, and gave him them, having taken back the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver which I had first put down—my husband stepped forward, and took up the half-sovereign which Knight had put down, and said, "Have you rung the changes?"—Knight said, "Do you suppose we are <hi rend="italic">smashers</hi>, then?"—my husband said, "I do not know, but you must put down my good half-sovereign, or I will call the police"—he left to fetch a policeman, saying to me, "Mind he don't swallow it"—I saw Knight put a half-sovereign into his mouth with his left hand, and drink, with the mug of beer in his right hand, throwing his head back—I said three times, "You are swallowing it now"—he made no answer—Devine took up the bad half-sovereign, which my husband had bent, and thrown on the counter again—I do not know what became of it, but he took it off the counter—they remained there till my husband returned with the police, and were taken to the station—the half-sovereign I gave them was a good one, and the only one I had—Knight did not swallow the bad one—it must have been the one I put down, as he did not put his hand to his pocket.</p>

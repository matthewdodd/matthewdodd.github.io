                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it before you heard the money was lost that you saw the prisoner in the tool-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a fortnight, to the best of my knowledge—he opened the chest in my presence—I do not know whether it had any lock—he was at it before I went up stairs—I do not know whether he had any key—he lifted up the box lid—it was to be opened by any one that came into the room—I might open it, and so might others as well as me—Bridget Riley, one of the women, told me to go up—I have known her getting on for two years—<hi rend="italic">Biddy</hi> did not go up with me—there were two more women there, Mary Haggerty and Mary Donovan—they are not here—the women persuaded me to go up to see what the boy wanted—he said he wanted an apron—he went to the box and over<lb></lb>hauled the tools, and then turned round and said, "Go down and see if Mr. so and so is in the factory;" he meant Mr. Owen, the foreman.</p>

               <p>

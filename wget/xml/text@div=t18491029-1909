                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, of 154, Oxford-street. In May last the prisoner came into my service as shopwoman—I had a good character with her—she only stayed three weeks, and then discharged herself—up to that time I had no reason to suspect her—some time after, in consequence of a communication I had with Mr. Baines, to whom I had given her a character, she was taken into custody—I afterwards saw some duplicates, which the police-man brought me, and went with him to Dobree and Tomlinson's, pawn-brokers, in the Strand, and there found a new French-embroidered cambric handkerchief and a pair of new silk stockings—such articles were in the prisoner's reach while she was in my service—I can positively swear that the handkerchief has not been sold, because it must have been reported to me, and also the mark, and the money—I cannot be positive as to the stockings, but I have no reason to believe they were sold—we remove the mark when articles are sold—the prisoner had no right to have them—I afterwards went to a pawnbroker's in Farringdon-street, and found a piece of Irish linen of twenty-eight yards; it is my property, and has my private mark on it; I am sure it has never been sold—I also found a pair of new silk stockings, which I believe are mine, but I cannot swear to them—the prisoner had no right to any of these articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>, How can you swear to the handkerchief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the pattern—I never had but that one—I did not miss it, because my stock is very large—I have a piece of linen here, which corresponds with this that I found—this is my private mark, "<hi rend="largeCaps">OGB</hi>"—that means 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and this "<hi rend="largeCaps">AXGB</hi>" means 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which is the price of the whole piece—I do not think any other shopkeeper uses those letters—the maker does not make more linen of the same number.</p>

I live at 6, Albert Place, Thatcham Road, and am a pork butcher—the prisoner is a spiced beef and sausage maker—on 13th October, about 2.15 or 2.20, I was on the prisoner's premises—I had been employed there for about eighteen months—the deceased man, Swift, was also in his employment—Swift was addicted to drink, and he was the worse for liquor on the day in question, but I have seen him do his work when he was in a worse state than he was then—I came into the please about 2.15 or 2.20, and saw Mr. Lister and Swift quarrelling—I heard</p>

               <p>Lister say to Swift, "You talk about my wife," and he struck him in the face, and knocked him down by the strap wheel of the machine—he got up again and Lister knocked him down again across the horse-track—he got up again and Lister knocked him down again by the smoke hole—Swift got up and said, "Have mercy on an old man"—I said to him, "Charley, go home"—he was coming past the filling machine to get out into the arch-way, when Mr. Lister picked him up and threw him into the copper—the copper was about three yards from the filling machine—Swift was going out, and Lister picked him up by the trowsers and threw him into the copper with his face downwards—head formost—the copper was three parts full of water, and about three parts boiling—it was a fifty-five gallon copper—as he was thrown in, his legs were sticking out—I was about two yards away from him at the time—I did not interfere to save the man, it was done momentarily—my brother was there, and Mr. Lister's brother, I believe—I did not see the traveller there, I believe he ran away—I gave information to the police—previous to doing so I assisted the prisoner in picking Swift out of the copper—I said to him "You have done something, now help me to pick him out," and he did so—he caught hold of him on one side, and I the other—I went for a doctor first—I brought a policeman, and somebody said that Swift had fallen in—Swift said, "I was picked up bodily and thrown in"—the prisoner made no reply to that—I was not related to Swift.</p>

He threw down his hat, and said he was an Irish Cockney, and he must fight it out with me He had a potatoes and some ribbons hinging to his hat, and he came up to me with his fists up, and said ho would have it out there. I pushed him away, and pushed him down twice, and told him to go away, but he would not I caught hold of him, and said, "Now you shall go." I caught him round the waist. When he got to the side of the copper, he caught his foot, either against the copper or the bench, and acci<lb></lb>dently went into the copper. He was no sooner in than I pulled him out, not knowing whether there was any water in it, or whether it was hot or not His shirt was taken off, and some oil and floor put on him, and after that he said again he was an Irish Cockney, and would have it out.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and was called to the factory to see Swift—I heard the prisoner say they had struggled together, and the man fell in the copper—the policeman asked Nathaniel Nottage if that was the case—he hesitated—the policeman said, "You must tell the truth," and Nottage then said it was true they had a struggle, and that what Lister said was true—I saw the two Nottage's—they were not tipsy; but I could notice they had had a little to drink.</p>

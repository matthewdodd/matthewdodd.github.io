                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. I assisted in taking the prisoners from Islington-station to the police-court—in Upper-street there was a great disturbance and crowd collected round the officers—the persons in the crowd cried out—one in particular, though I do not know who he was, said, "Why don't you make several of them take you? why do you walk? don't walk"—that was addressed to the prisoners Wybrow and the two Ways—at that time I should think there were about fifty people in the crowd; several women and children, and children in arms—when we got near the turnpike Ching took hold of Saunders, who instantly seized him—they closed together, and Saunders threw him down and fell upon him—I went up and pulled Saunders off—he was kicking and making great resistance in every possible way—he had hold of Ching's collar, and was very violent—Sergeant North then came up—he and Ching took hold of Saunders by the collar, one on each side, and led him forward, he still making great resistance, plunging and kicking—when we got on to Arlington-street, opposite Sadler's-wells Theatre, Saunders again com<lb></lb>menced a great resistance, turned round, and tried to bite Ching—I imme<lb></lb>diately stepped up to assist Ching, and my attention was drawn to Norton, who called out to Saunders, "Give it him, go it, b—t him, kick him"—Saunders was then making great resistance, and kicking violently—Norton was about five yards off on my right hand—there was then a dense crowd, a great crowd, making a great noise—at that moment Ching was thrown down—I did not see who threw him down—he laid on the ground with the prisoner Lee, who had got his legs round Ching's neck—Lee was under<lb></lb>most, and was twining his legs round Ching's neck—both were on their backs—Norton still continued to make these vociferations, "Give it him, go it"—a person in the crowd undid Ching's belt by which Lee had hold of him, and also released his legs—Lee had got his hands fast by his belt behind, as well as his legs round his neck, and both were on their backs—I could just see Lee's head under Ching's belt—they were twined like two snakes—as soon as I saw Ching released, I seized Norton—he resisted violently till one of the letter G constables came up and took him from me.</p>

On the 6th of November I was going along High-street, Islington, to my work, and saw a mob by the Liverpool-road—I went to see what it was, and saw two prisoners in custody—as soon as I went up, Sergeant North <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me a way-right into the road—I stumbled, and Ching directly came and collared me; I asked why he did so—he would not tell me—I said, "Tell me what you collar me for, and I will go quietly"—he said, "Never mind what, I have got you right enough"—I said I would not go without he told me—he caught me by the throat, and began shaking me—we struggled, and fell, I on the top of him, or on the side—Inspector Miller and North came and pulled me off; Ching got up, laid hold of me again, with North, pulling my neck-handkerchief—I was eating some bread-and-butter at the time, and they very nearly choked me; I said, "Will you allow me to have my knife out to cut my handker<lb></lb>chief, I can't go along like this, you will choke me?" they still collared and shook me about; they said, at Hatton-garden, that I tried to get my knife out—I never tried to do any thing of the kind—I asked them to get it out, and cut my handkerchief—they were completely choking me; I was getting black in the face; the persons round, said, "Leave go of his collar;" they would not, but kept <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> me about all the time; some<lb></lb>body, I cannot say who, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> in, and I got several hits on the head, and kicks from the mob and the policemen; Lee was taken, as they said be struck a policeman, and kicked him; I never saw any thing of it: some of the G division came up and took me into custody, and at Hatton-garden they said I went to speak to the prisoners, but I only went to look on, the same as other persons.</p>

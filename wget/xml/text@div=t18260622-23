            . I am a constable, and was in the Hall. The prisoner was given into my charge, with the box; I found a pair of scissars on him, with the duplicate of a handkerchief, pawned that day for 3s. - he denied the charge - I did not know him before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work till twelve o'clock, and then being ill, my mother persuaded me to take a walk; I went to see the election - the gentleman accused me of stealing his box.</p>

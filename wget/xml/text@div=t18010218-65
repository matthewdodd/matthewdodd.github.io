               <p>BENJAMIN WOODHOUSE sworn. - On Tuesday night, the 17th of this month, I lost a metal watch, with a gold seal, as I was going in hackney-coach from St. Paul's to my own house, in Park-row, Knightbridge, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I think the number was 192; my watch was found upon the prisoner, in his hat upon his head; he was in the coach with me; when I came to pay the toll at Hyde-park, I missed it; I had taken some punch in the course of the day, which had made me rather intoxicated, having eat no animal food that day; the streets were very slippery; I was staggering in the street, and the prisoner laid hold of me, I believe, in Lombard-street, about nine o'clock; he said, I seemed to be very much in liquor, I told him I was, and if he would see me home, I should be very much obliged to him; he conducted me to a coach in St. Paul's Church-yard, which I got into, and he with me; when I missed my watch at the toll-house, I said, you are a thief, I have got a thief with me; the turnpikeman assisted me, and my watch was found in the crown of his hat, on his head, and my handkerchief under his arm-pit; when he got out of the coach, he got from me, but did not get more than one hundred yards, or perhaps not fifty, before he was taken and brought back, he was then taken to Mount-street watch-house.</p>

               <p>You never found the other? - She was taken up, and I really believe her to be the person, but it being dark in the alley, and she having a hat and cloak on, I could not swear to her, but the prisoner was never out of my sight and had no hat or cloak on, I delivered the chain to Mr. Morris.</p>

               <p>How soon did they begin to wrangle about the watch? - Directly, almost as soon as I came in, I do not know how long they had been there before.</p>
               <p>Who began the wrangling? - The man said he had lost the watch in the house.</p>
               <p>How soon after he came in was that? - I do not know how long he had been in the house before I came in.</p>

               <p>Which of the patrol? - I do not know the man's name, he is a tall man; the patrol went away, and the man found his watch on the bed directly after the patrol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080188"></xptr> went away, then the man said I will treat you with any thing you please, but he did not treat them; there had been half a pint of gin sent for, the man did not pay for it, but he drank some.</p>
               <p>Who paid for it? - I paid for it out of my own pocket.</p>

               <p>Where did go from the Bell? - I was going down Holborn to go home.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Shadwell, there was a woman standing at the end of Union-court, asked me where I was going, and she asked me to go along with her, and I did go to the house where this woman mentions; I do not charge the prisoner with any thing of this, but what was afterwards.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at Williams's house? - I had not been in the house five minutes before I missed my watch and money, I immediately made an uproar in the house, and said I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How many women were there in company? - There were four, I believe; I insisted upon not going out of the house till I had my watch and money, I was in the house from about ten till about a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Did the women that were in the house with you follow you out? - No, they were gone out before.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of those in the house? - I cannot say whether she was or not, I do not remember her face there.</p>
               <p>How long had you been out of the house before what you say happened? - I had but just got out of the house; when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080189"></xptr> found I insisted on my property, they said, why, damn you, why did not you go and look in the room, and I went, and I found it underneath the bed, between the bed and the mattrass, after that I was going up the alley again, I met with the two women, the prisoner at the bar and another, I believe they were not the same women.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>
               <p>Court to Morris. Did the prosecutor appear to be drunk or sober? - He was sober, to the best of my judgment, he shewed me the house where he had been before; when I first came up, the prisoner and he were together.</p>
               <p>When you first saw them, had he hold of her? - Yes, she did not offer to resist, she was not above five or six yards from her own lodging, they all lodge in one court.</p>

Thus far was Evidence for the King. The Prisoners called several Persons of good Quality to their Reputation, who (in the general) gave a favourable Report of their former behaviour. Upon the whole matter, it appeared that they were all equally ingaged in the Quarrel, and that Mr. Kelsey was seen to strike the deceased: but Mr. John Breames was the person that gave the said Hutton the fatal wound, and that without any provocation given by Mr. Hutton. The Court summ'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Jury very distinctly, desiring them to be very considerate about a matter of so great consequence: so after all, they returned this Verdict, That they were all three <rs id="t16931206-13-verdict56" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>fastenings were all in order and the house properly fastened up—I was awakened about 1.50 by a sound as if in the house—I got out of bed and looked at my watch—I waited till I heard a constable coming along his beat about 2.40, and I called him from the window, and then went down and let him in at the front door—I went over the house with him—I went down to the basement floor and found one of the iron bars protecting the window of the wash house bent on one side and forced from the socket—the bars are inside, and the window must have been opened first—the door leading from the wash house to the kitchen was open, and had been forced—the window of the kitchen was partly opened, but was secured by a screw at the side, which prevented it opening more than 2 or 3 inches—the drawers in the kitchen were open, and had been ransacked—I found a large bundle of linen done up in the table-cover, and a parcel of cutlery on the top of it—in the parlour, the cheffonier and a writing desk had been opened, and the contents strewed about—I missed my overcoat from the lobby, in the pocket of which was a handkerchief, and I also missed a scarf—when I got towards the foot of the stairs, I saw a person making his escape by the back door—I found a pair of boots, one in the kitchen and another under the table in the parlour—there were a large number of foot-marks—I found a chisel on a chair in the parlour, and I saw marks which had no doubt been caused by the chisel—this this my coat and handkerchief which were in the lobby that night.</p>

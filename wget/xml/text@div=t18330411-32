            . I am an officer. I stopped a cart within about two hundred yards of the prosecutor's gate, between five and six o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of February; I found 22 lbs. of oats in a sack on the top of the load - there was another sack of chaff and oats, mixed, for the horses, but these were in a separate parcel; I took the prisoner back to the yard, and asked him what this was for the said to be mixed with the chaff, but I found the other was mixed; he then said somebody must have put it into the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this sack? A. On the top of the load - the tilt was folded over this, and over part of the load; the prisoner went back quietly - I had him in custody, but did not take hold of him.</p>

            . I am the beadle. I was with Watkins when the cart came out of the yard - we followed it to the King's Arms.</p>
               <p>MR. WALKER re-examined. Q.What quantity of oats, or oats and chaff, do you allow your men to take with the horses? A.We give them a bushel every night for three horses - he had his chaff and oats mixed in a bag, and I should think he had three parts of a bushel in his nosebags; he had more than he ought to have had besides this- he had no business with this at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then whether any of the other men might have put this on the cart you cannot tell? A. No - I suspected the others, but not the prisoner; I would take him into my employ again.</p>

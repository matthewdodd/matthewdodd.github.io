                  </hi>. I am a dealer in coals, and live in Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road, two doors from the prosecutor's. On Friday morning, the 11th of October, I was sitting at my door, and saw the prisoner and three more consulting together on the opposite side of the way—I suspected, and watched them—two went down the street, and the prisoner and another went up the street, and came past me, and ongoing put the prosecutor's, the prisoner stepped up to the board outside, took some meat, and handed it to the other, who wrapped it up in a handkerchief—they both walked on slowly together—I went after them, and caught the prisoner by the arm—he said, "I have got nothing"—I said, "No, but you had something just this moment, I saw you pass it to the other boy—the other boy immediately threw it over some area rails, ran away, and escaped—I held the prisoner till a policeman came up, who took him bad to the prosecutor—a man picked up the meat, and gave it to me—the prisoner, at first, said the handkerchief was his, but the meat was not, and afterwards he said neither the handkerchief or meat belonged to bun.</p>

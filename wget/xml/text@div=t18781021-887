I am 14 years of age, and am in service at 27, City Road—I have known the prisoner seven years—he has been courting me the last two years—he was my Sunday-school teacher—it came to the knowledge of my mother and she forbid me to have any more to do with him; after that I did not speak to him; he tried to speak to me from time to time—on Sunday evening, 13th October, about 6 o'clock, I came out to go to chapel; I saw the prisoner on the other side of the street waiting for me; he was coming across the road and I crossed over to avoid him, he then crossed again to me and I crossed back again to read a bill outside the City Road Chapel, so as to let him go on in front of me, because I did not like him behind me—he did not pass me, he hid in the gates of the chapel—I then went on and he followed me again—I turned round and saw him coming—I then went on again and turned round again, and he was close behind me, and then he threw some hot stuff upon me—I did not see him do it, but there was no one else near—he was close to me, almost touching me; the stuff came on the back of my neck, it almost took away my senses—I do not know whether I fell or not, but when I came to I was in a young man's arms and the prisoner had gone—I went straight home to my mother's and made a complaint—she took me to a doctor's and the burns were dressed.</p>

About half-past 10 on the evening of 13th October I went to the prisoner's house—he was in bed—I went with his father to his room—I told him I was a police sergeant, and that I was going to apprehend him for throwing some vitriol over a girl in the City Road, at 6 o'clock this evening—he said "I can prove an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>; I have not been in the City Road to<lb></lb>night"—a little while afterwards he said "Oh! I forgot, I came along by St. Mark's Church and Old Street into the City Road up into Church Street, East Road, to see a friend"—I told him to put on the same things that he had on that evening, and come with me—he got a pair of trousers and put on; there were no braces to them, and he turned round to some other trousers and got the braces from them—I took up those trousers, and some money fell out of the pocket—I said "These are light trousers"—the girl had given a description of the clothes he was wearing—he then dressed, and I took him to the station—I then sent a constable for the light trousers, and they were brought; before that I brought the girl and the prisoner together, and he said "lizzie, you did not see me do it"—she gave an account of what had happened and said it was he who had done it—she said "You know you done it, John"—I asked her if those were the same clothes that he had on, and she said that was the same coat—I gave the trousers to the doctor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The coat was not new, the trousers were very nearly new—I went to the prisoner's house with Mrs. Bubbers—I saw the father and asked whether he was at home—he said "Yes, and he, is in bed now; he has come home queer and very sick"—I did not hear the mother say "I should think he has been ill, after what he has done to my daughter"—Boyden, another detective, was with me—I had a paper with me, upon which the sergeant had written the time at which the offence was committed—it was 6.40—the girl was with me—6.40 was the time when the party came to the station to lodge the information—I did not say it was half-past 6 when the matter had occurred; I said "6 o'clock" because the girl had told me that was the time she came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of the police—about 7 o'clock on the evening of 13th October I went to the station to see the prosecutrix—she had two scars on the back of the neck as though a corrsive Huid had been thrown; they were black at the time; and there was one an the right cheek, the cuticle was removed—I examined her hat and jacket—there was some liquid on the hat, and some holes in the ribbon—the back of the hat and jacket were also discoloured, or rather the colour was removed; they were also wet and in holes—I examined the fluid; it was sulphuric acid; and I believe it was sulphuric acid on her peck and cheek—I was afterwards shown the prisoner's coat and trousers; the trousers were light grey, and on the right leg there was one spot of discoloration, and on the flap of the ticket-pocket of the coat there was some discoloration; the lining was also coloured red, and on the lower part of the front of the coat thorp were also marks of the same description; ' I tested them, on the Monday morning they were fresh stains; it was sulphuric acid.</p>

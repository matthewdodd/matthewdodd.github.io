                  </hi>. I live in St. John-street-road. The prisoner was my errand-boy—on the 30th of September I sent him on an errand, about three o'clock in the afternoon—he might have been back by five o'clock, but he did not sleep in my house—he came next morning, about half-past six o'clock—six was his usual time—I had then received information about a silver tea-spoon—the policeman was there ready, and I gave him in charge for having stolen it—he denied it—it was marked with a Roman "P.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Peart, and had charge of the plate. On Monday, the 30th of September, I missed a spoon from the hick kitchen, where I had seen it about half-past eleven o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner bad been at work that morning, and had been in the back kitchen several times—he has to go there for purposes of his work—he went to dinner at one o'clock, and returned after dinner—I informed master, just before five o'clock, that I missed the spoon—the prisoner was just going out when I began to inquire about it, and he did not return that evening.</p>

On the 30th of September, about eight o'clock at night, I met the prisoner about two miles from Mr. Peart's—he showed me a tea-spoon, and asked if I thought it was silver—I said I did not know, and asked how he got it—he said he had found it—I asked him where, but he did not tell me—he began talking about something else—I believe there was a mark at the back, but cannot tell whether there was a "P" on it, as we handle was bent back.</p>

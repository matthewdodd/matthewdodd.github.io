            . I am a constable. On Saturday, I went to Mr. Wilson's house, I looked at the place, it is a small room made for people to sat drinking, they call it a cockloft. I saw at the window that a person could come out of the one pair of stairs into that cockloft. I asked them who lived in the one pair of stairs, they told me a man and woman had quarrelled, they had gone to George alley, and they kept the key of that room. I went into George alley and found the prisoner, I asked her where her husband was she said he would be at home to breakfast, he came, and I took him in custody, I searched the room, I found a five shilling paper of half-pence in a table drawer, and nine loose one. I took the prisoner and her husband to the watchouse, I searched them I found nothing on the man, the woman gave me some halfpence out of her pockets, I searched her pockets afterwards, I found two or three more in it, that made ten, what she gave me and what I took out of her pocket. I shewed Mrs. Haswell the halfpence she owned two of them that were found on her person.

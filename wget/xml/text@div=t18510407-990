                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 8, Creek-place, Greenwich. On Friday evening, 28th Feb., I was at the White Swan, at Deptford—the prisoner was there—we drank together—I left about nine o'clock, and walked towards home—the prisoner followed me, and all of a sudden he ran his hand into my right-hand trowsers-pocket, and then struck me a very heavy blow on the side of the head, which knocked me down on the footpath—I had sixpence in silver, and three halfpence in copper, in my pocket—I know it was safe when I was in the public-house—I had taken it out in the prisoner's presence, to pay for the beer—I was perfectly sober, and remember everything that happened—I am sure it was the prisoner who knocked me down—I got up as soon as I could, and said, "You vagabond, you have robbed me;" he said, as he ran through the railway-arch, "I have only got three halfpence"—I went to the station, and gave information.</p>

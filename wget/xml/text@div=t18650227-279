               <p>B."—there was some discussion—the question was gone into on the summons, and an affidavit read in answer—Mr. Baron Bramwell then ordered the de<lb></lb>fendant to be sworn, and he was sworn—the clerk who was opposing the summons asked him, showing him this affidavit, whether the contents of that affidavit were true—he said, "Yes"—his Lordship then asked the clerk who was attending the summons if he had anything to say—he said, "No, I have not;—I can't say anything if be still persists in saying that is true"—Mr. Baron Bramwell then said, 'This becomes a very serious matter; just pay attention to me;'and he began to cross-examine the prisoner—he said, 'Where did you serve the defendant? did you serve him personally?"—he said, 'Yes, I did"—he asked him whore—he said, "In the hall"—"At what time?"—'About twenty minutes to 12"—his Lordship then said, 'I can't help it, if he still persists in saying his statement is true; you know what remedy you have got"—his Lordship asked, 'Are you sure you did not give it to a lady,' or "a female?"—he said, 'No,' but I believe after-wards he was going to say that he did—what he did say, was, 'No, I am quite sure; 'he was about to say something else, but his Lordship did not seem to go further into it, and he did not finish the sentence he was about to make.</p>

Hooper"—I believe this produced to be the paper—I sent it to my brother next morning—on 23d November, an officer of the Sheriff of Kent came to my house—I paid him a part, and gave security for the rest—I had heard that the matter was settled.—on 10th October, I called at Mr. Ashurst's as I returned in the evening to pay his bill, and his housekeeper handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 28th November, I attended at the Judges' Chambers before Mr. Baron Bramwell—the de<lb></lb>fendant was not there; at least, I did not see him—the matter was adjourned till 30th November, that he might be present—on 30th November, I again attended before the same Judge—I heard the Judge say it was a serious matter; he cautioned the boy as to what he said, and then asked him if he had seen me, and he swore that he had seen me in my hall at Kingsdown, at twenty or twenty-five minutes to 12 o'clock—the Judge asked him if I was in the room, and he pointed me out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled clerk to a solicitor at Dartford—on 10th October I saw Mr. Hooper at our office there about half-past 11—he gave me a cheque to cash; I did not cash that cheque, I cashed another one which I drew—I have the counterfoil in my possession; it was for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would call in the afternoon for the cash, which he did, about half-past 4 or quarter to 5, and I gave him the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man at Farningham—on 10th October last I remember Mr. Hooper calling on me, as near as possible about half-past ten in the morning—this receipt is my writing—it is dated 10th October, 1864; that was the day—I can't tell at what time in the day I wrote this receipt—I did not give it to Mr. Hooper myself; I gave it to my servant, and she gave it to him when he called for it—I wrote it in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said to me—he came to pay me some money; he was in a dog-cart; when he left my house he went in the direction of Dart-ford.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he sworn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I think all the parties were present when that was said—the clerk of Messrs. Walker and Bligh, who was attending on the other side, was there, and Mr. Wittey, clerk to Mr. Charles Hooper; Mr. Hooper was not present—nobody has been out of Court and told me about this conversation—I have not heard a word from any one; in fact, I do not believe that one of the witnesses who have come into Court has been out again—Mr. Charles Hooper did not come out—I have not seen him since the case came on; I wanted particularly to see him on other matters—not a soul has spoken to me—no one has mentioned to me any<lb></lb>thing that has taken place in Court this morning—I am managing clerk to Mr. Hooper—I have not had the getting up of this case—I had the manage<lb></lb>ment of the case in the Exchequer—of course I thought there was a good action; I think so now—that was not the reason for prosecuting this lad—I have not said so; quite the reverse—I have no doubt I drew the affi<lb></lb>davit for Mr. Hooper—I did not know till afterwards that he had received the writ on that day; I knew he had received the writ, but I do not con<lb></lb>sider the giving of it to him in a letter by his servant, to be a service—the Judge was told that he had received it on that day, by Mr. Hooper himself; I believe the words used by Mr. Hooper, as nearly as possible, were "On my return home in the evening between 9 and 10, Miss Godfrey gave me a letter, and in that letter was contained the writ"—I believe that was the first time I knew that he had received it that night—I was not surprised to hear Mr. Hooper say so, because I knew he bad received it; I did not take notice at what time—to the best of my recollection he had not told me when or how he received it; I knew he had received it in a letter sealed up; I did not know whether it was that night or the next morning—that was the only doubt I had—I did not inquire; I did not think it of importance; I won't be certain when I first saw the writ—I don't think Mr. Hooper showed it to me the first day he got it; I think his brother came to town some few days after, and then they showed it me together—I dare say I saw it within four or five days.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I wish to call your Lordship's attention to the Second Count of this indictment the first being clearly not sustained). It contains the words, 'And the said R. Eve shall be required to attend, &amp;c, to show cause why judgment signed in the said action and the execution issued thereon should not be set aside, on the ground that he had not been served with any writ.' I appre<lb></lb>hend that the judgment so signed, and which is intended to be set aside by Has process, is essential in this case, and should be produced. If there were no such judgment there would be no jurisdiction on the part of the Judge in Chambers—there would be no jurisdiction to issue the summons until there was a, judgment signed, and therefore that judgment ought to be produced.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I submit it is not necessary; it is a mere step in the cause: the moment the writ is issued the cause exists. The Judge, having competent jurisdiction, issues a summons; upon that summons the inquiry takes place, upon which the perjury is alleged, and it is quite unnecessary to prove the signed judg<lb></lb>ment, that is independent matter.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">How could the Judge have jurisdiction to issue the summons unless Judgment had been signed</hi>? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">We have proved that there was a unit; all I contend that toe have to prove is that there has been a summons by a Judge in the cause, and on that summons the parties have attended: the matter of that summons surely it is not necessary to prove.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">How could a person's evidence before the Judge be material, if there was no judgment to be set aside? I am of opinion it is a necessary step in the prosecution to produce the judgment: that is not done, and it seems cannot be done, therefore, unwilling as I am that a case like this should go off on a mere technical point, I must direct the Jury to acquit the prisoner.</hi>

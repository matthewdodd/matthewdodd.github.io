                  </hi>. I am a physician, of Kirkdale, Sydenham—Mrs. Ellery and I arrived at Sydenham Station on the 15th of December, having with us seven boxes—I hired a cab to convey my luggage from the station to my house—on my arrival at home one box was missing—about ten days afterwards that box was brought to me by the police, in a broken condition—all the valuable articles had been abstracted—there were various books and articles of wearing apparel, all of which have been identified—I was present when the articles were packed, and know that such articles as this chemise and flannel petticoat were put in the box—the mark on the chemise is "Ellen," that is the name of my wife—I identify distinctly this book of Moore's Poems—there is a name now in it,"Mary Ann Carey," and a leaf has been torn out that name has been inserted since I lost it.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of December I went to 8, Berner's Place, Waterloo Road, to apprehend Hog<lb></lb>wood on another charge—on searching the room I found under the bed a portmanteau—I said to him,"What is this you have here?"—he said,"That's my <hi rend="italic">petery</hi>" meaning a portmanteau; "the whole of the articles that that contains belong to this young woman;" Carey was in the room, and he was speaking of her; "they hare all been honestly bought and paid for—I said, "I shall take it away, for it is my belief it has been stolen"—Carey then said, "Do not take the whole of those, because they belong to me; you will find my name inserted in some of them"—I took the portmanteau away with the contents, and afterwards found they belonged to Dr. Ellery—Carey was afterwards taken into custody and brought to Carter Street Station—there she said, "I have a flannel petticoat and chemise, given me by Selby; I don't know anything about the other things which have been taken: if I did, I would tell you"—she mentioned the name of Selby distinctly, meaning Hogwood—I did not say they all be-longed to her—I said a few things belong to her, which I gave her.</p>

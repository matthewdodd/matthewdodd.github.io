             is my son. I lost these articles - I knew the prisoners, and on the night of the 5th of January I went to their shop; I saw them both, and asked if they had bought a cut-glass salt of a boy of mine, who had stolen it from me- they denied it, but Miller showed me a pewter inkstand, a white jar, and a blue dish, which she said she had bought of Edward Davis; she had given 2d. for the inkstand, 1d. for the jar, and I think she said 3d. for the dish - I should think the inkstand was worth 1s., the jar 3d. or 4d., and the dish 6d.; the clogs and other articles were produced by the officer at the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They both said they would give 2d.? A. Yes; I do not know the expences of a witness here - I do not expect to get any thing; I have a brother, named William - I do not know where he is; I saw him about five weeks ago - I do not know that he was tried and convicted here last Session - I never heard that; I do not know where my father is - my mother never told me; upon my oath, I do not know that he is transported - my mother never told me so; I did hear it once - I never was in any gaol myself; only one, that is Clerkenwell - I cannot exactly say when I got out; it was the second day of the Session before the last.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I advise you to be very careful how you answer me: do you mean seriously to tell me you never were in gaol but once? A. yes, Sir, never but once; I was two or three times remanded - I will swear I have not been in gaol half a dozen times; I never visited any body in gaol - the last place I saw my brother in was at home; I will not swear that - the last place I saw him at was at Clerkenwell; I did not go to see him in Newgate - I never was flogged, and was never in gaol but once; it is about four months since I heard my father was transported; I cannot exactly tell what I did with the money I got for these things; I did not, as I was going from the office, make use of an abominable expression to my mother: I did not speak to her, to my recollection - I do remember something of an expression I used to a young woman who was with my mother; I remember it, but I do not wish to say the words - I did not tell the prisoners that my mother had sent me with these things, and she was in great distress - I saw my father in Whitecrose-street about seven months ago.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 6th of January I went to the prisoner's shop; I saw Miller at the door, and said I wanted a word with her - she came in, and I asked if they had not bought some things of a boy; she said she had, the boy's mother had been there, and she had shown her this dish, this jar, and this inkstand and glass - I asked if she had bought any more things of the boy; she said No, she was sure she had not - I took out a paper which I had received from a brother officer, and said I should search her house; she then produced the clogs, the spoon, and a plate - I then asked her about a petticoat, and she called to stone, who was in the back parlour, to go and fetch it from down stairs; I followed her, and met her coming up with it, but I previously asked Miller why she had denied to the boy's mother having these other things; she said the mother never asked her about them - I then asked why she denied it to me; she said she had not bought the other things, but a friend had, and then she called to Stone- I went down, and saw a little back kitchen; I asked whose it was - Stone said it was hers; there were chairs and tin goods there - I asked whose they were; she said hers, that she had been in the public line, and these were the goods she brought away from the public-house - I asked her if she knew any thing of a saucepan, which I could not find; she said No: I told her to be careful, as Miller had said she had bought some things - she then said Miller was in the shop when the things were purchased, but she was not certain who paid the money; I came up stairs again, and told Miller she must go with me - that Stone said she was in the shop when the money was paid; I do not know what answer she made - Miller stated at the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060065"></xptr>fice that Stone was her partner, and an officer was sent for her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw no attempt at absconding? A. No; I saw Edward Davis at the office - I did not hear the expression he made use of; I believe that was when he was in custody before for robbing his mother, but she would not prosecute him; I have heard the prisoners bore a good character - they live about three hundred yards from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does Mrs. Davis keep a shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>Miller's Defence. I did not pay him for the inkstand, but I was present, and there was a poor woman came with some pamphlets, which I did not wish to purchase, but, seeing her distressed, I went to a stationer's over the way, and while I was there the boy stole one of the pamphlets.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to EDWARD DAVIS. Q. Was any pamphlet found in your pocket? A. No; I took one up, and was looking at it - I offered to pay the woman for it; it was not found in my pocket - I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled it out again; I was going to pay for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the woman see you put it into your pocket? A. Yes - I did not sell the prisoners any thing after that.</p>
               <p>Miller. I took the book from his pocket, and then I hindered him from stealing a pair of shoes; I said to my friend, "Don't suffer that boy to come to the shop again;" his mother came in the evening, and produced a list - I showed her what she asked for - I was washing the whole of the previous day, and was not present when any thing was bought but the inkstand.</p>
               <p>Stone's Defence. We were both present when the jar and inkstand were sold; there was another boy with him - the other said he was not to take 2d., but he said he would.</p>

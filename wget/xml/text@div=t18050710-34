               <p>Q. You were in a crowd you know? - A. Yes; I am confident I felt some person's hand in my pocket; I immediately turned round and caught hold of the handkerchief; I accused the prisoner of it, he put his hand behind his coat and denied it, after the handkerchief was dropped; Croswell, the officer was by, he heard me accuse the prisoner; he picked the handkerchief up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the handkerchief the officer picked up was the handkerchief that you had in your pocket? - A. Yes; it is a very remarkable silk handkerchief.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday, the 8th of June, I had been at Bow-fair, going round the fair I saw Mr. Brine take the prisoner by the collar; he charged him with picking his pocket; I searched the prisoner, he had no handkerchief about him but this; he said, it was his own; it is almost a new one; he held it in his hand; Croswell got a light from one of the gingerbread-stalls, and on the ground I picked up this handkerchief; it is a silk handkerchief; Mr. Brine said he would swear it was his; I then took the prisoner to the watch-house; and coming to town with him, I asked him if this cotton handkerchief was marked; he said, he did not know whether it was or not; I then asked him, if it was marked what the marks should be; his reply was, if it was his father's handkerchief, it would be marked P. L. and if it was his own J. L. this handkerchief is marked T. H. Birch, No. 3. in full length. (The silk handkerchief produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>- CROSWELL sworn. - In going through the fair on Saturday evening, with Gleed, I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner by the collar, saying, he would take his oath that he had picked his pocket; I called for a light, I saw Gleed pick up the silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from where the prosecutor stood? - A. About a foot and a-half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was standing at the corner of the gingerbread-stalls; this gentleman came up to me and asked me if I had seen his handkerchief; I said, no; he said, I had picked his pocket; there was a mob of people about; he came up and collar'd me; they looked on the ground and found a handkerchief, and he said it was me that took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with the prisoner in North-wharf-road, Paddington—on 18th July, about in the morning, he came home—I was standing in the street talking to a woman—he told me to go home—I went in, and went up stairs to Hobbs' room—the prisoner went into his own room, then came out and stood at the door—he did not see me—I was up stairs looking over the bannisters—Hobbs asked him what was the matter—he said there was not anything the matter, but there soon would be if he could find me—he went into his room, and I heard him say he would burn my clothes—I went and pushed open the door, and asked him not to be so silly, for when he bad had beer he did not know what he did—he told me to go out—I went out and he locked the door—I burst the door open, and took my shawl—he was sitting on the bed in the act of lighting his pipe with a candle, and he threw the candle<lb></lb>stick at me—it struck me on the head—I don't remember anything after<lb></lb>wards till I came from the hospital—it has got well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Paddington—early on Monday morning, 19th July, I was called to the prosecutrix—she had two wounds—one over the centre of the forehead, and one on the right temple—she was in a semi-comatose state, insensible from concussion of the brain—I dressed the wound, and attended her for about seven days—it was such a wound as would be caused by this candlestick—I should think it must have been thrown with force.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 340). On 4th Nov. I was at Woolwich—I know the prisoner Chalkley; he is a marine store dealer, and keeps a shop in Warwick-street, about 100 yards from the dockyard—I was not watch<lb></lb>ing his shop, no more than the regular duty—I saw the prisoner Aldous go into the shop about 6 o'clock in the evening—as soon as he entered I went to the corner of the windows—there was a gaslight in the shop—I saw a brown paper parcel in the scale—it was weighed by Chalkley, and put into a cupboard in the back part of the shop—it was a cupboard with no door to it—it was merely thrown in carelessly in the paper by Chalkley—I then saw Aldous take two metal tape from his pocket—he laid them on the counter—Chalkley came round from the other side of the counter; he picked them up, and looked at them with the gas, and he walked towards the place where he had put the paper parcel—the prisoners had been speak<lb></lb>ing to each other—I could not hear what passed—I went into the shop and asked Chalkley to let me look at the thing that this man had brought in for sale—he brought the two taps round and delivered them into my hand—I saw the mark of the broad arrow on both of them—I asked him to let the look at the other things that were brought there—he said there were no more—I told him there was; and he then went to the cupboard in which I had seen the brown paper parcel put, and he took from there a brown paper parcel and delivered it to me on the counter—it was like the one I had seen him put in—I told him the taps were marked with the broad arrow—the brown paper parcel had then been opened, it contained sheet copper—the copper was lying there—I said to Aldous, "Where did you get this from"—he said, "I found it"—I asked him where, and he made no answer—I told him I should have to take him to the station, and Chalkley must come like<lb></lb>wise, and I did so—I had known Aldous before that day—this is the copper and the taps.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was 6 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was dark—the gas was lighted in the shop—I was standing at the corner of the window—there were small articles in the window—when I went in first I asked Chalkley to let me look at the things this man had brought in for sale, and he delivered the two taps to me—he had them in his hand when I went-in—his back was not to me—he was on the other side of Aldous, two or three yards from him—he had walked two or three yards when I got in the shop round the end of the counter—he walked from the door more towards the inside of the counter—when he began to walk his back was to<lb></lb>wards Aldous—he had passed the cupboard to pass to the other side of the counter—I mean to swear the taps were in his hand, and he delivered them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270140"></xptr>
               <p>to me—I saw Aldous lay on the counter two taps of the same description as those that Chalkley gave into my hand—I was looking through the window, and I swear I could see that they were taps—I did not say a word about taps till he put them in my hand—when he gave me the taps he came round to the front of the counter—the prisoners were both together—I was in plain clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the shipwrights in Woolwich Dock-yard. These taps are Naval stores—they are marked with the broad arrow, which is impressed upon them in the usual place—this piece of copper bears the mark of the broad arrow—this is the usual mark on copper sheathing—I do not see the broad arrow on these other two pieces, but copper funnel is not usually marked on more than two places—they appear to have been all one piece originally—I can speak to this one piece as being part of the naval stores.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose you did not see this broad arrow, you would not know that these were naval stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this broad arrow is indented between two rollers—if I saw the broad arrow on that inkstand I should call that naval stores, I mean Government stores—I will swear that this is the property of the Crown—I am not aware whether the Ordnance use this mark—they might have a tap of this descrip<lb></lb>tion with a broad arrow, but there would be another mark beside—as far as my judgment is concerned, I say this is a naval store—I do not know that from anything except this mark—these are stop cocks for water closets—I have seen them used in Her Majesty's Navy.</p>

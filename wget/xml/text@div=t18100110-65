            , a paper stainer in Chiswell-street, his manufactory is in Coleman-street, Bunhill-row. On Saturday the 23rd of December I received two one pound notes of my master, I was to pay myself and another of the servants; I went home to my mother directly in Shoreditch, my father keeps a shoe shop; I asked my mother to give me change, she said she could give me change for one; I wrote my master's name on both the notes; I gave the other note to my sister to get changed, and as she was going out for that purpose she was met by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner - A. I believe the prisoner to be the man; the shop was dark, I do not speak with certainty; she met this man just by the doorway; the prisoner said he wanted to buy a pair of shoes; my sister turned back to serve, the prisoner followed her behind the counter; he was in the shop for near ten minutes, he then went out; my sister said she had lost the note and she thought the prisoner had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner buy any thing - A. I believe not. I ran out of the shop, I could not see him; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the one pound note ever been found since - I saw it in Mrs. North's hands in Holywell-lane, about an hour and a half afterwards. Before the prisoner went out of the shop a little girl came in, she informed me where he lived, I went there and waited at a small distance till he came home; I saw the prisoner come to that door, I went in the house about a minute after him; my sister was in the house, she and I taxed him with taking the note; he said he did not know what we were talking about; I told him I saw him in my father's shop, but did not go behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true - A. No; I saw him behind the counter; I told him he had taken the note from the window behind the counter, he denied it; I sent for Mr. Armstrong the officer and gave charge of him, he was taken to the watchhouse; Mr. Armstrong and I went with a pair of shoes that the prisoner had bought somewhere, he would not tell where; we found he had bought the shoes of Mrs. North in Holywell-lane; on our taking the shoes Mrs. North produced the one pound note; I knew it again, it had my master's name in my own hand writing; Mr. Armstrong has kept the note ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive from your brother on the 23d of December a one pound bank note - A. Yes; I was going to get it changed; the prisoner met me at the door way, he said he wanted a pair of shoes; I turned back; I had the one pound note in my hand, and as I was going round the counter I laid the note in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the window behind the counter - A. Yes; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100039"></xptr>prisoner followed me directly and passed the window where the note was put down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner buy any shoes - A. No; he was about ten minutes behind the counter looking at the shoes to see if any would suit him; as he was turning to go I cast my eyes in the window, I said that man has taken the note. The prisoner was only at the door, he must have heard me, I halloaed it out, my mother and all heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop - A. No. Just as the prisoner was going out a little girl was coming in; she met him, she told him where he lived; my brother and I went to where the prisoner lived in Crossby's-buildings, Curtain-road; I went into the house to wait for his coming home, my brother and brother in law were waiting out of doors a little way off; when the prisoner came in my brother followed him and taxed him about the note, he replied, nonsense, don't talk to me about any such thing; he denied having possession of the note; my brother sent for Mr. Armstrong, he was taken in custody. I saw the note at the watchhouse; Mr. Armstrong brought it and I knew it again.</p>

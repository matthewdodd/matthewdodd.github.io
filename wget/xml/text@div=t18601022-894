I am the secretary of the Provident Institution for savings, at St. Martin's-place, Charing-cross—I keep the rules and regula<lb></lb>tions of the society—a depositor when he opens an account is required under the terms of the Act of Parliament, to sign a declaration that he has no money in any other savings bank—he receives a deposit-book—this is one of the books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the original deposit-book given to George Hunter, on 31st September, 1844—the address is entered in another book—this is not the book that is signed by the depositor—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed on 31st September, 1844, by George Hunter, described as a gentleman's servant, living at Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—money was paid in by him from time to time—140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, and the other is the accu<lb></lb>mulation of interest, amounting, as far as this book goes, to 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this book is made up to the 20th May, 1854—the last deposit was on 3d June, 1850—no depositor can put in more than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 16th May, 1860, I found that the accumulation of interest made 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote to inform the depositor of it—this is the letter I wrote—it was forwarded to George Hunter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): 16th May, 1860—Sir, I beg to inform you that the deposit made in your name amounts to the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., no further interest therefore, can, by Act of Parliament, be paid on your amount un<lb></lb>less you decrease your amount under 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. You are requested to acknow<lb></lb>ledge the receipt of this letter"—the postal address is Mr. George Hunter, 10, George-yard, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—there is "Robert George Hunter" in the corner—that was done afterwards at the office—the prisoner afterwards produced that letter at the office—he attended with a friend of his of the name of Cox, a greengrocer—they both came into my room—I said, "Is your name George Hunter?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where is your book?"—he said, "I have not got it"—I asked what had become of it, and he said it had been destroyed in a fire some years ago—I asked him why he had not made an earlier application about it, and then his friend Cox immediately said, that he had received an injury upon his head, and he did not trouble himself much about his concerns, and it was on that account that he came with him—I then told the prisoner that the first step was, that he must give us formal notice of the loss of the book—I then took him to the officer whose duty it is to take a record of these matters, and he then signed the book—it is a form that we fill up—when the application is made it is signed—this is it, the name of depositor is Robert George Hunter, originally paid in as George Hunter—the date of the application, 4th June, 1860, the original address is not filled up; name of the applicant, Robert I George Hunter; address, 1, Frederick's mews—that was signed by the prisoner, "Robert George Hunter"—I saw him write it—that money paid in as by George Hunter, was paid on 4th June; the day of the application—I have no doubt the officer did not put in the address because we thought that the prisoner was the original depositor—I did not know at that time whether it was made out originally in the name of George or Robert George Hunter—I then told the prisoner that it was always our practice, when the money amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to allow them to have it immediately; but I said he must wait a week, and he came again on the following week, the 11th, with Cox—a fresh book had not been made out in the meanwhile; we waited till the depositor attended—I was directing a deposit-book to be made out when he came in with Cox—Cox looked at the manager, Mr. Robert</p>

               <p>Thompson and said, "I beg your pardon, but I think I know you very well"—Mr. Thompson did not immediately recognize him, and Cox said, "I am a greengrocer living in the neighbourhood of Connaught-square, and I have been in the habit of supplying your family with vegetables"—Mr. Thompson said, "Oh, I recollect you perfectly well"—he then said he came to make the application for this money belonging to his friend Hunter—upon which Mr. Thompson said, "I know you very well, but I know Hunter better; he occupies stables under my brother-in-law, and I am in the habit of hiring his flys, and it is only a few days since that he drove myself and family to the Crystal Palace; I have known him for some time, and what<lb></lb>ever he tells you, you may rely upon"—I then gave orders for a new deposit-book to be made out, and he was to receive the money which would have been a small amount at that time—he asked if he might not have a larger sum at once—I asked how much he required—he said he should like to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said of course he could have it; as he was so well known, he might have it at once—he was paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that sum was entered in a book as allowed without notice; a new book was given to him—he was paid by Mr. Scallon, the cashier—I sent him to the proper ledger clerk and cashier to pay him; after that Mr. Scallon came in and told me there was some difficulty about the signature of the depositor—I am not quite sure whether that was in the prisoner's presence, and then I called the prisoner and inquired how he accounted for the variation in the signature—it was signed Robert George Hunter, the name of the depositor being only George Hunter—I asked him the original address, which corresponded with that in our books—he gave me in words an address which corresponded with the original—Mr. Scallon and I then conferred together and we thought it would be much better to get the name corrected—we allowed him to correct it in the signature-book—he altered his name according to Mr. Scallon's direction, and after that he was paid the money.</p>

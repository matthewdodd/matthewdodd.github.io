I lived a short way from town for a short time, for the benefit of my health, and she was left in charge of the town house. A table-cloth was stolen - I saw it since at Muncaster's, Skinner-street, in December. On the 7th of November I told her her mistress would sleep in town next night, and to prepare her room; and at half-past ten o'clock on the 8th of November, I went home with my wife, and my apprentice informed me the prisoner had left - she never returned; I did not see her again till Monday last, when a friend stopped her, and brought her to me; I gave charge of her. My name is on the cloth at full length - it was locked up; the drawer must have been opened by a false key; I had had it some years, but it was seldom used. I think I gave 10l. for it.</p>

I met the Prisoner's Husband, who was my Ship-mate: He bade me call upon his Wife, to see if she wanted nothing in my Way, which I did. I afterwards miss'd a Piece, which I found where she had pawn'd it. The Prisoner thus made her Defence: When the Prosecutor came to my House, he was very rude, threw me upon the Bed, and swore that he would do so and so, whereof I would not let him; and then he said he would give me a Piece of Cloth to pawn, and he would spend all the Money upon me, and be merry, and do so and so; whereof he gave me the Cloth, and I pawn'd it, and we spent the Money; and then, because I would not let him do so and so, he said he would swear a Robbery against me, whereof he did. The Prosecutor was contradicted by his own Witnesses, and the Jury <rs id="t17250407-52-verdict297" type="verdictDescription">

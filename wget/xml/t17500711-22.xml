The sauce-pan was taken from my yard June 21. between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I found it again the next morning. My wife had a suspicion of the Prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood; he came the next day to clear himself. I told him, I thought he was guilty, and if he had pawned it I would fetch it out. I stopt him and sent for the keeper of Bridewell to assist me; we took him before the justice, there he acknowledged he had pawned it, also he did acknowledge the same before we got there. I went by his direction and fetched the sauce-pan.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in the Prosecutor's ground playing at skettles, they lost a sauce-pan. I went there the next morning to drink a dram, and they stopped me on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q Where is the person to whom the sauce-pan was pawned?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He would not come here without I subpoena'd him, and I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you alarmed any night - A. Yes, by the barking of the dog on the 20th of October. I heard the clock strike four, when the noise subsided.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get up at the barking of the dog. did you - A, No, I got up at six o'clock: it was then break of day only. Upon my getting up, I came out of the two pair room, where I lodged. I found my door open, the window thrown up in the area, and a pannel in the shutter cut out. I observed the area window the over night; it was fastened by a centre bar by myself. The window was thrown up; a pannel of the shutter cut out, and the shutter loose. I lost a pair of plated candlesticks, snuffers, a Stilton cheese. On coming down stairs I missed a carpet out of the room, a table-cloth from the kitchen, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Thursday the 18th of October. On the Sunday following I saw some of the things at the Giles's. I saw the prisoner Angler in custody on the the Thursday following after the robbery. He told me he understood I was the person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300032"></xptr>he had robbed; he begged me to shew him mercy; he cried, and told me voluntary, what I will tell you. I said nothing to him by way of promise or threat. He said, Mr. Sadd, I throwed your house open. I quieted your dog, but did not hurt her. I saw your parrot's cage go over. I did not molest the bird. I also laid my hand on your son; I did not hurt him, I only frightened him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your son in the house at the time - A. Yes, sleeping in the parlour. He told me what room my son slept in. He also heard, he said, a gentleman call my son up a four. I did not get up. I said my dog was in the habit of barking. I was not well; I would not get up.</p>

            , meaning the prisoner Angler, was the man that robbed the house, but he did not say what house. We went on until we came to Burton Crescent, in Bloomsbury, and when we came to Burton-street, I saw the young man he had put in possession of the goods until he came. I went down the area of an unfinished house, where the things lay. A young man was there in the vault of the area. I found a carpet covered over beds, candlesticks, and other things. I took possession of the things, and brought them away. Burrell assisted me in bringing the things to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other man - A. His name is Chipnell, a man who is not apprehended; the things are here, I have kept them ever since. After I had got the things home, I went in search of the prisoner Angler, and the house that had been broken open. On the Wednesday morning the patrole took Angler and brought him to the watchhouse. After he was locked up, I went to him and asked him what he thought of himself? He said he did not know. I asked him whether any body was with him. He said nobody. I asked him who put his hand over the child's face? he said he did himself; he said he brought the swag (meaning the things out of the house) himself, and brought them to a public house in Dean-street. Then he said, they wanted to do him out of the whole. I asked him who he meaned by they? He said, Burrell and Chipnell. That is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that Burrell did more than give you information, he supposing Angler had done wrong - A. I never heard any thing against Burrell in my life: I have known him a good while.</p>

            . I am a publican, in Dean-street. On the 20th of October Angler brought a bundle to my house, about a quarter past six in the morning. I shewed him the porter's block; instead of his putting it on the block, he put it under my window. He asked my wife to let him put it into my house. He left it there; they were fetched away when I was absent. Angler desired to leave them at my house, until he had an opportunity of taking them away.</p>
               <p>Angler. A person of the name of Jack put it on the pitching-block and ran away.</p>
               <p>Lane. Angler brought it there himself.</p>
               <p>- CHIPNELL.

Burrell is a watchman; he was not on duty that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the goods department of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. The entry on this sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made out by me—it is an entry of goods to be delivered to a person of the name of Delay, in Kent-street, Borough—when the charge for cartage and all expenses have been paid upon the goods, it is usual to enter "All paid" upon the bill—it is entered in respect to this item—it would be the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty to deliver the goods without any further charge—he would have no right to have such a bill as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his possession—we have such bills in the office; they are lying about the office, but the carmen have no right to take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Delay, of No. 226, Kent-street, Borough. I recollect receiving some skins on 13th April—I cannot swear whether the prisoner is the person who brought them; the person who came produced this sheet, and said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay—I said I could not pay without a bill—he objected, and said that was his demand—he said he had no bill—I said I would not pay without—he then pulled a roll out of his pocket, and filled it up with my blue ink; he also signed it, "G. D."—I then paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept the receipt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police, at the Brick-lane goods station of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On 26th April I took the prisoner into custody—I told him that he must consider himself in custody on a charge of obtaining 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Delay, under false pretences—he said that he had the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but he could not tell what he had done with it—I searched him at the police station, but previous to doing so, he gave up these papers—he said they were given to him by his mate on the previous week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you took him into custody he handed you this bundle of papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not; he gave me a few of them, but the bulk of them he gave me afterwards—there are twenty-nine altogether.</p>

               <p>paid—in the ordinary course of business he would not have to account to me for anything with respect to those goods; he did not do so—I should say that this receipt is the prisoner's writing—he had no right whatever to interfere with those blank forms, or to fill in any sums—the tickets are given out to the carman with the sums in them—he merely has to sign them on receiving the money.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; on the 7th of December, I was robbed of a silver watch, in <placeName id="t17830115-48-crimeloc276">Newtoner's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Court. In what way did she pick your pocket? - While I was laying on the bed with her.</p>
               <p>Could not you have stopped her, when you found she was picking your pocket? - I did not find it.</p>
               <p>Did she take your watch too? - No, the other brought the brandy hot, and she took me to her room; she said, she would help me to the other, and get my money again if she could: then I went to her room, and lay on the bed with her; and she took my watch out of my pocket, and handed it to another that was at the feet of the bed; and the other woman that she gave the watch to, went away; then I went down and called the watchman; I charged him with Pass; and then the prisoner Davis came up to her room, and they were both taken to the watch-house. I never had my watch again.</p>

               <p>I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. These are two separate larcenies; if the prisoners had been both in the room, it might have been presumed that they were both concerned in the business; but they cannot be principals to any larcenies when they were not present: now you see by his account, he was robbed by each separately. You cannot find them guilty on this indictment; but you may find either of them guilty, and acquit the other.</p>

At half-past five o'clock on Friday, the 14th July, I was in the pen-fields in Hillingdon parish—the prisoner came up behind me on the footpath—I looked back, and did not take any notice of her—she began pulling me about, and feeling me about the pockets—she went about five more yards and turned back—I kept on the</p>

About half-past five o'clock in the evening of the 14th of July, I was in Dr. Bedell's premises near where the prosecutor was walking—I saw the prisoner come running down the hedge, and she met a young man, and said "Look you here, you b—y b—; had you stuck to me, we could have <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> him before; I <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> him without his flinching a b—y inch"—she had some money in her hand—I had not seen the prosecutor before that, and had not seen the prisoner do anything to him—about two minutes after I saw the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost any money.</p>

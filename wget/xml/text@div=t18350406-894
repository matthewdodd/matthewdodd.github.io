                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Waltham Abbey. Perry was in my service for about six weeks—he had to drive the hay to London, three times a week—he scarcely did any thing else—on the 12th of March, he, with a man, went with a load of clover hay—he left my place about three o'clock in the morning—he did not return—I afterwards saw some hay, which I have no doubt, was mine—I suppose there were thirty pounds, or more—I do not know the other prisoner.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live in Green-street. I stood at my door, and about 200 yards from where the robbery was committed, and saw the prisoner running in a direction from the London Apprentice. I stopped him - we both fell and I held him till the prosecutor came up. He was the first who was running.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I had been to Shoreditch with a little girl, and by Crown-street I saw him take the watch out of the prosecutor's pocket, he ran by me with it, and I followed him calling, Stop thief! he was stopped opposite a green grocer's shop. I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said that he had a white coat on - A. Yes he had, and so had the man who was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry and followed the people. A man took me and I said I was pursuing them.</p>

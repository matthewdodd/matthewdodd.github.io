               <p>Mrs. SUSANNAH BOYLE. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 2nd of November last the prisoner came into our service, at 14 l. per annum wages. Up to the 27th of February she conducted herself to my satisfaction. She asked permission to leave the house on the 25th, for medical advice. On Wednesday, the 27th of February, about half-past ten in the morning, I left the house with my nursery-maid and the children - leaving Eden, (the house-maid) and prisoner in the house. I returned ten minutes before twelve - found the closet locked - on unlocking it I looked for a tea-spoon, but could find none, and called for Eden, the house-maid. The prisoner was not in the house; and I saw no more of her. She had given me no intimation of her leaving. The table-spoons were also gone from the closet. I went up stairs to a drawer, where part of the plate was kept, and found the lock disorded and a key broken in it. In the after-part of the day I missed the two pelisses, a shawl, a scarf, a pair of stays, and the other articles stated in the indictment. They are worth 25 l. I had some things at the mangle, and sent orders that they should not be delivered to her if she called.</p>

            . I am house-maid to Mr. Boyle. The prisoner was also servant there. I occasionally fetched water from St. John-street. On the 27th of February, about a half-past ten or nearer eleven o'clock, she asked me if I was going for water - only she and I were in the house. She wished me to fetch the water, and get her a watch ribbon. I asked what sort - she said she would leave it to me choice. I washed up the tea things and she assisted me to put them in a closet in the dining-room, which is close to the kitchen. The plate in common use was kept in that closet - there were table and tea spoons, a silver mug, wine strainer, fish knife, a butter knife, four salt spoons, and desert spoons, there at that time. She went down and cleaned her boots and put them on, saying, that her feet ached with the shoes she had on. She only spoke once about my getting the water, I should have gone at that time if she had not spoken. She folded the clothes for me to take to the mangle - and told me to take them, and tell the women to do them directly; and that I would call for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her work - A. She intended cleaning her kitchen, and the bed-room. I went out about eleven o'clock, and had not the least idea of her leaving. The key was in the cupboard door, and every thing safe when I went out. I returned in about twenty-five minutes - she was gone and never returned. - Mistress came home in about ten minutes, and asked me for a tea spoon. I said they were all in the closet, and on looking, all the plate was gone. I went up into my own room, and missed the property stated in the indictment as mine (enumerating them), which were all safe when I left the house. The prisoner's box was also gone. I saw my things again last Tuesday - they have been brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you went for water were you not going to buy some for fur yourself - and I asked you to buy me a watch ribbon - A. Yes, I was to buy her ribbon at the same time.</p>

            . I live in West-street, Smithfield. On the 27th of February, about eleven or a quarter past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my house; she knocked at my mother's door, and asked for a person named Jones; my mother went to her; I afterwards saw her; she begged the favour to leave a box which she had with her; I gave her leave. She asked if it would be safe; I said</p>
               <p>"If you do not think it safe, do not leave it." She said she had had words with her mistress, and had left her place, and was going back to settle with her; that she could not go out in that condition, and pulled out of her box a black gown and spencer, and put them on, and went away. She went out first without changing her dress, and then changed it, and my husband took away the box with her. She gave me a red whittle and an old cap instead of money, saying that her mistress had not paid her in small change. Next morning I went with these things to Mr. Boyle, and stated what I knew.</p>

She asked if I knew her; I hesitated, and he said she came to give herself up to justice. I asked her a few questions, and put her to bed with two other women. She said she should say nothing till she had seen Mr. Williams or Mr. Boyle, and intimated a wish to see them. I knew of this matter from hand-bills which had been left with me. She was genteelly dressed, and had this pelisse and shawl on. I brought Mr. Boyle to her next morning.</p>

I am the wife of John Jeffries, a law-writer, and live with him at 22, Cumberland Street—I have known the prisoner two years this last August—on 26th November, at 6 o'clock in the evening, he came to my house; he knocked twice before I heard him—I only heard the third knock; I then opened the door to him; I said "What do you want here!"—he said "You"—I said "You will not get me, you have no business here—he called a young man, gave him threepence, and said "I shall not be</p>

               <p>long"—the young man went away—I should not know him again—my street door is close by the room door, and the prisoner put his foot between the doors as he gave the young man the threepence—I used rather a vulgar expression in my excitement, and said "You had better take your <hi rend="italic">hook</hi>, you have caused enough misery here; I don't want you here after me"—he walked into my room and shut the door after him; he looked round the room and said "This is very comfortable, very comfortable indeed, and I have nowhere to go"—he then said "You have got to come out with me"—I said "I am sure I shall not, I expect my husband home every minute;" with that he pulled a revolver out and said "Come out or die here, which you like, for die to-night you will"—he put the pistol to my head—I put on my bonnet and tried to escape by the bedroom door, he heard me turn the key, and said "You don't get out that way, you will never slip me again"—he pulled the pistol out again and said "I have a great mind to do it as you stand now, if you defy me I will"—I said "Oh! pray don't shoot me, I am sure I am not prepared to die"—he said "Then come out, or I will shoot you;" and under that threat I went out—I told him I expected my husband in to supper—he said He will never have another supper here—I went out with him round to a beerhouse; I sat there crying; he called for a pint of ale and wished me to drink; I did not want to drink; his pistol was out again directly—we stayed there about three-quarters of an hour; he would not allow me to go home—I was praying to go home to get my husband's supper; he would not allow me to do so—we came out together and walked from Goodge Street into Tottenham Court Road and went into another public-house; he would not let me leave him a step; the pistol was then in his coat pocket, just inside, and he kept shifting it from one pocket to another pocket—I was crying most hysterically in this public-house, and I kept saying out loud, thinking the landlord would notice what I said, "Will you unload that pistol; pray unload that pistol?"—the prisoner laughed and said "Yes, I will unload it directly, through your head when I do unload it; you had better behave yourself, if you do you shall stay till 12 o'clock, you shall live till 12 o'clock; if not, you will go at once, as I mean to do for you, the old man, and myself to-night"—the land<lb></lb>lord ordered us out; he would not go till he made me walk first—I said something to the landlord when we got outside; the prisoner did not hear it; he asked me what I was whispering about, I said "Not anything much"—he said "If I thought you had told him what I had got you would have it directly"—he said to me "Come to the corner of Windmill Street with me, and I will give you up the pistol to your possession"—I went with him, and when we got there he laughed at me when I asked him for the pistol—there were two Life Guardsmen there, he spoke to them and called for a quart of beer, and they drank it with him—that was at a public-house at the corner of Windmill Street—I went with him there; he demanded me to go wherever he went—I said to the Life Guardsmen "Well, gentle<lb></lb>men, you are soldiers, this man has got a loaded pistol in his pocket, will you be kind enough to protect me?"—they said "I suppose it is a love affair; you are his wife?"—I said "No, sir, I have got a good kind husband at home, and I want to get home to get his supper"—I pulled his coat on one side and they could see the butt-end of the pistol, and one soldier said to the other "He has got a pistol</p>

               <p>there," and the other one said "Let us see what you have got?"—the prisoner said "I can let you see my fist, and if that is not sufficient I can let you have a bit of metal"—I believe those were the words—the land<lb></lb>lord then ordered him out; we walked from there back towards the police-station, and when I got there I walked backwards into the station; the prisoner was standing looking at me at the time, and I expected he would shoot me as I went in—I spoke to the inspector, and explained everything to him; a constable in uniform came out with me, the prisoner was then gone—the inspector told me something and I went home, that was about 9 o'clock as near as possible; I found that my husband was not at home and I went to the Old King's Head opposite, where he generally goes to get a glass of beer for his supper;—I said to my husband, "I have seen that fellow again," and as my husband was coming out at one door the prisoner came out at the next compartment following him; I caught hold of my husband, and said, "Don't speak to him, pray don't, he has got a loaded revolver, and he has pointed it at my head such a many times to<lb></lb>night;" the prisoner laughed and said to my husband, "Well, Mr. Jeffries, how are you, I should like to shake hands with you"—my husband said, "You go away, you are no man to follow my wife about and frighten her as you do," and he said to me, "Come inside, Jane"—I went inside with my husband, the prisoner followed us in; he said, "I am going to Colchester to<lb></lb>morrow, I have enlisted to-day"—my husband said, "I don't know so much about that, for the first constable I see, I shall give you into custody"—the prisoner had got the pistol then in the waist of his trowsers, and he pulled it out and fired at my husband without a word; my husband said, "He has shot me"—the prisoner waited close on a minute and then he fired again; finding my husband did not fall, he levelled the pistol straight at my hus<lb></lb>band's head; at the second shot I laid hold of his hand and knocked his hand on one side, and made the shot go on one side; he fired, and as he fired I knocked his hand on one side, and the shot went to the right; I laid hold of the pistol, and he tried his hardest to bend his hand down and put the muzzle to my head—I held it straight up in his hand—I had got my two hands on it, and in our struggle he turned me from one corner about four or five feet; I still kept hold of the pistol, and hearing a crowd outside, I called out, "Won't some one come, I can't hold on much longer"—two young men rushed in, one laid hold of him by the wrist—I can't tell whether I gave the other one the pistol or not, but it was taken from him—I don't know what the prisoner said—my husband was taken to the hospital <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had seen you on the Monday afternoon, the 25th, the day before this—I met you accidentally in Tottenham Court Road—I was not walking with a young man, you saw me speak to a young man in the Euston Road, a cousin who used to come to Mr. Cole's shop, he did not speak three words to me—whether he got on a bus or not I could not tell—I tried to pass you, and you said, "I have come from the Isle of Wight to see you, you need not think to pass me like that since you have got up in the world"—I did not tell you the young man was a particular friend of mine, and that I did not intend to give him up—I did not say that he knew nothing of me as yet, but at Christmas he might, as he was going to buy me a diamond ring, which I should have to take care to hide from the old man—I said nothing of the kind—I don't think you asked me why I did not keep to my husband, and not go with</p>

               <p>other men—why have you followed me in the manner you have done if you wish mo to keep to my husband—I do not remember saying it was no business of yours, and that I should have who I liked—I think if I said that I should be bound to remember such a thing—I went with you to the City Road that night, I was bound to go because you always followed me about—you have been to my house in the dead of the night—I went with you on the Monday night, I was bound to follow you, as I have always been bound to do since I have been a married, woman, or else have you come to the house—I went into Mrs. Jordan's—I tried to get away from you think<lb></lb>ing you would go away, but you waited outside the door and came and knocked and asked me if I was not coming out, and I said to Mrs. Jordan, "It is no good, I shall never get rid of him till I give him some money again as usual"—I tried my utmost to get away from you, I did not stay there with you till half-past 12 o'clock, I jumped into a hansom to get away from you, and you caught sight of my dress as I got into the cab, and you jumped into the cab while it was going on—as we were going along, I said, "Will you allow me to go home"—you said, "I have got no money, and you don't go home till you give me some"—I gave you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the cab, and you allowed me to get out, and I went straight home and told my husband what had occurred—it was not 1 o'clock when I left you, I was frightened of you knowing where 1 lived—you shot my first husband dead—I did not ask you to come next day at 3 o'clock—I had too great a horror of your knowing where I lived to think of such a thing—you did not come and whistle, I never knew that you could whistle—I did not jump up and come to the street door and say, "Come in"—you did not come in and sit with me in front of the fire—I did not take a fancy to your purse, nor did you give it me—I never saw your purse—I think I told you that my husband had been suffering with rheumatics, that was in the evening when I wanted to get home—I did not show you my knee covered with flannel—I showed you my hands where I had rheumatism, and I said, "Keeping me out in this wet won't improve it"—I did not say to you "You cannot pass from this door because my husband has got the key and he can come in at any moment, we will go to the bedroom"—you did not pull off your coat, nor did I say, "Don't be careless, keep your coat on"—I tried to escape out of the bedroom door and you followed me and said "No, you don't escape me any more"—we did not remain in the bedroom 20 minutes—I did not tell you to wait for me at the corner of the street—I did go out with you under your threat of shooting me in my own room if I did not—it was not as we were standing in the house having a glass of ale that I saw the muzzle of the pistol in your pocket, the first time I saw it was in my parlour, and you pointed it at my head several times—you did not tell the Lifeguardsmen that you had a pistol—I can't say that you were sober—when we went into the last house you were not so sober as you were when you first came to my house, because you drank several pints of ale to yourself—I did not drink anything but one glass of ale—you insisted on my drinking with you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law writer and live at 22, Cumberland Street, Tottenham Court Road—the last witness is my wife—on Tuesday evening, 26th November, I was at the Old King's Head, in Cumberland Street, about 9.15; the prisoner came in while I was there—I knew him by sight only, I had never spoken to him—he looked very hard at me, but I did not want to know him, and I went out and into another compartment to avoid him—I spoke to the landlady—my wife had not arrived then—I went outside and met her—the prisoner came out as well—nothing passed between me and my wife in his hearing—he came up and said "How do you do, Mr. Jeffries?" I said "I want nothing to do with you"—he said "I am going to Colchester to-morrow morning for a soldier"—this was just inside the public-house—I pulled my wife in there for protection sake—I said "I don't know so much about your going to Colchester, for the first policeman I see I shall give you in charge;" he then deliberately took out this revolver and levelled it at me and fired—he fired twice—I think he took it out from his left-hand pocket, he had been fumbling about there for some time, and he fired it from his right-hand—he might have been perhaps three yards from me when he fired the first shot, perhaps not quite so far—the bullet hit the button in front of my trousers and glided off on to the floor—the button struck my stomach—the bullet went through my greatcoat and there is the hole now—when he fired my wife seized his hand, but he managed to fire a second time; the pistol was directed at me, but she just managed to shake it off, and the bullet fell on the ground close by where I was standing—it must have hit the partition, I suppose—the prisoner did not say a word when he fired the two shots—my wife kept hold of his hand all the time, struggling with him till assistance came in—I believe the revolve was taken from him, but I was so excited after being struck—I walked to the hospital with one of the constables, and a surgeon examined me—it was not necessary for me to remain there—there was a bruise on my stomach—this man has been trying to take my wife's character away, but she has been a good wife to.</p>

I worship every hair that grows on her head; and if he has got a wound, she has led me to do it"—I then entered the charge of shoot<lb></lb>ing, with intent to murder, and read it over to him, and he replied "That's a lie"—he was not sober, he was unsteady in his walk, and also thick in his speech—I examined the revolver—it has six chambers, five had been loaded, two had been discharged—three then contained full ball-cartridges—I produce them—it is a self-acting revolver—the cartridges found on the prisoner are ball-cartridges of the same description, and they fit the pistol.</p>

After the prisoner was taken into custody, I made a search in the Old King's Head, and found two bullets, which I produce—one I found about 12 inches from the partition, and the other three feet, on the floor—they are the same class of bullets as the others.</p>

The day after the prisoner was in custody, I went to the Old King's Head, and made a search to see if I could find any marks of bullets—I found two marks on the partition, apparently bullet marks, one three feet from the floor; it was a very slight indentation; it might be accounted for by the bounding of the bullet; the second mark was 13 inches from the floor—that appeared more like a bullet mark—there was also a fresh Mrrk on the ceiling—it had the appearance as if something had hit the ceiling, and bounded from the ceiling on to the partition—the ceiling is about 12 feet from the floor—I measured the place where this matter occurred, the partition is 11 feet 6—that is the space in front of the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on Tuesday night, 26th November, about 9.45, Jeffries was brought there—I examined him; I saw the hole in his coat—I found a contusion on his stomach about the size of a sixpence, just below the navel; it was the kind of mark I should expect to find if a bullet had struck a button there; it was in a very dangerous place—a bullet fired at 9 or 11 feet distance and entering the stomach there would in all probability have caused death—it was not necessary to treat him surgically; he was able to walk away.</p>

The prisoner was employed by me as a charwoman, but had no authority to pledge any articles in my house—I had my wife at the hospital with a broken arm—the prisoner attended at my house in consequence of my wife's absence—I missed my trowsers and waistcoat on Sunday morning the 25th of June—when I gave the prisoner into custody, she contended most strongly that I had given her authority to pawn the articles—that is not true—I missed a bolster, and some other things—I have found nothing in pledge but the trowsers, waistcoat, and holster—I had a few things in pledge by my act, but none of these articles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Blackfriars-road.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I used to pledge them every week for him. He said, "I have no money, take these white trowsers, and get a shilling on them"—I could get but ninepence. I bought tea, sugar, and other things. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She bad to buy but very little; I generally bought the things myself, and I never left her without a shilling or two on the mantel-shelf. On the day that she says I needed money, she borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the landlord of the house on my account, which she could always do; she was supplied with greengrocery by the landlord, and the baker's bill was paid by the family. I most solemnly declare she has on no occasion had to provide for me with her Own money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said, while you was at breakfast, "Take my waistcoat, and get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, my salary is regular, and I have no necessity. I never missed these trowsers before: my hours of business are very heavy—fifteen hours a-day. On one or two occasions, when I looked into my box, it appeared to be full, and the trowsers and waistcoat were there; but after my attention was excited by the prisoner's absence, and deserting any child that she had to wean, I looked in the box, and found it was piled up with rags, most artificially. I never kept rags in that place, nor did my wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Your children are running about without shoes or stockings, or a bed to lie on; and he sent me to pledge these things; I bought a breast of mutton; I made things, and went to the hospital to his wife; he was out</p>

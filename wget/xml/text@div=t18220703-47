We had come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030024"></xptr>out of Leicestershire about a month before; he was living at his father's, and I at mine, in York-street, Westminster. I was to meet him in the park by appointment; he was going into the Infirmary. I was never in the park before of a night, but was there once in the day-time. He came to meet me, as my father and he had had words, and he did not like to come there; we were to meet a little before eleven o'clock. As I was walking along, a man dressed like a soldier, and the prisoner, came out from under some trees; the prisoner had a dark frock on; they both took hold of me, and said nothing, but dragged me under the trees; I cried out Murder! as loud as I could several times. They stopped me about four yards from the trees. Neither of them said anything; but when they got me under the trees, the soldier robbed me of the shawl off my neck, and cut my pocket from my side; there was nothing but a small pen-knife and a key in it. The soldier then said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"We are two comrades;" and the prisoner said to him,</p>
               <p>"You be off," and the soldier immediately ran away across the park, and the prisoner went about twenty yards from me and changed his dress; he put on a white smock-frock. I continued making an alarm, and two gentlemen came up and took him, while he was putting his arm into the frock. I was laying on the ground and could not get up, they hurt me so; they dragged me on the ground; they had pulled me down. The prisoner used me worse than the soldier, by dragging me about, which hurt my side very much; and when the gentlemen held me up I fell down again, from the hurt I received and the fright together; they said nothing to me; I had never seen either of them before. My bonnet came off with their dragging me. The prisoner's other dress laid on the ground; he tried to take it up, when the gentlemen came up and secured him. I am sure he is the man. He took nothing from me, but the soldier did; here is the gown I had on at the time (producing it); it is torn, and all green with the grass.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Adam-street. I was coming through the Park, just by the new monument, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, and heard a woman scream Murder! several times; the voice came from under some trees near the milk-house. I was alarmed, and did not like to go alone; but a gentleman came up soon after, and ran with me; I got up to the woman first, and did not see any more of the gentleman. Just as I was making up to her, she was coming out of the grove of trees, with her hair all down, and her bonnet in her hand, and said she had been robbed by a soldier and another man. I looked round and saw a man in white, about ten yards from her; I thought it was a woman, and said,</p>
               <p>"What woman is that with you;" she said it was a man. I went up to him (it was the prisoner), and asked why he did not help the woman while she was crying out murder; he said it was nothing to him, but her calling out murder had caused him to lose his money. Directly she came up she said he was one of the men who had robbed her; he had not got his frock completely on, and had a loose bundle laying before him; he took it up loose as it was, and ran towards Piccadilly gate. I and the prosecutrix ran after him, and Dawson met him and secured him. The woman was not able to run, so I took her by the hand.</p>

            . I was in the park; I heard the woman cry out Murder! and saw the prisoner running, and these two running after him. I ran across and secured him. I brought him into Piccadilly. Howlett and the prosecutrix came up, and she said that was the man who helped to rob her.</p>
               <p>JOHN WORMWOOD. I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. The soldier cannot be found. The prisoner's bundle was brought to the watch-house; it is a black smockfrock and two soldier's jackets. I do not know that he is a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday evening I was enquiring for a lodging about a quarter past nine o'clock. I bought this new frock and jacket, having had money given me to go into the country. I had a 1 l. note from the Royal Hotel. I inquired for lodgings about Westminster, and the last place I enquired at was about forty yards from the Park; and as I could get none, and thinking that if I travelled on the road with the bundle I might be stopped for stealing it, I determined to sleep in the Park, and took off my frock, and in came a young woman (the prosecutrix) arm-in-arm with a soldier. They looked at me, and I did not wonder at it, as it might look suspicious to see me changing my clothes. Directly after I saw her sitting down with a stout man; she directly called out Master, master! and I thought to myself, if I go to assist her, I shall get abused and insulted, and perhaps robbed of my clothes. Well, he kept scrambling with her for five minutes, then got up, and came by me swearing, and she calling after him; he had a brown coat and light breeches on, and appeared a smith, or something of the kind. Directly after that, a soldier came up and asked what was the matter, and she told him her case; he spoke kindly to her, and asked her all about it. He laid down by her for two or three minutes; they then got up and came near me, and looked at me; then the soldier said,</p>
               <p>"Ah! Yorkshire, what country." I said I did not know what country I came from. The prosecutrix had hold of his hand, and she had something in her hand - he was taking it from her. She said,</p>
               <p>"It is mine" - and he said it was his. She said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you take my part;" I said,</p>
               <p>"What do I know about it - how am I to know which is right." Well, he went behind her, took her under the arms, and dragged her round, but did not hurt her; he then took her bonnet, and set off; she said to me,</p>
               <p>"You are no man, or you would take a woman's part;" I said I should get into trouble if I did - I was sorry to see her ill-treated, but he was a man of more strength than me. Well, she grumbled at me and went on. I took up my things and went a few yards into the trees; she followed up to me. This young man came up, and she told him I would not take her part; then another man came up, and two or three more; they began to search me, and I said I should lose my money. Then they said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the woman's handkerchief or shawl?" They began to hawl my things over, and took hold of me. I said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go to the light." A sergeant came, and the girl said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a deserter - here is his jacket and waistcoat." Well, they determined to take me before a watchman, and met one, who said he would have nothing to do in it. They took me to the same public-house where I had enquired for a lodging, and the landlord and landlady both said I had been there about a lodging. I told them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030025"></xptr>to search me there - they would not. At last they met another watchman, who took me in charge. The young man threatened me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You bl - y rogue, I will pay you;" I said I had injured nobody, and the innocent had nothing to fear. Well, they took me to a watch-house; several people bolted in after me - they laid very heavy charges against me, and called me a Methodist, and things of that sort. The beadle searched me at the watch-house, and found nothing on me but my money, which they counted before me, and said if I spoke a word they would strike and beat me. They locked me down stairs without a drop of water, and when the girl came to have her trial, she had another gown on.</p>

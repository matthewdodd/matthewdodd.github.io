It appeared, That Mr. Oliphant and his Wife coming over Stepny-fields, the deceased, being in drink, did abuse Mrs. Oliphant, and Mr. Oliphant asked the deceased why he did so? he replied, what do you think much of it, and endeavoured to strike at Mr. Oliphant; and Mr. Oliphant endeavouring to defend himself, there came a great Dog and flew at him and tore his waistcoat; but being parted they went each about their business. The deceased turned back again, and pursued after the Prisoner; then the Prisoner flew out of his Wife's Arm, and they went to fighting again; and they being both upon the Ground the Prisoner killed him with a Penknife. Then the Jury having considered the whole matter, that what the Prisoner did was in his own defence, they brought him in <rs id="t16950828-15-verdict84" type="verdictDescription">

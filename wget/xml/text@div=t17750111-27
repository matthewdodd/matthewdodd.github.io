There were four of us in the coach, two men came up to the coach, I first saw a man on the side of the coach my daughter was on, she let down her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110014"></xptr> glass immediately, while my attention was engaged to that side of the coach, another man broke the glass on my side; then they both opened the doors and came in, and demanded our purses; we all gave them our purses, I told the man that came in second, that we had given our purses already, to the other man he swore an oath, and struck me on the left side of my head, I felt the blow, but I leaned my head back in such a manner, as to prevent a great deal of the violence of the blow; then the same man, with his left fist, struck me a very violent blow on the right eye, and at the time he struck me on this eye, he gave this little girl a violent blow upon the temple, he threw his hand back, and struck her, she fell back stunned, I thought she was dead, the child was all bloody; then he demanded our watches, I told him we had none, he threatened very violently and struck me several blows with the pistol upon the face, I avoided the blows as much as I could, but yet I felt them, then he struck me with his fist on the right eye. He searched my pockets, and my little girls pockets, and often threatened to blow our brains out, we begged for mercy and pity, my daughters begged him to spare their mamma, he threatened to blow their brains out if they spoke a word, he went out and came in twice, at the second time of coming into the coach he took off my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea of the persons of the men?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Greme. No I have not, I was very much terrified.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Greme. It was moon light, it was pretty light.</p>

            . I was in the coach with my mama. They took my watch and my cloak, the man that was on my side the coach, and he threatened to blow my brains out, when I begged mercy of them; they opened both doors, and one came in at each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they step upon the coach, or get entirely into it?</p>
               <p>Miss Greme. They got quite into the coach, one of them, when he went to search my aunts fingers for rings, when he turned about, he was almost in my lap, they felt our hands for rings, we told them we had none, we were in mourning, it was light enough for them to see that we were in mourning. I saw the man strike my mamma three blows, I begged him to spare my mama, the man that was with me, said to him,</p>
               <p>"Be quiet John, get out," or to that effect, but the other did not pay any attention to it; they took away our cloaks.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was it, that you say was almost in your lap?</p>
               <p>Miss Greme. I think he was a small man. One had a crape over his face, the other had something over part of his face, they were a long while with us, they once bid the coachman drive on, but then they bid him stop, and they came into the coach again; they were a long time with the footman for his wacth, he told them he had no watch, no more he had; they took my cloak and my watch, I gave them my purse the instant they came in.</p>

            . I was with my mistress on the 13th of December, when she was robbed. As we were going on these people stopt the coach at about a quarter after Eve to the best of my knowledge there were four; they opened the coach doors, and went in and desired my ladies to give them what they had. I heard an outcry in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations upon the persons or dress of the men, and was it light enough to distinguish their faces.</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes, I could see they had some black crape over their faces, when they went into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they go first into the coach?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I cant tell when they went into the coach first.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the other two men do?</p>
               <p>Allpress. One was with me behind the coach, he had a hanger; the other man was at the head of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any arms?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lightish, or very dark, or how?</p>
               <p>Allpress. I could see plain enough,</p>
               <p>Q. What size men were they that went into the coach?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They were the size of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Allpress. I believe so, because of the size.</p>
               <p>Q. Your belief is founded only upon the size?</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was dressed?</p>
               <p>Allpress. That I could not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish whether he had his own hair or a wig?</p>
               <p>Allpress. He had his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Had both that went into the coach their own hair?</p>
               <p>Allpress. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stay in the coach till they had taken all the things away, or did they go in and out?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They went into the coach two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two men that had been in the coach, did they go away directly?</p>
               <p>Allpress. They came to me and bid me give them my watch and money. I had no watch. One of them had a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them take any thing out of the coach?</p>

            . I saw the hanger in the prisoner's hand on the 28th at night. I saw him with it at Cow Cross about seven in the evening. The prisoner and one Hunt had broke my windows; a school boy came up and told me they were coming up again, and the prisoner

             the hanger and struck the boy twice with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dinmore) What time was he taken.</p>
               <p>Dinmore. The same night.</p>
               <p>Hartrey. Dinmore came to me and I told him which way he was gone, and he went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110016"></xptr> took him; they came and told me he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you can't speak to the hanger?</p>
               <p>Hartrey. I saw a hanger: I can't speak to it particularly; I keep a chandler's shop; a girl came running into my shop, followed by the prisoner and one Hunt, she said they wanted her to go to Black Boy Alley, and insisted upon lying with her: she is a daughter of my next door neighbour, and is but thirteen years old. They came into the house and insisted on having the girl out; I struggled with them; I got Thomas to the door and gave him a fall; immediately as I had got the door fast Hunt dashed a pistol thro' the window with such violence, that he broke the sash frame and he broke his pistol, the lock stuck in a butter tub that was standing in the window and two pieces of the barrel and a piece of the lock lay by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Dinmore. Brown gave me the butt end of the pistol and the hanger.</p>
               <p>Halliburton. Here is the appearance of a piece of glass in the butt end of this pistol that is produced.</p>

            . I have here the remaining part of the pistol; I had it from Mrs. Hartrey at Lydia Hall's house, that is her maiden name, her married name is Brown.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. My Lord, the jury are in doubt. if this should be the same pistol, whether the glass that appears in the butt end of it, is the glass of the coach or of Mrs. Hartrey's window.</p>

            . Yes, I told him he was; he desired I would come away immediately, for he was in Cow Cross with a drawn hanger and a pistol. I called up Mr. Dinmore, and we went to Cow Cross: he was not there; I went into a public-house, the Marquis of Granby's heads in Chick-Lane; I saw the prisoner standing at the fire; I went out and called Dinmore, we went in, and we met the prisoner in the passage coming out: he had this pocket pistol (producing it) in his hand; he held it partly behind him, I seized him, and pushed him up against the wall, then he dropped the pistol, and Dinmore took it up. The pistol was loaded with a piece of lead, rolled up and chewed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Barnard's-inn. I lost a pencil-case and a spoon from my rooms, and I noticed that a piece of cloth I had in my place was considerably shorter than it ought to have been—the prisoner had no access to my rooms by my permission—I knew her by sight—she used to attend to Mr. Tims's rooms, which are above mine—that would lead her to pass my door, and she has come down once or twice, and inquired for Ransome, my laundress—part of the duplicates of these things were found on Ransome, (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 552,) and the others on the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 2d of January I was in Mr. Slater's service, and was left at home; about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, the bell rang; it was then quite dark, and I was alone in the house - I went into the area, and saw the two prisoners standing at the door; they asked if Mr. Slater was at home - I told them, No; they said they wanted to see him, that they had come from Brighton, and asked if they could wait till he came in - I went up and opened the door - Stevens walked into the passage, and said he must write a note, or wait till Mr. Slater came in - he asked me for a pen and ink - I said it was locked up in the counting-house; he asked Wilson for a pencil, which he gave him - he then asked me for a bit of paper - I said I had none; the prisoners then both walked down into the kitchen - I had two lighted candles there - Stevens pulled off his hat, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to tell you, but we are come to rob the house" - be then took his hat, and a candle off the dresser, and went up stairs - I saw no more of him - Wilson remained down stairs with me, and told me to sit down, and make my life happy; and said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't make any alarm, we shan't hurt you, we don't intend to do it; but if you make any alarm, we have things about us that will do it, and we shall do it" - he then laid a pistol on the table - I sat in a chair, and remained quiet; he sat on a chair on the opposite side of the table; he asked me where Mr. Slater kept his money - I said I believed he carried it about with him; he said they only wanted the money, and asked if the doors up stairs were locked - I said Yes; he said I had better give him the keys - I said I had not got them; and he said he supposed they were in the door then - we sat talking, and about eight o'clock I heard the bell ring; he asked me what bell it was - I told him it was my bell - he then took the pistol off the table, and went out of the kitchen with it - I saw no more of him; the bell only rang once - Stevens was up stairs all this time, and had a candle with him, and I heard the doors being broken open - I went up stairs, when my master came in, and found the counting-house door broken open - the counting-house is at the bottom of the shop, and is part of the dwelling-house - the counting-house door was locked, when they came in - I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw Stevens for a very little time? A. Yes; I had a light in my hand in the passage - I am sure he is the man - I have not mistaken one person for another; if I had seen him six months after in a crowd, I could have picked him out; he took his hat off in the kitchen, but took it up stairs with him - I am sure I am not mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How soon afterwards did you see him? A. On Monday morning - I was always sure of his person.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I came home with him - I rang the bell, as Mr. Slater was rather behind, paying a coachman - I rang the bell, and waited nearly three minutes, and then the prisoner Stevens opened the door, I saw his face, and am certain of his person - I asked what business he had there; he and another man directly ran out of the house, without answering me - I then saw my husband about two doors off; the two men ran towards him, and then attempted to cross the road, seeing him coming - I called Stop thief! and he pursued one of them; I was too much frightened to know what happened afterwards - I searched for my children, who were out with us; my husband entered the house before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the door opened, was there any light in the passage? A. None; but there is a strong gas-light opposite our door, on the same side of the way, and it reflected strongly in Stevens' face - I am quite sure of him - I did not see the other's face.</p>
               <p>MR. SLATER re-examined. Upon coming home, I saw the two prisoners run out of the house; the pathway is much higher than the road, you must either jump off, or go a good way down to get to the road - I saw them come out of the house - Mrs. Slater called Stop thief! and they ran towards me, and crossed from the pavement, into the road; I followed them - Wilson turned short to the left, Stevens took to the right, towards town, and I followed him, he crossed the road, and I struck at him, but missed him, and struck against a post, but still had him in sight; he ran in the direction of Knightsbridge-green, ran towards a saw-pit, and threw himself down by the side of some logs of timber - I hesitated for a second, then got over the timber, and collared him; he lay flat on the ground, behind the timber - I brought him back to my house; and found Wilson in custody - I said they had got the right man - I found that the wainscot, between the passage and shop had been broken down; two or three persons, who were with me, began to search the prisoners, and while so doing, the prisoners' backs were towards a table; they were both shuffling their hands behind their coats, and on the table was found a pistol, and screw-driver - I then said</p>
               <p>"It has been desperate - I will look at the counting-house, and see if that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130049"></xptr>is all right" - I found the counting-house door broken open - I had locked it the morning before, and had the key in my pocket; the counting-house is at the end of the shop; and communicates with it internally; the first thing I observed was my tin cash-box, turned upside down on the table - I had left it locked up in a drawer, under the desk, which drawer had been wrenched open by some instrument, and the desk had been broken open; violence had been used to the cash-box, but they had not succeeded in getting it open; it was about three feet from the drawer, in which I had left: it contained a 20 l., seven 10 l., and three 5 l. Bank-notes, twenty-five sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a guinea, a gold ring, three half-crowns, five shillings, and ten sixpences - I missed a silver watch, which I had seen on the counting-house mantel-shelf that morning - I have not found it; on my return from the counting-house other things had been found on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure that the cash-box had been left in the drawer? A. Quite so; I did not loose sight of Stevens at all, there was nobody else on that side of the way, till I had taken him; four persons came up afterwards - I am positive of both of the prisoners; there is no door leading from the counting-house to the street, you must go through the shop to it - there are marks of violence on the box; an experienced thief might have taken box and all.</p>

               <p>"Stop those two men; they have robbed the house" - they ran into the road - Wilson separated from Stevens, turned short to the left, and came back under a shallow wall; he came opposite to where I was standing on the pavement - I then walked towards him; he crossed the road, I followed, and took him by the collar - I took him back into Mr. Slater's warehouse - Mr. Slater had then returned with Stevens - they were searched; a pistol and screw-driver were found on the table, behind then - I am sure Wilson is the man.</p>

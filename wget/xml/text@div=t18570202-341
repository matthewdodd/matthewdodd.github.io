                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, keeping the Blue-coat Boy, Norton Folgate. The prisoner was my potman three months, and I discharged him—on Monday, 26th Jan., I placed on a clothes chest, in my bed room, a cash box, containing from 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in gold and silver—it was always kept there—I took the money up every night, and sometimes</p>

               <p>oftener, as it accumulated—I saw it safe at a quarter past 5 o'clock, having put in 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, wrapped up in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels—three or four odd six<lb></lb>pences might sometimes be loose in the box—I did not go up to my bed room again till 12 o'clock, and then missed the box—the two servants had then gone to bed—I told the prisoner that I had lost my cash box, and asked him if he knew anything about it, he said, "No, "—he assisted me to the police station, as I am lame, and the matter was investigated there—I charged him with stealing it—it was suggested by the officer on duty that I and the prisoner should return, with two policemen, to see if the cash box could be found—we returned and the prisoner opened the door which leads to the flat top of a parlour, which is built on the yard, and walked up to the wall which divides my house from the other buildings—I was with him and the two constables—he said, "Here is the cash box, master, it is not all gone, for it feels heavy," he took it in his hand, with two pieces which had been broken out of it; he brought it into the kitchen, and I counted the money in it, in his presence, and there was 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in silver, in it—I missed 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then all went to bed, and next morning I secreted myself in the spirit room, where I could hear any conversation taking place in the kitchen—I could not see into the kitchen, because when the door is shut the kitchen is dark—it was about 9 o'clock, and I heard a conversation be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and Ann Lott, a servant girl—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">He</hi>," meaning me, "is out in his reckoning about the silver, he said, last night, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I wish I had had more;" Ann Lott answered, "Yes"—I discharged the prisoner that day, and as he was leaving, he said, "You have made oat no charge against us, you will never find your money"—there were no other persons in the kitchen—on the evening I lost the money the prisoner was waiting on customers—he occasionally ran out for a minute or two, and sometimes he would go up stairs—it is my usual practice to put my money in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels, and this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the cash box on the night previous to the robbery—there were seven other pieces, I cut up a parochial paper into eight pieces, and I believe this is one of them—I would not say that it is the piece—I know it because it is a parochial paper, and you can see the mark of a half crown on it—I have seen this leather bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's possession twenty times, he used it frequently of an evening for his own purposes—this sixpence (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in my cash box on the evening of the robbery, I know it from the pe<lb></lb>culiar manner in which the hole is drilled.</p>

On the 24th of September, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner looking into his shop - he then went in and brought out the looking-glass; I went and asked if it had been paid for - they said No: I ran and saw the prisoner in John-street - he put down the glass; I lost sight of him for a moment in Windmill-street, but he was taken soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this a pretty good thoroughfare? A. Yes; I had never seen the prisoner before - I saw him go in and come out with the glass; the prisoner had turned a corner before he put down the glass - I lost sight of him then for a few minutes, but when I saw him again he had the glass; I took up the glass - he then turned the corner of Windmill-street, and I lost sight of him, but I can take upon me to swear he is the man.</p>

            . I heard Stop thief! called and saw the prisoner run - a man caught him, and he said,"For God's sake let me go, there goes the thief," but he was the foremost man; I took him, and met the witness turning the corner with the glass - there were a few boys running after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the gentleman here who stopped him? A. No - he was a gentleman going by; he did not say, "If that is the person who took the glass, he must have come a different way to this man" - he let him go, and I took him.</p>
               <p>DAVID THOMPSON. This is my glass, but I was not at home - I missed this glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Paddington, and was returning home through Windmill-street - I heard Stop thief! called and ran as others did, when a man stopped me and detained me three or four minutes; I said I was not the man, but he might search me - I did not know what had been taken; he seeing the mob run in a different direction to me, let me go; the Policeman then came up, and in about six or seven minutes this man came up with the glass, and said, "This must be the man as I never lost sight of him," and at the office he said he did lose sight of me - I never was in John-street.</p>

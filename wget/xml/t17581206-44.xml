Then he and the woman went through Ludgate.

The Gentleman said, for God's sake don't use me ill; Socket took his hat, and his shoes and buckles from his feet, then he ran away; then one of the company ask'd me to hold out his legs while he took his watch; we tried, but could not get it, if he had one. Then we went up a lane that leads into Shoe-lane; there some of them grumbled that we did not take more from him. We went back, there he was sitting on his back-side; we listed him up, and said, What do you sit there for? he looked at us and ran away directly.

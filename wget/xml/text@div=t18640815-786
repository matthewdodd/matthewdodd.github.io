On 27th July I was in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner—I followed him into some offices in Tower-street, and there saw him stooping down, picking up some raw coffee—I stood at the bottom of the court, and when he came down I asked him if he had offices up there—he said, "Yes; what do you mean, sir?"—he said that in English—he was then carrying a coat on his arm—I asked him if it belonged to him—he said, "Yes"—he then turned back and went up into the office again—in the course of five minutes I went up and saw him standing on the staircase—I asked a gentleman in the office if he knew him, and he said "No"—I then told the prisoner I was an officer, and I should charge him with unlawful possession of the coat he had on his arm—he would not understand that—I took him to the police-station, and he was searched—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some coppers, and a piece of paper, which I took out of his pocket, with a County Court summons—he caught hold of it, and tore it from my hand—he stated at the Mansion House that a Jew had given the coat to him to sell—he said he did not know him—I believe he said that in German—he was talking to the Alderman at the time in German, but I could not understand it.</p>

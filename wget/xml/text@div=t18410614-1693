On the 10th of June I saw the prisoner, about a quarter before four o'clock in the morning, coming from the Uxbridge-road, and going towards Colchester-terrace, which is about a mile from London, on the Bayswater-road—he had a bundle under his arm—I called after him three times—he did not stop—I ran to him, and asked what he had in his bundle—he said, a live tame duck, which he had picked up in the road, coming from the Swan, in the Bayswater-road—I said it was not his, for I had seen it a few minutes before in Mr. Smith's premises—I took him into custody.</p>

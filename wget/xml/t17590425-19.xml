Producing a drawer with pegs fastened in the bottom, standing upright in rows.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250026"></xptr> All these pegs had each a ring on them, except three at one corner; she look'd at them, and fix'd upon one; then I miss'd a ring; I call'd my master, and he sent for a constable; when the constable came, she said she would be search'd. (He produc'd a new gold ring). She had two rings on her fingers besides this, two on her left hand and one on her right; this ring, which my master believes to be his, was on her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain there was a ring missing?</p>
               <p>Lee. I am positive of that; there were three wanting when she came in, and four when she went out.</p>

            . I am constable; this is the ring that the master of this apprentice believes to be his property, but he cannot swear positively. When the prisoner was before Mr Alderman Cokayne, he desired her to take it off her finger, and give it to me; saying, there was reason to believe it to be the prosecutor's ring; she took it off her finger, and deliver'd it to me. When I was sent for to her, I ask'd her how she came by that ring; she said it was not Mr Salter's, her brother gave it her five months ago, and that he was on board the Alexander privateer. After that, she said she had just fetch'd it out of pawn; I ask'd her where; she told me; I went to the pawnbroker, where she said she had been and fetch'd it from; the pawnbroker told me she had not been there for two or three months; it appears to be a new ring, and the burnish is not gone off.</p>

I was in Mr Salter's house at the time the prisoner at the bar was there; the boy call'd his master down; I went down also, and saw this ring taken off the prisoner's finger; the prosecutor said he believ'd it to be his ring; it was return'd to her again; and she put it on her finger and carried it to the fitting alderman.</p>

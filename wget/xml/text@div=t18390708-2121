                  </hi>. I was a mate in the Helpless ward of Greenwich Hospital. It was my duty to go round to the different pensioners in the room with the mess, every dinner and meal time—the nurse, Charlotte Cox, generally went round with me—on the 20th of June, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, I went round with the dinner—we carry a bag round containing tallies or numbers which the pensioners draw, and get a corres<lb></lb>ponding mess—that is done that there maybe no unfairness—when I came to the prisoner I said, "William, draw your tally, will you?"—the nurse was along side of me—he rose up off his seat, and spoke very sharp to me, which I had never known him to do—he said, "No, I shan't"—I said, "Who shall draw?"—'he said, "I don't care, draw who likes I will draw you by and by"—I took no notice, but I said to the nurse, "Do you draw for him," and passed on to the next man, Person, upon my right—he drew his tally—I then went to a man named Jones—he was drawing his lot—I be<lb></lb>lieve he had got his hand into the bag, but had not drawn it, when I felt a heavy thrust in my side, and he said, "D—n you, I have done you"—I did not know who it was then—I looked round as well as I could, and saw the knife in the prisoner's hand—I did not feel the knife—I only felt a thrust that cut me—I said, "My God, I am dead"—I was all over blood—the prisoner had been drinking that day, but he was not the worse for liquor—I was attended by a surgeon, and was laid up for three weeks—I never had an angry word with the prisoner in my life—we were always on good terms.</p>

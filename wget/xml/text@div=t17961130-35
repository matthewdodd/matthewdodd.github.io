               <p>Q. Had you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No; I told her she had another guinea; she said, no, she had not; I bid her feel in her other pocket, she then pulled out a gown, she said she had spent the guinea in cloaths; she had bought a gown for 9s. a petticoat for 9s. and an apron for 1s. 6d. and had spent the rest in apples; I told her she was a very wicked girl for doing so, and asked her if she had taken any thing else, she said, no; on the Monday following, I missed my cloak, and asked her if she had taken it, she said, no; afterwards, she confessed she took it on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300047"></xptr>Saturday morning, and sold it to a lady in Fleet-market, for two guineas; and that she would stay with me and work it out: I asked her what she had done with the money, she said she had paid it away to people she owed money to; the cloak has never been recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she told you of the cloak, had you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes, provided she got the cloak again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she told you she had taken the cloak, before you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cloak? - A. Four pounds, it cost me five guineas; I had not had it above a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you offered her any favour before she made a confession? - A. I am not positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these guineas marked? - A. No; I could not swear to them, only by her own confession.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the guineas, whether you had not told her it would be better for her to confess she had them? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure she declared these two guineas to be your's, before you offered her any favour? - A. Yes; I never said I had lost any thing till I said the two guineas in the paper were mine; and then she said she took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. A week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her? - A. Yes; from the Red Ball, in Red-lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house, in Cursitor-street? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a milliner? - A. Ever since I lived in that house; my husband has been dead three years; I only come from abroad lately, I am a German; the officer that took her, found nothing upon her, and he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the whole house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I hired myself to this place as a private house; when I got there, I found it was a disorderly house; I was to go to see my brother on Sunday, and she begged of me not to say any thing to my brother what sort of a place I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor). Is there any body else in the house besides yourself? - A. Two ladies.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they women of character; how do they get their livelihood? - A. I cannot say, one of them I believe, has a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to doubt they are girls of the town, or one of them? - A. I cannot tell, I do not trouble myself about my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. She says you told her not to tell her brother what sort of a house she was in? - A. Upon my oath, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this girl receive any company in your house, or was she merely a servant? - A. No; she was merely my servant.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not call any witnesses to her character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Turk-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green. I occupy the ground-floor—the owner of the house does not live in it—I have it to myself. On the 29th of Dec., about six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I fastened my window, locked my room door, and took my key with me—I returned between eight and nine, and found a square of glass broken, and the window opened, and when I went in, I found the till pulled out, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence gone—the window looks into the yard, at the back of the house—the taking out of the piece of glass would enable a person to introduce his arm to open that window—I had a farthing among the money that I can recognise—it is battered up at the edges, which are higher than the middle of it—I know the prisoner—I had seen him at my house that evening, before I went out—after discovering the robbery I had a constable to look over the place, and whilst he was doing so, the prisoner walked in—he asked me what all this bother was about—I said, "You are just the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> I want," and I directly gave him in charge on suspicion, with a lad who he said he was in company with the whole evening—that lad was afterwards discharged.</p>

On Sunday night, the 28th of Dec., I was assisting my brother at his shop, and noticed a farthing in his till, of the reign of George II—I took it up, looked at it, and made an ob<lb></lb>servation to my brother about it—I then put it back into the till—when the prisoner was given into custody, near the station door, I saw him drop this had farthing—it is an old battered piece of coin—I picked it up—this other coin is the farthing which I had seen in the till.</p>

On Monday, the 29th of Dec, I saw the prisoner—he asked me to take a walk with him to the play—I said I had some work that would last me about an hour—I went out about three quarters of an hour afterwards, and passed Mr. Prince's door—it was between five and six—the front window-shutters were shut—I saw a light at the back when I went up the court—I saw the prosecutor's window half open, and the curtains blowing out—I went to the top of the court, and made an alarm—I did not find anybody near the spot—I saw the prisoner about three quarters of an hour after, about twenty yards from Prince's—he said, "Will you come to the play now?"—I said, "Yes"—I told him that Prince's had been broken open—we went to the play, and when we came back again, he went in and asked Mr. Prince what was amiss—the prisoner lent mo 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, as I had no money to pay for myself at the play.</p>

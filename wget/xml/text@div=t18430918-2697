                  </hi>. I am a widow. On Saturday evening, the 9th of September, I had passed through Euston-square, when I found that something had cut the fringe of my shawl, and nearly pulled it off my shoul<lb></lb>der—I turned and saw the prisoner and another man close to me—the pri<lb></lb>soner begged my pardon, and instantly ran away—I put my hand to my pocket and missed my purse and keys—I had a half-crown, six shillings, and a sixpence in my purse—I ran after him and called "stop thief"—a gentleman asked what I had lost, and he took the prisoner in a baker's shop near where it happened—I saw my purse and keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Beaufort-buildings, Strand. About six o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of September, I was passing Euston-square—I saw Mrs. Rogers running and crying "Stop thief"—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man run past me—they reached the end of the street, and one went one way, and one the other—as I did not know which to pursue, I waited till Mrs. Rogers came up—she pointed out the prisoner, and said be took the purse—I pursued him, and saw him standing in a baker's shop—I said; "What have you done with the lady's purse?"—he said, "Me, sir? I have not the lady's purse"—he turned to the counter, and I saw him take his hand from behind him, apparently from his pocket, he took this purse and keys from it—he passed my hand, and endeavoured to put the purse and keys under some pastry—I said, "Here is the purse"—by that time Mrs. Rogers had come up—the prisoner said, "Ask the lady if that is her purse"—I did, and she said it was—I took him till the officer came.</p>

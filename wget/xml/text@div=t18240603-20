            . I am an officer. On the 24th of April I was in Aldgate - about two o'clock I saw the prisoner, and another person very close to him, at the corner of the Minories - I suspected that they were in company - they did not talk together that I saw - they both went towards Leadenhall-street, and both returned in about a minute - I turned up Church-row, they went by, I came out of the row, and saw the prisoner with this parcel in his hand, which he had not got before - I ran and overtook him by the Bull Inn - he scuffled - I took him to the Mansion-house, and he there said that he had picked it up.</p>

            . I am a porter to Messrs. Davenport and Tapson. On the 24th of April I put up these things ready to be put into a parcel, and put the parcel into a truck which was to go to the Saracen's Head, Aldgate, and the Three Nuns - the parcel produced is what I put into the truck - it contains six pairs of stockings.</p>

            . I am employed occasionally at the prosecutors' warehouse, which is in King's Arms Yard, Coleman-street - I was delivering parcels in a truck at different places - I stopped at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate - this parcel and two more were in the truck, and when I got to the Three Nuns it was gone - the truck is in closed with rails at the sides - it could not fall out - I had not left it after I went to the Saracen's Head, but I was in front of the truck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Cannot you tell when it was taken - A. It was safe when I was at the Saracen's Head - I had nine parcels when I set out.</p>

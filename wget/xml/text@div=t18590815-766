                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Dale, of Shoe-lane, a founder and lead merchant—about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening of 16th July, I heard a ring at the bell, in consequence of which I went and opened the street door—there were two gentlemen at the door, one of them said, "Is Mr. Dale in"—I went to answer him that Mr. Dale was absent, and they both rushed in—one of them closed the door, and the other seized and held me by the throat—there were only two men then, but one more came in directly afterwards—I got from the man that held me, and screamed, and then the other man got hold of me by the throat, and pressed me very hard with his two thumbs—that was the prisoner; I am sure he is the man—two of Mr. Dale's men then came up, but the prisoner did not let go of me for a minute or two, till the other man ran out, and then he ran out too—the usual time for Mr. Dale's men to leave is 8 o'clock, but they were there later that evening—when the prisoner rushed out, both Mr. Dale's men pursued him, and I was left alone in the house—I saw the prisoner again at the station, the same evening—I had never seen him before.</p>

I live in King-street, Lambeth, and am a brass-fitter, in the employ of Mr. Dale—I remember the night of the 16th July—while in the back premises, I heard a scream from the last witness.—I and my fellow workman rushed to the passage, and I saw the prisoner had got hold of the servant by the throat—I am quite certain he is the man—he rushed out at the door, and I rushed after him, and followed him till he was cap<lb></lb>tured—I did not lose sight of him at all—he was at last secured by a police<lb></lb>man—in going along, he made a stop; I came up to him, and he went on again.</p>

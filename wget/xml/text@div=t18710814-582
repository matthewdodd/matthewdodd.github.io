Directly I got there, the prosecutor caught hold of me, and said I had his watch. I said I had not. He said "I think you have." I took off my coat, and shook it, and stood there till the constable came up, holding Turner's hand, walking very slowly, as if he knew nothing about it The prosecutor called him, and drew his attention to what we were talking about. He looked at me very hard, and told the persons to go away who were being tied up with the rope. I looked round, and saw the constable whispering in the witness's ear, and the boy said "I saw him take the watch, and give it to a man, who ran up there." I was took innocent; the boy knew nothing at all about it.</p>

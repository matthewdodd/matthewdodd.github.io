                  </hi>. I am a dealer in jewellery, plate, and other articles, and live at No. 82, High Holborn, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. About a quarter past ten o'clock at night on the 22nd of November, I was in the parlour at the back of the shop, which was not shut up, the door was open—I heard the breaking of glass—I went into the shop, and found a square of glass broken which was sound before—I had noticed it within half an hour—I missed seven watches, which hung close to the glass, on a brass road, they could be reached with a hand—the prisoners were about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the shop-door was open, but I am certain they did not come in and take them.</p>

I was in Dean-street, Holborn, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I observed Rae run by the end of Dean-street where I was—I ran, and found him stopped by Nicholls, and found a watch in his hand—as I took him back to the shop, he said there were two more in it—I looked behind and saw Welsh in the mob—directly he saw me looking he hung back, and I took him also—while I was searching Rae at the shop, Welsh took a watch from his shirt, and said, "I will not hide it from you, take it"—he told me there was another one in it—one watch was picked up by the mob, and given to me.</p>

In consequence of information I took Rogers standing opposite the prosecutor's house just after ten o'clock—I had seen him up and down Holborn several times, in company with the other two prisoners—I had had him in custody about half an hour before for stealing a pair of trowsers, but he as let go—I heard of this robbery</p>

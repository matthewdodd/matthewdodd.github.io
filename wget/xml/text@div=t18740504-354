I am a fishmonger, at 5, Ship Tavern Passage, in the City—the prisoner has been my foreman about ten years, and he was about twenty years in the service of my father—I trusted him with buying and selling fish—if he received money it was his duty to put it on the desk and account for it when I came down at 6 o'clock in the evening—I am in very bad health—I generally attend to business from 9 o'clock till 1, and from 5 o'clock till about 7 in the evening—the prisoner bought the fish in the morning and I paid him for it afterwards—he had lent me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some<lb></lb>time before—I had paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I owe him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—before the 10th of April I consulted Mr. Crook, my solicitor, and on that day I left the shop from 5 to 6 o'clock—I left the prisoner 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a drawer for change—if he sold fish while I was away, it was his duty to put the money on the desk and to account to me for the fish that had been sold—I knew that the clerks and the police officer were about to buy fish at my shop—I returned to the shop at 6 o'clock, and there was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk—4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for fish sold in the morning, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was also on the desk—Mr. Crook came about 7.45 as the prisoner was about to leave, and Mr. Crook asked him to come upstairs—I can't recollect what was said, of course Mr. Crook made allusions to the fish that was sold, but I can't say for certain what he said—the prisoner asked me to have mercy on him, and that he was guilty—he said that in the presence of Mr. Crook—the prisoner said that was all the fish he had sold to the value of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was on the desk—I don't think he said anything about the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have no recollection of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was consulted by Mr. Bateman about this supposed embezzlement, and it was by instructions that my clerks went and bought fish, and from information I received I afterwards went to Mr. Bateman's shop, and as the prisoner was about leaving I requested him to go upstairs into a private room—Mr. Bateman came too—I asked the prisoner what money he had taken for fish sold between 3 and 6 o'clock—he replied that he had taken 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in ready money, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a parcel of fish sold in the morning—I then told him he must have made some mistake and that he had taken more money—he replied that he had not done so—I then said "Did you not receive 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 2 lbs. of salmon"—after some little hesi<lb></lb>tation he said he had—he denied having received anything else and said he must by some mistake have put the money into his own pocket—I told him we knew he had sold other fish, and he said he had not—I said that we must call in a police-constable and give him into custody—he said "I beg you won't do so on account of my wife and family"—I said the fish had been bought and paid for with marked money—he replied he was sure it could not have been so, that he had received no more money than he had stated, and he had offered to turn out the money in his pocket—he did so, and Mrs. Bateman, who was then present pointed out the two half-crowns and two shilling piece as being marked money—a constable was fetched and he was given into custody and money was given to the constable.</p>

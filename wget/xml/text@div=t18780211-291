                  </hi>. I live in Park Row, East Greenwich, and am a coach painter—a little before 8 o'clock on the night of the 3rd January I met Murray, and we went to a public-house, where I treated him—he after<lb></lb>wards took me to the Crown—I had rather over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon me, two half-sovereigns and the remainder in silver—we met several men there, and amongst them Murphy—I treated them—I might have given them more than a gallon between them—no doubt when I pulled out my money to pay they could see what money I had—we left the public-house about a quarter past 12, near closing time—Murray was going to take me home, and he walked by the side of me—we had gone about 20 to 30 yards when I received a blow on the right side of my head—I didn't know there was anybody in the rear, and I turned round to resist and I got a blow in my mouth, which knocked the blood out of my mouth and nose—I was knocked down, and they had me by the throat—I could see what they were doing, but I could not speak—I was choked—one man cried out "Sloper is coming," and he gave me one or two kicks—when I was able to draw my breath I cried out "Police" and "Murder"—my money was gone then—there were four or five men there—they all gave it me—from the state of insensibility I was in at the time, I could not exactly say whether the prisoners were taking part in it then on the ground—of course they all assisted in injuring my poor body—Murray raised me out of a pool of blood—Mr. Lawes came up in plain clothes, and I thought he was a gentleman, and I said "For God's sake come and assist me, I am murdered"—I had a bag in my pocket like that one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it says in my depositions that was taken, these initials were on it—I never before to my remembrance took notice of those, but the bag is just about the same as this, with a piece of tape tied round it—all the money was gone from it, and out of my pockets as well—I told the policeman that Murray was taking me home—Murray was taken into charge that night—I</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Little Crown, East Greenwich—the two prisoners were in my house on the night in question with several others—the drink they had was paid for by different persons—I served the prosecutor with a pot of beer, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he gave a man to get a pint—they left about 12. 4—Murray offered to take the prosecutor home, and I advised him not to do so—they were not drunk.</p>

At 12. 30 on 3rd January I was in plain clothes in East Lane, Greenwich, and heard cries of ''Help," and "Save my life"—I ran as quick as I could towards the cries, and just before I got there I saw two men run away, one having a white slop on, who I consider resembled Murphy—Murray had hold of the prosecutor by the arms and was lifting him up—I believed the man to be Murphy because he had a white slop on—the prosecutor said "You vagabonds, you have robbed me and would have killed me if it hadn't been for this gentleman coming up"—he had been drinking and so had the prisoners—the prosecutor was bleeding from the mouth, and com<lb></lb>plained of being assaulted and robbed, and I took him to the station and they were charged—the bag produced looks like a pay-bag—they are made by the hundred or thousand perhaps. <hi rend="smallCaps">

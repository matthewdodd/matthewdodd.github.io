                  </hi>. I am an eating house keeper at Vauxhall-wharf. On 16th Nov., the two prisoners came in company with another who is not in custody—the two prisoners sat down by themselves, and the other sat down in the parlour by himself—the prisoners had some refreshment which came to 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they ate what was given them and Reeves offered me a sovereign—I took it up, took it round the counter, and rung it on a slab, and by the weight and ringing I was perfectly satisfied it was good—I asked my wife to get change, and Williams said, "I believe I have copper enough to pay"—I saw he had some copper, and I gave the sovereign back to Reeves—after I had given it back Williams said he had not got enough by a halfpenny, and Reeves <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a piece and said, "Never mind; give me change, governor, for this; I must get change somewhere"—I took up the piece that he threw down directly and said, "I cannot give you change for this"—he asked why—I said, "Because I do not believe it is worth a farthing"—it was not the same that I had had before—it was very light—I detected it by the weight and by the roughness on the edge—Reeves asked me for it back again to go and get it changed—he said he took it for work—I asked him where he worked—he did not give me any further answer than this, "I told you I was looking for work"—I sent for a constable—I gave him the sovereign and gave them both in charge—just as this disputing was going on, the third man came out of the parlour door which is on the left, and said,</p>

               <p>"Governor, are these men trying to pass bad money on you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me look at it"—I said, "No, you won't catch old birds with chaff"—I did not give it him—I went to fetch a constable—he followed me out and did not return.</p>

In the forenoon of the 8th of March I went to the shop, and cut out some strips of leather, and left them on the board in the shop; in the evening the prisoner went from Mr. Harman's shop; at seven o'clock in the evening. I saw the prisoner at the Bull in John-street; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; two officers came from Marlborough-street, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in his pocket. - A. Eight strips of leather he took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose leather was it. - A. Mr. Harman's; when he was taken before the magistrate he was searched, there was another strip of leather found upon him.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I worked in the same shop with the prisoner, and when we left the shop he had no property about him of that description.</p>

About half past six that evening; afterwards we went to the public house, and I perceived his pockets full of leather; I informed Mr. Clark. He had been back to the shop with an excuse for an awl, and then he got this leather, I saw the eight pieces of leather taken out of his pocket; he then begged leave to go and desired us to say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was in the shop all day by myself; when I went into the shop for an awl, there was a man there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 8th of March I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody at the Bull in the John street; when I came there Clark was sitting by him with this leather in his hand, and this here piece of leather I took from him before the magistrate; it was in his apron. (The leather produced, and identified by Clark).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Them pieces of leather were cut out the day before, and some of the leather I had in my pocket; while I worked for Mr. Harman, Clark did every thing to counteract what I did; the second witness is Clark's man, they both work piece work. I took the work home on Saturday, intending to do the work on Sunday; I was treating these men on Saturday evening, when Clark was very much intoxicated, and I was the worse for liquor; they took me in a state of intoxication. I should have done the work on Sunday had I not been put in prison.</p>

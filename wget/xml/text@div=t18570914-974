                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Rainbow</hi>, an English vessel plying between Rotterdam and London. The prisoner was a passen<lb></lb>ger on board, and the deceased Richard Faulkner was a shipmate of his; they were both passengers from Rotterdam to London. On Saturday, 15th Aug., we were about forty miles at sea—on that day I saw the prisoner and deceased come out of the fore cabin, and go forward to the foremast and begin to fight—I saw them close in on one another, and strike—they had their coats off—the fight lasted a very little time, there were a very few blows exchanged—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand; it was a common sheath knife, such as American sailors generally use; like a pig knife, rounded at the point—the English sailors use knives of a different descrip<lb></lb>tion, clasped knives—when I saw him with the knife I called out—I was on the bridge of the boat, looking out; and after that I saw him stab Faull<lb></lb>ner three times in the back—I then turned away to call to the captain—Faulkner staggered, and I believe went below—the captain went to separate them, but they separated themselves—I saw Faulkner lying there two minutes afterwards, bleeding from the thigh, but I was not near enough to see the wound—the blood was coming down his trowsers—he had seven stabs altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Thames policeman</hi>, 29). I took the prisoner into Custody on 16th Aug.—I was called by the captain, and found him locked up in one of the side houses on board the <hi rend="italic">Rainbow</hi>—I told him I took him into custody for stabbing a man—he said, "Yes, I believe I have; I hope <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> is not in a bad condition"—I asked what he had done with the knife—he said, "I don't know, but I believe I <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it overboard"—I observed a kind of cut in his right hand, it was very deep and it was bleeding then; I asked how that was done, or whether it was done with the grasp of the knife—he said, "Yes, I believe it was"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon on board the hospital ship <hi rend="italic">Dread<lb></lb>nought.</hi> On 16th Aug. Faulkner was brought there—he was first examined by my substitute, as I was out—I saw him about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he was pale, and was suffering from seven wounds, three on the back, two of them between the blade bone and the spinal column, and one a little lower down; two on the hip, and two below the heart—the two below the heart were not deeper than the cartilage of the ribs—the deepest wound was on the hip, but the longest were those over the heart—that on the hip was an inch and a half deep—those on the back varied from half an inch to an inch—none</p>

               <p>of them were serious in themselves—I think he remained in the hospital ship about a fortnight—a sharp pointed instrument would cause such wounds—they were all stabs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This occurred at dinner; we were all eating; I suppose we were all the worse for liquor; I was, as well as the prosecutor, very drunk; I made some remark over the table, and he took it up, and said I was insulting the party—I said I was not, that I was speaking about myself, but I supposed I had been so long out of society that I did not know how to conduct myself when I got into it; he said it was not that, but I its insinuating at him, or some of the rest, particularly at him; I said I was not; he said if I did not <hi rend="italic">shut up</hi> he would make me, and got up; I said I was as good a man as he was; he jumped over the table at me; I ran on deck, and he followed me; I had my sheath knife in my hand to cut my meat; he ran after me, and I fell against the scuttle of the fore cabin; he caught me by the hair, and dragged me five or six feet, hitting me all the time in the head and face; trying to free myself from him, and having the knife in my hand, I perhaps cut him in so many places, but not intention<lb></lb>ally; I can say with a clear conscience that I never had any enmity against the man; we were on board a man of war together for a long time; this never would have occurred if we had not been in liquor; we were all good friends; this is the first time I was ever before a court of justice; I have been ten years on the water.</p>

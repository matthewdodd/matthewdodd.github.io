               <p>THOMAS MAYERS. I am a constable; I live at Queen's-elms. I was in my shop at twenty minutes after eight o'clock on the 12th of January, and saw the prisoner with two large bundles - I followed him twenty yards, and then stopped him; I said, "What have you got there?" he said, "What is that to you?" I said, "I wish to know;" he said he brought them from his father in the creek - I took them off his shoulder; he twisted round, and ran away - I followed some distance, but I had my slippers on, and could not run very fast; in three-quarters of an hour he and his mother came, and wanted to have the property; I said No - I took him to the Magistrate, who ordered him to be confined; the victuals would not keep - I described it to the prosecutor.</p>

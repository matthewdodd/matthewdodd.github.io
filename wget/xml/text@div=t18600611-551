Brie and Co., of Conduit-street, Regent Street—the prisoner was in their employment for a short time in December, 1859—he left on the 24th December—this document is his writing, I know it Perfectly well—I have seen him write frequently in the employ of the firm—he had not the slightest authority to make such an order—this signature is also his.</p>

             . On the 31st of Dec. the Prisoner brought a spoon to Mrs. Parson's, I looked upon the back of the spoon, said I, this spoon has a crest upon it, and it does not look to be your property, he said it was not his property, but that he came from one Miller a master brick-maker at the Pinner of Wakefield . - He said his master wanted a little money, and that he was ashamed to come himself. I desired him to tell his master to come, he went as far as Gray's-Inn-Gate , and said his master could not come, I said if he would send any body to give me satisfaction that it was his spoon I would take it in; but as he did not, I stopt the spoon and advertised it.</p>

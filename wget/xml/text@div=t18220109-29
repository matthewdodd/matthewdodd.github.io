On the 19th of December, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop; she asked for remnants of lace; I shewed her some in a basket - she laid out 1 s. 10 d. in lace. I observed her squeeze about three remnants in her hand - I had put what she bought in paper; as soon as an opportunity offered, I saw her put the three pieces into her pocket; I went round the counter to give her change for 2 s., I had previously sent for an officer - I told her she had taken some property; she said nothing, but sat down on a stool. The officer found one piece of lace, which was not ours; the three pieces were found on the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. I suppose the space between the counter is narrow - A. Yes. I do not know whether she saw me whisper to the person to fetch a constable.</p>

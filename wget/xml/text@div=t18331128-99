             - I knew him at that time; he was clerk to Mr. Hart - he called two or three times at the house, I cannot say which - he called to ask if there were any more letters left.</p>

               <p>Q. For who? A. For Hart; if there were any more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280085"></xptr>letters left in the name of Smith I suppose - when Hart called it was to ask if there was a letter - I know the postman but not by name - I have never seen Atcheson meet him - I saw Hart take a letter one day at the door, but not inside the door - it was about a week after the conversation about furnishing the room - it was within a fortnight - he took the letter at the door from the postman - I never saw but one letter taken by Hart, and the one sent to him - I knew his name was Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how you came to take in a letter by the name of Smith? A. Neither myself nor Mrs. Tucker expected any letters, and I presumed it was for Hart, and sent it down to him - I did not take the letter in myself; I called after that at Hart's, in Mornington Crescent - it was after Hart had met the postman at the door - I found him there, and had some conversation with him respecting the letter I sent him; I thought it very improper if he wished letters addressed to the house to stop the postman in the street and take them; because the neighbour's noticed it - (I had not observed the neighbours notice it, but it was named to me by persons in the house) I really do not know the reply that was made - I did not think I should come before a tribunal about it, and did not take dates or anything - we had a conversation of a few minutes - I do not know what passed- it was of no moment at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hart say when you said it was improper to stop the postman in the street? A He might laugh it off or something; it was tantamount to saying it was of no detriment to the house, or something; I really do not know what it was - he said, "Oh, that can make no difference," or something.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Having refreshed your memory by means in your possession, have you ascertained that is the paper from which the advertisement was inserted? A. Merely by the mark, which we must make on it before it goes up-stairs.</p>

Morton - after I sent the letter, I saw the prisoner at the bar, at the Swan Inn, at Alton, in Hampshire, which is eight miles from my house - I had some conversation with him - I did not accost him by any name - no name was mentioned - I think not - I asked him if he could accommodate me with from one to £5000. and at what interest - the newspaper was not there - I merely said I came to ask him if he could accommodate me with a sum of money - I rather think I began the conversation - he asked me who I was; I told him I was the son of Sir

Praed's and Co." and omitted to sign my name - nothing was written on the stamps except the words I wrote - I do not know what was to be done with them - I did not authorise him to do anything with them - I do not remember his assigning any reason for my writing on them - I had made an appointment with him to go over to the Inn, because I wanted to raise the money - in consequence of the advertisement, I wrote a letter addressed to Morton, University-street, and had a letter in answer to it - I have not got it - I have lost it - I have looked for it and have not found it - there was no allusion made to that letter in the conversation I had with him at the Swan, that I know of - the name of Morton was mentioned several times by the prisoner; he said he was sorry Mr. Morton could not attend himself; that he had sent him in consequence - I saw nobody but the prisoner about the business; I gave him the ten pieces of paper with"payable at Praed's" written on them, and he made them £500. each at his own suggestion - he asked me what sum the ten bills should be and said "I think we will make them £500. each" - he wrote on the papers in figures "£500" in ink - these are some of the papers which I gave him (looking at them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Point to the place where he wrote anything on them at that time? A. I fancied he wrote on them: he certainly made the observation that they should be £500 each - I do not see anything here that he wrote at that time - I wrote on them "payable at Praed's and Co. No. 189, Fleet-street," - that was all I had written on them at that time - since then some stir has been made about this affair and some of the bills have been returned to me - I received a letter signed T. Morton, which first called my attention to the mistake I had made in omitting to sign my name to the acceptances - this is the letter I received.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live at No. 30, Upper North-place, Gray's-inn-road. I know the prisoner - I have one or two occasions had opportunities of seeing him write, and have received letters from him, and acted on them, and have seen his affidavits - I believe this letter, signed J. Morton, to be the handwriting of Mr. Hart - I believe these other three letters and this memorandum to be his hand-writing - they are all in a feigned hand, but I believe them to be his writing(See documents Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).</p>
               <p>FRANCIS DUGDALE ASTLEY re-examined. In consequence of receiving that letter, (No. 2.) I saw the prisoner- he mentioned that I had omitted to sign my name - he produced the ten pieces of paper which I had given him - it was several days after I had first given them to him- when he produced them, I signed them, and returned them to him; he did not say anything to me about what was to be done with them; he merely said, he would send the money in two or three days, by the mail - I signed my name to all them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I see on the bills above your name there is the word "accepted;" when was that written? A. That was written by me, at the time, I signed my name, I think.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You wrote the word "accepted" at the time you wrote your name? A. I did; I did not receive a farthing of money - I think I wrote to University-street, on not receiving the money - I think this letter(looking at it,) was the first intimation, I received, respecting my bills. (No. 3.) In the meantime I had received these other three letters.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving the letter, signed Dimsdale, did you go to town? A. I did; I went to No. 35, University-street - I did not find any such person there as Morton, or anybody, answering to that name - I also inquired at No. 34; I was told at No. 35 there had been a person of the name of Morton residing there; that there had been a gang in the house - I saw a woman; I believe I had at that time received some other letters - I then went to my bankers, Messrs. Praed &amp; Co. and by their advice I went to a solicitor to assist me in the business - no money has been demanded of me in payment of the bills- I did not see the prisoner, from the time I saw him at my own place, until very lately - the only inquiry I made was at University-street - I employed a person to search after him under the direction of my solicitor - five of the bills have been returned me - I did not pay a farthing for them - the others have not been returned, but I know where they are.</p>

July this year; at my interview with the prisoner, at the inn, I wrote across the paper, "payable at Praed's, &amp; Co., 189, Fleet-street, London" - after that interview, it turned out that I had forgotten to put my name, and we had another interview, at which, I put my name, and the word accepted; there was nobody present but the prisoner - it did not occupy long - some little time after I put my name, I wrote to the prisoner requesting him to send me £500 - I afterwards had some communication with a gentleman, named Smith, about one of the £500 bills, to know whether or not he would have a reference to some body in town, about my validity- this letter is my hand-writing - it was written in consequence of Smith's having applied to me for a reference in town, as to the validity of one of the £500 bills - it is dated 11th August - the bills were signed 2nd August; I wrote on them on the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the communication you had with Smith, by letter? A. Yes. (Letter read No. 7.)</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Now, is that bill one of the ten you gave the prisoner? A. It is; I told him I had £60,000 in the bank, on which the bills might be secured, which would be responsible for them - I am sure I did not state that I had got £60,000 by my wife, and out of that those bills were to be paid - I had not funds sufficient at my bankers at the time the acceptances were given, to take them up, nor had I the means of providing it except in this way - my applying in this way to get money was only to pay other debts.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some time before that you had been making a settlement with your creditors? A. The only settlement I was about to make was with Smart; there were outstanding bills on which there was an understanding that there was a composition made, or to be made.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were those outstanding bills, bills for money or goods advanced by tradesmen, or quite of another description? A. They were gambling transactions; Smart had bills of mine quite independent of these ten bills, to the amount of £2500 - some of those bills were for £500.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you mean to say, when you wrote the letter, saying, if Smith presented a bill it was genuine, you referred to one of the ten bills, or one Smart held independently of you? A. I referred to one of the ten bills which was in the possession of Smith, who had written to me; I never saw it in his possession - I stated if Smart presented it, it was a genuine bill - I had no expectation of being called upon to honour the bills, at the end of two months - the prisoner told me, as long as I paid six per cent. for the forbearance, they might continue outstanding - the £500 I applied to the prisoner about was in part of the £5000 he had promised me.</p>

            . In June, July, and August I was a General Post-office letter carrier for the district in which University-street, Bedford-square, is situated - in the course of those three months I had letters directed to No. 35, University-street; I met one person only once, to whom I delivered the letters; but I met another person frequently, in North-crescent, which is not a great distance from University-street - I do not remember ever meeting a person in University-street; the name of the person who came but once was Morton - a person named Atcheson came with the person who described himself as Morton.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the person was Morton? A. He asked if I had letters directed to Morton; I delivered letters to him then, and many times afterwards to Atcheson - those letters were directed to Morton, University-street - I firmly believe the prisoner to be the person who described himself as Morton - I received the postage for the letters on delivery, in the street - I remem<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280087"></xptr>ber on one occasion having a letter with the Alton postmark on it; I do not remember the date.</p>

I said, "No, my name is Adamson" -"Ah!" said he, "I recollect that is your name; Mrs. Hart told me you had been to my house to search for me" - he told me he was glad he was apprehended, for it would bring the thing to an issue - he said, "Adamson, you are a man of the world, you can perhaps tell me whether it is a case of felony, if Mr. Astley gave me the bills of acceptance" - I said, "Did Mr. Astley give them to you?" he said, "Yes, he did" - he said, "Do you consider that a felony?"

            . I am the drawer and the indorser of these two bills; I did not write the body of the bills; I drew them merely to oblige somebody - I know nothing of Mr. Astley; I had no claim on him at all - this other bill (looking at one) is drawn and indorsed by me.</p>
               <p>The following are the documents referred to in the evidence.</p>
               <p>No. 1. Twenty thousand pounds. - Money to lend. - A gentleman retired from business has this sum unemployed, with the addition of a larger one in the funds, ready immediately to lend upon the promissory notes, bills of exchange, or other good personal security of gentlemen or persons of respectability, either in one or more sums, who require but temporary assistance, who may feel desirous to avoid the expense of effecting morgages on their property. Terms for short periods four and a half per cent. Particulars, stating amount required, time, and every other information are requested to be made in the first instance, by letter, post paid, to Mr. T. Morton, No. 35, University-street, Bedford-square, London, which will be received in strict confidence, and meet early attention if approved."</p>
               <p>No. 2."Sir, - In consequence of some little irregularity in what took place between us when last here, it is requisite I should see you again, in order to rectify it, prior to a final settlement; as I considered it preferable to have a personal interview, rather than communicate my wishes by letter. I came here at some little inconvenieuce for this purpose. It is totally out of my power to comply with your request, of remaining until to-morrow, as I have to go into Kent. I will endeavour to come down again between this and Saturday next, but you shall hear from me first, your obedient servant, J. M." To F. D. Astley, esq.</p>
               <p>No. 3, was also addressed by J. M. to Mr. Astley, without date, requesting that if either of the bills should be referred to him, he would state that they were his hand writing, and would be attended to; but not to enter into the particulars of the transacction, by attention to which, matters would be finally settled on the following Thursday.</p>

               <p>No. 4."Sir, - My arrival here was delayed on my way to town, until this afternoon, and that is why you have not heard from me before. I am sorry that I shall not be able finally to complete your business, until the latter end of this week. I have to be at Southampton on Saturday next, and will meet you at the Swan at Alton, on that day, at 1 o'Clock. You say in the letter I found here, that it is your intention to be in London, either on Thursday or Friday next; but I suppose his was upon the supposition that you would not see me at Alton again. I shall be from home almost all the time, until I see you; as I leave early to-morrow, I may possibly be at Alton before Saturday, in which case I will send over to you, and should you be out, leave word where you are gone to, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. M.</p>

               <p>No. 5."Sir, - I find on inquiry at the coach office, that the two coaches which pass through Alton to-morrow morning,(Saturday) are both full; I am, therefore, obliged to go by Basingstoke to Southampton. I shall be on my return home about Wednesday next, and shall come by the way of Alton purposely to see you. On my arrival at the Swan I will despatch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280088"></xptr>a messenger to you, as you said you did not wish me to come to the house, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. M.</p>
               <p>To F. D. Astley, esq,</p>
               <p>No. 6. The postman is requested to leave all letters to Mr. Moreton, 35, University Street, at No. 4, Gower Place, Bedford-square, J. M.</p>
               <p>To T. Smith, esq. 21, Austin-friars, 11th August.</p>
               <p>No. 7. Sir, - If the bill you allude to, was presented by Mr. Smart, No. 12, Brydges Street, Covent Garden, I have no doubt it is quite correct; though a sight of it previous to its being discounted, would be satisfactory to me, as I am compelled to be very cautious in my pecuniary affairs.</p>

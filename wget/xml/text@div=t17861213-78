               <p>Do you go off your duty so early as that at this time of the year? - Yes; I saw this man with his arms and head in at the tap room window belonging to the prosecutor; he rose up, and immediately went down the street, seeing the glimmering of my light as I supposed; I immediately went up to the window with my lanthorn, and saw the window was open, the sash thrown up, and the curtain drawn back; I immediately went after him; he was but three or four doors off; I took him by the collar; he walked a moderate pace; he did not run; I brought him back to the window; I asked if he knew of the breaking of it; and he said no; I took him to the watch-house; he made resistance when I had him by the collar to get away, and struck me; I was going to turn my rattle, he said, he would go civilly; I took him to the watch-house, but did not search him; I came back and alarmed he prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Then could the man get through the casement? - I do not think he could; but what he owned before the Justice he denied on his second examination.</p>
               <p>Is your tap room lower than your bar room? - No, much upon a square.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. Did you see him reaching without side the window or within? - Withinside the window.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Could any body go from the bar to the tap room? - Yes, there was no door locked between them.</p>
               <p>How is your tap room fastened? - The shutter was with a flap.</p>

               <p>I was going along, and this watchman seized me, and asked me, if I knew this place had been broke open; I told him, I did not; he took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Watchman. Had you lost sight of him so long as not to be sure he was the man? - No, Sir; I am sure it was him; there was not another soul out; he owned before the Justice there were three more and himself concerned in this robbery.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of March last, we sent twenty six hides to Miller's wharf, to be shipped for Scotland; I am partner with my brother; the next day we sent twenty six more, consigned to the same house, to Hoar's wharf. On the 19th of March, Mr. Ashmore, a tanner, sent to our counting house, and said, he should be glad to speak to one of our house immediately; as soon as I came home from market, it was market day, I went, and he said, that his foreman had bought five hides of the prisoner; I saw the hides at Mr. Ashmore's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the twenty six hides put into the conveyance? - I did not; we sent them by our cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they had been lost before they got to Mr. Miller's you would have been accountable for them? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw them on Tuesday? - I did, and I suspected the hides, and from the mark on them, I believed it to be my mark; I would not swear positively; I did not swear positively before the justice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to my house sometime in the month of March, I cannot say to the day; I was rather ill, and he asked me if I knew the price of hides? I am a publican, says I, I don't know the value of them, but I told him I had an acquaintance that would give him the value of them; and then he said to me, you may as well take a walk up to him, and he went and agreed with Mr. Winter for the hides; I never saw the hides at all; he only asked me the question; and I went with him for a walk.</p>

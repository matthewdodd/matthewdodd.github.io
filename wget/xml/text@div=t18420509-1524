I am the wife of William Cresswell, who keeps a public-house in Old Vineyard-street, Clerkenwell. On the 19th of April, the prisoner came to our house about nine o'clock in the evening, and asked for a pint of porter—I served her—she gave me a bad half-crown in payment—I told her it was bad, and asked where she lived—she said, in Drury-lane, and that a woman gave her the half-crown and mug outside the door—I bit it, and said "Send the woman in for it"—she did not send in any one—I put the half-crown in a glass ornament on the mantel-piece—I afterwards gave it to Webb the policeman.</p>

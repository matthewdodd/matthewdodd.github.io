                  </hi>. I am a carman, residing at Hermitage Street, Wapping, I was in the Whitechapel Road on the night of the 25th May, some<lb></lb>where after 8 o'clock—I was walking along with my wife and children and my brother and his wife—we stopped opposite the East London Theatre to bid them good night—I and my wife and family were going to walk to London—there were five or six men standing on the pavement, I said "Stand aside, allow me to pass," the prisoner said "All right" so he stands aside and leaves room enough for me to squeeze through, at that moment four or five more men came pushing round to my right and squeezed by my left hand, the prisoner stood opposite me, and some one behind me says "Have you got it Joe," and he says "All right" and at that moment I missed my watch, I collars hold of him and says "You have got my watch you vagabond," he says "No I have not" and drops his hands, I said to my wife "Look after the children I've got the man," he said "Are you going to let me go "I said "No, not till a policeman comes," and he said "I have not got your watch my good man," I said "If you have not got it, you did have it"—I held him by the collar, a struggle ensued, and we were dragged about the road, and some one said "Joe, kick the b----and get away from him"—I said "Let Joe kick, I can bear it"—I was knocked down again and again, and kicked about the head—101<hi rend="italic">H</hi> came up—I was on my back and the prisoner on the top of me—I gave him into custody, whereupon he said "It is not me, he has been kicking and knocking mo about"—I said "No, this man on the the top has stole my watch"—the policeman held him until 40 <hi rend="italic">H</hi> came up—I went across the road to see after my family, when I got into Church Lane I was again attacked and ran in front of the police, when one of the prisoner's comrades struck 40 and knocked him down, and the prisoner commenced kicking 101—I collared hold of him again while 101 got up, and I helped to take him to the station while 40 was trying to get hold of one of the others—the others escaped—I am sure the prisoner is the man siwho was in front of me when I felt the snatch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were I should say, a dozen men there—perhaps more—they were all crowding up the thoroughfare—the prisoner was only 3 inches from me when I felt the snatch—when we were struggling he was sometimes on the top, and me underneath, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—I didn't give him a chance to escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar maker, living at 17, Charlotte Street, Stepney—I was in the Whitechapel Road on this night—saw the prosecutor and prisoner about 10.30—the prosecutor asked to pass through the crowd—the prisoner said, "All right, plenty of room"—I heard a voice say, from behind, "Have you got it, Joe?" and prisoner said, "All right"—I saw the chain in his right hand, and the watch in his left—he was facing the prose<lb></lb>cutor</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell why the Magistrate's clerk should not have put in my depositions the statement I made, that I saw the chain in one hand and the watch in the other—he must have omitted it, but I stated it, I am sure—it was read over to me before I signed it—I signed this deposition—there is nothing written down there about my having said I saw the watch in one hand and the chain in the other—I cannot account for that—I told the clerk so after he had read it over to me—I was not amongst the crowd—I was not quite three yards off—there were three in front of him, and the rest behind him—he passed the watch to his left hand, and put it under the end of his coat—he dropped both hands—there was a man by the left side of him—I could not see whether he passed the watch to that man or not—I should not have seen him hand the watch over, because his hand was hanging down.</p>

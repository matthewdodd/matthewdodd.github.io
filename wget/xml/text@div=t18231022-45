On the 3d of October I was with him at Chelsea, when he received his pension, and gave me three sovereigns, half a crown, and a sixpence. I put it in a piece of whitey brown paper, and put it into my pocket. About twelve o'clock we went to the prisoner's apartments, in Royal Hospital-row, dined with her and her husband, and staid till three or four o'clock - we drank all the porter at dinner - I took my money out to pay for more, and she saw it; she and her husband went to shew us the way home; she took us into the Duke of York, public-house; we had a glass of gin and water between us two, and staid there near an hour; it was then dark; we went into another public-house, in Sloane-square; Cluiff, a lodger of hers was with us; we had two glasses of gin and water between us five, came out, and before we parted my husband asked if I had got my money; she was near enough to hear it, and before I could answer she was gone. I felt and missed it all; we went back to her house; she had not got home - we got some officers and went again, and found her alone, but found nothing - her husband left us a quarter of an hour before we parted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you receive the money - A. About twelve o'clock; we had a little porter before we went to her house - my money was safe at the Duke of York - I did not shake hands with her at parting - I accused nobody else of it; I do not know Oglesby; we returned to the Duke of York, thinking she might be there - my husband looked round the room there for the money, thinking she might have left it there. I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I received my pension on this day, and gave my wife all but 2 s.; and opposite the King's Arms, public-house, in Sloane-square, I saw the prisoner take her hand out of my wife's pocket, and pull out a paper somewhat similar to what the money was wrapped in. I asked my wife if her money was safe; she set off before my wife could answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not immediately seize her hand - A Being a friend I did not like; till I was sure she had it - I called her back, and called to Cluiff - neither of them returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did you come into her company - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon - I spent 3 s. 6 d. myself; we had oysters, and four pots of beer among six of us. I was quite sober - my wife was not perfectly sober. We came out of the King's Arms, about six o'clock - I went after her, but did not see which way she went; we found her in an hour and a half, very much intoxicated - I then went to the Duke of York, by desire of the officer, to write my address; and hearing she had been drinking at several houses, I looked about there; I never accused Oglesby of it. Cluiff had left us five minutes before I saw her take the money - she was off directly.</p>

            . I am a constable of Staines. On the 23rd of December, at six or seven o'clock in the evening, I saw James Hall turn the corner of my house with this gun concealed under his arm, with the butt against his foot - I went up to him, knowing him very well; he said,"I have a gun here" - I said, "Why are you seen about in the evening with a gun, when you know what a bad character you have in the town? take my advice, and go with the gun;" I looked at it, and gave it him back again - instead of returning home he went towards London, and it struck me that a person had informed me a gun had been stolen; I followed James, and saw his brother John join him, and he gave the gun to John - I called James, and he stopped; I said, "I want John, he has got the gun" - I went up to him and said, "Let me have the gun;" he resisted my having it, but James said "Let him have it;" James then said he had bought it - I said,"Tell me of whom, and I will go with you to the person"- but he would not; I took him to Mr. Bean, who had informed me the gun had been stolen - the prosecutor came and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening when you saw James Hall? A. Yes; he was alone - I have seen a number a persons go out shooting; they do not carry their guns in the same way I think - it was not till after I had given him the gun back that John came up: they had gone about fifty or sixty yards - I know a man named Stepley, and I think he ought to have been here; James Hall did not say he bought it of Stepley for 17s. - I have an idea that Stepley was in the robbery; he was at the top of the lane when I spoke to James Hall.</p>
               <p>James Hall's Defence. I had six witnesses, but they are not here - they could prove I bought it of Stepley.</p>

            . When the prisoners were examined they said they had not time to get their witnesses - James did say he bought it, but did not say of whom: I said,"I will put my horse into the chaise to go any where to get the person," but he did not tell me.</p>

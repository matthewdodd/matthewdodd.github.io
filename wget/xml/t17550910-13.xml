I had carried in seven pieces of clear lawn, 52 yards, and laid it down on a chair. When I went to pack up my linen, I miss'd them; there were two of her neighbours with her. She and one of them went out; I asked the other that was there, if she knew of it? she said she did not. I desired her to go and fetch the prisoner; she came; I asked her if she saw the lawn? she said she did not. I got a warrant, and searched the house, and found it down in the vault, which was in a sort of a closet in the house.</p>

             . There were seven or eight neighbours of us together at a dinner; we were told the constable was going to search the prisoner's house; so we went along with him. The house consisted of two rooms. I saw the lawn took out of the vault with a pair of tongs; it was roll'd up in paper. The prosecutor was ready to jump through the ceiling when he saw it brought out.</p>

On the morning of 1st June, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, I was on duty in Mitre Street, Aldgate, near Mr. Brinkley's, a fruiterer—I saw three persons near his premises, and the prisoner went in—Obee, another constable, was on duty in King Street, in plain clothes—the other two men ran away when they saw me—I went to Mr. Brinkley's warehouse door, and the prisoner, who was inside, shut it in my face—I stood there for a second, and he opened it and struck me on the head with what I believe to be a life preserver, it cut me just above the forehead; it bled—the prisoner then jumped off the steps and ran through Mitre Street, King Street, and Duke's Place; I followed him, calling, "Stop thief!"—Obee followed—I left my hat behind, it was knocked off—I did not lose sight of the prisoner till he came to Gravel Lane, and then Obee was close alongside of him—I overtook him by Stoney Lane, Obee had then got hold of him; he was very violent—Obee and I took him to the station, but he resisted very much—I searched him at the station, and found on him 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some matches—I had tried the door of Mr. Brinkley's warehouse a quarter of an hour before.</p>

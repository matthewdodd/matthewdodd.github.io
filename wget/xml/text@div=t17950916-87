               <p>Q. Are you a married or a single man? - Single man. Another young fellow and a woman was with her. I took in a handkerchief with a bundle, and which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160237"></xptr>contained two silk handkerchiefs, &amp;c. all tied up in a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there another silk handkerchief besides? - Yes, in the jacket pocket. I laid them down along side of me on the bed, the bed was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress and go to bed? - No; I sat, with the things, along side of her. I sent for a pot of beer and staid there till about one o'clock, and the other parties, they went away; I still had the bundle along side of me for ten minutes after they were gone, and I had occasion to get up to do something for myself, and the prisoner went twice to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the room? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your back turned to her? - Yes. When I came forward to the bed I missed my bundle; I asked her for the bundle; and she said she knew nothing about it. With that she went to go out, and I detained her from going out; when she found that I would not let her go out she seemed rather reconciled, and laid down on the bed. I sat up along side of her till I was rather tired, and I happened to fall back myself and drop asleep; with that the first thing that awaked me was her hand in my pocket, and I had about eight or nine shillings in it altogether; on my stirring with that she drew her hand away from me, and pretended to be asleep; I laid there some time and dropped off again, and she went out, and I did not see any more of her till the morning, she left me in the room. In the morning she came in, and I asked her for my bundle; and she said she knew nothing about it. With that I sent for a constable, and a constable came; the the pawnbroker's, and there he found a waistcoat that she pawned.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of St. Luke's; I produce a waistcoat that I found pledged at Mrs. West's, the corner of Fan-street, Aldersgate-street.</p>

               <p>I live with Mrs. West, in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did you receive that waistcoat which the constable has? - Of the prisoner at the bar, the 3d of July, in the morning, before ten o'clock; I had seen her before; I supposed that she had a husband that belonged to her. The constable called in the morning and I was not in the way, and he took the waistcoat to the magistrate, and has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. To the Constable. Did you examine this woman - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates? - Nothing of the kind.(The waistcoat deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the waistcoat to sleep with me all night. About twelve or one o'clock he came and knocked at my door; there are two or three people more in the lodging house; with that they told us we might go to bed, we should be very safe; and when we awaked in the morning we found the door wide open. It was a common lodging house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. On the solemn oath you have taken, did you give her that waistcoat? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money? - Only some money to get some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid with her all night? - I did, when I found I had lost my bundle.</p>

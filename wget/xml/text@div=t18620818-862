               <p>works at Mr. Watkins, a bookbinder's, in Suffolk-street—he went there, I think, somewhere about Christmas, but I really cannot tell for a certainty—I was up when the prisoner came in on 4th July, at twenty minutes before 11 o'clock—I noticed the time, because I have a clock, up stairs and down, and that is about our time of going to bed—I was sitting smoking my pipe in the kitchen when he came in—I work till between 9 and 10 o'clock—he did not go to bed before me; we went up together—we have two bed<lb></lb>rooms for ourselves, and one which I let to a person that is outside, and the boys slept in a little room over the kitchen—they must come through the bedroom where I sleep; the door is just by my bedside and opens into the kitchen, and they cannot come in or go out of that room without my seeing them—I heard that my son went to Wandsworth for three months out of the four during which I said he had not been working—I believe he came out of Wandsworth gaol the morning before I saw him.</p>

I am the prisoner Palmer's mother—I remember Friday night, 4th July—he came home that night, and went to bed with his brother—I saw him the next morning—what I am saying is quite true—I remember two gentlemen coming to take him up; that recalled the fact to my mind—they called on Sunday, the 6th, the day after; and I offered to show them the bed he had slept in—I went to the station, and before the Magistrate twice, but was not examined—there was no attorney there, and I was not called.</p>

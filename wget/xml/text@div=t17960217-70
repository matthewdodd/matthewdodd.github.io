               <p>(There were several other Counts charging the like forgery, varying the intentions).(The indictment was stated by Mr. Dauncey).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. May it please your Lordship Gentlemen of the Jury. - It becomes my duty on the part of this prosecution, to state to you the nature of the charge against the prisoner at the bar; and of the evidence by which it is supported, in order that you may be able to direct your attention to the principal points of that evidence, and to do that which will be extremely material to the prisoner, and to public justice, to distinguish the application and bearing of the evidence that will be laid before you; because it will be necessary for me to produce a considerable portion of evidence, which of itself will not criminate the prisoner at the bar; in order to establish a fact, without which, we cannot even begin to make a charge against the prisoner. It is certainly equally necessary to justice, that your minds should be prepared, that no further than that evidence is distinctly brought home to the prisoner, by facts fixed upon himself, or clearly within his knowledge, can any tittle of that evidence affect either the life or character of the prisoner; and no man, I am sure, will be more anxious than myself, not even my learned friends, to whom his defence, against so important a charge, is entrusted, will be more anxious than I shall be to point out that distinction in any evidence that I may offer to the Court, and in the outset to do that which my learned friends are not permitted to do, to caution you myself, to strip your minds of every thing which you may have heard or read respecting the transaction in question. The charge against the prisoner arises from a transaction of great public notoriety, and many things may have passed which are entirely unfounded in truth, and, therefore, from any thing you have heard, or any impressions made upon your mind, well or ill-founded, ought you to suffer, in the flightest degree, to enter your minds, but to wipe off, as far as it is possible for human nature to do, every recollection upon the subject, as if you were perfect strangers to every thing but what you may hear in Court, and from that, form your opinion, whether the charge is so made out, as to justify you in finding a verdict that will affect the life of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the crime of forgery is one that is destructive of all security of property, and which tears up by the roots, the confidence necessary to be placed in solemn legal instruments; in short, leads to every kind of plunder, and is therefore justly estimated, by the law, the highest order of crimes that can be committed in a state of civilized society, and punished with death. It is the duty of Juries, in all cases to take care in judicial enquiries, not to proceed upon vague grounds of suspicion, and certainly peculiarly so, in cases that affect the life of the party.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having thus shortly called your attention to the importance of your duty, it becomes necessary to give you as distinct and concise a narrative as possible, of this transaction; I will afterwards point out the more important facts, which apply to the questions you are to try; and give you a general statement of the nature of the evidence by which it is to be supported.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the will in question purports to be the will of a gentleman of the name of Lewis; and the first question for you to decide will be, whether that is the genuine will of the party or not; because, if upon the evidence in this cause, you should find reason, when you have heard both sides, either to think that this is in fact the will of Mr. Lewis, or to entertain any considerable doubt, whether it is or not, we certainly cannot proceed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170104"></xptr>one jot further; for no evidence of suspicious circumstances, no evidence of mysterious conduct, nothing that tends to involve the prisoner in general suspicions, can have the smallest effect; if you are doubtful whether this is a genuine instrument, for the prisoner is not in the outset called upon to prove that it is a genuine instrument; God forbid that he should; but we are called upon to prove, in this case, something which partakes of the nature of a negative, but which is, however, an affirmative proposition, capable of proof that it is a forgery. The first point, therefore, for you to consider is, whether this is the genuine will of Mr. Lewis, or whether it is a forgery; which, if we should establish beyond any reasonable ground of doubt, for you are not to expect mathematical demonstration in the proceedings of the administration of justice; but you are not to pronounce him guilty of a forgery, if a reasonable doubt can be entertained, by conscientious men upon their oaths, fairly considering the circumstances of the case. And, gentlemen, if we should make out that proposition, still the prisoner will stand unaffected, unless we bring home a knowledge and participation of the prisoner in the acts of those persons who fabricated the instrument.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Lewis, the real or supposed testator, was a clergyman, a gentleman of a liberal education, and of considerable accomplishments; a man respected in the neighbourhood in which he lived, for the character of a man of letters, and for a peculiarity of character, which may not be immaterial for your consideration, in estimating the probability of his having first made any will at all; or, secondly, a will of the kind which is the subject of this indictment; he was, besides being a man of letters, a proud and reserved man; not extremely communicative of his affairs; little disposed to confer with strangers, even upon trisling matters, much less upon matters of importance; and still less with persons of inferior rank, or of doubtful and suspicious characters. Mr. Lewis had been, through a considerable part of his life, involved in a litigation respecting the authenticity of his mother's will; it appears from some of the evidence in the cause, that that circumstance had made a strong impression upon his mind; what the nature of that case was, is totally immaterial; and it would only be wasting your time to allude to, further than to explain some of the declarations of Mr. Lewis himself, which have reference to the subject of this charge; it is sufficient that he had a strong impression of the forgery of his mother's will; and that that circumstance weighed so much in his mind, as, joined with other peculiarities in his character, to produce a determination in him, which appears to have continued to the time of his death, never to make a will himself; but, to use his own expression, to let the law make his will, and dispose of his property: you will find, therefore, that upon several different occasions, and to several different persons, for some time antecedent to Mr. Lewis's death, which happened in the month of January, 1795, he has declared, cost he never meant to make a will, and never would; and sometimes with allusions to the transactions of his mothers' will.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you will find also, that he had no great esteem or affection for the family of a person named in this indictment, who is not now forthcoming to public justice; a Baronet, of the name of Sir

            , who had married a cousin of Mr. Lewis's; and in whose favour, as to a very considerable portion of Mr. Lewis's effects, the will in question is supposed to have been made; I mean in favour of Lady Briggs, and her posterity, not to Sir John himself; you will find, however, that the unfavourable impression he had received of the character of Sir John Briggs, had induced him to declare, at a period not very distant from his death, and long subsequent to the date of the supposed will, that none of the Briggs' family should have any portion of his property.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, so circumstanced, resided at Hygga, in Monmouthshire, a few miles distant from the town of Monmouth; he used to go frequently into Devonshire, partly on account of his health; he returned from thence to his own house, with a fevere indisposition, which terminated in his death, which happened at Monmouth, at the house of a relation, Mrs. Kane, the mother of Lady Briggs, in whose favour the will disposes of one half of his real estates, during her life; notwithstanding that circumstance, I believe you will find no hint was ever dropped by him, that he either had made or intended to make any disposition of his property by will; the universal impression by all his family, that this gentleman had died intestate; notice was given of his death to his different heirs at law, for he possessed several estates, some of which came to him by his father, and some through his mother; to his estates at Monmouth, the present prosecutor, Mr. Morgan, was maternal heir at law; there was no trace of a will found among his papers, nor no suspicion entertained, at that time, that any will was made. In that situation, the parties entered into possession of the different estates, and things remained in that situation from the time of his death, the 11th of January, till the 5th of April following; when a very singular transaction happened; a letter was received by a gentleman of the name of Lewis, at Monmouth, from a person of the name of Isgar, dated Bath, who stated, that the Rev. Mr. Lewis was indebted to him for witnessing his will; and, desiring to know where he might address him, in order to be satisfied for the trouble he had taken upon that occasion. This was a very singular occurrence, both in its nature and the time and circumstances, under which it came forward; and it was a singular sort of charge, for, I believe, it is one of the first instances of a bill brought in (at a distance of so considerable time from the date of the will) for being a witness to a gentleman's will. This extraordinary letter excited a great deal of speculation; and Sir John Briggs thought proper to set out for Bath, to enquire for this person, of the name of Isgar; he went with other persons, to Isgar; he asked him, if he knew any thing of a will of Mr. Lewis's; he replied, that he did; and, what is still more surprising, this man, an obscure man, resident at Bath, at this distance from Mr. Lewis's family, not only was a witness to the will, but had the will in his possession. Isgar produced the will; and, on the 5th of May following, this will was brought by Isgar to Monmouth; delivered to Mrs. Kane, the mother of Lady Briggs, who was appointed one of the executrixes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170105"></xptr>Gentlemen, I ought now to state to you, what the will was; it bears date the 10th of August, 1791; near four years before the death of the testator, so that you will find, that most of the declarations of Mr. Lewis, the testator, that he never would make a will, are posterior to the date of the will; that he never had made a will, and never intended to make a will. The will is drawn formally, not with the appearance of having been drawn by a gentleman in Mr. Lewis's situation-a man of letters, a gentleman, and a clergyman; but drawn formally and scientifically; as if it was drawn by a man of the law, as you will find by the provisions.(Reads the will, for which see the evidence).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the parties claiming under the will brought an ejectment for a moiety of the lands lying in Montgomery, against Mr. Morgan, the maternal heir at law of those estates, which had come to the testator from his mother, and who had entered upon them, upon the presumption, that Mr. Lewis died inteslate; that ejectment was tried at the last Summer assizes, at Hereford; and it becomes necessary to state, that upon the trial of that ejectment, a verdict was found against the authenticity of that will, for the defendant, the heir at law; and, here again, I think it my duty, on the part of the prosecutor, to state to you, that you are far from being bound or concluded by that verdict; that verdict does by no means prove this will a forgery; I will go further, I will say, that as against Mr. Crossly it is no evidence, that it is a forgery, because Mr. Crossly was not a party to that cause; nor appeared as an attorney in it, and therefore it is extremely possible that all the evidence may not have been distinctly laid before that Jury; or if it was, that that Jury may have formed a wrong opinion; you are therefore not bound by that verdict even to believe that this will is a forgery, which is the first thing we have to prove; but it is necessary to state that fact to you, that such a verdict was found. The noble and learned Judge, who tried that cause, thought it his duty, in furtherance of public justice, and in order that a transaction of so soul a nature, if that verdict was right, might be the subject of further investigation in a Court of proper jurisdiction; for it then became the subject of criminal jurisdiction; it was thought proper to detain the will: and Austin and Isgar, the witnesses to that will, were apprehended by warrant, and committed to Hereford Gaol; and while they were so in custody, one of those witnesses, whom I have already mentioned as residing at Bath, in an obscure situation, and of no very good character, thought proper to give intimations that he was ready to make a discovery of, what he alledged to be the whole truth; he purports to be a witness to that will; he therefore must have knowledge as to the question whether it is or not the will of Mr. Lewis; it was thought deserving of attention, and conducive to public justice, to attend to his offer; the Mayor of Hereford, accompanied by some other persons, with Mr. Stoke, the attorney for this prosecution, and attorney for Mr. Morgan, upon the trial of that ejectment, attended; Isgar repeated his offers of disclosure, and, in fact, gave an account before the Mayor of, what he stated to be, the truth, of that transaction. You will see, therefore, that that person, who stands in the light of an accomplice, who has witnessed a will, which he now says was a forgery, who upon the trial swore to the execution of that will, must necessarily for public justice, be brought to-day before you as an evidence: I need not, after giving this description of him, tell you, with how much caution you ought to receive testimony from so soul a quarter; I will even go the length of saying, that that testimony is wholly undeserving of credit, unless it is very materially confirmed by circumstances proved by unsuspected witnesses. Upon this verdict, however, and upon this disclosure of Isgar, other parties were apprehended; Sir John Briggs left the kingdom; that circumstance, however it might affect him, if he was now upon his trial, can have no influence upon your judgment with respect to the prisoner. Mr. Holland, another of the parties, has also withdrawn himself from public justice; Bowden, the other witness, being dead.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have thus given you a narrative of the transactions which have led to this prosecution; it will now be necessary more particularly to state to you, the nature of the evidence, by which you will be enabled to form a judgment upon the two questions that will be submitted to your consideration; first, whether you are clearly satisfied that this is not the will of Mr. Lewis, which it purports to be, but is a forgery; and secondly, if it be a forged will, whether you have sufficient proof brought home to the prisoner at the bar, to satisfy you that he was one of the persons concerned, either in the immediate act of the forgery, or in publishing that will, with the knowledge that it was forged.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, that the will is a forgery will be to be collected from the substance of the will itself; from the characters and descriptions of the witnesses that have subseribed it; from the declarations of the testator upon the subject, compared with the will, the date of the will, and certain other evidence in the testator's hand-writing, found in different papers belonging to him, which are pretty strongly applicable to the question, whether the will is or not a genuine will: you will find that this will is made principally in favour of that very family to which the declaration of the testator was applied, long after the date of the will, that they never should have any part of his property; and the authenticity of the will will be still more materially affected by the will itself, which, pursuing the legal form which men of the law are used to, revokes all former wills made by Mr. Lewis, the said testator; from that, you are to infer, in the very teeth of all the declarations that you will hear, that this was not the first will he had made, but that he was in the habit of making wills from time to time; that it was necessary to revoke all former wills; and that applied to a person who repeatedly declared, subsequent to the date of the will, that he had never made a will at all.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you observe the will bears date the 10th of August, 1791, that it purports to be witnessed and executed at Bath; and in point of fact you will learn, if it is necessary, from the noble and learned Judge, who tried the ejectment, that the witnesses swore to the eexcution of it at Bath; and they are, I believe, all of them, residents at Bath; now it will be pretty clearly, and unquestionably proved to you, that on the 10th of August, when this will bears date, Mr. Lewis was at home at Hygga in the county of Monmouth, and it will be prov<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170106"></xptr>ed to you, by something more positive than vague recollection, by accounts of transactions at Hygga in his own writing, of things brought in, and payments made by him to different persons distinctly and regularly from a day prior to the 8th of August, down to the 12th of the same month, and afterwards to the 20th; but, from the 20th to the 27th of the same month, there is no entry made by Mr. Lewis in that book; the possible conclusion at least from which is, that he might have been absent from Hygga at any time, or the whole time, between the 20th and 27th of August. Mr. Lewis having been at home at the time the will bears date, proved clearly that the will could not have been executed by him at Bath; and this being more generally talked of than the prudence and reserve that ought to have been used, would admit, it became pretty well known that there would be strong evidence against this will, if that will was attempted to be applied to the day of its date, it appearing therefore, that that could not be the true date, and that unless the will was antedated, it could not be the will of Mr. Lewis; it is pretty remarkable, that afterwards, upon the proof of the will, the witnesses admitted that the will was antedated, and fixed the time of the execution in that very period in which the blank in this memorandum-book occurred, and a very lame apology indeed was made for antedating it; the reason given, was, that the draft of the will was left blank, and that it was filled up with the word tenth, because there was not room to write a longer word in the blank. Now, when you come to find, that this account was not given till after it was known, that the will could not have been executed on that day, that will be a circumstance of very strong suspicion indeed.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, from these circumstances, therefore, there seems to be strong evidence, that that was not the will of Mr. Lewis, and having laid that foundation of probability, I will add direct and positive testimony, by persons long and well acquainted with the character of his hand-writing, and who, I am told, will be extremely clear upon that point, that this is not his hand-writing. Gentlemen, besides this, you will find a very strong body of evidence, extrinsic of the will, to shew that a will was intended to be forged, and was actually forged for Mr. Lewis; you will find a meeting held with Sir

            , who has left the country, Mr. Holland, who has also left the country, and both of whom are implicated in this indictment. Gentlemen, in furtherance of that you will find, that when Mr. Holland's house was searched, several very material papers were found, which will be applicable to the two different heads of evidence that I have stated to you; at present, I shall confine myself to the general proof, that that will was a forgery, for that Mr. Holland was concerned at least in that forgery, does not at all affect the prisoner; but at Holland's there was found a paper, purporting to be the will of Mr. Lewis, which makes dispositions of the property of Mr.

            , similar to those contained in the will, that is now contended to be his genuine will, similar exactly in the principal demises of the estate, the legacies somewhat differ in their amount, but are to the same persons, and in short there seems to be little doubt, that with the alterations which it would occur to a man of business, to make in this instrument, this paper was the prototype of the will now produced as the genuine will of Mr. Lewis; but that will is so ignorantly drawn, so illiterally expressed, so full of mispelling, in short, upon the face of it, so impossible to be the will of Mr. Henry Lewis, a gentleman and a clergyman of learning and education, that the moment it was read over by a man of sense, or a man of business, the observation which you will find afterwards was in fact made, must occur-this will not do, this can never pass as the will of Mr. Henry Lewis, but there is to that draft a signature of Henry Lewis, much more like his writing, than the will in question; but that is not all, for that paper contains absolute demonstration, that some persons were attempting to forge a will for Mr. Lewis, for it appears most distinctly, that when that draft was rejected as impossible to pass for the true will of Mr. Lewis, persons have been practising upon that sheet of paper, for you will find the name of Henry Lewis written over twelve or thirteen different times, sometimes Henry Lewis, sometimes Lewis only, and sometimes Henry only; in short, to imitate the handwriting of the testator, as will be proved by this paper.</p>
               <p>Why then, Gentlemen, that naturally leads me to the principal evidence in the cause, I mean the evidence Isgar, the accomplice; you cannot expect that many witnesses can give precise and positive testimony to an act of forgery, it will never be committed in the presence of any person who is not implicated in the guilt; it seems to me, therefore, that it can rarely, if ever, by any thing but accident, occur, that a Court, or Jury, can have direct evidence of the fact of forgery from what may be fairly called a credible witness; and in this case, the only direct evidence will be that of an accomplice; and, of an accomplice, I will fairly state to you, as little deserving of credit in himself, as any accomplice that can be called into a Court of Justice; because, he not only comes to tell you, that for hire and reward he became a subscribing witness to a forged will, but afterwards, that he came into a Court of Justice, by perjury, to support that forgery, stating himself to be present at the execution of that will by Mr. Lewis, which, he now says, never was executed at all; therefore, you will certainly not feel yourselves called upon to believe any thing that Isgar says, merely because he says it; or because he says it upon oath. I will now read to you the account Isgar has already given, and will, probably, again give of this transaction. Isgar states, first, a conversation which passed in London, in the month of February, with a person of the name of Clarke, an attorney, in Nottinghamshire, who will make a considerable figure in this transaction; and another person, respecting the writing of a will upon a blank sheet of paper, upon which the persons name should be subseribed. Holland was also present, and a reward was promised, at that time, to Isgar; and, he admits himself, from the pressure of distressed circumstances, to have assented to this wicked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170107"></xptr>plan, and agreed to lend his assistance. He then states, that Holland, in the month of March, brought to his house, at Bath, a draft of a will, purporting to be the will of Henry Lewis; and that this was after the death of Mr. Lewis, that he produced a sheet of paper with the name Henry Lewis written upon it; he says, Holland, at that time, told him, that the paper was old enough; you see the meaning of that; that the will purporting to bear date four years before the testator's death, if the paper had been made a few weeks before, it would have furnished a means of detection. He admits that he himself copied that will upon the piece of paper so prepared he says, he sent it by the post, with a direction that he received from Holland; that Sir John Briggs called upon him with the will which he had so sent, and said, that that will would not do, for that the testator was a very particular man, and certainly would not have signed such a will as that. Sir John took it away, and, afterwards, Holland called again with the same copy, and asked if he could find a witness who could make good marks; upon which, he says, he soon after saw William Austin, the other witness to the will in question, and told him, that he knew how to put him, Austin, in the way of getting 100l. that he told him it was to put his name to a will; and Austin said, that he would do it; he says then, that Holland, Austin, and himself, went to a public-house in Bath, where Holland produced the will so copied; and Holland himself then went through the form of publishing that as the will, and then gave Austin a note for 100l. for value received, payable at Nando's coffee-house; he says, that for some time afterwards, and in his original account, given before the Mayor of Hereford, it appears, that the first time he saw Sir

He states that they were sent by Sir

He says Austin wrote his own name, and then the name of

He says, Mr. Crossley dictated a letter for him to write to Mr. Morgan, at Monmouth, which he accordingly did.

               <p>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the account of this nefarious transaction, by a party confessing himself to be an accomplice. Gentlemen, from the difficulty of bringing forth transactions that in their nature shun the light; the wisdom of the law does not wholly reject the restimony of accomplices, but directs Juries to receive it with great caution; unquestionably, because a man who comes into Court to impute to himself a degree of guilt equal to that of the prisoner at the bar, is not entitled to the same belief as what the law calls a fair and credible witness; but it would be perfect nonsense if the law admitted such evidence to be examined, and at the same time said, that when he is examined, you shall in no case be permitted to believe it; that would be an absurdity, which cannot be imputed to the laws of this country. The law therefore takes the middle line, which is the line of justice and common sense; it says, we will hear what a man has to say, who even stands (to make use of that vulgar expression) in that blasted situation that I have described; but we will hear him with caution; we will attend very minutely to the circumstances of the story that he tells; we will judge of its probability; but we will go further, we will examine whether he is so confirmed by written evidence, or by facts proved by credible witnesses, as to satisfy the Jury, that though the story is told by a person who himself is not worthy of belief, is nevertheless a true story.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I have endeavoured fairly to state the point of view in which you are to consider the evidence that is to be given by Isgar, and it now becomes my duty to state to you, what the circumstances are, by which this evidence of Isgar is to be consumed. Then, Gentlemen, the first material thing that Isgar states is, that

             subsequent application; now that will be confirmed in the most clear and satisfactory manner, by the fabricated draft, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170108"></xptr>which I have already observed; with that number of names to it, found in Holland's house; that therefore Holland was possessed of a paper, as described by Isgar, is certainly true; for that is proved beyond a possibility of doubt. Another very particular circumstance that confirms it is, that this very paper is in the hand-writing of Isgar, who says he wrote it. Another very remarkable thing is, Holland saying to him, that the paper was old enough; now you will find, that in a letter found at Crossley's house, from Clarke, couched in very mysterious terms, which indicated pretty strongly, that they were engaged in some nesarious transactions together, and which concludes with this remarkable expression,"I have some very choice paper forty years old:" so said Clarke to Crossley, on the 6th of March, 1795. The other parts of the letter are so unintelligible, that I have not ingenuity enough to apply them to this or any other transaction. Gentlemen, when you find that, and also the other correspondence that will be produced to you, between Clarke, Crossley, and Holland, writing to one another in this enigmatical manner, will confirm that part of the testimony of Isgar.</p>

               <p>The next point in which Isgar's testimony is confirmed will be this, that after Austin had subscribed his name to the paper produced by Holland, and had agreed to become a witness, Holland gave Austin a note for 100l. payable at Nando's coffee-house, for value received. I will give you unquestionable proof that that part at least of Isgar's testimony is true, because that when Austin was apprehended at Hereford, that very note was found in Austin's hat. That note is antedated; for it is stated by Isgar to be in March, 1795; and the note is dated the 12th of December, 1794; and when that note is produced, you shall have the examination of it; you shall hold it up to the light, and you will see very clearly, that though it bears date upon the face of it on the 12th of December, 1794, the note was written some time in 1795; because you will see that the figure 4 is written over a 5; that therefore must have been written in 1795: it was delivered to Austin in March 1795; the 12th of December, 1794, therefore, could not have been the date of it. That part of Isgar's testimony, therefore, is true beyond all doubt.</p>
               <p>The next confirmation of Isgar is this, that in April he and Austin came up, at the desire of Sir 
               <persName id="t17960217-70-person722">
                  John

            , to London, to meet Crossley, where the forgery was committed. Now I shall prove that Austin and he appeared in London together about that time; that will be proved by the person with whom Isgar lodged, in St. Martin's-lane; and by the sister of Austin, who will prove that Austin was in town at that time; and the person with whom Isgar lodged will prove that Austin came to him while he was there: that is another confirmation of Isgar's evidence. His connexion with Crossley will also be proved; from some very material circumstances it will appear to you, that Crossley was seen with these men, by credible witnesses; and the witness says, that Mr. Crossley made use of the same expression to him that Holland had before done, in telling the witness that he had taken care in seeing that the paper was old enough for these purposes; there it is only necessary to remind you again of Clarke's letter to Crossley, stating, that he had got choice paper forty years old. He says then, that Mr. Crossley dictated the letter he wrote to Monmouth, respecting the will; that may or not be true; it is no further confirmed than shewing that they were together; but that such a letter was received is certain, for it bears date upon the 5th of April, and being antedated, it was not received till a period late enough to be written after the time he met. Crossley in London; it was not actually received, I believe, till the latter end of April, some days after Isgar had been in town, and had been seen with Mr. Crossley. Then Isgar states, that he was to have 500l.; that he received a bill of 501. which he paid to Crossley, and 10l.; in that you will find him confirmed by a letter of Crossley's, on the 2d of May, to Holland; in which he states that fact; and in another letter of the 2d of June to Holland, he says, "I have now advanced 70l. 10s."60l. on account of his bill for the goods, in which"your 50l. is included." So that it is a proof that Mr. Crossley paid 10l. and this bill for 50l. makes exactly the 60l.; in which Mr. Crossley himself states, the bill is included."The ten guineas is paid by order of"Monsieur." We cannot say who that was; it was likely to be Sir

Then, he says, "however let me have the 70l. 10s. by" return of post, and it may be best to let him have 40l."more, as he so much presses; but of this do as you"please; I told him, you ought not to pay for the"goods till the sale money was paid to you." Now these are circumstances which do pretty strongly confirm the testimony of Isgar. There is also in this letter of the 2d of May, very strong matter of crimination against the prisoner; for you will find him giving a false account of some transactions, in which he was then concerned; in that letter you will find the prisoner had the andacity to make use of the name of that very respectable gentleman who at this moment attends here, I mean Sir

             upon the 2d of May, Mr. Crossley says,"When I saw Sir

             here, he then advised,"and it was agreed, that Mr. Eberno should be at the"King's-head, upon Monday at eleven. I have since"then settled the matter of Eberno, which Mrs. Allen"last wrote about, and the bail was put in, so that"nothing can, but his own want of prudence, prevent"his attending to the appointment; he set off by the"coach at four this morning." Now that part of the letter leads into a very extraordinary transaction indeed, and I believe I may venture to prophesy, that Sir John Scott will tell you he never gave such advice, and that he has not any knowledge who this Mr. Eberno is; it is necessary, however, that you should know who he is, and I think I can prove that Mr. Eberno is no other than Isgar, the witness; I will shew you that Isgar, who will swear to the forgery at the time I have stated, staid in town after that, till the 2d of May, which is the date of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170109"></xptr>this letter, that he did set out from town at or about four o'clock on that morning; and I will prove, that on the preceding day, bail was put in for Isgar, by a Mr.

            , and paid for by Mr. Crossley, which I will prove by a book found at Crossley's, and that Crossley gave to Isgar two guineas, with three guineas and a half which he states was given to him before. I will shew you that Isgar left town that morning at four, as Eberno is stated to have done, and that no bail was put in for any person of the name of Eberno. You will also find that Eberno was to be at the King's-head on Monday, and that Crossley writes to Holland, and expresses great uneasiness at not hearing of Isgar's arrival; it will apear that Isgar was not at the King's-head, as Eberno was expected to be, but was prevented, as he says, for want of money; he goes, in fact, to Bath, and from Bath to Monmouth, but not till late on Tuesday the 5th, when he carried the will in question; and Mr. Crossley afterwards had advice from Mr. Clarke of the arrival of Isgar at Monmouth, upon which you will find he sets his mind at rest, which it was not till then, owing to the non-arrival of Eberno at the King's-head on the 4th. He says, "I hope Sir"

The conclusion of the letter says, "I hope Mr. Eberno will not be kept an"hour at the King's-head, as I have given him orders to"depart as soon as possible." So that as soon as Isgar had done his business, that is, carried the will, he wished him to get away as fast as possible, and I believe, when you are satisfied that Eberno means Isgar, you will have as little doubt that Sir

             and Mr. Crossley; after that, Mr. Crossley returned to London, and you will probably find that the forgery was there planned, which was afterwards executed at Mr. Crossley's house.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, another circumstance will strongly confirm the account given by Isgar; he tells you the way in which he received the 60l. he says, Mr. Crossley gave him change out of it; he says, that Mr. Crossley gave him two Abergavenay bank-notes for five guineas each; I will prove that two such notes were seen in the hands of Isgar at that time; he tells you further, that Mr. Crossley paid him that 10l. by a draft upon his bankers, Morland, Hammersley, and Co. in Pall-mall; I will prove by the clerks of that house, that that draft was received by a man of the name of Isgar, so that in many points his story is confirmed, and in many points that connect him with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is, besides that, a letter found in Mr. Crossley's possession, from Clarke, manifesting some intelligence he had received from Mr. Crossley, by means of a person of the name of Vincent, who is referred to in some other of the letters, in which he says, on the 13th of September, 1705, (a letter found at Crossley's, after Holland's house was searched);</p>
               <p>"I"have received your's, and am sorry Dixon's sample"is found; what a fool must he be to write so many"names as you say he hath done." Now I will prove Dixon to be a name by which Holland was known; and when I produce the draft of the will, with so many names subcribed to it, it is impossible to doubt that this will is a forgery, and that this letter had reference to it. He says, "What a fool must he be to write so many names,"as you say he hath done; you may be certain it is all"his own doing; I have had no letter. - Vincent called"here while I was with you; he said, he should call"again before he went back into the West, and from"him I shall have the whole history."</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, these circumstances confirm very strongly the testimony of this witness, in points directly connected with the prisoner at the bar. - And, Gentlemen, at the time Mr. Crossley was apprehended at his house, in the Adelphi, the first paper that appeared lying upon his desk, was the blank cover of a letter, having the Hereford post-mark upon it; and being of a date referrable to this transaction, it suggested itself instantly, that some light might be thrown upon the transaction by this letter; Mr. Crossley went to his private drawer, but upon being asked respecting that cover, he he denied having any knowledge of the letter from which that cover was torn; he supposed it was something that had been destroyed by some of his clerks; upon opening the private drawer; there were two particular papers, upon which Mr. Crossley made this observation, I suppose this is what you want. - Now you shall hear what that was which Mr. Crossley supposed they wanted; you will find it was the half sheet torn off the cover I have already described to you, and as that will be matter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170110"></xptr>of eye-sight, I shall say but little to you upon the subject; if you place them together, it will appear that the waterlines in the paper correspond, and the water-merk is torn in the middle; you will therefore be convinced, that that is the letter which belonged to that cover; it is a letter from. Hereford, written by Austin to Crossley; the evidence of it, as against Mr. Crossley, is, its being found in his possession, under the circumstances I have stated; it is a letter complaining of the hardships they had suffered in jail, Isgar and Austin being then in jail; upon this charge, Isgar not having at that time made any discovery; it is dated the 29th of September,</p>
               <p>"I"shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible, to"know what we are to do, &amp;c." (See the Evidence). Now this letter from Austin is found in a private drawer at Crossley's; it is first denied by him, and then he said, this is, I suppose, what you want. This is a very strong circumstance, which seems to have nothing particular in it, except from the story of Isgar; and is a very essential paper to implicate Mr. Crossley in the transaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg pardon for having taken up so unreasonable a portion of your time; I have endeavoured to point out, as clearly as I could, the circumstances brought home to the prisoner at the bar, by which the evidence of Isgar will be confirmed; and the greater part of those circumstances are by written evidence, proceeding very much from the prisoner himself, or found in his possession; if therefore the evidence of a person, totally discredited as to his own veracity, can meet with belief in a Court of Jutice, and if it cannot, I know no purpose for which the law receives it; the circumstances of confirmation do appear to entitle this evidence to be received at least, with much attention, and well weighed by the Jury. It is not my duty to press it further upon your minds, you will judge for yourselves; assisted by the directions you will receive from the learned Judge on the beneh, whether applying the whole of those circumstances that fairly do apply to the evidence of Isgar, weighing on the one hand the character of the witness, and on the other the material circumstances in which he is confirmed, you will pronounce your judgment whether you believe that evidence or not.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I shall call the evidence on the part of the prosecution, again asking pardon for having trespassed so much upon your time, in the sincere hope that the evidence may not come up to my statement; no man will be better satisfied, if, upon a full and fair examination of all the circumstances, you should feel yourselves authorized (in point of conscience, and with attention to your duty, and the oath you have taken) to acquit the prisoner at the bar, than I shall be; but if you should entertain no rational doubt, and your minds are clearly satisfied(as in a case of this nature you ought to be) of these two propositions - that the will is a forgery, and under the knowledge of the prisoner; then it is a duty you owe the public, to bring to justice the perpetrators of so foul a transaction as this.</p>

               <p>Q. From whose hand did you receive it? - A. I believe Lord Kenyon's; I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. As to whether that instrument was read in the cause or not, that of course you can only speak to from memory of the supposed contents? - A. I marked it at the time, and have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>THOMAS STOKES sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Mils. I am an attorney, at Monmouth; I was acquainted with Mr. Lewis till the day of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time? - A. For about eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, were you employed by him to transact any business; or were you acquainted with his house? - A. For upwards of seven years I was attorney for him in several causes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Lewis? - A. A clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. What fortune had he? - A. I believe he had estates, freehold and copyhold, to the amount of 800l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any personal estate? - A. Very trisling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his habits of life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they; with whom did he associate? - A. With Mrs. Kane and me; at Sidmouth and Monmouth he passed most of his time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he live with persons of his rank, or persons of inferior rank? - A. With persons of his own rank.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was a scholar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How nearly was Mrs. Kane related to him? - A. I believe they called one another cousins; but I don't know whether they were so related.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you often seen him write? - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen him write his name often? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that signature and say what you believe of it? - A. I have examined it frequently, and my opinion upon my oath is, that it is not Mr. Lewis's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. State any thing you see particular in that hand-writing that makes you think so? - A. It is wrote more formal, not with that degree of freedom and case with which Mr. Lewis generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170111"></xptr>wrote; from the observation I have made upon it, it appears to me as if some part of the pen had went over after some of the letters were formed.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of his hand-writing, and your observation upon that, what is your opinion? - A. That it is not the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of your acquaintance with Mr. Lewis, hear him at any time, and when did you first hear him, speak about his will? - A. In 1789, I was concerned in Iitigating a cause for him about his mother's will; I was in London with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, we humbly conceive, that this can be no evidence; it is most truly, most distinctly, and most honourably stated by my learned friend, who has just now opened the case for the prosecution, that it cannot be, unless this will is brought home to the prisoner. My Lord, if we were in a civil cause here between persons, litigating this property, connected with this family, and capable of course from that connexion of applying for evidence to counteract evidence of the description that is now given; I understand the objection was not taken before the noble and learned Lord who tried the cause, but supposing it was taken; if it was admissible there, it is not admissible here: Mr. Crossley stands (a mere stranger to the deceased), charged with a crime, and therefore, if the authenticity of the will is first to be settled or destroyed, and if Mr. Crossley cannot be affected till that authenticity is destroyed, the authenticity ought not to be effected by the evidence now offered before your Lordship; because having no concern with this testator, undoubtedly he has not the opportunity of answering it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the evidence, now offered, is, declarations of the testator, of two sorts; with respect to his being testate or intestate, and with respect to his intention, whether he should die without a will or not; and to be sure there are many persons, very honourable persons, have, during their life-time, stated such declarations, that they have made no will, when it has turned out afterwards that they have made one; I speak from my own experience; declarations of this kind are frequently made, when the persons themselves have actually made a will; and therefore I conceive it to be extremely dangerous to admit this upon the first branch of the cause; the question, whether this be or not Mr. Lewis's will, I submit, is not evidence; it is impossible to enlarge upon it, it is a simple question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I think I am merely to consider it from the situation in which Mr. Crossley stands; Mr. Crossley, being here in this situation, has a right to object to any part of the testimony, however it may appear to the Court, only to be matter of form or not; he having a right to object to that testimony, so he offers his objections to your Lordship; now, my Lord, a declaration made by this gentleman, he not now being living, there is no posible way in the world in which that declaration, as I conceive, in a criminal cause, could be produced here. My Lord, if he had made that declaration in articulo mortis, it could not have been produced; no situation could have been given to render that declaration available, and indeed it passes as a mere hearsay, not applicable to the case, but only applicable to that first part of the case, which the learned Sergeant has acknowledged he must establish, before he can go to the immediate corpus delecti here, but having a reference by possibility; here the prisoner calls upon your Lordship to pause before you receive it, and before it is received, I take it for granted, that your Lordship would expect from the gentlemen on the other side, to say under what sanction this declaration would be made evidence in a Court of Justice; that it has a bearing upon the first part of the case, which we, as counsel for the prisoner, are bound in duty to take; it appears to me, without troubling your Lordship further, that it is impossible in the nature of things, that any thing that gentleman has said, in the course of his life, under any sanction whatever, could be made evidence in a Court of Justice, in a case where the prisoner is trying for his life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. My brother Adair stated, in the opening, very properly, two points to consider, whether it is a forged will or not; and whether it was forged by Mr. Crossley. As to the first, if Mr. Crossley had nothing to do with it, it is of no consequence whether it is a forged will or not; but it is incumbent upon the prosecutor to make out that this is a forged will; I think it is evidence subject for the observation of the Jury; his declarations are, in my opinion, evidences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. State the declarations you have heard him make respecting a will? - A. I was in London with him in 1789; I was then concerned for him respecting litigating his mother's will; he lodged at Peele's coffee-house, in Fleet-street; and there, in the act of writing a letter, fell down in a sit; I thought it a very proper opportunity to remind him of the unsettled state of his own affairs; he told me then, he had not made a will; he never would make a will; the law should make his will; in the year 1791, I received a letter from a Mrs. Harman, of Bristol, who was the heir at law of Mr. Lewis, and in very distressed circumstances.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not tell us the contents of that letter. - A. I made an application to Mr. Lewis, to relieve her necessities; this he refused, on account of his own pecuniary embarrassments; saying, that she must wait till he was dead, then she would have all; she being his heir at law.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the person, I believe, who is now claimant? - A. It is upon the paternal side; he had frequently told me, that she was his heir at law; in the month of October, 1793, I received a letter from a Mr. Jacobs, of Bristol against Mr. Lewis, desiring to have him arrested; Mr. Lewis and I had a little shyness in consequence of it; I thought it my duty to send for him; I informed him of the circumstance of having a writ against him: on the 22d of October he was at my house, for the purpose of putting in bail to that writ; I joined in a bail-bond with him.</p>

I am coming to it; he then told me that he had never made a will; he never would make a will; and that the law should make his will; this I am positive was on the 22d of October; I don't confine myself to these three times only, he has many times told me so; but I don't fix my memory as to the times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him make any contrary declarations? - A. Never; they were constant and uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Lewis die? - A. The 11th of January, 1795, and was buried on the 16th of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before any mention was made, or any report made of a will? - A. I heard of a letter being sent to Monmouth the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Kane lived at Monmouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he die? - A. At Mr. Kane's house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have some papers here? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce those you had from Mr. Phillips first? - A. All but one, which I had from the officer that searched the house,

               <p>Q. You had better mark them? - A. These papers I found in Mr. Crossley's house, (ties them together and marks them).</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Mr. Crossley's house? - A. On the 7th day of October last, I went with a search warrant, backed by one of the officers at Bow-street; and a warrant to apprehend Mr. Crossley at the same time; Sayer, an officer, went with me; I found these papers I now hold in my hand, and a cover of a letter, on Mr. Crossley's desk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you come upon him by surprise? - A. Yes; he did not resist any thing; I asked Mr. Crossley for the contents of that cover; I saw the Hereford post mark upon it; and that made me so pressing for the contents of it; he made me some kind of an evasive answer, either that they were destroyed, or he knew nothing of them; we then proceeded to our search, and I permitted Mr. Crossley to take his papers out of his private drawer; the key of which he had: and I observed that he kept under his left hand two small papers; and appeared anxious to conceal them; I told him, he must let me have them; and then he gave them to me, saying, I suppose this is what you want; and he then gave me the two papers I now hold in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he point to one of them particularly? - A. No; he did not; he gave them me both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him upon the letters appearing to be signed by the name of Clarke? - A. Yes; he told me it was Mr. Clark of Worksop; I then took the papers away; there were some books also.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get those papers from? - A. Millar, the officer, gave them to me; I made him mark them; and they have never been out of my possession; these books have been out of my possession some time: upon Mr. Crossley going to Hereford, he wished to have access to these books; I gave them to Mr. Barrow, the Mayor of Hereford, on the 10th of October; I think that was the day that Mr. Crossley was committed; I did not take the books from Mr. Crossley's house; Sayer, the officer took them; he has marked them, and I marked them also.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were found at Mr. Crossley's, and you have them here? - A. Yes; I received them from Mr. Barrow, in December last; since which they have not been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have the register of Bowden's death, the other witness to the will? - A. I have,(produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined this? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an exact copy? - A. It is; from the parish of Bethwick, in the county of Somerset; he was buried the 10th of November, 1794, (the witness produces a copy from the bail-book, of the bail put in for Isgar upon the 1st of May, 1795).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search for any bail put in by Isgar? - A. I have searched in the Crown office for the whole of Hilary term, 1795, and Easter; there is no recognizance in the name of Eberno: I made the same search at the Prothonotary's of the Court of Common Pleas; afterwards at the Three Secondaries of the Court of Common Pleas; afterwards at the Four Judges Chambers; the Court of King's Bench; Exchequer office; Lincoln's Ian; I searched through every office, and could find no such thing: this is an office copy of the record of the judgment in the cause of Doe, on the demise of Kane and others, against Morgan, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Mills. Q. I believe you were present, or applied to by Isgar, before he was admitted to bail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You cannot, in this stage, go into that, (produces the attachment upon which the bail was put in).</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Lewis upon the subject of the family of the Briggs's, and particularly respecting his will? - A. The conversation I had was, I used to ask Mr Lewis about Sir John Briggs; he said, he knew little or nothing about Sir John, and he should not concern himself about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about this son? - A. I had; I told Mr. Lewis that Sir John's son would probably be at my house with the other officers of the militia, and asked him to come and spend the evening there; he told me, as Sir John's son was there, he should not come; I said, if he was displeased with Sir John, why with his son; that as he had some property to leave, he said, he should never give any thing, directly or indirectly, to Sir John, or any part of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him say whether he had or not made a will? - A. I never heard him say it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently seen him write. - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Have you frequently seen him write his name? - A. Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that will, and see if you believe that to be the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis? - A. I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. In what does it appear to you to differ? - A. Mr. Lewis would take his pen from the end of the n, before he made the r; and frequently be a break off between the n and the r.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon the whole, do you believe that or not to be his hand-writing? - A. I believe it is not his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted before that time with Mrs. Kane? - A. Yes; intimately and confidentially.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you called in upon the death of Mr. Lewis? - A. I was; in consequence of a note that I received, I went to Mrs. Kane's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any searches when you were there? - A. Yes; I searched the pocket-book of Mr. Lewis, and the other papers brought to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was this? - A. The 11th of January.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon that search, did you or not find any will of Mr. Lewis? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.(Hands him a book). Do you know that book? - A. Yes; I saw this book with some other papers sent me from Sidmouth, by Mrs. Jenkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand-writing? - A. I have very frequently seen Mr. Lewis write, and I believe this is hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that will, and tell me, whether in your opinion that is the hand-writing of Mr. Lewis? - A. I don't think it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you speak generally, or are there any particular circumstances in the writing that induce you to say so? - A. It appears differently from the signature that I have seen him sign several times.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the difference between this signature and that you have seen him sign several times? - A. The letters appear to be rough, and not with the same freedom and ease that he was used to write with.</p>
               <p>Q. By rough, do you mean jagged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any to Mr. Phillips; and where did you get these papers that you did deliver to Mr. Stokes? - A. I had received a number of papers that I had received from

               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. As to that kind of evidence, as far as my own practice has gone, it is such slight evidence, that forte persons will say one thing and some another; I have heard witnesses say, that in their opinion a signature must be a forged one; and on the other hand, others have said, that they did not believe it to be a forged one.</p>

               <p>Q.Shortly state if you remember hearing him make any declarations respecting his will? - A. He has frequently declared to me he never intended to make his will; that the law had made his will.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before his death? - A. As nearly as I can recollect, about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what way he expressed himself; did he speak of his intention to make one? - A. That he had had so much trouble with his mother's, that he never would make one.</p>
               <p>Right Hon. Lord KENYON sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adoir. Q. Does your Lordship recollect examining the witnesses to the will in question, when it was produced at Hereford assizes? - A. Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Will your Lordship have the goodness to state to the Court the account given by one of those witnesses, Austin, with respect to the execution of that will?</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. If I could, in point of form, appeal to the noble and very learned Judge to pronounce upon the competency of the evidence, I should not trouble the Court; because, if my own life was at stake, instead of the gentleman's at the bar, I should be very glad to have that matter decided by the noble Judge who is called upon to give evidence, and I shall only say it does appear to me to be so extraordinary a proposition, that I shall not offer another sentence upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I should wish my brother Adair to state how it can affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I conceive that upon the question whether this is or is not a genuine will, the account given of that will by the witnesses who attested the execution of it, is evidence against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Where are those witnesses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Austin is in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. You cannot examine his Lordship certainly to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. As far as they do go upon the question of its being a genuine will or not, though it has not the least relevancy, and if I had been informed that he had said one single word respecting Mr. Crossley in that examination, I am sure I would not have called the noble and learned Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Do the witnesses swear that it is a forged will?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Adair. No, my Lord, it is perhaps a little awkward upon the question of admissibility.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. If Austin was here, and they were both upon trial, I certainly could not resist the evidence; but as it is not so, I certainly must.</p>

               <p>Q.From whom did you inherit it? - A. I was in possession of it as maternal heir to Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Sir JOHN SCOTT sworn.(A paper handed to him).</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Do you know a person of the name of Eberno? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give any advice to Mr. Crossley whatever, touching the subject matter of that letter? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge of the facts referred to in it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea perhaps of going into the West at that time? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Q. You inherited that estate as maternal heir at law? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did you reside from Mr. Lewis during the latter part of his life? - A. About five miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, as you were to inherit a considerable part of his property, that you frequently visited, and were upon very intimate terms? - A. Not for the last two years of his life.</p>
               <p>Q.I don't mean to ask any improper question; but was the property, supposing this will to be out of the question, devolving to you, considerable? - A. To the best of my recollection it is worth nearly 200l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, though there was no particular intimacy between you for the last two years, did you meet occasionally upon friendly terms? - A. I cannot say we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Very much the contrary, I believe? - A. Yes; he had taken offence at some part of my conduct, and refused to speak to me when I accosted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170115"></xptr>Q. So that if accidentally you met in the street, and had civilly accosted him, he would not notice you? - A. After he had refused me once or twice, I never attempted it.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately might you have seen him before his death? - A. I cannot speak with any accurate precision; it might be within three or four months to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his resentment continue down to the time of his death, as far you know? - A. We were not upon speaking terms, as I told you, for the last two years of his life time.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Kane? - A. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. The mother of Lady Briggs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Lewis pass a great deal of his time at her house; we have heard that he died there? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Court. The last witness said that he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Q. Do you know what proportion the part that you took, as maternal heir, bore to the whole property? - A. In the proportion of 170 to 830.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have not been intimate with him for the last two years of his life; upon what terms were you with him the two years before? - A. Upon very good terms.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. My son and Mr. Holland; we went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sir John there when you first came into the room? - A. Sir John was not come when I went into the kitchen; Mr. Morgan said, don't go away yet, I expect the Baronet presently, he is gone in search of Mr. Lewis's will, I hope he will bring good news with him; soon after he came in, and Mr. Morgan asked what news, he looked very down, and said, he could not find a will; we went into the parlour and stopped till two or three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Sir John say any thing more about the will? - A. Mr. Morgan asked him if he had met with any intelligence of the will; he said, no, he blamed Madam Kane, and said, through her conduct he had lost 2000l. or upwards; I said, sure, was it so much; he said, at least that; he said Mr. Phillips came up from, Monmouth to give us the possession of the effects; I refused it, he said, had he been there, he would have had a will, or would have choaked him. Mr. Holland said it was not too late to have a will; Mr. Holland said, if you had a will, how would you do as to signing it; Mr. Holland said he would trust no man to sign it, he would do it all himself; Mr. Holland tapped me on the shoulder, and said, I will run the risk of my neck for Sir John; and Sir John, and Mr. Morgan, and Mr. Holland, went all three out of the parlour together, and left my son and I in the parlour; they stopped out some little time, it might be from five to ten minutes for what I recollect; Mr. Holland then returned in by himself; he desired me to be absent; in a few minutes in came Sir John and Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out? - A. I did not at that time; when they came in, as is always a custom, in Mr. Morgan's house, he said, Weaver, clear the board, and then be going home; I said to my son, it is time for us to be going; I looked for my hat, and felt for some silver, I had none, Sir John gave me a thilling, I went out and gave the shilling to the girl and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, did you see Sir John before the will was produced? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time seeing a man of the name of Vincent? - A. I saw him several times, particularly one morning after the affizes at Heretord.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen him at Mr. Holland's house? - A. I had never been at Mr. Holland's house when Vincent was there, till that day, after the affizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the family? - A. Yes; I took him to be a part of the family.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at the trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him in the neighbourhood? - A. Yes, several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember that? - A. I recollect it very well; I wrote my name upon it with a pencil; Mr. Lewis took the papers away with him.</p>

               <p>Q. And always in the same way? - A. As near as I recollect; I might not recollect every transaction of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the fire lit in the parlour before you went in, or after? - A. I believe, before we went in.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very cold at that time? - A. Very cold.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a remarkable expression you have used-Mr. Holland tapped you on the shoulder and said, I will run the risk of my neck for Sir John? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite as certain of that as any other part of the conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a remarkable part of the conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined at the affizes of Hereford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say a syllable of this at that time? - A. I believe, I did not recollect it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You certainly did not state it at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Holland there at that time? - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen to know whether he was there or not? - A. I believe, he was ill at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not state it at Hereford? - A. I might forget a great many expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John was very much cast down? - A. He seemed to be low, when he came in, his spirits recoverted, and he damned, and swore pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. He complained he had had a fruitless journey? - A. I think he said he had been at the Star in search of the will, between the passage and Hereford.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether you or your son recollect the cir-cumstance of Mr. Holland saying he would run the risk of his life for Sir John? - A. I told my son to recollect as near as he could every passage that happened that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that; since you came to town, of before? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Hereford affizes, or after? - A. Before the affizes.</p>
               <p>Q.Your son Tom told you what he had recollected? - A. He shewed it me, he had put it down upon paper; after Mr. Phillips had been at our house, he wrote down his recollections upon paper, and I did the same as near as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the affizes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken the trouble to write down since, any thing that you have recollected? - A. Yes; before I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you brought it with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it this circumstance of Mr. Holland's tapping you on the shoulder, and telling you he would run the risk of his neck for Sir John, first struck you? - A. I made a memorandum of it before the affizes; but I had forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your son's memorandum? - A. I cannot say, I believe he did not recollect it, when of course we compared papers together.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John had no shyness about this at all; he spoke of it as you and I should about buying beasts at the market? - A. It was publicly enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Holland asked, how would you manage respecting the signing of it; and then Mr. Holland said, I would trust nobody to sign it but myself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure Sir John made no answer to it? - A. I am positive he did not; there was nobody present in the parlour when he tapped me upon the shoulder, but my son and myself; Mr. Morgan was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir John was not in the room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But I am speaking as to the time that he tapped you upon the shoulder? - A. He was in the room then.</p>
               <p>Q. And nobody answered the question? - A. No; he put the question and answered it himself; he said, I would not trust any body; I would do the will myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time Mr. Holland and Sir John and your son were all present? - A. Just so, and Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. You were attentive to the question he put to Sir John? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, if Sir John had made an answer, you are sure you must have heard it? - A. I am positively sure he made no answer.</p>

               <p>Q.Take it into your hand; that information which you have in your hand, you know, of course, as you have reason to know, and to recollect, the contents of that information you have sworn to?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. This is a cross-examination before he is sworn in chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I certainly could, if I chose, read the whole of it: you have, in that information, contradicted directly, the oath you made at the affizes? - A. Yes; I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Now, then, you will withdraw.(The witness goes out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, the objection I am about to make is, to the competency of this witness; and, my Lord, I make that objection after very long deliberation, and after much discussion of the subject. Your Lordship may depend upon it, that in what I now say, I am strictly addressing myself to the Court; I could indeed give your Lordship my honour, if it were necessary, that I rise simply to address the Court upon that point of law, and not by a side wind to depreciate the witness in the understanding of the Jury.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the objection that I take to Isgar is this, that the whole foundation of the credit which is due to any witness in Court, as Mr. Sergeant Adair has well expressed it, is, that he speaks under the solemnity of an oath; your Lordship can hear nothing from any man under any other fanction. My Lord, I admit, if any credit whatever can be given to his oath in a Court of Justice, he must be examined, however blassed his character may be, however he may be a witness totally unworthy to stand in a Court of Justice, however in the opinions of all who receive his evidence, and are to deside upon it, he may he perjured; upon subjects collateral to the subject in question, I would not waste your Lordship's time upon the objection; because, however infamous a man may be, however it may be his ordinary habit to impose no rules of veracity upon himself, he is still a witness; and upon this plain ground, that a man, however wicked, is not always wicked; he has not always temptations to wickedness; and although a man may have forsworn himself a thousand and a thousand times, unless the mark is set upon him, by a judgment of perjury, he shall be received as a witness, because his oath may have some value in the particular instance in which he is to be sworn; because his oath has never been opposed by his oath in the particular instance; and it is impossible for the Judge to say, that the man is not entitled, perhaps in the opinion of the Jury, to some scintilla of credit upon which other testimony may be built. But, my Lord, the objection which I take to the witness is this, that he is called up here, or he is called up for no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170120"></xptr>thing; to say that that will to which he has given authenticity upon his oath before the learned and noble ludge, who sat here some time ago, at Hereford, which he swore he saw executed in the presence of the deceased

            ; that he did not see him execute it; that it was not signed in his presence, or in the presence of the witnesses. Now, my Lord, the first matter I have to ask your Lordship is this, and by the answer I receive to that proposition, let my objection stand or fall, are these two propositions collateral to one another, or are they not? - If they are not absolutely inconsident, and abselutely and directly repugnant to one another, my objection falls undoubtedly as it ought. Suppose I had asked him-did you not, at the affizes at Hereford, swear you saw a man on Thursday: and after that, swore you did not see the same man on Thursday? in matter, collateral to the subject, it might have been said, and truly, to destroy all credit due to this man; because, how can the Jury take the oath of a man who has acknowledged in public Court, that he has forsworn himself? yet, peradventure, the man who has forsworn himself upon these different occasions, may not have the same temptation to commit a perjury in the instance before the Court; and therefore it is for the Jury to weigh, in point of credit, and not for your Lordships, in point of competency, to repel the oath of a witness standing under such derestable and abhorrent circumstances; but, my Lord, that is not this case. This case is-that the man having sworn two ways, first that it is the will, and then that it is not, offers, by his oath, to give one of those propositions a preponderance over the other, so as to build something in addition to that oath, by telling your Lordship that this will is not the will of

               <p>Now, my Lord, the question is, whether any credit can be given to that? any credit-my Lord, I should ask what credit? if a man has sworn to two propositions diamettically repugnant and contradictory of one another, which involves him, upon his own confession, not only in a perjury, but a perjury in the direct instance before the Court; how is it possible? I speak to reasonable men, and I speak in point of competency, not in point of credit, that if the competency of a witness is to depend upon any authenticity that he can give to a transaction upon his oath, if his oath is divided between these two propofitions, and has equally belonged to both of them, how is it possible to give him any credit. Now, my Lord, in order to try this case; and I observe your Lordship turning to some authority, which is natural enough. My Lord, no man feels more reverence than I do for the collective wisdom of ages, which constitutes the law of this country; no man bows more implicitly than I do to the authority of precedents, which, undoubredly, build up, and cement the fabric of our laws and constitution; and wherever I find a precedent, although the inclination of my judgment is strongly drawn against the foundation upon which that precedent is built; I bow to the precedent, unless I find it in the situation of those precedents, if any such there are, that are diametrically repugnant to the principles of jurisprudence everywhere, and aspecially to the principles of justice as immecmorially acted upon in this country, My Lord, it is a maxim which cannot he broken in upon, that it is only the sanction of the oath that consers the competency upon the individual; if a man knows nothing of the Supreme Being, the internal appeal to whom constitutes the fanction of an oath, he cannot be sworn at all; he may, if he is of another religion, because, in whatever view the mind of man has the impression of the Divinity stamped upon it; it is supposed that person speaks under the insluence of the education he may have received; but what is the case here? the man has sworn that it is the will, and he has sworn that it is not. Now, my Lord, I mean to give Isgar something that does not belong to him, in order to try this case; I will suppose he is no accomplice, and was now to be examined, and was to swear, that upon some given day, the 26th or 27th of April (no matter what day) this forgery was committed by Mr. Crossley, and the case so closes, could your Lordship leave it to the Jury? would there be any thing to leave to the Jury, with no other circumstances added to it? and we shall come to see whether when a thing is nothing, any thing added to it can make it something; good God! is it possible for any man, whose reason is not disordered, to say, that when a man has sworn the will was a true will, and the same man has sworn the same will was not a true will, that your Lordship upon his single unsupported evidence could desire the Jury to guess at which of his oaths is the true one, and to put the man's life in jeopardy, by even stating it to be evidence to go to the Jury. Now I am either wrong in this, or I am right, and I desire to have the opinion of your Lordships upon this, whether the man, blasted as he is, if that could be removed from him, so that your Lordship might, when the man is examined, put the cause upon his evidence, aye or no; could the Judges of England state that a man who had sworn two propositions staring one another in the face, upon which you have nothing to do but to arraign him according to the law of England, upon his own oath, without any extrinsic evidence, laying hold of him-as such a miscreant ought to be laid hold of, what could he avow, but that one of the two propositions was uttered by mistake; but here, the man admits that he signed the oath with deliberation, and was subject to no mistake; that he took the second oath also with deliberation; and that the one is true and the other salse, would your Lordship's leave it as a matter of evidence, which of the two are true, upon the evidence of a man who alone is to tell you, which is true, the very same man who has shewn himself to be entitled to no credit whatever, when he has sworn to these two repuguant propositions?</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, let us see whether what I have now stated is broken in upon by any of the rules and principles of law. My lord, I hold in my hand the observation made by my learned friend; Mr. Sergeant Adair, upon the law concerning accomplices; and I agree with him, it has been lucidly and properly stated; and I know that the favour and tenderness shewn to human life in this country, so remarkable for its justice, has frequently led to a delicacy upon the subject of accomplices, that I never felt, whether an accomplice shall be examined first or after he is corroborated; I think he ought to be examined first, for the best of all possible reasons, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170121"></xptr>he is a competent witness, though the humanity of the law is such (but I am not addressing you upon urbanity) that it is only from tenderness, that after an accomplice is admitted, the Court will not build any thing upon his testimony, unless he is confirmed, because of the great danger there would be of admitting such a man as a witness; but I do say, that though he is a worthless witness, and though undoubtedly he deserves what Mr. Sergeant Adair stated of him, and which I shall not repeat, yet still his evidence must go to the Jury, because he has not, by swearing both ways, destroyed, by his own conduct, the foundation of all credit due to his testimony, which foundation is alone the fanction of an oath.</p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, I come to the last point, and I do confess, I think, and, my Lord, I have thought of it a great deal, that it is impossible for a greater fallacy to be imposed upon the human understanding than this. This man is a worthless incredible witness, and taken by himself, my learned friend says, he is of no value at all; he does not put it of small comparative value with other witnesses, but he states boldly that he is of no value at all; but he says, though it may be true that his oath cannot receive any fanction from a Court, yet that there may be circumstances arising from Mr. Crossley's own act accumulating upon one another, which may fasten the crime upon Mr. Crossley, I agree to it; and though, undoubtedly, I should do my duty to the utmost to the prisoner, yet, most undoubredly, if I saw such transactions belonging to him, I should say, he must suffer the law upon that evidence; but the question is, whether by taking Isgar's evidence as the foundation, and taking it as nothing, you can erect it into something, by surrounding it with other matters, which, as far as they throw light upon one another, do, I admit, constitute a body of evidence which may, peradventure, in this case, be sufficient for conviction; but I would humbly ask your Lordship, (I speak earnestly, my Lord, because I speak feelingly,) how can that confirm the evidence of that man, which was before stated as nothing; and how can that nothing be converted into something, by the addition of other materials by which that nothing is to be supported?</p>
               <p>My Lord, I know there is no other way to support moral truths, but by turning back to that which is the foundation of all certainty, I mean the calculations of matter; the calculations of matter, and the truths belonging to them, must be the foundation of all your reasonings in the world; then I would add this: I want to make up a sum, and for forms sake I begin with nothing but a nought; I put down that nought, and then I am to make up a sum by the progression of numbers, by a great number of units, which will amount to a particular sum in the calculation, be it so; those different units may be sufficient to answer the purpose of the calculator, and may answer the purpose of material demonstration for which they are produced; but will the adding them together, or multiplying them together, erect a nothing into something; and will you make that progression of numbers different, when added to that which was before nothing, and make them tell differently in any quotient, because there is that before it, which it is admitted, by itself, is nothing; but which having lost its nothingness. acquired a local habitation, and a name? My Lord, I can only say, my mind revolts at such a propossion, and I shall think I am getting into a second childhood, when I find my mind stagger from the contrary proposition.</p>
               <p>Then, to bring your Lordship back again, added to this, you have the man as an accomplice, I have been trying him as not being an accomplice; and the reason why I have tried him as not being an accomplice is, because it entitles me to give your Lordship a view of the subject, that I could not have given you if he were an accomplice; because, if he were not an accomplice, your Lordship would be driven, perhaps, in the coarse of the cause, to come to this very principle, that after the man had finished his evidence, and the case was finished, your Lordship would be driven to say to the Jury, that it was matter for them to deliberate which of the two contrary propositions is the true one; and which none but he can divulge, by only the same oath which had been given equally first to the one and then to the other; why, then the only answer is this, if a man swears to two propositions, the oue extremely improbable, the other very much probable: that the one has nothing to give credibility to it, that the other is confirmed by every thing that confers credibility, would you not then admit it? - yes, certainly; but not that the witness shall add any thing to it, upon his oath; I can examine the proposition as it is an intrinsic proposition; I can examine all the probabilities by which that intrinsic proposition is supported upon the one hand, and by which the improbability is made stronger upon the other; and when I have done that, I have sufficient, by the rules of criminal law, to direct a Jury, upon all those circumstances together, to find a man guilty of forgery; I should do it with a calm spirit, and with a consciousness that I was performing my duty to the country; but what I dread and tremble at is, - that upon your Lordship's judgment, which I should be sorry to hear pronounced, that man, as he has described himself, is to be set up here, and is to lay a foundation, and that the Jury are to suppose, under your Lordship's judgment, as they must undoubtedly, if your Lordship sets him up as a witness; it is telling the Jury some credit is due to him; it is leaving it to them undoubtedly; but it is allowing him some credit; when, I contend, not a scintilla of credit is due to him; and which it is admitted at the very moment it is received, to be in fact good for nothing. I confess, it does make a strong impression upon my mind; it appears to me, to be making use of evidence of no value at all for that is my proposition); and after you have got it, then you build other things upon it, by taking a foundation which is, in fact, no foundation at all; and if the man is ultimately convicted, it will not be upon the circumstances themselves to which credit is due, coupled together, but upon these circumstances built upon that which in the opening is admitted literally to be nothing.</p>
               <p>I beg your Lordship's pardon, for having detained the Court so long; I feel this objection strongly, and I therefore have expressed it strongly.</p>
               <p>The objection to laizar's competency was supported also by Mr. Garrow and Mr. Fielding; when Mr. Sergeant Adair rose to answer them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Brother Adair, you need not trou<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170122"></xptr>ble yourself; I have paid great attention to Mr. Erskine and Mr. Garrow, as I always do; they are very able men, but they have not brought conviction to my mind; and it is a singular stage in which they have taken the objection, after having sworn the man upon the voire dire, because he has perjured himself in the very fact in question before the Court; that the man has sworn contrary ways before, there can be, I presume, no doubt; I know nothing but from the opening on the one side, and the statement on the other; I will suppose this man has sworn to facts directly contrary one to the other, but he is brought here now, not with any conviction upon his head, he is brought here as a person who labours under very great suspicions; but he has not been convicted of the crime of perjury. Now, it is admitted in the course of this argument, that, if this man had been convicted of the crime of perjury, and pardoned, or if he had been pardoned without any conviction, his evidence might have been received; if that be so, I cannot point out to myself any ground upon which that man, who, if he was pardoned, might be received as a witness, should not be an admissible evidence, when not having been convicted, no pardon can be necessary. I do not now chuse to say a word about the credit that I think may be due to him; - not a word about what the Jury ought to think of the witness; here after we shall hear what he says, and how he is corroborated; but, in my opinion, in strict point of law, this witness is admissible.</p>

               <p>Q. You had seen him before that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had sent this will, you saw Sir John Briggs, and he said, the will you sent would not do; had you sent any other will than that at that time? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you why it would not do? - A. He said, Mr. Lewis was a very particular man, and therefore, that will would not do; we must get a better; he would have a little alteration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, at any time, Sir John Briggs having that will any of the times that he came to you? - A. I never saw him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Holland coming to you after you had seen Sir John Briggs? - A. I saw Holland in London afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you saw Mr. Holland at any time after you sent that will to Bath? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did you see Mr. Holland there? - A. He told me there was a person wished to see me there; I went and it was Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that when you went and saw Mr. Crossley? - A. I do not remember the day of the month in particular, it was about the 10th or 11th of April, perhaps.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find Crossley when Mr. Holland took you to him? - A. At the Three Tuns.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps that house? - A. One Mr. Ballinger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see at the Three Tuns, besides Mr. Crossley and Mr. Holland? - A. I did not see any body else there in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person in company with them, or did you take any other person with you, during the time you were then at Bath? - A. I believe, William Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you did or not? - A. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed at that meeting while Mr. Crossley was present at the Three Tuns? - A. He desired that me and Austin might accompany him and Mr. Holland; at least to meet them at the Globe, at Newton, the morning following, which was on a Saturday, I think, the 11th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Newton? - A. Between Bristol and Bath; Austin went before with Mr. Crossley; and Mr. Holland and I rode after.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, upon that, see Austin either then or afterwards? - A. Austin went with me the morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Crossley tell you, or any body else in Mr. Crossley's presence, for what you were to meet at the Globe, at Newton? - A. I don't recollect, but it was some conversation about this will.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it stated to have been respecting any will at all, in Mr. Crossley's presence? - A. Mr. Crossley and Mr. Holland went forward first together; there was nothing particular passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time before you went to the Globe, at Newton, disclosed to Mr. Austin the business that you had been concerned in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to Mr. Austin about it? - A. I told Mr. Austin this, that I knew a person that wanted a witness to a will, and that he might get 100l. if he wanted to get 100l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse, or did he agree to it? - A. Mr. Austin said, I would put my name to an hundred wills for that money, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Holland and Mr. Austin together at Bath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Mr. Holland and Mr. Austin relative to the will? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed between them? - A. Mr. Austin and Mr. Holland were at a public-house with me, the French Horn, or Seven Stars; Mr. Austin would not agree to do any thing in the will without a note for 100l. to make sure of his money; he said, he could not give him a note of 100l. unless they should recover the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Holland at last agree, or refuse to give the note of 100l.? - A. He gave the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it, do you think, if you saw it again? - A. Most certainly I should; (it is shewn him); this is it; here is an alteration; he would not have "or order," and it was interlined"James Smith."</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ready written? - A. No; I believe the stamp was out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any particular recollection as to the date of the note? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Newton? - A. Mr. Austin and I went, and Mr. Crossley and Mr. Holland; we rode there.</p>
               <p>Q.What day was it? - A. I think the 11th of April, but I cannot be sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect of whom you hired your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170124"></xptr>houses? - A. I believe it was Aborfield or Merrifield, a man that keeps horses, in Corn-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley there, or how? - A. When we went to get the horses, we saw Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley riding by before us, about 100 yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Newton, did you see any body there? - A. Nobody else, and Mr. Austin did not come in at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed there in the presence of Mr. Crossley? - A. Mr. Crossley drew up a long copy of a note to send to Mr. Lewis, to inform him that I had a will of such a person's, one Lewis, a corn-factor, of Monmouth, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass at that meeting, relative to that will? - A. Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had not drawn the will? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether any thing more passed with respect to that will, before you parted at the Globe? - A. Nothing particular; upon Mr. Crossley's return to Bath, I received a note from him, as I was going to Eath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that note? - A. No, I destroyed it; I saw him afterwards at Bath, and he asked me if I had a note drawn by a nephew of his, one John Upsell; I told him I had; it came to me in a letter directed to

               <p>Q. Did you go out of town that day, or the day after? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.After the bail was put in how long did you stay there? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Crossley, after you had asked him the question about that will, did he say any thing more about the will, that you can recollect? - A. Not in particular; he said he took care that the paper should be old enough, that it might not be discovered.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the letter you wrote to Mr. Lewis, at Monmonth; when did you send it? - A. I suppose, about the 12th or 13th of April, I am not quite sure to the day, it bears date before that, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170126"></xptr>Q. Do you recollect about what time in April that letter was actually sent? - A. I don't recollect particularly the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the letter (shewing it him)? - A. Yes, it is the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any other money from Mr. Crossley than the change of that 50l. bill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What further sum did you receive from him? - A. I think, ten pounds or guineas; I am not sure which, it was an order upon his banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who that banker was? - A. Ramsden, or some such thing, it was No. 57. I think, in some street, I forgot what; Hammersley, or some such thing, if I was to hear it I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in St. James's-street, or the Hay-market, or Pall-mall? - A. In Pall-mall, I think; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You got the money for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them your name? - A. Yes; they asked me, and I told them the name on the bill was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your return from London did you go over to Monmouth? - A. Two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day you returned from Monmouth? - A. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week? - A. I cannot say; I was to be with the will at such a time, at Monmouth of the Monday following, I think at eleven o'clock; but I could not go, and therefore it was some time first.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it stopped you from going to Monmouth at that time? - A. I did not get from London in time.</p>
               <p>Q. But how long after you reached Bath was it? I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go with? - A. One John Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to Monmouth for? - A. With this said copy of a will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - A. One Mrs. Kane.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive this money? - A. The 10l. was after the will was made.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in London after that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it or not, the paper you carried to Monmouth? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that; is it the same paper you had from Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. This, my Lord, is the cover at I have now shewn the witness.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that, (the will), is that the same that was afterwards produced upon the trial at Hereford? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. I have been looking at you, and listening to you, for a great while, with profound admiration, and think I never saw a gentleman so much at his ease as you seem to be; perfectly tranquil and happy, are you not?</p>
               <p>Court. You are not bound to answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look across to the Jury; you did not know at all the deceased

            ? - A. I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true at all that you knew him about five years before 1791? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is true that you swore that though? - A. I am very sorry I did.</p>
               <p>Q. So I see; and you swore also, I believe, that he came to your house, and that the will was made at your house, and attested at your house, you are sorry for that too, I suppose? - A. I came into this Court, I wish to do justice, and to let the truth be known; I think it has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>Q. It has; and I shall apply to his Lordship to make you answer every question I ask. You did swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With as much ease as you are swearing now the contrary; now, how am I to know, if what you were swearing then, or what you are swearing now, is the truth? - A. I came now to do the honest justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose I had been at Hereford, and was asking the question - whether you did not come to speak the truth, what would you have said; were you not asked that? - A. I likely might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your answer was, that you were come to speak the truth; was it so? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.You know very well, after you had made that oath, you were commited for the forgery; that you were taken up, and sent to prison? - A. I know I was sent to prison, and am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long after you had been in prison did you begin to tell the story you have been telling to-day? - A. Some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had, some time after, confessed that you committed this forgery? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call signing your name to a forged will; do you mean to swear you did not know you were guilty of a capital offence for having unered a will knowing it to be forged? - A. I did not know it then.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you don't think that wrong? - A. I don't think that was right.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't think it a very wrong thing not for once or so. What do you think of the one that you did over now with the name of Lewis to it; do you think that a forgery? - A. I don't know; it might be a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that when the blank paper was said to be old enough, as it was said by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170127"></xptr>Holland, and you were desired to copy it over the name of Lewis, you did not know it was a forgery? - A. I positively swear I did not know it was a forgery then; I did not think it right not withstanding.</p>
               <p>Q. You practised as an attorney? - A. I was an auctioneer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever practise as an attorney? - A. I have been an attorney's clerk; I don't deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not practise as an attorney, state yourself to be an attorney, and do business as an attorney? - A. I never stated myself as an attorney yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not practise as an attorney? - A. Not by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you the names of a few causes, and see whether you practised in any of them: in Parry against Pyander; did you practise in that? - A. I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I was not concerned in the business any more than the gentlemen here.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know any thing of it? - A. I served the process for the attorney, one Akerman.</p>
               <p>Q. You were his clerk, were you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to serve the processes? - A. It was sent to Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not Akerman acting as your agent, in that very cause? - A. He positively was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into prison, you underwent an examination before Mr. Barrow, the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had then a perfect recollection of all the circumstances that belong to this transaction? - A. I recollected some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your recollection get better after a long course of time? - A. I was at a nonplus.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been two months in goal before you were examined? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know so? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told those gentlemen, all this abominable business you have been describing, was planned before you came to London, when Mr. Crossley was at Bath; that you took horses, and that Mr. Holland and Mr. Crossley rode together, and you and Austin together; that one went to Newton, and then to Linton; that strikes me as the most important part of the business, does not it you? - A. I cannot say; what I have said now, is, before God and man, positively true.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen, that though the Magistrate has said it was read over to you deliberately, that you made erasures where you could not swear to it, that there is not one syllable of having seen Mr. Crossley at Bath? - A. Because there is a part of it told, and part not; there was not time to take it all down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Barrow that circumstance? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? - A. I don't mean to swear about it; I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that when you were admitted an evidence for the Crown, that at that time you did not recollect? - A. I did not know I was to be admitted an evidence for the Crown at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prosess to tell the truth to Mr. Barrow? - A. I did; but Mr. Barrow did not ask me, and I did not tell him; and there may be some more yet, perhaps, that was not put down.</p>
               <p>Q. If I recollect you right, Mr. Holland, when at Bath, told you that would not do, for that Mr. Lewis was a very particular man? - A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said so? - A. I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - A. Sir John Briggs told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before, or after Mr. Crossley went to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that this was managed before Mr. Crossley went to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have said nothing about it in your examination? - A. It was all managed before, I tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever asked, at the assizes, whether you had seen Mr. Crossley before; what did you answer to that? - A. I said I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, you only saw him once by accident, coming out of the King's-Bench? - A. I did not say that I had not seen him any more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that you did not? - A. To the best of my recollection, I did not swear that; I don't recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear you did not? - A. I cannot; I am come here to tell the truth, I hope, and I will do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you saw him coming out of the King's-Bench, and that was the only time you ever saw him in your life? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that examination; did you give an account to the magistrate of all you knew, and did he write it down? - A. I did not say I did.</p>

               <p>Q.Did not you prosess to give an account of all you knew? - A. No, they did not ask me; I did not give every particular instruction, every word, that I knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that Mr. Crossley desired you to write that letter you sent to Mrs. Kane? - A. Mr. Crossley wrote that letter, and I copied it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170128"></xptr>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate so? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you told him so? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose it should turn out that you did not tell him so, why did you not? - A. I cannot answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, if you can account for not having told the Magistrate; supposing that when that comes to be read, you should not have told the Magistrate one syllable of having seen Mr. Crossley at Bath; how can you account for it? - A. I only described the heads of it, and this was left out, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know Mr. Gray, the jailer? - A. Yes; I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversations with him upon the subject of this? - A. Yes; previous to my giving this relation to Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any previous information of what you have laid before the Court to-day? - A. Not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear you had no communication with him after that time? - A. I have talked to him several times, but not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q.After Mr. Crossley was committed to prison, had you not conversed with the jailor, Mr. Gray? - A. I don't know but I might, several times, as he comes to lock me up in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect whether you had or not? - A. Not private conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say, that, subsequent to the time of Mr. Crossley being committed, you never did speak to Mr. Gray upon the subject of Mr. Crossley being brought there? - A. Previous to the time of Mr. Crossley being brought there, I had said, to be sure, that the will was a good will, till I told Mr. Barrow the rights of it; and after that, if I did say any thing to the jailer, I certainly did say, that Mr. Crossley was concerned in it with Austin and me.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after Mr. Crossley was committed, and after you had laid an information against Mr. Crossley, you said the same thing to the jailor that you had said in your information; that is to say, that Mr. Crossley was concerned with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said the contrary since Mr. Crossley was committed? - A. I might have said, that Mr. Crossley was not the first person that pointed out the will to be made, because it was Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Mr. Gray, after Mr. Crossley was committed, that Mr. Crossley did not know certainly any thing of the will, but that you were obliged to swear to it? - A. No; never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. That you positively swear? - A. Yes; positively.</p>
               <p>Q. I have now given you time to recollect yourself, and my Lord has got your answer down; now let us see how long you will stand by a thing, and in how short a time you will swear and unswear Mr. Gray asked you, whether Mr. Crossley had any knowledge of the will; and that you said Mr. Crossley did not know any thing of the will, but you were obliged to swear it; and upon being asked, how you could accuse Mr. Crossley, you said, that you, to your knowledge, could not possibly accuse Mr. Crossley of it? - A. I deny saying any such words to the jailor, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q.Vastly well, sir; now I want just to see whether I have got the rest of your evidence correct; I shall trouble you with very few questions now; you went, at the desire of Sir John Briggs, to London, and Austin with you; you went to the Golden Cross; Austin went to the White Horse Cellar; you went to Mr. Crossley on the Sunday morning, and told him, that Sir

               <p>Q. In the morning you went first of all and saw Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered your message from Sir John Briggs to Mr. Crossley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he gave you three guineas, or three guineas and a-half; now what time was that? - A. Monday morning, near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you asked him why he made two parts of the will; and he said, he made two parts of the will in case you should be detected, and Mr. Austin, at the trial; that he and his clerks might come and prove that an old gentleman left it with him; now that is a very remarkable expression, that must have struck pretty deep; it was not a thing one would hear and forget very much; did you tell that to the Magistrate? - A. I believe I did; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you did? - A. I think I did; I think you will find it in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving this letter from Akerman, in which, he says, he is sorry to be informed, the public term me the notorious Jacob Isgar's agent; now, upon your oath, do you mean to say, you did not employ Akerman in any of the causes in that paper? - A. Only in my own; three or four of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was employed in those causes? - A. No attorney but Akerman.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes Akerman to speak so in that letter? - A. Because one Wilmot sent it to him.</p>

No further than (the 13th of April was a Monday) Mr. Crossley called at my house, between twelve and one o'clock; he left word for me to go to the Three Tuns; I went there, and there was a bowl of punch upon the table; I asked Mr. Crossley how he came down there; he said, he was going upon business to Gloucester, and round there; he asked me for some money that I borrowed, in London, of him; he asked me to pay him that, which I did, we sat down and drank a glass or two of punch together, and presently in came Isgar; and Mr. Crossley said, will you be bound for Isgar, for what he owes me; I said, no; I was bound too much already.</p>

             should be at the King's head, on Monday, at eleven; I have since then settled the matter of Eberno, which Mrs. Allen last wrote about, and the bail was put in, so that nothing can, but his own want of prudence, prevent his attending to the appointment; he see off by the coach at four this morning, and has faithfully promised to keep his appointment. I hope Sir John will not fail to meet him, that he may at once dispatch his business; for he is much too apt to get drunk, and the sooner he returns the better; for I cannot answer for his prudence, if in liquor; and when any thing pleases or displeases Mr. Eberno, he is generally drunk on the subject. I am well satisfied you may trust him, as he will faithfully bring the money to account; so that you need not fear him on that head; but a man that gets drunk, is not a fit person for business, and therefore I would have you to act more cautiously, in future; the 50l. you gave him last is accepted; and I told him where to have the cash, and he had it, the full 50l.; and Sir

             desired me to advance him five guineas, as it is best to keep no accounts but what are clear. Mrs. Allen has a desire you will write her fully on the business, and how it is managed, and what is done (that she may know her money is properly laid out). You must be prudent and diligent in the business, and there is no doubt of success, the security is so good, and so very perfect the title, that no one can miss of approving the matter; so that there need no begging the question; and if the money is not advanced, on the security, when Mr. Eberno brings it, it may be got elsewhere - so I would have Sir

             told when you see him. Pray any compliments to our friends; and, I think, if Sir John comes into your part this summer, you may shew him this; he will the better understand how to act; and as I have, when I saw him, told him the whole truth of the case, I am satisfied he has too much understanding not to see it is right; besides, as he is in the habits of approving titles, he must be better and more perfectly satisfied by an open behaviour and disclosure of the full truth, than by any thing kojt back. I hope Mr. Eberno will not be kept an hour at the King's-head, as I have given him orders to depart as soon as possible. I am, Sir,</p>

               <p>"I have received your letter last post; it is not convenient, at this me, to come to London to meet Mr. Dixcy, as I am not well, and noble, at present, to take so long a journey. I want much to go Leicester; I must go there next week. I hope Dixcy hath got is accounts allowed before the Master (I suppose 2000l.)</p>
               <p>"I have sent Dixcy a jobber, a man of judgment and money; he ath set off to Dixcy's house well mounted, by way of Worcester; suppose he will be there some day this week; he comes to take view, and see situation, before he fixes; his name is Vincent; I hope he will find Richard at home, and that all things will be made greeable to them both. If Richard should come to London this week, he must hasten back to see the merchant; he will go to the King's-head, Monmouth, and send over for Richard.</p>
               <p>"We have a great miss here; you may tell Richard, Old Nick went over to Worksop manor last night, and took his old acquaintnce, Wake; he was an idle devil not to fetch him ten years ago; he also fetched, last week, Briggs Rotherham, the Justice of Drauseld - they will make a good hroil together.</p>
               <p>"I have both seen and sent to Gillet's brother, to do something or him, and have had a deal of trouble about it; they have put off o consider from time to time, &amp;c.; I sent again yesterday; his brother Thomas seems to be now most forward to assist him, and promises to come to me here on Wednesday next; I will do all I can o serve the poor man, you may depend upon it; and I will write o him as soon as I know what will be done; I will do my best for his interest."</p>

I have had no letter-Vincent called here when I was with you; he said he should call again before he went back into the West, but hath not yet done so; when he comes, I suppose I shall be acquainted with the whole history. I have seen the party which I told you I would; I have every reason to think I can get it; but you know there is no promising, certainly now, till you have the sum in hand. I have told you, I would do every think I could to serve you, and he assured I will; I hope I can do it shortly; but remember, I have never said absolutely I could do it; you know I told you how I was situated; I'll do my best, and hope I shall be able to oblige you; but don't depend upon it till you have it hand.

I wish I may see you before your other affairs are to ripe. I wish the meeting had been nearer Bath. I shall bring hills with me such as you may want, and let me have all you can in return, and we will finally settle what is to be done.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I have scarcely been able to hear one half that has passed; I wish your Lordship would permit Mr. Erskine to make some observations for me, as to the letters; I have not been able to distinguish any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot suffer your counsel to speak for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the situation then in which I stand, I will content myself with my counsel calling evidence; all that is possible for me to relate, is, that I know nothing of the charge; those things which relate to money transactions, have no relation to this will; I know nothing of the will, and have not the least conception; I gave no other answer to Mr. Clarke's letter, than this, I certainly received the letter on Monday, in which it was stated, that some papers were found; but so little it struck me, having no knowledge of this will, that I wrote to Mr. Clarke, charging him, that I suspected, if there was any thing in the business, it must be a draft of his own, and that letter is his answer to me; if the letter is reffered to, it will be seen that it is a letter in answer to one of mine, in which I must have charged him with something. As to the letter of Austin, it is well known, after Sir John Briggs applied to me, to defend him,(there are letters to prove he employed me); he told me he was entirely innocent; I never saw Sir John in my life till after the assizes; as to the evidence of Isgar, there is not a word of truth in it.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a letter in which you say you have consulted Sir 
               <persName id="t17960217-70-person836">
                  John

            .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is a letter Mr. Clarke desired me to write, respecting the sale of Mr. Holland's estate. With respect to the entry in the day-book, I have no doubt I shall be able to give a satisfactory account of that, and that the evidence of Isgar in that part cannot be true. That letter, where Sir John Scott is mentioned, must have been wrote from dictation; I have something on my memory, that something of a title to the Holland estate was enquired into.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Without breaking throught any of the rules your Lordship has laid down, I shall merely state to your Lordship what I mean to call to first; as the rest of the evidence is all in confirmation of Isgar's evidence; therefore I shall begin with contradicting him, in every part of his testimony that relates to the cause; he denied having spoken to the jailor any thing respecting Mr. Crossley's innocence.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You are jailor at Herford? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, in your custody, this Mr. Isgar? - A. He was a prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was committed under a warrant of Mr. Barrow, the mayor of that place? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when the information was taken by Mr. Barrow, when he came into the prison? - A. I cannot remember the day, there was an information taken by Mr. Barrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being also committed to your custody? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.At that time Isgar had been two months in your custody? - A. Near about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Isgar, previous to the time Mr. Barrow came into the prison to take the information? - A. Not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember conversing with him after Mr. Crossley's commitment? - A. I remember his speaking to me after Mr. Crossley was committed to my custody.</p>
               <p>Q.After Mr. Crossley was committed to your custody, and committed on his information you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Isgar any question, when he came to accuse Mr. Crossley? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What was it you said to Isgar? - A. I menmentioned to Isgar one night, when I was locking him up, particularly on account of having the misfortune of losing some prisoners, I lock them down with a chain; I said, for what, do you accuse Mr. Crossley? I thought there was enough of you without him? Isgar said, I am hauled into a hobble, and must get out as well as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the answer Isgar gave to your ques<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170135"></xptr>tion, how he came to accuse Mr. Crossley? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, besides that expression you have just now repeated, any other expressions he made use of at the same time? - A. Yes; I do particularly; I asked that in the first place of Isgar, and he said, he was hauled into a hobble, and he must get out as he could; he said particularly he was obliged to swear, in order to get out of the hobble himself; it was as near those words as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about what you are now stating? - A. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Go on to state the rest of the conversation that took place between you and Isgar? - A. It was not only that time, but several times, he spoke those words, that he was hauled into a hobble, and must get out as he could; I believe not one, two or five times only; he said, he did not think he was so much concerned as some others; I cannot exactly remember the day, it was about the 19th, the words were, he mentioned it particularly, he wished to say to me, I was mentioning it before the prisoner in the kitchen; but he said, he did not think Mr. Crossley so guilty, as to the will in question, as some others, meaning Sir

               <p>Prisoner. Upon the 19th of December, the jailer told me exactly what passed as in that paper; that he said, he was obliged to swear it; it remained in that state two months; when I wanted to adduce evidence, I asked him if that was true; and Dr. Combe undertook to examine this man; and Dr. Combe sent to inform me what passed; and Mr. Underwood said, he could say a great deal more; Mr. Gray said, he could say a great deal more; and Mr. Underwood said, let me hear it now.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gray.) How long was this paper written after the 19th of December? - A. I think, in the month of January 1796.</p>
               <p>Q.What time in January? - A. I cannot tell the day; it was the sore part, before Isgar came from Hereford.</p>

               <p>Q. You received a writ of Hobeas Corpus to bring up a prisoner to-day? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason he is not here? - A. (Produces a paper as the reason).</p>
               <p>Q. I see what that is; it is a certificate, signed by the person who took the information. What was the person you did not make a return to the writ of Habeas Corpus? - A. He was in such a state of health he could not be removed with safety to his life.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't obey the King's writ, why do you not return the cause? - A. I had no cause but from the physician and surgeon.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that paper again, and tell me whose hand-writing it is? - A. Mr. Thomas Combe, the surgeon: Dr. Combe, who is the Justice of Peace for the county and city.</p>
               <p>Q. When you entered into this conversation with the prisoner Isgar, how long had Mr. Crossley been in your custody? - A. I cannot say how long; it was some time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you a plain question; how long Mr. Crossley had been in custody when you first asked Isgar any question? - A. I suppose some weeks; two or three.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known Mr. Crossley before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the jail was Mr. Crossley confined? - A. In a safe room, opposite to where I lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he board? - A. I found him for a few days, and afterwards he found himself.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he find your family too? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so anxious about Mr. Crossley? - A. It was mentioned by Isgar first; he said he wanted to get out of this hobble.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before Mr. Crossley was in custody? - A. After; I asked him again, after he had said something about Mr. Crossley; I asked why he accused Mr. Crossley? he said he had got into a hobble, and must get out by what means he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Isgar said any thing to you upon the subject before he said that? - A. He mentioned particularly, that Mr. Crossley was come here now, or something of that kind: Mr. Crossley is come here now, or come at last.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you asked him as you have stated to us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had got into a hobble, and must get out as he could; and you told him you thought there was enough of them already? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always so attentive to your prisoners, to prevent more of them coming? - A. I mentioned it to Isgar; he said, he was not so guilty as he thought some others; and particularly mentioned Sir

I never heard any thing material, to my knowledge, till I was subpoened, and I thought it right to recollect myself.</p>
               <p>Q. But who told you the 26th of April would be a day particular upon this occasion? - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Not till you came here? - A. Yes; Mr. Webb told me that the Bath races were on that Tuesday that he went out of town; he said, he had promised to be there on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you before you came here that the 26th of April could be a day that would be particular? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you think it more useful to take notine of that day than any other day? - A. When I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you were subpoened, how came you to think that day more necessary to recollect than the other? - A. I understood from them that it was the day of the Bath races.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been this day? - A. Here, in different companies.</p>
               <p>Q. What one of the witnesses have you seen since you have been here? - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the last you saw when you came in? - A. I suppose there were twenty sitting with Mr. Stokes's witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been sitting in a room all this morning; so that you have not learned this story of the 26th of April till to-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But then you knew it was a material day before to-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you taught that it was material? - A. I never was taught.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was by mere accident that you thought it material? - A. When my brother was taken up, and I was subpoened, I thought it right to recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lodge when he was in town? - A. I have heard him say he lodged in St. Martin's-lane; I could not accommodate him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Isgar? - A. I have seen him at Hicks's-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When Henry Austin was in your house was any thing said to him, by your brother, about his having come up from Bath with Isgar? - A. not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a day was it? - A. A sine day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did you attend before the Grand Jury? - A. I was subpoened there by Mr. Stokes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have attended here upon the subpoena from Mr. Stokes? - A. Yes; a very unnataural thing, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Dauncey. Q. How came you not to come down when you were called? - A. I went over the way after my cloak, and left word where I was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Your brother came up to town on Sunday morning? - A. The 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day? - A. Between nine and ten, to the best of my knowledge; I asked him what he came to town for, and he said, there was some gentleman in Bath making interest to get him into the Custom-house; I cannot particularly say that he said in Bath, but some friend of his.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you who he was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you before he went away whether he had seen the gentleman? - A. No; I asked him if he had succeeded in his wishes; he told me he did not know whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ask him that? - A. Just as he was going away.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot swear whether the Weavers came there before or after? - A. I think it was after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Crump come? - A. He came to take a little farm of me, about two o'clock; and he staid from that time till about eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away before nine? - A. He very likely might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went first? - A. Crump and Jones went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you six some time at which they went away? - A. About nine, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long did the Weavers stay after them? - A. They went away before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear the Weavers went away before twelve? - A. I will swear my house was shut, and the Weavers did not sleep at my house, and that I went to bed before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Holland was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing at that time about a will? - A. No; only that he had been at the passage, and different places, searching for the saddle-bags; and I think that Mr. Phillips, who was employed for the heir at law, had given him the key, or something.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on that day you did not hear of any intention of framing a will for Mr. Lewis; when was it you first offered a bett, that a will of Mr. Lewis's would be found? - A. I don't know that I ever offered a bett of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not offer a bett that a will of Mr. Lewis's would he found after this conversation? - A. I was one day at Monmouth with Mr. Lewis, and he told me he had received a letter from one Isgar at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever offered such a bett? - A. There were wagers talked of, but not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who talked of wagers? - A. Mr. Holland, and Mr. Lewis, a bailif, were at my house one day, and I had seen on the Saturday before, a letter, that there was a will of his in Bath, which he shewed me at the public-house, at Bath; I cannot say what house it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that letter express? - A. To let Mrs. Kane know that there was a will in favour of Mrs. Kane in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that letter? - A. No more than I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it read, or did you read it? - A. I think, I heard it read.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say from your recollection, that that was the contents, or substance of the letter, that this Isgar had a will to deliver to Mrs. Kane, and that the will was made for the benefit of Mrs. Kane? - A. To the best of my recollection, the letter did express that word, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a letter that Mr. Lewis, the cornfactor, had at Monmouth? - A.. Yes.</p>

             the baker was at my house, and he proposed making a bett; he asked me to go his halves; I said, I have no objection; I thought no gentleman would write such a letter, and mentioning his place of abode, would send a letter of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Who would bett, when you knew he discovered it immediately to Mrs. Kane; who would bett with you? - A. It would have been no bett.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, before this letter was produced, that you had not talked about a will, that you were sure a will would be produced? - A. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Q. He is a respectable man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not advise him to go and bett about a will of Mr. Lewis's? - A. Not till after I saw the letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in fact, lay a bett about this will? - A. I never received one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you if you ever laid a bett about this will? - A. Dr. Powell, the surgeon, offered to lay me two guineas to one, which I agreed to, and that bett was withdrawn; that is the only bett I ever made.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. We mean to call several witnesses to prove Isgar, independent of this transaction, so bad, that no credit ought to be given to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Hollings). Q. Do you know any thing of Isgar? - A. I have heard him swear things that I should hardly, upon his oath, believe a word of him, what he swore there, and what I have heard him swear since.</p>
               <p>Q. From his character, do you suppose him to be a man that, upon the most insignisicant subject, you could safely trust upon his oath? - A. From what I have heard of him, I would not believe him upon his oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. Q. Then he did come to Monmouth? - A. Yes; I saw him at Mrs. Kane's; he produced the will at the assizes; it was put into my hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did he produce it as a gennine will? - A. I asked him where he got it from, he said, Bath; I said, it was a good well-worded will-did you see him sign that will? I did; did you see Bowden sign that? I did - he is dead - as to Austin, he was at Bath; and who is this Isgar? it is me, says he.</p>
               <p>Q. Then sitting as a juryman, or in any other capacity, you would not believe one word he said upon his oath? - A. No; I would not.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow. I have lived at Bath about eighteen years; I have been acquainted with Isgar about a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell those gentlemen, from his character and conduct, whether his character is a good one or the reverse? - A. Not a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it very bad? - A. I never knew any good that ever he did.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe I heard you correctly, that from your knowledge of his character and conduct, he is a man not fit to be trusted upon his oath? - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. I desire, the deposition of Isgar before the Magistrate may be read; they have produced a great body of evidence, applying to different persons, and accounting for a number of persons upon a specific day, the 26th of April; they have adduced a body of evidence from various parts of the country, to speak to that particular day, I therefore now desire that the information of Isgar, giving an account of that transaction, be read, to shew that in that information there is not one single word that points at that particular day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment at what I have now heard from Mr. Sergeant Adair; when I consider the humanity of his nature, I confess I hardly know where I am when I stand up, to hear my learned friend's observation. I am astonished; I meant to have asked to have it read, but I had closed my evidence; the witness, Isgar, comes to day to fasten forgery upon the prisoner at the bar; the scene of that forgery, in point of time, and in point of place, he lays at the times that I must bring home to your Lordship's recollection; he says, that he arrived in London upon the 25th, in the evening, or 26th in the morning, it is immaterial which: that he put up at the Golden Cross; that he went to Mr. Crossley; that Sir

             wanted to see him at the Golden Cross; that Mr. Crossley refused to go to the Golden Cross, and desired to see Sir John with him; that he went so far on the way with Mr. Crossley to Sir John; and that upon the evening of this Sunday, the 26th of April; not upon the examination of the learned Sergeant alone, but upon my cool and cautions cross-examination, knowing the importance of the testimony, I fixed it upon him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170153"></xptr>positively and unequivocally, to be the only time he saw Mr. Crossley in London; and what is much greater astonishment, that in that information there is not an iota that leads to the idea of this meeting at Newton, or at the Three Tuns, or having had any knowledge of Mr. Crossley, relating to this will, but in London: my Lord, that is not all; but, he says, the next day, Monday morning, before twelve, he saw Mr. Crossley again; good God! am I in England! and am I here in a criminal trial, past the hour that criminal trials are generally over; and after my strength and patience is exhausted, to hear, that when three persons brought together by a witness infamous beyond the power of language to express; a witness not competent but by your Lordship's judgment, which I must reverence, because it comes from the Bench, whatever I may think of it myself; when that man, himself an accomplice, scarcely within reach of testimony, when your Lordship gives me (to your honour be it spoke) the hint -</p>

               <p>Court. I gave you no hint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Then I will take it that your Lordship gave me no hint; what is the proposition now? that the prisoner is not to be tried upon what this man has sworn against him to day, in Court; that though the Jury should, peradventure, believe he did not see Mr. Crossley upon the 26th or 27th of April; that, peradventure the Jury may believe that Austin was not in the condition in which he is placed by the witness; that Holland was not in the condition in which he is placed by the witness, and that the other man also was in the condition in which he is placed by his unfortunate child, whom nothing but duty, I am persuaded, could have induced my learned friend to torture in the way he did; and the prisoner is to be tried upon the speculation that this was in May; because, when his story was to be made when he was in gaol, he states it to be in May.</p>
               <p>Court. You mistake my Brother Adair; you had better hear the Sergeant, and you had better not speak so loud; you know, you are addressing the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I am addressing myself to your Lordship; and I am addressing myself to your Lordship in an audible voice; because I cannot speak upon a subject that agitates and affects me without speaking in the tone in which I now speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. It is difficult for my learned friend to know what I mean; he has, no doubt, misunderstood entirely, the purpose for which I desired to have it read; it was not for the purpose of opening a door for him to change the day, which he has unequivocally fixed, by his evidence to-day, to be the 26th of April; it was no such purpose, I should disdain such a purpose; nor was it for the purpose of shewing that he fixed another time, with that view, upon his examination on a former occasion, so as to give the go-by to those witnesses who have been produced: but, called upon, as I am, it is my duty to state distinctly and audibly, the reason why I do desire the paper to be read, and the effect it appears to me it will have when it is read, and in that I shall not be irregular. - My Lord, a great body of evidence has been adduced, prepared before-hand, brought together from distant parts of the country, that could not have been acquired since twelve o'clock today, in order to shew where three different persons were on the 26th of April; I will ask, how any body concerned for the prisoner at the bar knew before to-day that it would be material to prove where these persons were on the 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must beg to interrupt the learned Sergeant, and I do it with all the temper that becomes this place; I do assure the learned Sergeant, that the reason I took the liberty of interrupting him is, that I apprehend what your Lordship called upon the prosecutor to do was, to state some legal principle, in the application of which this piece of evidence is admissible.</p>
               <p>Court. I think that they ought not to bring forward this evidence, it is matter of observation by me to the Jury, and there is nothing more in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sergeant Adair. My Lord, I am perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>

            . The particulars of the will, it is hardly necessary for me to state to you, the nature of the offence you are aware of, and you know, that by the laws of this country, the forging of a will, or the assisting to forge, or the uttering after it is forged, or the causing and procuring to be forged of any will, is a capital offence. The prisoner therefore is standing here to answer, at the peril of his life, the charge that is brought against him. I believe, the best course I can take, will be to sum up the evidence to you first, and then make my observations; there can be no observations in point of law; you can have but one question to try, whether Mr. Crossley forged it, assisted in forging it, or procured it to be forged, or uttered it after it was forged.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and then proceeded as follows:)</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is all the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and as this evidence stands, if you think proper to give credit to the testimony of Isgar, there can be no doubt, but that the case as it was opened by my Brother Adair, and as it is laid in the indictment, is fully and completely proved, because you have the general evidence of connections between Crossley, Holland, Isgar, Austin, and Clarke, of Worksop; you have evidence that Sir John Briggs, and Austin, and Isgar, were all in town upon the 26th of April, and Isgar tells you, that at that time the will was brought out by Crossley himself for them to sign; Mr. Crossley must know, that such a will, not being executed by the testator, must have been a forged will; indeed the man himself had been dead some time, therefore you have this case fully and completely made out, if you think proper to give credit to Isgar's testimony, without which you have not a case made out, by which you can find Mr. Crossley guilty, for without him you have nothing to connect him with Austin, or with Sir John Briggs, against both of whom there is an indictment for this forgery; but if you give credit to Isgar, you have abundant evidence to find Mr. Crossley guilty of this charge; but you are aware that those who conduct the defence of Mr. Crossley, have contradicted the evidence of several witnesses, and particularly the testimony of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170154"></xptr>Isgar. It will now become me to state to you the contradiction they give to Isgar's testimony; and you will find that Isgar fixes Sir

             being in town upon the 26th of April, and Austin's being with Isgar at Crossley's house, in order to meet; that they call witnesses to prove that Sir John Briggs was else where, and to prove that Austin never was at Crossley's on that Sunday.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on the part of the prisoner, and proceeded as follows).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this is all the testimony on the one side and on the other, and really at this time of night I do not find myself equal to the talk, and perhaps I should rather weary you that assist you, in going at much length into it. I have summed up the evidence generally, and I will make this observation upon the testimony of Isgar; the evidence of an accomplice is a very slender, trifling evidence, but if that accomplice is corroborated materially to the point in question, it certainly will have considerable weight. If an accomplice is confirmed in certain particulars, but that as to all the circumstances which affect the life of the prisoner, he standing uncorroborated, and in many respects contradicted, it will be for you to say, in such a situation as that, whether you think that Isgar's testimony ought to be believed. Now I do not recollect, that in any one circumstance in which Isgar swears, respecting the personal interference of Crossley, in the execution of this will, that he is corroborated either by any one witness on his side, or on the part of the prisoner, but he is contradicted, and yet it is by witnesses, who labour under a very strong degree of suspicion; for those witnesses do, in some respects contradict each other. It would be idle, as my brother Adair has stated to you, to call a witness, and tell you that the law allows him to be admitted, and at the same time to tell you that the law will not allow you to give him credit; I cannot tell you that, but you will consider the situation in which he stands; you heard the way in which he gave his evidence; he now tells you that he is sorry for what he has done, and that what he said last is the true state of the case; and he is corroborated in many of the circumstances by other witnesses; but as to the material business of the 26th of April, his being at Crossley's house with Sir

            , there is no tittle of evidence in the course of this cause that corroborates it; on the contrary, he is contradicted in the alibi, both as to the circumstance of Sir John Briggs being in London at that time, and as to Austin being at Crossley's house that Sunday afternoon, and as to Crossley being in town on that day.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, with respect to the first part of the question, as to whether this will is forged or not, perhaps I ought to say something to you upon the subject of the will itself; and I have seen so much in the course of this trial, that I take it for granted, that it is a forged will; there are several witnesses who do not believe it to be the writing of Mr. Lewis; the circumstances of its being in the hands of such a man as Isgar, brought to Mrs. Kane so long a time after the supposed testator died, and I don't recollect immediately what other circumstances; but these two circumstances do make such an impression upon my mind, as to lead me to draw the conclusion, that this will is a forged will; but the question remains still for you to decide, whether Mr. Crossley was the person forging it, assisting to forge it, or in causing it to be forged; and as to that you have nothing but the evidence of Isgar, as to what passed upon the 26th of April. It is observed by the learned Counsel, who lead for this prosecution, that there is no way by which the prisoner and his witnesses could get at the date of the 26th of April; It is very extraordinary, that all of them should come here apprized of that day, how to account for that I cannot say; I am told, that in the examination, which is not produced before us, there is no mention of that 26th of April; therefore, what it is that has brought them so well acquainted with this day, really rests on my mind in such a state of uncertainty, that I cannot account for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, so long since as last Michaelmas Term, all these witnesses swore in the Court of King's-Bench for the purpose of my being upon bail, we traversed, and then came out the day.</p>
               <p>Court. It must have transpired by some means or other; here they all come to prove, that Crossley, Austin, Holland, Isgar, and Clarke, of Worksop, were connected in a way that must blast the reputation of all of them in all future time; and though they prove them all connected together, yet that wicked, that bad, that blasted connection ought not to have such a weight with you, as to give credit to Isgar alone, unless you think the fact clearly brought home to him; you will pin your attention wholly to that fact of the 26th of April, which rests wholly upon his testimony, and he not being corroborated by any body, but contradicted by a number of persons, under very suspicious circumstances, you will say whether you like those suspicious circumstances, or whether you think proper to give credit to Isgar, when he says Mr. Crossley was present on that day; if so, you will find him guilty; if you have any doubt, in all cases, especially in capital cases, you will lean to the side of mercy.(The Jury withdrew at half past three o'clock in the morning, and returned at four with a verdict of)</p>

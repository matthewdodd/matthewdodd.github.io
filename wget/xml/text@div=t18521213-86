                  </hi>. I am an hotel keeper, in the Haymarket; I know the prisoner; he brought me a bill of exchange about the 23rd Oct., and asked me to discount it—I told him I did not do such things, bat I took it into my possession, he owing me an account, and told him if I could pay it away I would give him the difference—he had, at various times, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which made the difference—I gave him the balance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about the 25th; I then told him it was rather irregular, because it was not made payable at a banker's—he said, "Very well, I will make it payable at my mother's banker's," and he did so, at Neville, Reed, and Co.'s—I was applied to by the police sergeant for the bill about the 16th Nov.; this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

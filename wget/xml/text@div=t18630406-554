                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and am staying at the Queen's Hotel, St. Martin's-le-grand—on 7th March, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Cheapside, by Sir Robert Peel's statue, when the procession was passing—at the very moment the Princess was passing on, I felt a great shock on my left side, and thought I was robbed—I felt a snatch; I turned back at once, and seized the prisoner—I had not seen his hand in my pocket—he tried to get away, and I seized him again between the legs of somebody, and then saw plainly my chain and seal in his hand—the chain was broken—I thought at first my watch</p>

               <p>was gone too—I had not time to feel in my pocket then, but found my watch there after—I took the chain and seal from the prisoner's hand, and held him for a long time—some people tried to rescue him—in about ten minutes I gave him to a policeman—I never let him go at all—I cried for a policeman, as we were much pressed—I was afraid of being stabbed.</p>

I am a wire worker, at 19, Eagle-court, Smithfield—on the day the Princess passed through the City, I saw the last witness take something out of the prisoner's hand—I was not sure what it was—the prisoner tried to get away, and some one tried to get him away, as hard as ever he could—I helped the prosecutor, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

I lost a gown and coat, and several other little articles, a shift and silk handkerchief, they were in a two-pair of stairs back room; they were pawned by the prisoner. I do not know the prisoner. She came about the house, my master and mistress knew her; I never saw her before to my recollection, it was on the 12th of December.</p>

               <p>Serah Putt. My Lord, she went to the pawn-broker's with me, and fetched the things herself, her and the constable went together.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the person that took these things I met by chance, who went into Mr. Shipley's, I suppose to pawn them; afterwards I knew whose they were, on account of a relation of mine who sent for me, and begged if I knew any thing about it, nobody should hurt me; and Mrs. Brailsford said she would not hurt me; they asked me to advance the money. I have suffered three months imprisonment, was here last sessions, and was not tried; have two fatherless children: as to saying I pawned them, I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-driver. About six o'clock int the evening of the 28th of Oct. I was called by a man, who said he had got a fare for me—he told me to go to the corner of Robert-street and George-street—he rode on the box with me—I went to ther corner of Robert-street—he rode were three more men—they put the box on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, two of them got in-side, and one rode with me—they ordered me to drive to the Borough, down Holland-street—I passed a little way, and went to turn down Edward-street—some inquiries were made of Jones—I was told there was no thoroughfare, and orders were given to me to drive up the Blackside—when, I drove to the street—I was afterwards told to go straight down Bankside—when I got half way, they said they were going down the New Kent-road—I drove to the corner of New-street and Lyon-street—I was told previously to drive in the direction of Blackfriars-bridge, which was from the Kent-read—when I got there they had no money to pay me—they took the box off, and one of the four stopped with me—I waited about three minutes till they brought me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my fare was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I carried three persons—they went down New-street—when I got there, there was a fourth man—I did not see what became of him—when we left Edward-street, I suppose he must have ridden behind the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I found him when I arrived—I have only a slight recollection of Field being the man who rode outside—he sat on the roof—we did not get into con-versation—he sat above me—it was a dressed <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was not Field who called the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the man who called me was dreeeed in a fustian jacket and dark trowsers, and a hat—one of them had a cap—it was a black leather trunk, with brass nails, and in oval top, and a cord round it—the man who rode at the top assisted in putting it up, and staid with me while the others went—it was a very dark, dirty street where I pulled up—I think two of the men were in jackets, Field in a black frock-coat, and one in a Chesterfield wrapper.</p>

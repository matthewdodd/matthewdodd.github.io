The prisoner came there to look at some muslin dresses, and various other goods—she said she was buying them for herself and two sisters—three yards of flannel were cut off, which she wished to take with her, to leave before she got home, but she did not tell me where—the other goods were to be sent to Captain Warner's, Finsbury-square—I gave her the flannel, to leave where she pleased.</p>

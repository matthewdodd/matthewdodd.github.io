                  </hi>. I am matron of the West London Union, near Smithfield. The prisoner came there on the 10th of Dec, and wanted to see Louisa Aldridge—I asked her what she had to take up to her—she replied, "Nothing"—she looked rather large in the back part of her person, and I asked what she had there—she said, "Nothing"—I put my hand and found some soap—I took her into the lodge and took off her gown and stays, and under her stays I found these two small flannel petticoats, two shirts,</p>

               <p>and a large flannel petticoat, beside the one she was wearing, and in her pocket I found worsted, tape, socks, and these other things, and a purse of duplicates—I asked her where she got the soap—she said she bought it in Shoreditch, but she did not know where—she did not say anything about the other things.</p>

On the 10th of Dec. she had leave to go out—I have looked at these articles—they belong to the Union—this it a woman's flannel petticoat, whicli was given to the prisoner to wear in the house—this thread, and tape, and other things, are the same as are used in that house—the prisoner is nurse there, and these things are given to her, but the had no right to remove them from there.</p>

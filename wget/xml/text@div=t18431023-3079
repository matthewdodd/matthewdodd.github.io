                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Smith, publican, Kinggate-street, Holborn—on the 12th of October I went into my bed-room, which is the front room, second floor, and put two sovereigns, a crown piece, two half-crowns, and seven shillings, into a drawer—there were two spoons and a watch of my husband's in it—I locked it—a tea-caddy was standing on the drawers—my watch was in the caddy—I left the room between twelve and one in the day, locked the door, and hung the key on a nail in the bar parlour—the pri<lb></lb>soners had been customers—as I was coming down stairs, I saw the prisoners and another man not in custody, in the bagatelle-room, which is on the first floor—they were standing by the board—one had the mace in his hand, and the other was sitting down—I had seen the third man there before in the prisoners' company two or three times—about half-past one the prisoners came from up stairs, and passed through the bar parlour, the bar, and the passage, and went out—they asked for some gin—I was at dinner, and my husband served them—they were all three together—they paid their reckon<lb></lb>ing and went away—I dined in the bar parlour, which commands a view of the bar—no one had been up after I came down—about four I went into my bed-room and found the drawer and tea-caddy broken open, and the money, watches, and spoons gone—the lock of the door was picked, but not injured in the least—it could not have been opened by my key, because I had it down stairs—there is no other way of going into the bagatelle-room, and to my bed-room, but through the bar parlour—I can undertake to say, that no one had</p>

               <p>gone up those stairs from the time I came down and hung up the key, till my husband went up after the prisoners had gone—I had no servant—I have two lodgers up stairs, but they went out at nine o'clock, and did not return till the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep this public-house. Between twelve and one o'clock this day, I saw the prisoners and another man at our house—I had seen them in company several times before—Pendleton and the other man came in company on this day—Martin came in soon after, and asked if his friends were there—he walked up stairs into the bagatelle room—my wife was up stairs in the bed room—before Martin came in Pendleton ordered a glass of gin and water—I went up stairs, and saw him and the other man there when I took it up—I came down stairs, and in the course of a minute Martin came in—I afterwards saw them altogether up stairs in the bagatelle room—I was not absent from the bar more than a minute, when I took up the gin and water—while I was gone I let the flap of my bar down, and shut the door, so that no one could have gone up stairs while I was there without my meeting them—no one was up stairs but my wife to my knowledge—she came down in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—she came into the bar where I was—I did not leave the bar, except when I went up with the gin and water, unless my wife was there—I remember the pri<lb></lb>soner and the third man coming down stairs—they had something to drink at the bar, paid for what they had up stairs, and left—while we were at din<lb></lb>ner, no one came in to go up stairs, till the prisoners went away—if they had I must have seen them, as they must have passed through the bar and the bar parlour—no one went out after the prisoners—I went up stairs about four o'clock, with the key of the bed-room, which I took from the bar par<lb></lb>lour—I found the lock had been picked—the lock had not gone quite back—the drawer had been rifled, and the property in the tea-caddy was gone—the money that was gone was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Saturday night after, I was in Fleet-street, and saw the prisoners with several others—I ran to the officers who were before me, and Restieaux took Pendleton—Martin started off,</p>

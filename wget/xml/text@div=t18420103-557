                  </hi>. I work on board a ship, but I get my employment from Mr. Chicken—I know the prisoner. Between eight and nine o'clock, on the 30th of December, he came into the tap-room and <hi rend="italic">lit</hi> his pipe—he then went out—I followed, and when he got opposite the bar I saw him put his hat on—I thought there was something in it—I went and called Brown—we followed him—he was running as fast as he could—he ran up Gold's-hill—when he got half way up he took something out of his hat, and ran on to Three Cups-alley, and threw what he had over a wall—he ran on to High-street, and there I lost him—I spoke to a man, and then I went into a barber's shop, and found the prisoner there—this pot was picked up by a witness—the prisoner threw what he had over the wall of a cooperage—I am sure he is the man.</p>

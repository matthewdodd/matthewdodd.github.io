On the 26th of May, about four four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and presented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280007"></xptr>a petition for relief, I said I could give her nothing, and desired her to go. She stopped a few minutes, and then walked towards the door. She had come 12 or 14 yards into the warehouse - some pieces of Aberdeen dowlas were standing on their ends in the warehouse; they generally run about sixty yards; the lowest price we can buy them for is 3 l. a piece. She passed them as she came in and as she went out. I saw her stoop - (the dowlas is twenty-seven inches high) - I then followed her to the door. I saw her come from the cloth, which was between the two doors. I will not swear it, but I have every reason to believe it was not there when she came in - it-was not the proper place for it. She then sat herself down on the step of the outer door, before the piece of cloth. She stopped a minute or two, then looked round, took up the cloth, threw her handkerchief or apron over it, and then walked down the street with it; I followed and brought her back with it under her arm. I knew it to be my masters' property - it has a private mark on it in my own hand-writing; it cost above 3 l. I sent for a constable, who took her in charge. She appeared quite sober, and told me she had had nothing to eat or drink.</p>

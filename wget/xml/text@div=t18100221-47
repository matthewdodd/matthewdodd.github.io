On the night of the 5th of February, at eleven o'clock, I examined all the fastenings of my shop, and saw it was all perfectly secure, and I and my family went to bed. In the morning, about half past seven, I was informed that my house was broken open. When I came down I found that the shutter of the shop door window had been broken open; the shutter had been wrenched off, and the iron bar had been taken down. One of them was fastened by a padlock: the padlock was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you by what means this violence had been done - A. It appeared as if it had been done by two iron crows; the marks of the crows were remaining in the wood; a pane of glass was taken out; I think they must have put some person in through the place where the pain of glass was taken out; it was large enough for a man or a boy to be put in. I suppose the shop door had been opened in that way. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210032"></xptr>fastenings were all off when I came down, and the bar laid upon the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. The outer door next the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any of your property stolen - A. Yes; all that property mentioned in the indictment. Fourteen hundred pounds worth of cloth.</p>
               <p>COURT. That, I suppose, was almost all the stock in the shop - A. No; there was a good deal left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What sort of cloth was it - A. It was mostly superfine cloth, and part of it milled kerseymere.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know, sir, whether you were with the officers when they apprehended the prisoner - A. I was. He was apprehended in Bottle-hay-yard, St. John-street, three or four days after the robbery was committed. On searching the prisoner's room we found two iron crows; the officers took these crows and fitted them to the impressions on my door, in my presence; they exactly fitted. I have no doubt at all but the impressions had been made by these crows.</p>
               <p>Q. Among other things did you find any cloth there which you knew to be your property - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there then light enough from the heavens to see the face of a man - A. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been in that state - A. It had not been long; it is dark at seven o'clock at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was not light half an hour - A. No; it could not have been.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down in what condition did you find the shop - A. There is a door in the passage that leads into the shop, which I usually go in of a morning, I found it fastened on the inside, which led me to suspect that there had been somebody inside had fastened it. I went to the shop door and found that the shutter had been taken down and replaced; the shop door I opened, which I found only on the latch; the iron bar was laying in the shop; there were marks of crows underneath the shutters. I found a pane of glass had been taken out. The shop was in confusion, and cloth was laying all over the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, Stanton, and Mr. Gustard, go, on the 10th of January, to the lodgings of the prisoner - A. I did; at two o'clock in the day; his lodgings were at No. 4, Bottle-hay-yard, St. John-street; I knocked at the door, the prisoner's wife opened it; I asked if Mr. Maddox was at home; she said, yes. I went in the room; I found the prisoner in bed; his room was down stairs. I told Mrs. Maddox that I had a search warrant to search the same room, in the prisoner's hearing. I searched the room; I found in a drawer fifteen skeleton keys, and under the stairs, by the bed's head, ten bales of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean ten pieces - A. Yes. Some whole pieces and some parts of pieces. I went out to Mr. Gustard and informed him that we had found his property; he then came in. I told the prisoner to get up and dress himself; I then took him in custody. Stanton found the pistols and crows in my presence, in the same drawer I found the skeleton keys; he found two loaded pistols, one of them loaded with slugs, and two iron crows. I have the charge of the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Stanton to Mr. Gustard's to fit these iron crows. - A. I did. I found the impression made on the door to correspond with them crows; I have no doubt that these crows had been used for that purpose; one is broader than the other; one fitted the impression to the right and the other to the left. One of the crows is jagged, I found the impression jagged.</p>
               <p>Q. How many places did you find the crows to correspond - A. Three; two on the outside, and one on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates - A. Stratton found the duplicate concerning the cloth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had he a house to himself - A. No; an apartment only; his wife and he lived in the room; she ran away.</p>

             I am a cabinet maker; I live in Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn fields.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 5th of February, or the morning of the 6th, did you come through Bedford-street - A. I did; at two o'clock in the morning. I passed Mr. Gustard's house; I observed two men at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210033"></xptr>door, they appeared to me to be attempting to force the lock of the door; on my approaching one of them turned down Henrietta-street, and the other up Bedford-street. I followed one of them, and, in doing so, I passed a watchman; I turned round and spoke to the watchman; then I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they - A. One of them was like the prisoner in size; not having seen his face, I do not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the dark blue cloth - that corresponds with that found at the pawnbroker's - A. They were examined, both, at the office by me and Mouls. I know the cloth produced by Mr. Chapman perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. First look at that piece of blue cloth found at the prisoner's lodgings; what is the quantity there - A. There were eighteen yards stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the quantity at the prisoner's lodgings, and the quantity pawned, to make up that quantity - A. No; there were two yards deficient. The quantity pawned is two yards and a quarter, and fourteen yards were found at the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that that remnant, pawned at Mr. Chapman's, was torn off that very piece - A. Yes; we have matched it; it agrees exactly. I am quite sure it was torn off that piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that cloth found at the prisoner's lodgings - A. About one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. The other piece produced by the pawnbroker is light blue - A. Yes; that corresponds with that piece. The quantity stolen was seven yards and a quarter; we found five yards at the prisoner's lodgings, and Chapman produces two yards and a quarter; it is my property. The dark grey is my property; there is six yards and a half; there were damages in it; and the list is very particular. I have examined it all; I believe all that is here is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the theft. It was brought to my place on the 6th of January, about half after five in the morning. There was a person that worked fellow servant with me, and lodged in the same yard with myself, he was in the habit of calling me in the morning when he was up first, and I was in the habit of calling him if I was up first. I gave the watchman orders on the over night to call me between two and three o'clock, he came and called me in the morning between two and three o'clock; I had been very ill about a fortnight before with the pain in my bowels; I told my wife not to go to sleep. I had a good deal of work to do; I expected this man to call me when he went to work; I went to sleep and my wife went to sleep. About half after five I heard a knock at the shutters, I called out loud; I did not know but what it was this young man,

They told me that it was the property of a person failing in business, they would be much obliged to me to let them be there till the evening; I said I did not know but I might be at work very late in the evening, but my wife with be at home all day, she will give them you. I have never seen the parties since, from that day to this. I am entirely innocent of it. I told Mr. Stanton the officer how they came there the first night they took me in custody. They took me to the house of Correction, I was three weeks there; I could not see any person so that I could not make any defence. I told him so on the first night; he came and said, Maddox, if you mean to do any good, if you know any thing, tell me; I told him; he said he was very sorry for it; if they were living he would have them; he said, that would clear me of my trouble.</p>

As I had known him four or five years I gave him a pint of beer and some money to get a little tobacco. I never knew any harm of him to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who the persons were - A. Yes; he told me one was

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 5th of January what time you went to bed - A. At eleven o'clock, I believe. The prisoner was in the house, and I believe he went to bed at that time; I did not see him; I heard him in his own room. His room is under mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the door (that night) of your house - A. Mr. Maddox. He asked me if I was going out any more, I told him, no; he fastened the door. About one o'clock I heard him cough; I was very ill that night and could not rest, and I heard him cough at past five in the morning, before he went out; he went out after five, but how much I cannot tell. I heard him answer the watchman at two o'clock, when the watchman called him.</p>

               <p>Q. If he had gone out at the time that you supposed he was up stairs, must not you have heard him go out. - A. He very seldom went out but what I heard him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that he went out before five o'clock. - A. Not till after five o'clock, that I solemnly pledge myself that night.</p>

               <p>Q. This was a very wakeful night to you indeed. - A. Yes, I was very ill; I had a bad cough.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first asked to come here, and give evidence for him - A. Mr. Bennett, the attorney, was the first person that asked me; I believe, last Monday.</p>
               <p>A. Are you quite sure that no person made application to you to come here before last Monday - A. When Mr. Maddox was in Clerkenwell prison; he spoke to me about it, that is a fortnight ago to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you of the night of the 4th and the morning of the 5th, could you give me the history of that as particular as you have of this night of the 6th that you have been speaking of. - A. On the night of the 4th, he helped me with a tub, and then wished me good night; I went to bed nigh ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were all night laying and counting the clock on the 4th. - A. Yes, I was</p>
               <p>Q. And the same on the night of the 3d. - I can't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say you mostly heard the prisoner go out of a morning. - A. Very seldom that he went out but what I heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he chose to go out softly, I suppose he could. - A. I do not think he could; the door makes such a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after five was it on the morning of the 6th. - A. A quarter after five, or half after five; I got up before Maddox went out, and staid in my own apartment till seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house quiet all the time, except Maddox's going out. - A. Yes; I never heard any thing but Maddox go out; I heard the spring latch catch.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any man come that morning, you must have heard him. - A. I did not hear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had come, and knocked at the door at hall after five, you must have heard him. - A. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons knock at the door at half past five. - A. I did not hear any; I never missed of hearing the watchman call Maddox.</p>
               <p>Q. And at five you were up, if any persons had knocked, you must have heard them. - A. I must; I never heard any body knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. If three men came, and knocked at the door, and brought great bundles, you must have heard them. - A. I must, I should have thought. I am very quick of hearing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

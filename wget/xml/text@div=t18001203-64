               <p>Q. At the time you charged the prisoner with this offence, was he in your service? - A. Yes, as <rs id="t18001203-64-deflabel347" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Had you, before this offence, missed any of your property? - A. Yes, we suspected the prisoner.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that suspicion, what did you do? - A. The prisoner, upon the Tuesday evening, was in the act of shutting up the shop; and as we were determined, in consequence of lo sing several articles, to watch him, he did not come in so readily as I could wish, and I went out and brought him in with me, and I asked him what he had got in his pockets; I put my hand upon the outside of his pocket, and I felt something like a bread and butter plate; I then pushed him forwards towards the desk, and he took out of his pocket a China bread and butter plate, and a black milk-pot; I then asked him where he got them; he told me, in the warehouse, and that they were our property; I neither threatened him, or made any promises; we then sent for a constable, and went and searched his lodgings, and we found the other articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those such articles as you dealt in? - A. Yes, they were; I believe them all to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular marks about the plate you took out of his pocket? - A. It was a very remarkable one; we had had it in the house man years; it was a very old-fashioned pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Agar. Q. You dealt in those articles, but you cannot swear to them? - A. I am positive they are my property.</p>

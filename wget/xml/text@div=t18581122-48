                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 98, Paul-street, Finsbury. On the 18th September, at 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Chiswell-street, and met the prisoner, who asked me if I wanted to buy any cigars—I went into a public-house in Chiswell-street with him, and had some beer—he then produced a watch and chain, and asked me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him whether the watch was not German silver—he said, "No," and he wished God Almighty might strike him dead if it was not silver, and the chain gold; that he was a smuggler come from Boston, in America, and the captain died and he <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> his watch—he came down to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. without any intermediate price—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I noticed that he was anxious to get away from me afterwards, and I followed him—he said that if I followed him he would knock my b—y eyes out—I continued</p>

               <p>to follow him till I saw a policeman, and then gave him in custody, as I thought he had taken me in, and that the watch was not silver—he did not mention the value of it, but he asked 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he afterwards said that the head steward of the vessel gave him the watch—I should not have paid him the sovereign if he had not said that the watch was silver and the chain gold.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>). I am a watchmaker, of 36, Pitfield-street—this watch is German silver, electro-plated, and the chain is metal, electro-gilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the value of the watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eight shillings, and the chain about two shillings.</p>

On the evening of the 18th November, at 7 o'clock, I took the prisoner in the City-road, and asked him how he came to defraud the young man of the pound by selling him the watch—he said, "What has that to do with you?"—I was in uniform—he resisted violently, but with the assistance of two other constables I got him to the station—he is a powerful man, and was in liquor—he knew what he was doing—he had got a quantity of such jewellery about him, such as pins.</p>

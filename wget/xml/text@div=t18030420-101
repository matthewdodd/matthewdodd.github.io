            , the warehouse is under Mr. Lobban's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe to us what kind of floor there is to the warehouse? - A. It is an old floor, it is wood; the prisoner has been eleven years warehouseman with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How is this warehouse situated with respect to the street? - A.There is a court-yard; Mr. Lobban's house stands in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the entrance into this yard? - A. Through a pair of great gates, or otherwise a hatch, which a coach can drive in.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the warehouse generally secured? - A. There are shutters, and a lock to the door, and a staple over the lock, to which a padlock is affixed; the padlock was put on in the evening, when the warehouse was done with.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose possession were the keys of the lock of the door kept? - A. The prisoner had a key, and I had a key, and no body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who generally kept the key of the padlock? - A. No body but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me who had the possession on the 20th of February last? - A.The prisoner; it was on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key of the padlock upon that occasion? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q.Relate to his Lordship and the Jury if any thing passed upon the 20th of February respecting this warehouse? - A. As near as I can guess, sometime after seven in the evening, there came a knock at the door very violent; the servant called me out; I immediately went to the warehouse on hearing it was on fire; I found a crowd in the yard, the padlock was knocked off, and the door bursted open; the warehouse was full of smoke, and the cask, which had been on fire, rolled out into the yard to be extinguished, which saved the warehouse; it was a whole cask, with the head out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the cask? - A. It was full of ashes, or something, I presume shavings; indeed I will say there were shavings that were left.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you been last there? - A. To the best of my recollection not since the Thursday evening myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you observed any cask in your warehouse of that description? - A. There certainly was a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any carpenters' there? - A.There had been a door mended on the opposite side of the yard; that door belonged to me, it was an outward door; it might be a week or twelve days before this conslagration.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner came to the warehouse that evening? - A. Yes, nearly as I can recollect, about half an hour after I got there; when the man came into the yard there was a general buzz; here comes the warehouseman; I said, say nothing, let him come in; I let him come into the warehouse, and asked him rather sharply what business he had there that afternoon, his answer was, I came to feed the cat; I said you must give a better account of this business before we part; he turned round as if to go away; upon which I observed, as that is the case, Sir, I shall cut the matter short; I asked whether there was a constable present; there was one, whom I delivered him to, to take to the Compter immediately, and bring him before the Lord Mayor the next morning, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the key which you had in your possession? - A. It always hung before my desk in the accompting-house; I took the key with me in consequence of the alarm of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time after this, which did not occur before the Lord Mayor? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you made him any offers of favour? - A. I am positive I did not; I went to him about a fortnight after this business, for in taking the stock I missed a considerable quantity of goods in this warehouse, and asked him what had become of these goods; he at first denied knowing any thing about them; I told him that he must know what was become of them; I made use of this observation to him - I have often suspected people that may be innocent; the warehouse was broke open twice two years running, you have now heaped guilt enough upon your head, and may as well tell the truth, and I shall no longer suspect innocent people; says he, Sir, I will tell you to morrow; I said you may as well tell me now, upon which he walked up and down the room two or three times agitated, and said, I took them, and sold them to such and such people, naming the people.</p>
               <p>Q.Where are those people now? - A. I took them up before a Magistrate, and they are now upon bail.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you have the goodness to tell us in what state the windows are in at your warehouse? - A.The windows which have no shutters are, certainly broke a good deal, but there is a very thick iron grating before the windows; they are not wide enough to admit of a child; they are about six inches apart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. The prisoner lived eleven years with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And had a favourite cat in the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the property you have missed? - A. As near as I could calculate between two and three hundred pounds, at least.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Lobban; I have lived in his service near a quarter of a year; I was there at the time of the fire; he lives in Great Winchester-street, No. 28; I know the prisoner at the bar; I don't know in whose employ he was; I saw him on the day the fire happened, at Mr. Lobban's, in Winchester-street, as near as I can guess between four and five in the afternoon; he rung at the bell and I let him in; I did not let any other person in with him; he went to Mr. Geledneki's warehouse; I don't know where he went in; I saw him take the lock in his hand, and that was all I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone into the house, how long was it before the fire happened? - A. As near as I can guess seven o'clock, it might be ten minutes after; I went to the finishing shop to get some coals, it is across the yard, and as I came out I saw Mr. Geledneke's warehouse on fire; I immediately set my coal-scuttle down, and gave the alarm to my mistress that the premises were on fire, and then I ran to the gate and gave the same alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner staid there after you admitted him into the yard? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let him out? - A. He went across the yard, and I went to see if the gate was shut, and it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any one come into the yard when the gate was shut, unless it was opened on the inside? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had let the prisoner out, and before you discovered the fire, had you admitted any other person into the yard? - A. Yes, an acquaintance of my fellow-servant's.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner went out, how long was it before your fellow-servant's acquaintance came in? - A. As near as I can guess about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did your fellow-servant's acquaintance go to? - A. He came across the yard into Mr. Lobban's kitchen; he continued in the house about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he the whole of the ten minutes in the house? - A. Yes, talking to my fellow-servant; I let him out again; I went with him to the gate; he went directly out without stopping in the yard; I shut the gate after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let in any other person before the fire happened? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person go out of the house into the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gate continue shut until you gave the alarm of fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the alarm of fire, was the warehouse door shut or open? - A.Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one come into the yard upon your giving the alarm? - A. No, not till I opened the gate to let them come into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any one open the warehouse door after the people were admitted into the yard? - A. I opened the gate, and a great many people came in, and a gentleman broke the door open with a poker; I have seen the gentleman here to day, this is the gentleman, Mr. Jepson.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Boldero, the banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Winchester-street, at Mr. Lobban's house, at the time of the alarm of fire being given? - A. I was not there at the time the alarm was given, but I was there between the hours of seven and eight o'clock at night, I cannot exactly speak to the time; when I got into Mr. Lobban's yard, there were three females.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to get into Mr. Lobban's yard? - A. The first thing that I heard was the screaming of female voices; I was in my way home; I turned round, and a man came running down the street crying fire; I went into Mr. Lobban's yard, the gate was open, and first I observed three ladies standing there; I asked them where the fire was; I observed the fire through the window of a warehouse, which I understood to belong to Mr. Geledneki; I asked the ladies if they had got the key of the warehouse; they said, no; I asked them if they had a crow, or any thing I could force the door with; they then brought me a poker; I observed there was a lock and a padlock; I resorted to the poker, and broke the hanging lock off; the other lock was not locked; as soon as ever the padlock was off, I took the catch off, and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the warehouse at the time? - A.Directly opposite the door there was a large cask, or hogshead, which was on fire, and blazed nearly to the roof of the premises; the head of the cask was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the flames force their way through the hoops of the cask? - A. They came through the staves, and came right up as well as out of the head of the cask; we called immediately for water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the warehouse having been burnt? - A. We did not go so nigh; we called for water, and we succeeded in a few minutes in putting out the fire; after the fire had been extinguished, I desired first of all that the cask might not be brought into the warehouse, for fear there might be any fire in it; in turning the cask upside down, a quantity of burnt shavings appeared to fall out of it, with a piece of the cask, or some other matter, which appeared nearly consumed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return to the warehouse? - A. I did; I first looked into the shavings to see if I could find any thing by which I could suppose it had been set on fire, and there was a flat piece of board, near the place where the cask was, which appeared to be a lid of a box; it was scorched a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200110"></xptr>little; very near the mouth of the cask, there was a box to which that flat piece of board seemed to be the lid of; there was likewise a large cask, which stood by the side, which appeared to be very much scorched, and which I have no doubt would very soon have been on fire; I was very much afraid that the fire had got into the cask, as smoke appeared to be issuing from it, and therefore I imagined there was fire inside of it; I wished it to be opened, and it was opened by Mr. Geledneki's desire; it was filled with furs; it appeared this cask was not on fire; I observed three or four other casks standing round, but they were not scorched.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being called upon on Sunday, the 20th of February, to any place? - A. Yes, I was called to Chigwell; I was coming by Great Winchester-street, and stopped my engine there; I heard a piece of work, and people run after me to stop my engine; I went to Winchester-street, to Mr. Geledneki's warehouse, the fire was out; I went into the warehouse, and made an enquiry about the fire, how it might happen; I went to inspect into it, and I saw a quantity of shavings lay close by the door, part burnt and part unburnt; I examined the flooring, and found it was burnt; I examined the cask, and I saw part of it was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Having been a fireman for sixteen years, you can tell us whether that appearance of fire was of long standing, or whether it immediately happened? - A. It could not have been, to the best of my judgment, more than two or three hours burning.(Mr. Alley then addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Mr. Geledneki.) Was there any body, besides the prisoner, that went into the warehouse between the Thursday and the Sunday, and was that at candle-light or day-light? - A.Not any body but the prisoner only, by day-light, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 12th of Dec, I hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at Notting hill to drive me to the Coach and Horses at Ealing—the prisoner drove it—I had a canvass bag in my pocket, containing four so<lb></lb>vereigns, two half-sovereigns, four half-crowns, six shillings, two sixpences, and a key—I am a carrier—that money belonged to me—I told the driver I should sleep all the way—I was tired and sleepy—I slept all the way—we got to the Coach and Horses at Ealing, the ostler came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and awoke me up—I got out, and said, "Where is the cabman?"—he was gone in doors to have some coffee—I went in to pay him—I put my hand in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pocket, and missed my purse and money—I had nothing to pay him—I called him out, and accused him of robbing me—he said he had not—I said, "You have; I insist on having the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and you searched by the policeman"—there was no policeman—the ostler brought a light and looked in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but found nothing—I said, "Look again"—he did, and found nothing—the prisoner then looked in—I then called the ostler again, and he looked, and there was one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and my key, under the straw—the policeman came up, I gave the prisoner in charge, and we all went to the station—the police<lb></lb>man searched the prisoner, and then the prisoner said, "Now search him," meaning me—he said, "I know his purse is about him"—I said, "I know it is not"—he searched me, and drew my purse out of my waistcoat pocket, which it had not been in before—I always carry it in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I said I would swear to the purse—they then searched the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and found two more sovereigns behind the wadding of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and then there was another sovereign found there.</p>

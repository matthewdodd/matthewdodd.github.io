               <p>saw the body at the inquest—in consequence of further information, I went to the "Duke of Sussex" public-house in Grange-road, Bermondsey—I saw the prisoner—I told him I took him for being concerned in a prize-fight, and that McDonald was lying in a suffering condition in Guy's Hospital—he asked how McDonald was, and hoped he would recover—I cautioned him not to make any statement—he replied, "It is better to tell the truth" he then said he left London at 8 o'clock by the train for Abbey Wood, and afterwards fought with McDonald for near an hour, and the last round they closed and fell together; McDonald's head being under his arm, and he received the injury, that the fight was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a side.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Grange-road, Bermondsey. I went to the fight at Abbey Wood—I saw the whole of it—it lasted about 35 minutes—I observed the last round—they both closed together, McDonald fell, and the prisoner on him—the prisoner was taken up—I did not observe in what position McDonald's head was—I heard McDonald say when he was down that he was dying—it was about two or three minutes after he was thrown that I heard that exclamation, during the time he was lying on the ground after the fall—he seemed to be very much wounded—he was lying on the ground on his back—his seconds raised him up as well as they could.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you there at the commencement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was a fair fight, as far as I could see—I do not know whether the deceased was a boxer—the prisoner was punished in the fourth or fifth round; I heard him say to his seconds that he should give the fight up—he was struck in the ribs—he was not knocked down—McDonald came to the ground every time—he fell every round—I don't know whether in the last round he received a blow—it did not appear to be a blow—they closed and fell together—this was on 28th November—I do not know that the fight had been made up by some friends of both parties—it was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a side.</p>

I heard a noise and went up and saw the fight—I was in time to see the last round—I saw the prisoner throw the deceased—his head was under his arm, and he fell, and the prisoner fell over him—McDonald remained on the ground two or three minutes, he was gasping for breath—the seconds took the prisoner away—some men who were there lifted McDonald on their shoulders and took him to the "Harrow."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Guy's Hospital. I saw the deceased about 10 or 11 o'clock on the evening of 28th November—he was then in a dying condition; and he had evidently suffered from severe injury to the spinal cord near the neck, above the shoulders—he had a slight injury under the right eye, and some few cuts and bruises with fists—I was present at the post-mortem examination—we found a dislocation of the bones of the back—the dislocation of one of the vertebrae would not cause death, but the crushing of the spinal cord, which is contained in those bones,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130102"></xptr>
               <p>would occasion death—the cause of his death was the crushing of the spinal cord—I should imagine that a person falling on his neck, and another person falling over him, might have occasioned such an injury—I was present a few minutes before his death—he died at a quarter before 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have heard the evidence of the fight—supposing a person had received several falls, and was in an exhausted state, and he was carried in that exhausted state for half a mile on a sort of stretcher, was it not possible that the accident might have been caused by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear that it is impossible, but it is most improbable—I should think if he were carried by railway, and then in a cab in any bungling way I should think it could not have been produced—it is not impossible, if the head had been suddenly jerked, that this might have occurred, but I think it is highly improbable.</p>

I missed a great many things; and when these things were produced, they appeared to be my property. The first time I saw them again, was at justice Wilmot's, (except a pair of boots, which by the permission of Mr. Alderman Townsend, I took away; having nothing left but slippers this man having first made a mark in them, that he might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160006"></xptr> know them;) I saw the boots at the Red-Lion, at Tottenham, about the middle of the day; this was the morning after that I heard they were at Tottenham, at the Red-Lion. I found the man belonging to the Red-Lion, he told me he could not deliver any thing without Mr. Alderman Townsend's authority. I went to the Alderman, and informed him of my situation, that I had nothing to wear but a pair of slippers; he went with me, and I got the boot.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the boots so delivered to you, were your boots? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they been in the house the night before? - I had worn them the day before, I did not pull them off till eleven o'clock the night before; I delivered them to my servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What time in the morning was it that you first discovered this? - Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Is there any other person that speaks as to the time of the house being broke open? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>You are perfectly satisfied as to the identity of the boots? - Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the house was fastened as to the outer fastenings? - I cannot tell as to the outer fastenings, being only a lodger; but a part of the window was forced open, and the tracks of feet from thence.</p>
               <p>LANE HARRIS sworn.</p>
               <p>Where did you get these boots that you delivered to Mr. Finch, by order of Alderman Townsend? - They were in this bag with the other things.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am one of the Toll-men. A cart came up, about a quarter past three, as near as I can guess, on the Sunday mor ning, the 29th of September, at the Green-lanes turnpike, going up to Hornsey; it came there, and two people in the cart appeared at first; they asked me to take my toll, they gave me all bad half-pence, and I disputed them; then one of the guards that was along with me, wanted to examine the cart; (we have two guards every night, for the safety of the roads, ordered by the commissioners) they said they had nothing but a bag of linen, and they hoisted it out themselves, that was this bag; he took it into the house, the guard's name is Bond: then he desired me to take hold of it, and see it; I put in my hand, and the first thing I saw was a child's frock, and I said it would not do; and I went to the horse's head, and stopped the cart. There were four in the cart, I stopped them all: one drove it, and the other set by the side of him, and the other two were laying buried under some hay, so that I did not see them at first. The men behaved extremely civil, and wanted to come down; they all agreed to get down to see these things examined; and as soon as they were got down on the near side of the cart, they all ran away, just like as one may say, shot out of a gun. The guard run after them on the off side of the cart, and shot at them, but there were only three swan shot in his pistol; and they all got off.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you an opportunity to observe their persons, so as to know them again? - Not me.</p>
               <p>Court. They all got clear off then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has that bag been in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does it contain the same things that it did then? - Yes, to my knowledge; there is Mr. Finch's name within the boots, and a mark I can swear to, which I put myself.</p>
               <p>The other things are the same that were in the bag? - To the best of my knowledge, I sealed it; I have no reason to think that any thing has been changed.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by Mr. Finch; and the boots deposed to by Harris, who marked them.)</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of these things be? - I valued them at 10 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Put a moderate and reasonable value on the things, there seems to be no reason why you should under value them? - The other things I am no judge of.</p>
               <p>What other things are there? - Three muslin robes, I value them at one guinea and a half, they are worth more than that;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160007"></xptr> here is another dimity robe, that is worth half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. Are any of the things marked Mr. Finch? - They are all stained with and wine, they were carried down into the country on purpose to be bleached, and I believe I saw them every day; I have not the smallest doubt of their being mine; there are three cotton gowns, I valued them at half a crown a piece; here are four frocks, value half a crown a piece, here are two skirts, value two shillings, an old pair of shoes which I know perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Mr. Finch. I suppose you do not know them by any thing but the general appearance? - No.</p>
               <p>To Harris. You say it was a little after three that the cart passed the turnpike? - To the best of my knowledge I had just been up to look at the person's watch that was in the house.</p>
               <p>It could not be more than a quarter past three? - I think not.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was moon-light, but the moon was clouded, it rather rained.</p>
               <p>Is not this turnpike eastward of Hornsey? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>How far do you take it to be from Barnet, take it the nearest way you can, suppose a horseman to go it? - About six or seven miles.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>You were the guard at this turnpike in the latter end of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember this cart coming up to the gate; and stopping it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing any of the men, so as to know them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you observe, so as to know him again? -

               <p>Could you in seeing a man, that you had never seen before, for about two minutes or a little more in a cloudy morning about three o'clock, observe his features so as to know him a week after? - I am sure he is the same person.</p>

               <p>You did not speak to the prisoner? - No.</p>

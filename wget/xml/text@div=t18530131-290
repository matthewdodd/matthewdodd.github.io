                  </hi>. My husband's name is James Aldridge. On Saturday evening, 30th Jan., I left home about 10 o'clock, and returned about half past 11 o'clock—as I was going up stairs I saw the prisoner come out of my room with a candle in her hand, and go into her own room, which is on the same floor—I had locked my room door when I went out, but about ten minutes afterwards I gave the key my little boy to come home and go to bed—I went into my room, looked about, and found the prisoner's apron at the further end of the room—I gave it to her, and asked her if it was hers—she said, "Yes"—I asked her whether she was in my room—she said she was not—I swear I saw her come out—I afterwards searched my room, and missed my husband's coat and waistcoat, a square of flannel, and several other articles, which were safe when I went out—I then went and got a policeman, and went with him into the prisoner's room—I found my little girl's frock under the prisoner's bedstead, and after the prisoner was locked up we found my husband's coat and waistcoat, the flannel, and several other articles in a pillow case—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my husband's—when I spoke to the prisoner, she denied having been in my room, and said she had seen a person on the stairs; which the landlady, in the prisoner's presence, said was false—when I came home I found the children in bed and asleep—my eldest child is thirteen years old.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I tell you I had been knocking at your door two or three times, to tell you about who had been up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you said you had been to my door at three different times, but you were in the room when I came up—you said you missed a flannel shirt out of your own drawers—you turned up your bed in the policeman's presence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 538). I was sent for to the last witness's house, and received the prisoner in charge—I took her to the station—the prosecutrix's husband also went to the station, and be locked the prisoner's door before we went—we then went back, and found the property produced in a pillow case in the bed—I did not find the child's clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not turn my things over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in Mrs. Aldridge's presence, but the pillow case was not opened—it appeared like a pillow.</p>

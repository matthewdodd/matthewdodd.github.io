               <p>Q. Had the latch been broke? - A. Yes, it was forced open; I am positive it was fast when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your pigs? - A. In the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that can speak to Mansell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take Morris up? - A. Soon after; when I came home I was sent for to give charge of Morris; I never lost fight of Ranton till he got to the corner of the stable-yard; it was quite moon-light.</p>

               <p>JONATHAN KIRBY sworn. - I am a patrole; I was at the taking of Ranton; I found him in a hay-lost, lying upon two trusses of hay; I told him he was the man that had done the robbery, and he said he was asleep there; Davies immediately charged him as being one of the men.</p>
               <p>Ranton's defence. I am innocent of the fact; I was standing at the corner of my own yard when the watchman came up to me, and I went to lay down to sleep in my father's hay-lost.</p>
               <p>Morris's defence. I got up half an hour sooner than I thought it was, and going along, Davis came out and said his house was robbed, but he never laid hold of me at all, but away he went, and away I went and had some purl in the lane.</p>
               <p>Ranton called two witnesses, and Morris one who gave them a good character.</p>

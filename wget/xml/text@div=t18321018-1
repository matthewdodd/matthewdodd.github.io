On the 30th of August I was going along Cornhill, about three o'clock in the afternoon, or between three and four, dressed in the same uniform as I am now - I met the prisoner in Cornhill; I had never spoken to him before, but he had bowed to me in passing - when I met him, he said,"How do you do?" I bowed to him, and he accosted me and asked where I was going; I said to Austin-friars, and from there to Broad-street - I had a letter in my hand which I was going to take there; we went on together, and just as we got through Austin-friars and into London-wall he asked me if I would take a drop of porter; I said I had no objection, but he said he had no money - I said I did not mind, and we went into the public-house at the corner, and had a pint of porter; I paid for it - we stood and drank it - we came out of there with my letter in my hand which I was going to deliver, and he said he was very much in distress, and asked me if I knew four or five gentlemen whom he named, who belonged to the India-house - I told him I certainly did, and he then said would I give him a shilling or two, as he was very much in distress; I told him I had no money in my pocket, but if he would call on me any day at the India-house, I certainly would give him a shilling or two: we still continued going on to Crown-court, Broad-street, where my letter was going; I gave in the letter to the person, and left the prisoner at the door - it was raining very fast; when I gave in the letter to the person, he asked if I would take a glass of something to drink - I said No, I could not, as I had a person waiting for me, and he asked the prisoner to go in, which he did, and we all had a glass together; when we got out the prisoner said he was in a great hurry, and he was going to Stepney - I said Broad-street was his nearest way, but he said he would go a little way with me, as I was going to another place; we went by the chapel in Moorfields, and then on to the square - I pointed up Sun-street, and said that was his way; I was going up Chiswell-street - he still kept with me, and said he must have a shilling or two, as he was very much in distress - I said, as I had before, that I had none, but if he would call at the India-house I would give it him - he said it was all d-d nonsense, he must have it now; he went on with me till we came to the brewhouse in Chiswell-street; he then called out Hey! and a tall man crossed over towards us - the prisoner said to him, "What do you think? this old b - r has brought me all the way from Cornhill, and took me to a house (meaning the house where I had left my letter,) and wanted to take liberties with me;" the other man said directly "You had better give him 5s., for if he calls at the India-house, and exposes you, it will be such a disgraceful thing;" I told him he could not do that, for my character was so well known there, I could defy him or any one else to hurt me; they still followed me up to St. Luke's church, using bitter oaths - I went to where I had to go, and they followed me back, the prisoner still saying, "If you don't give me the money. I will give you in charge of a Policeman," and every pawnbroker's we came to, he said I had got a watch, which I could pawn - I objected to pawn my watch; he then said,"Give me one of your seals - that will fetch 5s.;" I said I should do no such thing, for I never was in a pawnbroker's in my life, but if he would call at the India-house, I would give him a shilling or two: in going along London-wall, they still followed me with violent threats, the prisoner kept saying if I did not give the 5s. he would charge me with the offence, and the other kept persuading me to give the 5s., and said it would expose me, for him to call on me - when we got to London-wall I called at a friend's house and said, "Mr. Jones, can you lend me 5s." - I was so alarmed I went to borrow the money to get rid of the parties; Mr. Jones gave me half a crown, two shillings, and one sixpence; I came out, and gave it to the prisoner - the other man then said, "Now I must have 5s. - you can't expect me to walk all this way for nothing;" I told him I had not any money, that I did not ask him to walk, and should not give him any thing - the prisoner then said,"I will give you half a crown of this - I know where to find him;" I said to him, "Do, and call, and I will give you the half-crown;" I then went home, and gave information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180004"></xptr>to two or three officers about our place, and told them I expected a young man to call; he did not call till the Monday following, when he called and said, "How do you do, Mr. Pearsall? you promised you would show me the sale-room;" I said, "I can't now, for the sale is going on;" he then said, "Give me the half-crown" - I said, "I have no money now, but I am going out to my dinner;" he went down the steps with me, and two officers took him - I gave him the 5s., because I was so alarmed and afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in the same dress as you are now? A. Yes, I am always in the same dress - I asked you to have some porter at the house we went into: I did not follow you into Mr. Jackson's, at the corner of Finch-lane; we did not go that way - I had never spoken to you before; I had seen you pass, and bowed to you.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you promise him the shilling or two? A. Because he mentioned the names of two or three gentlemen whom I knew, and I thought he was in distress - if I had had a shilling or two I should have given it to him, and I thought the gentlemen would have refunded it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask me to stand in the passage while you went into the house, and did you not offer me a part of your umbrella. Witness. I really do not know whether I had an umbrella, but I do not think I had.</p>

             (City Police-officer No. 67.) I took the prisoner in charge, and found two handkerchiefs and a case on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day stated I had been to boy a pair of iron rings, and was going to Aldersgate-street; I stood in the street, reading a picture about black jokes; the prosecutor brushed by me two or three times, and then he asked me which way I was going, and if I would take part of his umbrella - I thanked him, and went with him to the house with the letter; he went in with it, came out, and said, "It is all right;" I asked what he meant, and he took me in, and he got some liquor - Mr. Russell sat a chair for me by the bed, which was turned up; they then shut the door, and began to act in a very unmanly way to one another, and to me; I was alarmed, and said if they did not let me out I would alarm the place - they did, and we went out; as we were going along a tall man came up to Pearsall; they went to two public-houses, and then he went to Jones, and borrowed some money - when he came out I bade him good day, and asked when I should call for the ticket for the Diorams, which he had promised me; he said, "In a day or two;" I called on the Monday at the India-house, and asked one of the porters to call him; they did, and he was all in a tremble - I asked him if he would give me the ticket, and show me the India-house - he put down his head, and went away; he came back again in the course of a few minutes, and had some papers in his hand; he then said he was going to his dinner - I went out with him, and an officer came and took me; I asked what for, and the prosecutor said I had wanted half a crown of him - I then stated about a young man coming up to him, and he said that he was my friend, and that I had called him with a whistle or a Hey! I had lived with Mr. Dawson in Great St. Helens, for four years.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARSALL re-examined. Q. Is there any truth in the statement of your acting as he states? A. Not the least, and the other young man I never saw till he called him over with a Hay! I had the pint of porter and the glass of spirits.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you meet any officer after they spoke to you? A. Yes, several, but I was in such a fright I could not tell what to do.</p>
               <p>DAVID JAMES RUSSELL re-examined. Q. How long were these persons at your house? A. I suppose five or six minutes, not longer - I was there all the time, and never rose from my chair; I had a boot in my lap; they were in my presence all the time - there was not the least liberty taken all the time, and the prisoner never came further than the mat.</p>

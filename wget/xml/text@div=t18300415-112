They were to pay 6s. a piece - I did not know the donkey-man; they bought them not half a dozen yards from my brother's door; the officer came about twelve o'clock I went before the Magistrate, but I did not speak - I had never seen the man before; it was about half-past eight in the morning when they bought them - I am usually in service, but left my place last Saturday fortnight; I lived with Mr. Avis; the donkey had two baskets - one had the nets, and the other something-else; they came to search for Pearce's nets - they were taken out to dry, I believe; I do not know whether they were opened when they were bought - the donkey-man said they belonged to some one who was dead, and he could sell them cheap.</p>

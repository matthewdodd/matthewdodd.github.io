On the 24th of September I missed a ream of paper, in consequence of information - I saw one quire of it that day, at the house of Ephraim Finch's mother; he was in my employ, and is about sixteen or seventeen years old - I never allowed him to take paper for any purpose - I saw the other nineteen quires at the office, and am quite certain it is my manufacture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What mark have you on it? A.None; it is part of a large parcel, but seeing it constantly worked up and handling it I have no doubt of it - it has no appearance of waste-paper.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I went with him to Finch's mother's, where Finch slept; she produced a quire of paper from a drawer; it was worth at least 1s. - I am certain it is my father's - I returned to the manufactory; a Policeman was called in, and after Finch had given information I went, about five o'clock in the afternoon, to the prisoner's, in Edward-street, Portman-square - he is a grocer and cheesemonger; he was in the shop - the Policeman asked if he had not bought some paper of a boy that day; he hesitated a little, and said he had; that he hoped the boy had come by it honestly - the Policeman said indeed he had not, and wished him to produce it; he immediately produced nineteen quires, and said he had given at the rate of 2d. a lb. for it, 3s. 10d. in all - he accompanied the Policeman, without being forced, to the station-house; he remained in custody- he was taken before the Magistrate that evening, and was remanded - I believe he was permitted to go at large; he appeared on the Friday following, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was admitted to half? A. Certainly, and has surrendered to day - the paper was on a shelf in the shop; all of it, the whole marchant quires; there was none on the counter when I went in - the paper on the counter was of quite a different description; he keeps a respectable shop - the top of the paper was covered; the sides could be seen by any body.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer. I saw Finch come out of the warehouse, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, very cautiously, and as he approached me I said, "Where are you going with that paper?" he said,"I am going to Mr. Williams', Portland-road;" I went to Williams - I did not see Finch there; when I returned I told Jolly - Finch was brought in, and accused of this,</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to the prisoner's house, and asked if he had bought any paper of a boy - he said he had; I said, "You gave him 2d. a lb. for it;" he said Yes - I asked if he had got it: he said Yes; he took it off the shelf, and put it on the counter; there are nineteen quires; there was no other of that description on the counter - I said he had better go to the station with us; he went - I was at his final examination, but do not know when he was bailed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have a you doubt of his being bailed, as soon as his friends came? A. No; the Magistrate said he would take bail.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. JOLLY. Q.Could you have sworn to the paper, if you had not heard it had been taken there? A.When it was taken it was in a wrapper, with a duty-stamp on it; that was not on it then - I should certainly feel a hesitation in swearing to it without accompanying it with other circumstances - we buy the paper in this-state, and manufacture it into hangings; we sell it in quires occasionally - the cost price is 22s.</p>

            . I am seventeen years old, and have lived six years with Mr. Jolly. I took this ream of paper from the warehouse, with the wrapper on it - I took it home, took a quite out, and left it at my mother's; I took the wrapper, with the rest of the paper, to Mr. Harris', and got 3s. 10d. for the nineteen quires.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any questions about it? A. He asked if it was all right; I said Yes - he must have seen the wrapper; he asked me no other question; I took the paper about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - I did not see what became of the wrapper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell a lie for the world, could you? A. No, not on my oath; I have not told a lie about this - I said I was taking the paper to Williams', but I was not on my oath; I took the whole nineteen quires to the prisoner's at once, and was only once in his shop that day - I was not there so late as between eight and nine o'clock; I took no single quire there - I saw nobody in the shop but him; I never stole any thing before - my mother did not know it was stolen; I often took parcels<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200048"></xptr>there - she saw the paper, but went down stairs directly after; she said nothing to me about it - the prisoner only asked if it was all right; he did not say he did not want any - he weighed it; I asked 2d. a lb., which he gave me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was no wrapper to it - the boy came, and asked if I wanted paper; I said not particularly - he said it would suit me, and said, "Master always sends me to sell it at 2d. a lb., when it is cut at the end, and not fit for our use;" there was a quire on the counter; when Jolly's son came I pointed it out to him - he said, "That is right, give it us all."</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's shop, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, when Finch came with the paper - there was no wrapper, except the outsides, but there was no Excise stamp, or any thing on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Should you know the Excise-stamp? A. I think I should; I am not conversant with paper - the outside paper was like that produced; I was standing close by the parlour door, at the further end of the shop, and think he could not enter the shop without seeing me- there was nothing to draw his attention to me; I did not take sufficient notice to repeat what passed - I did not hear Harris ask him about his employer; it was not Mr. Harris that was in the shop - it was Mrs. Harris; Mr. Harris did not buy it - I believe I heard Mrs. Harris say afterwards, that he was gone out; I swear he was not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.What sum was asked for it? A. I do not know - if there was any bargain it must have been between Mr. Harris and the lad; that is, it did not take place with Mrs. Harris - I should suppose there was a previous hargain, but Mr. Harris was absent when the lad brought the portion of paper which I saw; it was rolled up, and there was not so much as is now produced - this could not all have been brought at one time; I reside in the home, and leave at nine o'clock, to attend an office in the City - I did not closely examine the paper, but will swear there is more here than I saw brought; I looked at it on the boy's arm - this would make a bundle double the size; it was perfectly clean paper, as it is now, without any cover - Harris told me the quantity produced at the office, and I told several people that was not all brought at once, and Harris told me it was brought at different times on that day, a day or two after it happened.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it possible to roll up that paper as you saw it rolled under his arm? A. No.</p>

            . I am a mealman, and live at Denham, in Bucks - I go to Pinner on the fourth Monday in every month, for orders, and generally call at Mrs. Webb's at seven or eight o'clock in the evening; I travel in a gig. On the 5th of November I went there about half-past seven o'clock, and went through the shop into the parlour; I remained there about a quarter of an hour - I did not see the prisoner there; I received some notes and a draft, which I put into my pocket-book, and three sovereigns, which I put into my purse - in going from Pinner to Ruislip; I pass the Black Horse at Eastcote - it is about half a mile from the half-mile gate, and half a mile from <placeName id="t18321129-9-crimeloc51">Ruislip</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon afterwards did he say so? A. In a very short time; I cannot say that I saw any bludgeons; the attack was from behind - I saw my man attack one of them, and that parto had a bludgeon, and I saw one in the hand of the man why knocked him down - I saw two bludgeons, but that was not the first attack; the prisoner was one of the two who had a bludgeon, and took an active part - he had a hairy cap on, and a drab coloured dress; I cannot tell whether it was a coat or jacket - I do not know what trousers he wore; I left my servant fighting with them, because I was disabled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to any body, "Well, I will not swear to him till I see whether my man does?" A. Never, nor any thing of the kind; I had a conversation with Mrs. Webb on the morning he was taken, but said nothing of the kind; I saw several bonfires on the road.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PEVERILL. I am servant to Mr. Fountain, and was in the chaise with him - we arrived at the half-mile gate about half-past eight o'clock, I think: there were three men in the road before us - I will not swear to them; directly we passed one of them seized the horse by the head, the other two dropped behind, and hit us with bludgeons; I jumped out, ran round the wheel, and made a grasp at the one who held the horse; the others came up instantly, and knocked me down - they were unbuttoning my clothes, to take what I had; they said, "Where is it, deliver it;" I said I had nothing to deliver - they said,"Where are your side pockets?" I said I had none; I am sure they had sticks - one of them said, "D-n him, let us kill him;" I said, "That is never worth your while" - they took my knife from my watch pocket, and 3s. 6d. from my breeches pocket; they got from me, and ran out of the high road into the field which is on the left, going towards Ruislip; I received a blow on my head, which stunned me for a moment - I did not notice how any of them were dressed.</p>

               <p> - WILCHEN. I am apprenticed to my brother, who is a shoemaker, and have known the prisoner about half a year.

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know the footway across the fields? A. Yes; it is shorter than the carriage road - we returned that way; we could go from the Black Horse to Pinner in twenty minutes; it was about half-past eight o'clock when we were at the Black Horse - we went from Pinner to Eastcote by the fields; I saw nobody with bludgeons - when we returned the prisoner went into Mrs. Webb's; I waited outside for about an hour and a half, till half-past ten o'clock, and he came out to me after he had his supper - I was examined before the Magistrate, and stated this; the prisoner had on a black hat, white trousers, and a kind of drab coat - he wears a hairy cap in his business; I never saw him wear it in the street.</p>

            . I live at Eastcote. I saw the prisoner at the bonfire, letting squibs off; Cooper and Wilchen were there, and some young women; the prisoner had on a black hat.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When did you leave? A. At half-past eight o'clock; the prisoner went away at the same time, with Cooper and Wilchen - he had a long drab coat on; I never saw him in a fur cap - I have known him two years; I never called at his mistress' - he had a flannel jacket and apron on when I have seen him.</p>

            . I was at Green's bonfire on the 5th of November, and was with the prisoner there from about a quarter to eight o'clock till a quarter after, letting fire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290012"></xptr>works off - he wore a hat: Cooper and Wilchen were there.</p>

            . I am in Mrs. Webb's service. The prisoner left about half-past seven o'clock, on the 5th of November, with Cooper - he did not wear his fur cap, for I saw it on the bakehouse board after he was gone; he had a black hat on - he had no stick when he left us; when he returned he did not seem as if he had been in a row.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did he go out again that night? A. No; he and I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock - he slept in the same bed with me all night, in a small room on the top of the stairs; I did not see Wilchen at all, and know nothing of his waiting outside the house; I was employed in the bakehouse, and did not see Mr. Fountain there that day - there is a back way out of the stable; the prisoner went out that way.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RUDD. I am a carpenter and live at Eastcote. I was at Green's bonfire, and saw the prisoner in a drab coat and a black hat; I missed him from there about a quarter-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How long would it take to run from there to the half-mile stone? A. I suppose ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a wheelwright at Ruislip. On the night of the 5th of November I saw Mr. Fountain galloping in his gig, calling Murder! he had just told me of this as the village clock struck eight.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was it eight or nine o'clock? A. It struck eight after he told me of it - he had arrived at Ruislip about two minutes before eight; I did not count the clock - I saw that it was eight o'clock by it - I looked at the dial; it was quite moon light.</p>

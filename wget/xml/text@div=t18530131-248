                  </hi>. I keep the Feathers public house, at No. 336, Oxford-street. On Saturday night, 22nd Jan., about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came into my house and called for a pint of beer, I served her in a pewter pint pot; a lady and gentleman were at the bar at the time—I did not see the prisoner drink any of the beer—my attention was attracted to a lady who came in at the time, and while I was speaking to her the prisoner left the house; I directly missed my pint pot—I went to the door to look after her, but could not see her—I saw no more of her till she was at Guildhall in custody of Maish—I there saw my pint pot produced by Maish—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I know it to be mine, and the one in which I had served the prisoner—it has my name on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 261). I was on duty in Hosier-lane, about half past 12 o'clock on Saturday, 22nd Jan., I saw the prisoner and stopped her, she had a basket which contained four pint pots, some bones, and some broken glass—I took her to the station, and she was searched by Susan Marshall, I saw Mr. Wood identify this pot on the Monday morning, it is one of the four I found in her basket—there was also a fifth pot found in the station, which she put down from under her dress while she was waiting there; I saw her do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had some beer in one that I was drinking. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had about two quarts of beer in a milk can, the pots were empty.</p>

                  </hi>. I searched the prisoner when she was brought to the station late on Saturday night; on examining her dress I found a strong band round her waist, and another across her shoulders, to which there were pieces attached where she could hang the pots under her dress; there was no necessity to have those strings for the purpose of her dress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The flounce of my dress was uncomfortable, and I put the hooks to keep it off the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There were no hooks, they were pieces of string.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never intended to keep any of the pots, I intended my daughter to return them next rooming; I got them for my daughter to get the beer in next day.</p>

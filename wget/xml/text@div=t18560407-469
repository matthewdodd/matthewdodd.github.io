                  </hi>. I am one of the Directors of the City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company. The prisoner was our secretary in 1854 and 1855—he has acted so, I think, seven years—he had a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and a house; also a commission of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. on the gross receipts—he received burial fees and monies due to the Company, and kept the books—it was part of his duty to enter in the books the monies received and paid by him during 1854 and 1855—the Directors used, I think, to meet fortnightly; that is, the second Thursday in the month and the last—on those occasions it was the prisoner's duty to attend and lay the accounts before the Directors—the fortnightly account showed the monies received; the monies expended were cheques drawn by the Directors—the prisoner had to pay a commission to undertakers—it was his duty twice in the year to make up the half yearly accounts—he made up the half yearly balance sheet to the 30th June last, for the meeting in July—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—among the assets here appears due to the Company 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was afterwards requested to make out the items of which that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted—this is the account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, is here debited to the amount of 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that account was made out before the half yearly meeting in July—it was put into my hands in July—after that account was given, the Board came to this resolution—the prisoner took the minutes—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Wednesday, 30th July. Resolved, from henceforth, the parochial accounts be made out within a week from the termination of each quarter")—on that occasion we received this letter in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company, 30th Aug., 1855. Gentlemen,—It is with feelings of the deepest grief that I shall be compelled to make disclosures of a most painful nature; I have done my utmost to avert the necessity of so doing, but it is impossible. For the sake of my dear family, I pray God that you will condemn me with mercy. Yours, &amp;c., W. S. Dowding.")—after that letter had been read by the Directors, the prisoner was called into the room where we were sitting, and made a verbal communication to the Board—he stated that he had received monies, and after receiving the cheques on account of these parish accounts, had lost them, by going to town to take them to the bankers, and, consequently, they were not entered in the accounts, and that they might amount altogether to between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the keys</p>

               <p>Were then given up to the Directors, and an examination was made of the cash book and ledger, which had been kept by him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash book of 1854, and here are the minutes in this book of the meeting of 30th Nov., 1854—at that meeting the prisoner accounted for all monies he had received during the previous month, from 29th Oct to 26th Nov., inclusive—here is no account from the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster—the total amount of receipts for which he gives credit here for that month is 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here are the different items of hich that credit is made up—they were ready payments made at the time—at the next meeting; 28th Dec., here is no credit given for a sum of 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster—the amount of his receipts is 506<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is made up principally of ready money sums, but here is an item of 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 28th Nov.—this account of 22nd Feb., 1855, includes a period of a fortnight—it does not include 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of St. Margaret's, Westminster; the amount is 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is made up of other items—in the following fortnight, or month, here is no entry of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from St. Margaret's, Westminster—I have seen certain receipts which purport to be the prisoner's writing—this receipt for 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his, and also this other for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for St. Margaret's, Westminster.</p>

Hankey's at once, without delay—I have not ascertained that it has been paid in—I cannot tell you when this cheque was paid in, nor the cheque of 16th Feb.—when he said that he had lost cheques, he did not specify any cheques—he did not refer to these two cheques—we understood that he referred to the losses he had had—I am not aware that he had to drink with undertakers—undertakers are our customers—it was not his duty to canvass them to procure custom, but he got a per centage—the more dead bodies he got, the more per centage he had—he had been well recommended to us, and has borne a highly respectable character—he was rather neglectful, but we had no idea of his dishonesty—he gave security, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Windsor, and am an assistant to Young and Bainbridge, the brewers—on June 7th I was walking down East Hill, Wandsworth, about 10 p.m.—I saw a two-horse ginger beer van pass me on the brow of the hill, about 200 yards from the Royal Oak, at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour—it was on the near side, I was on the opposite side—I saw no skid on—immediately afterwards I heard a sound—I walked down the hill and saw the deceased lying in the road—the machine was smashed up and the debris lying about—Halligan was sitting on the kerb—the van was standing still—one horse was being led on the pavement—the men were taken away—I met a policeman and told him, and the prisoner was taken into custody—it is a very steep hill.</p>

I live at 124, High Street, Wandsworth, and am a painter—I saw this collision with a two-horse van and the grinding machine—the driver was pulling in towards the kerb and his near horse went on to the pavement and stumbled, but recovered himself—the off horse fell down and the driver fell of the horse's back—the horses cleared the machine, but the van knocked it all to pieces—there was no skid on the wheel; I saw it hanging on the van—the van was heavily laden with bottles of mineral waters and ginger beer—I saw nothing else passing at the time—I saw the prisoner—his face was covered with blood—I could not say whether he was drunk.</p>

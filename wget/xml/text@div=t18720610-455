                  </hi>. I am an overseer of letter-carriers at the Holloway sorting-office—the prisoner has been employed in that office as a letter-carrier since the middle of February—his district of delivery was a portion of Barnsbury and the neighbourhood round there—each of the letter-car<lb></lb>riers have a cupboard in the kitchen if they require one—the prisoner had one which he kept locked—I have a duplicate key—on the 8th May, I went to his cupboard and found upwards of 300 letters and packets—they were all addressed to persons residing in the prisoner's walk, and bore post marks from 10th March till 4th May—it was the prisoner's duty to deliver those letters at their owners on the dates with which they were stamped—the first six in this packet are dated 19th March, 4th April, 12th April, 23rd March, and 16th April—it was his duty to deliver them to the persons to whom they were addressed on those days—he must have known that was his duty—he has a copy of the rules, and there it is stated—the postmaster, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Gardner, spoke to the prisoner in my presence on 8th May—he was asked how he came to detain those letters—he said he had kept them in his bag several days, and was then afraid to return them to the office—these are some of the letters—I delivered some to the persons to whom they were addressed—there was no difficulty in finding them out—I have got some few of the covers back—none of the letters had been opened—there was no appearance of their being letters of value.</p>

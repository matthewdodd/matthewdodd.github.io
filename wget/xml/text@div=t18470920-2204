                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live in White Lion-street, Pentonville. On the 9th of Sept., at seven o'clock in the morning, I purchased some beef and mutton in Newgate-market—I know Underwood well—I have frequently employed him to carry meat to my cart, and did so on this occasion—I told him where to go for both kinds of meat—after some time he brought one quarter of beef to the cart—the mutton did not come—I went to Mr. Lins<lb></lb>ley's to inquire—Underwood did not accompany me—he was gone down with the beef while I went there—he came soon afterwards—I found the mutton was gone—the scaleman said he had delivered it to somebody who asked for it in my name—Underwood then came up to me, and said the mutton was not in the cart—I said, "No, I am quite aware of it, some one has got it away"—he affected a great deal of surprise, and said, "It is possible some one of the same name as yourself may have asked for mutton; there is a Mr. Clerk at Westminster, perhaps he may have got it"—he ran to the different carts to see if it was in them—it weighted 11 stone 7 lbs., and was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw part of it the next day—I could not swear to it, but am almost posi<lb></lb>tive it was mine—it was cut to pieces, in a very awkward manner—a portion of it was gone.</p>

                  </hi> I am a salesman in Newgate-market. On the morning of the 9th Mr. Clark bought two sheep of me, with the exception of the shoulders—they weighted 95lbs.—shortly after he bought them, Akerman came, and asked for three pieces of mutton which Mr. Clark had bought—I thought he had employed him and I delivered them to him—he took them away—I saw the mutton the next day, and am quite sure it was the same, as I had got the head and shoulders.</p>

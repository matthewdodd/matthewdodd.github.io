Franklin asked him if he had got a small box in his possession, a portion of the property that was stolen—he at first denied it; he said he had nothing at all, and he knew nothing about the robbery—we threatened to search the house—he then rose from his chair, went to the back-room, and from the top of the corner cupboard he took this box and gave it into my charge—I then took him into custody.</p>

I am nurse to Mr. Masterman, of Waltham-stow—on 17th July, the family left home—we left the articles stated, in a drawer; the drawer was not locked, but a piece of paper was pasted over the lock—that would have to be broken in order to open the drawer—I saw it safe the day we left—the house was to undergo some repairs.</p>

I was at work at Mr. Masterman's house, in July last—the prisoner was there also—I found these things in the drawer—I told Cole about it, and asked him outside whether he would take them if I brought them out—he said he would, and I gave them to him—the drawer was not locked or fastened, there was only a piece of paper on it—I did not break the paper—I pulled the drawer open, and the paper came off—Cole is a painter—I am a shoemaker by trade, but I was working as a painter's labourer then—we used to lock the house when we went away at night—Cole did not see me take the articles—I took them out of the drawer; he had the scent-box—I told him where I got the things from—I pleaded guilty to this charge last session.</p>

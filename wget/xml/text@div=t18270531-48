            . I live in Bath-court, Islington. On Monday morning, the 30th of April, I saw John Broadway - he came through Islington church-yard; he had a little blood on the top of his head, and on Tuesday morning I applied something to his head, which was wounded, but nothing that I thought would be of consequence - there were three very small wounds - I could scarcely see them - he died on the Monday following. On Sunday, the 29th of April, he was in company with my husband and another young man, at our house. about a quarter-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner had come there at half-past two and left - he was always very affectionate to his brother; he came again about a quarter-past nine in the evening, the deceased was still there - the prisoner was then not altogether sober, nor was he drunk; his brother John was quite sober. He came a third time and they went away together; there had been a few words between the prisoner and my husband - the brothers went away together, apparently in good humour. John did not go to a regular surgeon until Saturday - I applied Dutch drops to his head; I saw him on Friday evening - he said,"I am very bad, God bless you, I shall not see you any more." The brothers always lived very affectionately together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROTCHE. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the prisoner, and the deceased together after the words? A. No; I have seen them at other times; the prisoner was remarkably attached to him, and would have died for him. I do not know why he came to my house the last time, unless he expected to see my youngest sister, who he was very much attached to - he was then so much in liquor he seemed not to know what he was about; he quarrelled with my husband - his brother did not interfere.</p>

            . I live in Brittania-row, Islington; the deceased was my son. On Sunday, the 29th April, when the prisoner was at supper, he said he would go and fetch John home - he went out for that purpose, but came back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310033"></xptr>alone, and sat down; John came in a short time afterwards with a can in his hand, which he had some beer in - the prisoner was not affected with liquor in any way, though he was not sober. John threw the can down and struck William, who had not said a word to him; but John told him that he would do for him that night, he would know who was master. William then walked out of the house, down the yard, saying, "John, I will not fight nor quarrel with you." John immediately followed, and knocked him down with his fist; he got on him, and beat him when he was down - William said, "For God's sake, mother, call somebody to help, or I shall be murdered;" the watchman opened the door and came in, having heard him call out - the watchman took John off him - William then got a stick and struck at John over the watchman's head. I really do not know what stick it was - I had no rake, but whether he borrowed one I cannot say - he was gardening that morning: whatever it was, it lay on the spot - he did not go any where for it. I was so frightened, I cannot tell whether he hit John - the watchman took it from him, and threw it over the pales - John went out, and William came into the house - his face was bruised and bleeding; I put something to it - they slept together that night, and did not have a word afterwards. John only went next door, and came back almost directly. I do not know the cause of their quarrel, they were always particularly sociable.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. William bore all this before he cried out, and only took up this thing to defend himself? A. No.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at half-past ten o'clock at night - I heard a scuffle in the yard, and the mother calling out; when I went in William was on the ground and John on the top of him, beating him over the eyes with his double fist - his face was very much swollen; I collared John, and pulled him off, and kept hold of him, expecting he would fly at him again; William jumped up immediately, and caught hold of a small garden-rake, which laid close to him, and struck John on the head; he did it all in a moment - I saw blood run down his face - I suppose the teeth of the rake made the wound; it was a small iron rake - I snatched it out of his hand, and threw it away. William was rather in a passion when he jumped up - John did not attempt to got to him again; I staid there about ten minutes - William went in doors quietly, and his mother dressed his eye. I have not seen the rake since - I begged of John to let me look at his head, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was John on the floor in the course of the scuffle? A. No. The rake must have been close by, for it was done instantly - it was small, and would feel like a stick in his hand. John was so violent that any one would have defended themselves against him; he said he would doctor the wounds himself, and went to the water and washed them - he went next door, and had half a pint of vinegar to wash them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Saturday, the 5th of May; I found him nearly insensible; there were three small wounds on his head, which might be produced by a garden-rake; he was bled, and the usual remedies applied, but he got gradually worse - it was too late to do him any good - he died on the Monday; I opened his head, and on turning back the scalp I found a great effusion of blood- the wounds had penetrated the scalp, and through the skull; one of the teeth of the rake had passed the dura mater - no doubt death was caused by those wounds; if medical and had been applied sooner it would have had no effect on the wounds - he might perhaps have lived a short time - there was a large quantity of pus formed on the dura mater.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it the extravasated blood which caused the pressure on the brain? A. There was no extravasated blood on the brain - it was an outward effusion - it is possible he might have been cured, but not very probable.</p>

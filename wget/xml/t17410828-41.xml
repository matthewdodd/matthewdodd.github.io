            . I am the wife of the last witness. I had been out a nursing, and came home on thursday the 20th of this month at 4 o'clock in the morning. I found my house broke open, and the Prisoner in the house. Part of my cloaths the Prisoner had on her back, and the rest were pack'd up ready to be carried off. I charged her with taking them, and she made me no answer, but undrest herself and gave me my things again.</p>
               <p>- Witner. I was at work near the Prosecutor's house, and seeing the wall broke, I sent for the key of the door and went into the house, and saw the prisoner there and these things upon her. I ask'd her how long she had been a house-breaker, and she look'd very hard at me, and said nothing; then these people came in, and this woman saw her cloaths on the Prisoner's back. She had made a great bundle of things, but had tied nothing up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along the road and met a young woman who desir'd me to go with her to her aunt's. Accordingly she took me to this house, and put me in, and desired me not to be frighted. We went into one of the rooms, and she told me these cloaths belonged to her, so I drest myself in them, and then she went away and these people came and took me.</p>

I sent her with a one pound note to procure what she liked to drink, she brought gin, and returned me part of the change, I imagine she kept about three shillings and six pence, in copper; they prevailed upon me for more money to get something to eat.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what time it was. - A. I asked the prisoner, she said it was about four o'clock. I searched for my property, my breeches I found on the floor, and all the money was gone but two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. The bank notes and the money was all gone. A. Yes, and the bank token too. When daylight appeared I went down stairs and went to Mr. Wyegate, a constable, I went to the prisoner's apartment with him, where I gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to charge her. - A. The purse was found in her possession, some silver and some copper, and the tenpenny Irish bank token. There is one bank note come to the bank, I have not been able to trace it to Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been able to trace at all any of those bank notes or bills of exchange. - A. They are not come due yet, I have traced none of them any further than this ten pound note has come to the bank.</p>

               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) The question is whether you do not recollect giving her the tenpenny piece as a curiosity. - A. No, at the time I went to bed the tenpenny piece was in my pocket.</p>

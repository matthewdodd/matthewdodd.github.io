            . I am a bay salesman, and live at Little Stanmore. I know the prisoners, they live in Edgware parish, about four hundred yards from Stone's. I went with a constable and a search warrant, to the house of Simm's, about half-past seven o'clock Sunday evening - I did not then know that the prisoners lived there - we found a woman there, and searched the house, and in the room the woman was in, we found part of a fore quarter of lamb, boiled, and in the adjoining room on a table I found a hind quarter, undressed, and gave them to Hinton. I apprehended Alsey in bed two doors from this house, on that evening; I said we must search; he said he had no objection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170059"></xptr>- I remained with him while Hinton searched, and brought up, part of a fore quarter of lamb, baked in a pie, a hind quarter undressed, and a piece of lights - we did not ask where he got it, nor did he give any account of it. I compared all the lamb with the skin next morning - there is no doubt of its being part of the carcase, from that skin. there was a piece of flesh left by the hind leg in the skin, which matches exactly. I produce both skin and meat; it matches the skin, and the two quarters match. I apprehended Weedon that evening, and told him I had been to his house, and found lamb there; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

On 24th July, from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 6, Charles-street, Drury-lane—I saw him there, and asked him if he had purchased any sheets lately—he said, "I have not"—I asked if he had any objection to my looking over his house—he said that he had none—I left an officer with him, went into the front bedroom, searched there, and found eleven towels in a box, with other things, and two sheets down stairs, where the prisoner was sitting—it is a sitting room and bedroom as well—one sheet was on the bed, and one folded up and laid on a box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sister of the female ward of Charing-cross Hospital It is part of my duty to give out the linen to be washed—on 21st June I made up a bundle of linen, containing twenty-one sheets and two towels—there was another bundle, containing old sheets; they were not cut up into towels, my towels were with the sheets—all the sheets were marked "Charing-cross Hospital"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the sheets which were in the bundle—the words "Charing-cross Hospital" are not on than now—they were marked like this (producing one)—the mark has been cut out, and another piece put in—I belong to the C ward—I do not find "C" n the corner of this sheet, but here is the place where it ought to be; a piece has been cut out, and replaced—I cannot swear that this is exactly the place, but we generally mark them with the letter C just below the hem—this is like the quality of our sheets, the patients in the ward hem them—this other sheet is of the same quality, but both marks have been taken out of it; it is one of our sheets—here is "Cha" on this towel, that is a private mark of my own—"Cha" still remains, but the rest has been cut out—here is also a private mark "C," that is the letter of the ward of which I am a sister—the bundle of sheets which I sent to be washed has never come back to the hospital—the towels had no number on them, I only find one here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a sister of the male ward "D" of Charing-cross Hospital. These sheets do not belong to my ward, mine are calico—I know how the hospital sheets are marked; a piece has been taken out of the corner of these sheets, at the same place where our sheets are marked, and a piece has been inserted—I miss seven pairs from the D ward, but of a finer description than these—I have not the slightest doubt that these are Mrs. East's—this towel belongs to myself, it is marked "Humphreys"—on the night I sent the sheets I sent twelve towels, seven of which belonged to me, and five were not marked—these two were left by patients, one has the name of "Humphreys" on it, and the other "M. W."—I have every reason to believe all these are mine—here are two which have the Crown on them, and one with a coronet; they have been given from the Palace for the use of the hospital—I did not miss the towels till the laundress brought home the linen on, I should say, 24th June—she brought me twenty-six sheets.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to Bay whether you ever took these particular things from the hospital at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I took away some bundles in a cart—I rode in front with the man who drove it—the cart had nothing in it but the hospital things—there were about thirty sheets in it, and a few blankets—I did not miss them till I was asked for them; not baring a list, I do not know; the list must have been in the bundle which was lost—I took in the cart all the bundles which were brought down—the man went up for a bundle while I was in the ward speaking to the sisters, and the bundle must have been taken then, just as it was put in—I have washed for the hospital three or four years; I believe these sheets and towels to be the property of the hospital, and to belong to these two particular wards—they are of the same quality, and marked in the same places—the sheets of different wards are of different materials, one is calico, and the other double twill—these are double twill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has he been in your employ? A. I think, twelve or thirteen years, or more - I asked him, one Sunday morning, if he had any more money belonging to me, but we had no quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not leave you on a Saturday in September? A. No; he left me on a Sunday morning, when I asked him if he had any more money belonging to me, as there was some which had been standing a long while; and when I came to cast up my book, he had 2s. more than his wages - it was his habit to deduct his wages from what he received - some of the entries in this book are mine, and some my son's - there was an account owing from Miss Oakey, of about 1l. - there is a carrier of the name of Bell, who lives about a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner left you, did he go into the service of Bell? A. I know he was in his service on the Tuesday, and he was then taken - Bell is a Highgate carrier, and I am a Holloway carrier - I charged the prisoner with taking 2s. above his wages - I did not take him then, but I did not know he was going to leave - I expected he would come on the Monday morning - I do not know whether I should have proceeded against him if he had come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160032"></xptr>back - he took money to carry on my business - he had my permission to make payments for me, and he took his wages at the end of the week.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say he settled every morning? A. He did not give me the money, but he settled the account, and if he had more money than I thought he wanted, I took part of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had a regular settlement with him since the 30th of July? A. Yes, every morning; he has never owned to having received these sums in his account.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go before Mr. Sergeant Sellon? A. Yes; he said this was not a case that ought to go to a Jury, and I might go outside and settle it - but I did not think it right to settle it - if the prisoner should be discharged, he may go back to Bell, and welcome - he offered to pay me 1s. a week.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The Court here cautioned the witness to be careful what he said</hi>).

I got to the house I examined it—the fire was out, but there were two separate places which had been on fire; they were about 4 feet apart—I found some bedclothes and sacking burnt—I asked the prisoner what articles he really had lost, and I took down what he said in this paper.

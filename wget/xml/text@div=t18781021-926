I live at 19, Hampton Street, Walworth Road—on 22nd August last I was living with the prisoner at 1, Maple Road, Surbiton—she carried on there the business of an upholsters—I assisted in the business—I was the manager—I slept on the premises—there was a shop, and at the back of the shop there was a sitting-room—the stairs go up between the shop and the sitting-room, and under the stairs there is a cupboard—on the first floor is a bedroom, which Mrs. Locke occupied—that is over the shop—there is also a spare bedroom over the shop—there is a cupboard in the corner of the spare bedroom used as a ward<lb></lb>robe—the bedroom I occupied is at the back of' Mrs. Locke's room on the same floor—on the night of Thursday, 29th August, I was on the premises—I went to bed about 11 o'clock—Mrs. Locke had not gamete bed at that time—I was the first to go to bed, and I turned off the gas at the meter in the shop—the shop was all right when J turned off the gas, there was no sign of fire when I went to bed—I did not hear Mrs. Locke go to bed, but she was in the act of going when I went—I was awoke at 2 o'clock in the morning by Mrs. Locke by knocking at the door between oar rooms—she said, "Get up; there is a fire in the house"—I got up, pat on my clothes, and went out of the room—I saw no fire then, only smoke</p>

It would have set fire to the roof of her house and two houses adjoining if the fire had communicated with it—I went into the drawing-room, there was nothing there, there were no pictures hanging up that I noticed, but I did not look particularly for pictures—I did not see eight or nine pictures.</p>

I saw the prisoner come back to the house that night—Croucher was with her—she was in custody—she was changing her dress, and she said that she must have a change of socks, and she emptied her pocket into a drawer in her bedroom—I heard a rattle, and drew the salvage officers' attention to it, and we found that it was silver spoons and forks which she had emptied into the drawer—I found these pieces of wood in her bedroom near the fireplace, but I should say that there had been no fire there for some time, for the back of the fireplace was rusty.</p>

I was called to the fire in the Maple Road about 2.30 on the morning of 30th August—when I got there I found other policemen there and the firemen—from inquiries I made I went to Mrs. Shuth's and found the prisoner there—she was only partly dressed, she had on a dress skirt and what I fancied was a waterproof—I asked her it she was insured, she said "Yes, in the Royal Exchange"—I asked her if she could account for the fire in any way, she said "No"—I returned to the fire and looked over the premises and in consequence of what I saw and heard I sent for the prisoner—she came and I took her in custody—I had noticed that she was very anxious to get into the house on the first occasion, and when she came the second time she was looking round rather furtively—she said that she wanted to see the place, but I told her that the firemen would not admit her—I went to Mrs. Shuth's and took possession of some things there, among which was an oil painting with a number of water-colour drawings nailed on to the back of it, and some brown paper pasted over them—I discovered that after I got it into the house—there were eight water colours—I also received a box from there—the water colour drawings were given up to a man who had a bill of sale—I do not know why; I did not know that I had power to detain them—I found in the box a quantity of plate—it is not here—I gave it to the man who had the bill of sale—there were perhaps two dozen spoons and forks, and cruet stands, candlesticks, dessert. forks, and table forks—they were in a portmanteau—there was also some wearing apparel, and one or two little articles—it appeared to me to be packed—I also received a desk in which I found this insurance policy. (<hi rend="italic">This was in the Royal Exchange Insurance Company for</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">on the household furniture, plate, wearing apparel, etc</hi>.)—I also produce a copy of a bill <hi rend="italic">of</hi> sale which I received from the man who holds it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I found that a great quantity of the furniture in the shop had been more or less burned—I mean the stock of furniture in the shop, not the furniture of the house, but that was damaged by fire also.</p>

The shop is distinct from the house, but it is part of the house—it is in front of the prisoner's living room—a great quantity of the furniture was burnt more or less—the furniture which was burnt was right through the shop, but in the rear of the shop: and that which was in the front of the shop was damaged by water—there was the remains of a cupboard in the shop, and it was more burnt there than anywhere else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jobbing gardener and have worked for Mrs. Locke over 18 months at carpet-beating and work like that—I was em<lb></lb>ployed on the premises a week—before the fire, gas-tarring the roof of a shed and beating some carpets—I used some tar to some wood while I was there to boil the tar pot, and when I had finished my job a pail-full of tar was was left, and a scuttleful of tarred wood—I left it in the yard—on the Saturday before the fire I saw Richards about 11 o'clock—he took me to the shed to show me where the water came through—he said that the tar did not keep the rain out—it rained all Saturday morning, and he said "I have a <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> good mind to burn the whole shed down"—that</p>

Richards gave me the money for them—he gave me a half-crown to get a quarter of a hundred, and told me to go to Littlewood's, but I went to Lane's for them—those are two different shops—before I got to the gate he called me back, and told me to get a wrapper to wrap them up in—I got them, and came back and took them into the room, and he said, "Put them down in the room," which I did, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—last Sunday fortnight he came to my house, and we had a deal of conversation—he said that he heard that Mrs. Locke said since she had been in prison that he had fetched the fire<lb></lb>lighters, and he said, "You know better than that, for you fetched them"—he also said, "Of course, what I, said about burning the place down was said in a.<hi rend="italic">joke</hi>" or "a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—I said; nothing to that—we had a long conversation—he had never been to visit me since the fire, but he had been to see me before the fire when he wanted me to do work for Mrs. Locke—one week there was about seven' rounds of a broken ladder which I pulled to pieces to make a narrow fence. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not use any of the broken ladder for my tar pot—those pieces of wood produced are thinner than I used, and if I had used them for my pot they would have been tarred on both sides—I did not leave above a tablespoonful of tan—gas-tar wants boiling—when he spoke about burning the shed down I said "With that fresh tar on it would burn if it were to catch fire"—J do not know that he was angry with me for not making it water<lb></lb>tight, but he did not like it—he did not say anything about setting the house on fire—when he came down to see me after the fire I had not mentioned anything about the fire<lb></lb>lighters—Richards first spoke about them—I saw it in the papers that they were found in the house—I did not talk about the fire till Richards came, but we talked about it when he came—when he gave me the money to fetch the things Mrs. Locke was in the same room—Richards told me to go for them but Mrs. Lock was there—I did not hear her say anything about them—I do not think Mrs. Locke was in the room when I brought them back—it was in the living-room, the parlour or sitting-room—that is where I put down the fire<lb></lb>lighters—I did not use any of them—I have never been there since—this was on the Monday before the fire took place, at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

I am a watch-maker in Greenwich Road—at about 5.30 on Monday evening, the 24th December, Tagg came into my shop and asked to see some watches, and he left and returned at 6 o'clock with Donovon, and said "You thought I didn't want to buy, and I have brought my father, and perhaps you will show me them now"—he then took one in each hand, and then the door, which had been previously shut, was thrown open from outside—they both ran out—I pursued them, and kept Donovon in sight, and saw him stopped by Newman—when I came up I said to him "You villain, give me my watches"—he said "I have no watches of yours," and then a severe struggle ensued, and he was taken into custody—I saw no one else except the constable.</p>

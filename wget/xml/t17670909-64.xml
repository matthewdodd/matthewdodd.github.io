On the 4th of August, when I was going up to bed, between ten and eleven o'clock, when I got up to the landing-place, I thought I heard a man's foot; I called to my servants below, and said I believed there must be somebody in the house; upon standing there, I heard a board crack; I looked at the door, and saw no key in it, as usual; I tried to open the door, and found it locked; I looked with the candle, and found the key was not in the door; then I went into the dining-room, which opens into the other room, in that was a great arm chair; I desired the girl to stand behind me; I removed the chair, and opened the door, and saw the prisoner standing at the farther and of the room, without coat, waistcoat, hat or shoes; I held the door in one hand, and the candle in the other; before he reached the door, I shut it too, but he came with such violence, that he forced one of the screws that held the lock, I put my foot to the bottom of the door; the girl ran down stairs, and called for help; the prisoner opened the sash, and I heard the window below break; then I went into the room and looked out, but saw no body; I perceived a little bundle lying in the room tied up; I ran down stairs, to see if he was in the back yard; we searched there, and the kitchen, but could not find him; we searched all the house over; then we went to the necessary house; upon the door being pulled, he burst out; I perceived his shirt bloody; I received a blow over my hand; I had a poker in my hand, with which I made a defence; we soon laid hold of him, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, I never saw him before that time to my knowledge; in the bundle were the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them;) the coat was taken out of the garret, and the other things taken out of a foul clothes bag, and the petticoat from our lodging room; it appeared he came in at the garret window.</p>

On the 11th of April I lost a horse out of the field, I believe, but do not exactly know where it was. I saw it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060012"></xptr>safe about seven o'clock the evening before, near a lane by Bow's Farm, which is about a quarter of a mile from my house-the lane is open to the turnpike-road; there is no gate to prevent the horse from going out of the lane. I found my horse in Mr. Watts's yard, Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, the same day that I lost it, and am sure it was mine - I claimed it; it was killed-the foot is preserved, which enables me to swear to it (looking at the foot) - I know it by a particular shoe, which I had put on it because it was lame - I knew the horse as soon as I saw it. The prisoner used to frequent our neighbourhood.</p>

            . I live at Pancras. I bought the horse of the prisoner on Saturday, the 11th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, at Pancras; he asked 30s. for it, I gave him 25s. I asked him where he got it? he said Mr. White, of Southgate, sent him to sell it - I knew the name. I noticed the horse's foot; that produced is it. I sold it to William Deacon for 2l. the same day.</p>

On Saturday night, 24th March, I was in the gallery at the Dean-street theatre—a young woman I knew was there, and I put my arm round her waist—the prisoner came up and struck me in my back—I looked round, and saw who it was, and let go of the young woman—I stopped looking at the piece for about five minutes till the curtain went down; then I went down stairs, and the prisoner stood in front of me—I asked her to get out of the way—she then struck me on the chest—I struck her at the side of the cheek, and she went to hit me again, and I bobbed my head down, and it went under her arm—I went down on the stage, and did not see the prisoner any more until the play was over, when I saw her outside the door—when I was coming out to the street, she asked me if I was going to see her home, and when I was going down to see her again: and I said I should not go to see her, and then she struck me in the chest—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the knife—I gave it to my father.</p>

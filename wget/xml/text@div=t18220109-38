            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I went to the house about half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 26th, as usual - I was not there the day before, I found the street door a-jar, and all the flats in which the butter and things were, had been moved from where I left them on the 24th, they were out of their place nobody was in the house, I got a light and lit the gas, I missed two turkeys off the scale beam and some hams, they were safe at twelve o'clock on the night of the 24th. I sent for my master, he came between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNGER. Two empty baskets were missed also from the shop - I found the first floor chamber-door broken open, and a secretaire broken open, and all the drawers empty - I missed two coats, worth 20 s., and a pair of sheets, worth 15 s.; the till was emptied of above 10 s. worth of copper, I lost more than seven hams, worth 3 l. 10 s., I gave 10 s. each for the turkeys; a trunk in the parlour was broken open, and the contents emptied on the floor, and the watch taken from it, it was worth 1 l. - I also missed a pair of trowsers, worth 10 s. I saw one of the baskets at Worship-street on the 26th, and can swear to it, the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square, at half-past eight o'clock on the night of Christmas-day; he had a basket with two hams in it. I asked how he came by them; he said he brought them from Mr. Simpson's, Royal Exchange; and I believe he said Simpson was a tailor. I asked where he was going to take them; he said to Mrs. Armstrong, No. 29, St. John's-square, Clerkenwell, and that he lived there. I took him to the public-house; I detained him, and sent Bridges to Simpson, and next morning I went to No. 29, St. John's-square. His mother worked there, but did not live there; it is a sash-maker's; Mr. Younger claimed the basket. I found a watch on him, but it was not the prosecutor's. I took him to the watch-house, and sent Bridges back to the public-house, to search the spot where he stood; there were other people in the house, but we had him close under the window, in a corner opposite the bar. I asked where he lived; he then said at No. 10, Aylesbury-street. I found his mother lived there, but not him; he afterwards said he lived on Addle-hill, which I found true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How far is the public-house from the watch-house - A. About one hundred and forty yards. He said he lived in John-street; not that he was going to his mother's there; he had a handkerchief over the hams.</p>

            . I was with Garton when the prisoner was taken; his account is true in every point. I went back to the public-house, and in the corner where the prisoner stood, I found a crow-bar. I went next morning to Younger's - the place was in great confusion. I matched the crow-bar to the first floor door - it corresponded with both ends of it, and also with the marks on the secretarie. I found the second floor door was burst open by the same instrument - it fitted exactly - and also with a trunk which was broken open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a common turn-screw - A. It will do for that; it was all over ham-grease, and smell of ham.</p>

            . I live in Little Bell-alley, four hundred yards from Younger's house. On Christmas night, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner, I am sure of him, his back was against Mr. Younger's door, he seemed to be looking at the opposite house; I then saw another man about a yard from him - I turned the corner about a dozen yards, and then returned to Younger's door; the prisoner then moved, and nudged the other; they went towards Angel-court - I went with my wife to Southwark-bridge; then returned, thinking something was going on a miss in the neighbourhood. I tried the door of the opposite house, it was safe; I went away, the party was gone - next morning I heard of the robbery; I said I should know one of the men, and hearing a man was in custody, I went to Worship-street, and saw the prisoner at the bar with another man, I knew him immediately, and swear positively to him; I should know the other if I saw him; there was two gas lamps within thirty yards, which both give strong lights - I looked him full in the face; he was looking up at the house, so that I saw his countenance plainly. I am confident of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. About eight o'clock, he had his hat on. One gas light was about twelve yards from him. I am an officer, and have been so seven years.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNGER. The basket is one I left in the house, my initials are on it, in my own writing, and I believe the hams to be mine. I should think it would take one man five journies to take them all.</p>

               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

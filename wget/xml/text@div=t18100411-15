               <p>WILLIAM LOOSE. On the 28th of March I was going along Golden-square; I met the prisoner with something wrapped up under her gown-tail; she seemed very much confused; I was close to her; I saw they were pots; I suspected she had stolen them. I spoke to Gregory, the officer; he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY. I received information from Loose. I took two pots from the prisoner; they were wrapped up in her gown-tail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman asked me to hold the pots; I did not know she was a thief; she said she was going to a servant maid for some victuals; she did not like to take the pots. I held the pots for a quarter of an hour; at last the old woman came; Gregory would not take her. I never stole any thing in my life.</p>

               <p>GREGORY. She never said any thing about the old woman till after she had been at Marlborough-street Office.</p>




               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

On the evening of the 6th of June I was in our parlour, and the window was open—my niece was walking in front of the houses—I told her to throw a handkerchief down the area, which she did—it was a yellow silk one—it was left there, as I forgot to take it up—I did not see it again till I was called to the station next morning—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in North-wharf-road, Paddington. On the morning of the 7th of June I was going along Lisson-grove—I passed the house where Mrs. Harris lodges—I saw the prisoner and three others, who were standing outside the area—I did not say anything to them then, but</p>

               <p>I saw them a second time, and asked what they were doing—the prisoner answered that Thompson, who was with him, had dropped his handker<lb></lb>chief and cap down the area—I looked, and saw these two handkerchiefs down the area, this yellow one and this red one—I said to the prisoner "Well, if they belong to you I will see you harmless, you may go down and get them"—he crept through one of the broken rails, went down, and brought them up; but immediately he got into the area he took up this yellow handkerchief, and put it into his own cap, and the cap that was down the area he gave up to Thompson—he then came out, and walked with the other three about forty yards—he then started off running, and so did the other—my suspicion were roused, and I pursued, and caught the prisoner in John-street, New-road—I asked him how it was he ran away—he made no answer, but went on—I followed him to York-street—I then told him he had been doing something wrong, and to give me up the pro<lb></lb>perty—he gave me this yellow handkerchief—I said, "Where is the other!" and he gave it me—I said, "I believe this is what you call a <hi rend="italic">diver,</hi> is it not?"—he said it was—it has a piece of list tied to it, and some pins at the other end, to serve as hooks.</p>

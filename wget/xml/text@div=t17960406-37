               <p>On Saturday the 20th of February, I went to Covent-garden, and came back again about a quarter before seven o'clock; as I came through Leicester-fields, the prisoner followed behind me, I had a muff in my hand; I took my hand out of my muff, and felt something come upon this hand, like scalding water; I turned round, and saw the prisoner go from me, and look into a pastry-cook's shop; she was close to me when I turned round, and there was nobody else near, except the two patroles, who were standing at the corner of the street, besides a little girl, who is in Court; I did not take any further notice, but my muslin petticoat dropped under my feet, by that time I had got to the top of the Hay-market.</p>

            Had you said any thing to her? - A. No.(produces her cloaths.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things whole before you saw her that evening? - A. Yes; there is a person in Court that saw me put them on; my hand was very red, but it was not blistered; she had insulted me on the Thursday before; as I was coming across Leicester-fields, at the corner of Bear-street, she was standing there, and a very ill-looking man along with her; she called to me, mistress, I want to speak to you, says she, how do you find money? I said, like all the world, sometimes I have some, and sometimes I have none; she asked me if I had any now, I said, no; she asked me to go with her to the wine vaults, in Castle-street; I told her I had rather not; she insisted upon my going with her, and as she was going along, she made a kind of a jump, as if she was about to jump upon his back; she put a pin into his shoulder, and then he turned round and

             a knife upon her; she went to the wine vaults and had some rum, she pulled out a shilling and asked me to toss up for it; I had a glass of carraway and paid for it myself; I had seen the woman before, and spoke to her once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. I wash and iron, and go to gentlemen's houses sometimes, and she insulted me with that on the Thursday; I met her about a quarter of an hour after; I left her at the wine vaults, and she followed me to my lodgings, and told my landlady I was nothing but a common woman of the town; she said, if she ever catched me going that way again to pick up gentlemen, she would give me a glass of aqua-fortis to drink, and there was a woman with her, but she has gone away, and would not appear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurny. Q. You are the wife of John Parker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what is your husband's business? - A. A smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Mary-le-bonne; we have been parted between two and three years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have got your living, since that time, by washing and charing? - A. Yes; my father allows me twelve shillings a week; and I keep my child.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a muff and a muslin petticoat, and had been to Covent-garden and back again; upon your oath, have you no other way of employment than charing? - A. No other way.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much offended therefore with the prisoner, for charging you with walking the streets; your virtue was offended with such a charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were particularly angry at this, because there was not a word of truth in it? - A. She had no right to charge me with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it true or false? - A. It is true she insulted me with walking the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it true or not you did walk the streets.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not ask that.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman of character, however, of course, would be angry at being charged with it? - A. I did not mind any thing she said about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you repeat that you were not at all angry at her charging you with walking the streets? - A. I was not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to any body upon the spot upon the subject? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, upon your oath, or did you not, speak to any body upon the spot, relative to this transaction? - A. I said, there was something the matter with my hand.</p>

            Did you or did you not state to the watchman, that the prisoner was at that moment on the spot? - A. I said, this woman had insulted me the Thursday before, and insisted upon his taking her to the watch-house; and he said, he was particularly acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, whether, when you spoke to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060032"></xptr>watchman, you did or not state to him that the prisoner was upon the spot, and desired him to take her into custody? - A. Not that very night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out to the watchman as if the transaction had taken place but a moment before, and desired him to take the prisoner into custody? -

               <p>Q. It is impossible you should have forgot? - A. I did before I went to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Justice Addington grant you a warrant directly? - A. No; the clerk of the office gave orders to two constables to go after her; one of them said, he had known her a long while; and I got no warrant till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the conversation you had with the watchman, when you saw him? - A. Yes; I told him, he was a very odd sort of a man, not to take her when she was abusing me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the watchman you could not swear that the prisoner threw this upon your gown? - A. I cannot swear to it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you could not get a warrant, because you could not swear positively to her? - A. I did say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am entirely innocent; I would be much obliged to my counsel to ask where she saw me last, and drank with me last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You felt no particular inconvenience from this? - A. It did not hurt my hand a great deal, my eyes were very much damaged; I had wiped my face with my petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin never came off your hand at all? - A. No.(For the prisoner.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether it was before or after the prisoner was taken up? - A. It was as I began to call seven, or half past seven, I am not sure which; she desired me to take the prisoner; I told her, she had better go and get a warrant; and she said, you shall take up your acquaintance immediately; I said, I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say the prisoner had done to her? - A. Burnt her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - A. After that, I told her, she had better go to the Justices; in about an hour I saw her again; she said, she had been to the Justice's, and he could do nothing in it, without she could swear that it was the prisoner that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of life is that woman? - A. I really don't know.</p>

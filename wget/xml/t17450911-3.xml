             . I have known the Prisoner about 3 years, and she was then a very honest person. On saturday the 17th of August last she came to me, and said she was come from her place, and was going to Nottingham in the waggon; and staid with me till Monday. I was obliged to go out on Monday, and when I came home she was gone, and I missed all those things. I went to the Ram Inn in Smithfield, and could hear nothing of her. I followed the Nottingham waggon to Highgate, thinking she might be in it, but she was not. And as I came back by Sir John Oldcastle's, I found her there hearkening to the musick, with my gown, and several of my thing on. I asked her if she would go with me, and she said she would. I asked after my things, and she said some she had pawned, and some were sold, and some she had on her back.</p>

               <p>JAMES TURNHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable belonging to the Thames Police-office: On the 4th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Payne's cart standing at Mr. Hill's door, with tripe and neats feet; I saw Blake and Pope standing together at the door; I saw the cart go up East Smithfield, and at the end of Dirty-lane stood Spencer, with a little poney, about three hundred yards from Mr. Hill's; Pope stopped and spoke to Spencer; then the cart went on to the middle of Dirty-lane; I was going on for Tower-hill; I turned round, I saw Pope and Blake in the cart; I was about forty yards from them; I saw Pope with a sack which was in the cart; Pope had got hold of the sack, Blake was pulling up the tripe; Blake and Pope put the tripe into the sack; their backs were towards me; I saw some neats feet put in besides; then Pope got up and looked round, I thought he saw me; then I ran up King-street, because they should not see me, and went round upon Towerhill, and there I saw the cart, and Spencer, Pope, and Blake at the Black Horse door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the sack? - A. I did not see the sack after; I saw Spencer put his hand in his pocket and give Blake something, but I do'nt know what, which Blake put into his breeches pocket; then I saw the sack taken out of the cart and put upon Spencer's poney, and then they went away for Rosemary-lane: then I took Pope and Spencer into custody at the end of White Lion-street; they asked me for what; I said you know for what, for this you have got upon the horse; I took them to the office, and going along they offered me something to let them at liberty; Spencer said he was just going to begin business, and he would give me any thing; I said, no, they should go before the magistrate; I took Blake the same day at Mr. Payne's; I took him into the accompting-house, and asked him for an account of the tripe that he had brought home; he said, thirty-six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180010"></xptr>from Mr. Mellish and ten from Mr. Hill's; then he said it was the first time he had sold any thing out of the cart, and he hoped his master would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. At the time this passed, what was said to induce him to confess? - A. I did not hear any thing of the kind; we took him into custodody.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether the tripe that you saw put into the sack came from Mellish's, or Hill's, or any where else, you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bag after you got to the office? - A. Yes; there was one tripe, four feet, a rule, a recd, and a bunch of lights.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This was Messrs. Payne's cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Payne). Q. Did you pay Mr. Mellish for thirty-six tripes that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay Mr. Hill for eleven tripes that day? - A. I have not paid either of them yet; my account is not yet come in.</p>
               <p>Blake's defence. I am not guilty; I never stole any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>The other two prisoners left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

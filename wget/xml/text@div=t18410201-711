                  </hi>. I live at Brentford. On the 21st of January, the prisoner came to my shop with another person—they wanted some pencil-cases—I produced to them a tray, and selected five or six, but they objected to them—the tray was placed between me and them on the counter—theprisoner then selected one, and placed it on the side—he applied to the other person to select his, and they kept handing the cases about—the prisoner then took up one, which was a very peculiar pattern, a new pat<lb></lb>tern—heunscrewed it and said, "If you will wrap this in paper we will call for it"—the other man said he should decline taking one, but said the prisoner had better take his, which he did—they then left, and I missed the new case—I then went in pursuit for about a mile and a half—I then turned back and met them—I took them into a public-house where they were searched, and nothing found—they were taken to the station—I then went home and missed four more cases, which made five in all—none of them have been found—nobody had been in the shop between my seeing the cases and the prisoner leaving.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner and another per<lb></lb>son in my master's shop—I was in the parlour—I saw them looking at the pencil-cases—I observed Holland, the other man, take some out of the tray and look at them—each time he looked at them he turned his head towards the parlour—he had his right-hand glove in his left-hand, and rested his left-hand on the counter, and I observed him rest his hand in his pocket.</p>

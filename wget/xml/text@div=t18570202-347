                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jonathan Walker, of No. 21, Pres<lb></lb>cot-row, Woolwich, and am a laundress. On Monday evening, 5th Jan., between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was in Francis-street, Woolwich, three men and a woman accosted me—the prisoner was one of them—they asked me the way to the railway—they said they did not mind which railway it was; Fenchurch-street, or London-bridge as if they went to London-bridge, they</p>

               <p>should want a conveyance to Fenchurch-street—they wished me good night, and left me—I had not gone far, when I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse, containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw them about an hour after-wards, and took hold of the prisoner by the tail of his coat, saying, "You have stolen my purse"—I had kept them in sight all the time; he said, "What do you mean?"—one of the others came up and spoke to him, and then he put my purse into my hand—I did not hear what the other man said to him—I said, "It is my purse, but it is not all my money "—it was opened at the Court, and there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bit—the prisoner then said that he had neither seen it, nor had it; I said, "How came you to give it to me back then?"—he said that he did not want my paltry purse, he had got 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket, and was a respectable man—he disengaged my hand from his sleeve, and I got hold of the tail of his coat, and held him by that—the others all went away and left him—I held him till a police<lb></lb>man came, and gave him in charge with the purse—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. I came out of the barracks in Francis-street about a quarter to 6 o'clock; that is near the Rose and Crown—I saw the prisoner give another man something behind him—I could not see what it was—the prosecutrix said, in his hearing, that he had robbed her—he said that he had no <hi rend="italic">call</hi> to rob her; he did not want her paltry purse; he had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket—I saw the prisoner give her purse—she said that it was her's, but that that was not all her money—the man who took something from the prisoner said that he would go and fetch a policeman, but he never came back.</p>

               <p>the prisoner put his arm towards her, and then saw the purse in her hands—there was another man close to the prisoner when I came up—they were both close to the woman, and immediately I saw the purse in her hands the other man ran away—the woman was very much flurried and confused, she could hardly speak—this did not all happen in a second; it was five minutes, I should think, before a policeman came—I heard the prisoner say that he did not have her purse; he said, "It was not I who gave it to you;" but the other man was gone—he did not insist on a policeman being sent for—he said that he was a respectable man, and would have the matter inves<lb></lb>tigated—he had no gloves on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix standing together—she said that he had robbed her; he said, "Me robbed you! you are drunk;" she caught hold of him by the skirt of his jacket, I saw his hand behind him with something in it, I could not see what, but he gave a nod to another man who came behind him, to catch hold of it—I did not see the other man take it, but he said that he would go and fetch a policeman, and then the prisoner put the purse into the woman's hand—I saw that the other man never came back—the prisoner said, "I do not want to rob you, I have got as much as 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell me, deliberately, on your oath, that you saw him put the purse into the woman's hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I said that down at Woolwich police court—it was a leather purse—my deposition was read over to me, and I put my mark to it. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition, being read, did not state that the witness had seen the prisoner put the purse into the woman's hand.</hi>) I did say so; it must be a mistake of the man who took it down—I did not see the prisoner with any gloves.</p>

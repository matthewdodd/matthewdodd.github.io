I am a wholesale confectioner, in Jewin Crescent—the prisoner was in my employment—his duties were to receive orders and col<lb></lb>lect money, and to account for it every evening to my father, at his office in Vauxhall-bridge-road, where he put up his horse and trap—he has accounted to me in one or two exceptional cases, when I happened to be at my father's office, and my father was not at home—in my father's absence he would most likely have left the money in his bag, with his credit-note—my father was not out of town in December and January; he might have been absent upon any particular day—the prisoner did not account to me for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 14th December, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 30th January, or for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 31st January—he has never accounted to me for those sums—I saw him shortly before he was given into custody; he called at my father's office and presented this paper to him—I was present—the prisoner said he was very sorry, that he had been receiving certain amounts of money and not accounting for them, and this paper was the particulars of them.</p>

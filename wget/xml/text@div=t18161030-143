On the 23rd of April last, between seven and eight in the evening, several people were in the house drinking; my wife was in the house; the prisoner Bailey was in the parlour drinking with several others. I was in the skittle ground at the back part of the house. I had occasion to come through the house, through the room where they were sitting. Bailey was not there then. I heard one of them, whose name is Morgan, say, we are in a bloody mess now; three or four of the others immediately rose up, and said, let us stall him off as he comes down stairs. Then there was something the matter on my stairs. I opened the stair foot door, and three or four steps up, was the prisoner Bailey coming down; I immediately seized him, and called to my wife to bring a light; I then perceived that he had a silk handkerchief of mine in his hand, which he threw over his shoulder behind him. I then brought him down stairs, and wanted to see if he had any other property about him; but his companions that were in the parlour came about me, and I was afraid they wanted to rescue him. I then took him into the bar; his companions went round to the front of the bar, and one named Thatcher said to me Hales, let the man go, for he is drunk. I said I would not let him go, for I found him with my property about him. He then turned round to the others, and said damn my eyes, if you are all of one mind be shall not be taken. Then they came round to the other door, and Thatcher dragged my wife away from me. She was at that time asking me to let the prisoner go. for fear of our lives. I immediately bolted the door upon them. It is a double door; the top part bolts, and the bottom part has a lock to it. They then took the shutters which they found outside, and battered the door all to pieces, and beat me away from the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300047"></xptr>till they got hold of the prisoner by the collar, and they dragged him over the door which runs into a passage that goes down by the side of the house. I never saw him again until about a month ago. I am sure he is the man. We found part of the goods named in the indictment missing, and other things proved.</p>

            . On the 23d of April, two strange men came into the house. They went into the perlour, and called for some liquor; I took them in some ale and some gin which they had ordered. When I went into the room, the prisoner Bailey was sitting on the child's small chair. I requested him to get up, and he abused me very much. They paid me for the liquor, and I went into the bar. There were in company with the prisoner, five men, whom we have had tried here. I went into the bar again and shut the door. Bailey came into the tap room and was very abusive there. Some wished me to go and speak to him, as he wanted to fight several in the tap room. I tried to persuade him to leave the place, and spoke to one of his companions to take him away. They did not regard what I said, and immediately left me and went to the parlour. I went into the bar, and served some gin to a woman at the bar, and the prisoner came into the bar and asked me if he should draw the liquor for me, and pretended to be in liquor himself. He came up very close to me, and I told him I was capable of drawing my own liquor. He grasped up some halfpence at the time he was talking to me. I gave him a push away, and he let drop some of the halfpence, but kept some in his hand, and said, thank God he had some halfpence to pay for some pipes of tobacco, I told him he was for no good. Several of them then came bustling round, all calling for liquor at the same time, and whether the prisoner went up stairs then or not, I can't say, but soon after I saw him on the stairs with my husband. He held a silk handkerchief in his hand, which I said, I could swear to was mine. He threw it over his shoulder, upon the second stair above him. I said, how he got it I could not tell, for I had the keys of my bed room where it had been in my pocket. The padlock key, and an inside key; my husband desired me to go up stairs to see if all was safe. I went and found the bed room door open. The child's silver coral laid at the door, and had been broken to pieces. The bed clothes were tied up, and the window was open, and I ran down stairs and exclaimed I was ruined. When I got down stairs, my husband had got the prisoner at the bar. I desired him to let him go, for I thought we should be murdered, for they beset us. Thatcher immediately dragged me away from him, and said I could swear to my property, and they would do for me. I resisted very much, and they beat me until my senses left me, and when I came too, I found myself in the parlour. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of September last, I was going through the Strand and saw the prisoner. I had seen the advertisement for his apprehension, and I asked him what the piece of work was about in Bridgewater Gardens. He said, he hoped that I would not trouble him for it. I told him I should do my duty, and take him into custody, I did so, and going to the office, he begged very much for me to let him go, saying he would go on board of ship directly, and leave the country. I proceeded with him to Bow-street office.</p>

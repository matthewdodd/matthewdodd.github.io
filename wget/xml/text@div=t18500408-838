                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>).I come from Saxony. I arrived in London on 20th March, and lodged that night at 24, Cranbourne-street, Leicester-square—on the 21st I was walking about London, and saw the prisoner with another man, standing at the corner of a street—I showed the prisoner a direction I had, alluding to Leicester-square, and asked him the way—he laid hold of my arm, and said, "Come," and was very friendly—we went into a street, the name of which I do not know—the other man bowed to him to go into a public-house—they ordered something to drink, and treated me—I put my hand into my pocket, and was going to pay for it, but they would not let me—they showed me some Bank-notes in a pocket-book, and asked if I knew those sort of things—we then left that public-house for another, and went to a room where nobody was—they rang the bell, and the waiter brought in some white liquor—I offered to pay for it, but they refused—I had my purse out, which contained sixteen double <hi rend="italic">Louis d'ors,</hi> one English sovereign, one Prussian and two Saxonian dollars, and some small silver—the gold was wrapped in a passenger-ticket—the prisoner said, "Ah, you have foreign money; let me see it"—Fry then made signs that the paper the money was in was not good—he counted the money, put it into a piece of brown paper, and I saw it put into my purse; but it seemed to me to be another paper, and not so big as the other out—they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it very quickly into my purse—I tried to pull it out, but they would not let me, and said they were going—when they saw I would not be without seeing the money right, they both left the room—I then pulled out my purse, ran after them, and caught the prisoner before he got out of the house—I screamed for help, and the prisoner gave me back the money wrapped in paper—I opened the paper, and there was one double <hi rend="italic">Louis d'or</hi> wanting—the prisoner then ran away—I ran after him, but was stopped by the crowd—I left my hat and purse behind me—I caught the prisoner in four or five minutes—I had lost sight of him, but I am quite sure he is the person—I also lost my pocket-book, containing seven Prussian and Saxou bank<lb></lb>notes—I do not know when I lost it—this purse is mine(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it from the public-house, and my hat—the prisoner spoke to me in English and broken German, but I could comprehend some of it.</p>

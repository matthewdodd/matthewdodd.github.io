On 17th Feb., the prisoner had a night's lodging at my house; he paid me a shilling—I put it into my purse, where I had no other shilling, and gave him a sixpence—I found the shilling was bad about a couple of hours afterwards—I gave that shilling to the constable on the Wednesday—I had it two days—I am sure it was the same—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner over at the public house after I found the shilling was bad—I went to him, and told him he had passed a bad shilling—he said if I would give him the shilling he would give me a good one—the policeman came, I gave him the shilling, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>evening, 18th Feb.; I stopped outside the George and Bull public house—between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the house, and Mrs. O'Neil was there—she came out with the prisoner, and made this charge against him, of passing the shilling—she had the shilling with her, and gave it to me—I asked the prisoner to let me see if he had any money; he would not—I took him into custody—he struggled very violently—I saw him put some money into his month—I saw the edge of one shilling in his mouth—he swallowed it, and got convulsed—I had another constable with me to assist me—he assaulted the other constable, and bit his finger—I hit him on the back—he swallowed the shilling—at the station he took this half crown out of his mouth—I took it out of his hand, he had no coin on him—he swal<lb></lb>lowed the other—he put either two or three pieces into his mouth—I saw the edge of one shilling between his teeth, and I heard them gurgle in his mouth—when Mrs. O'Neil said to him that he had passed a bad shilling, he said he would give her a good one if she would come to his lodging, but she would not.</p>

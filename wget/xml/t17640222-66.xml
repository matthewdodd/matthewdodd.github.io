I was a stranger in the place, and asked them the nearest way to Chelsea-collge? one of them said, he was going that way, and would show me: that man was just such a one as the prisoner Steward, but I cannot be positive, for I was a little in liquor; one of them walked along side me, and one or two of them walked on the other side of the way.

We intended to send Redmond in for two-pennyworths of bread and cheese, and he was to take the till. The people were in the shop, and took care of the door. After that, we walked up Wapping, and peeped into several houses. We met with the prosecutor at the bottom of Nightingale-lane; he asked the way to Chelsea. Rockett stept before him, and said, he has got a watch. He said, I'll show you the way. He was going quite the contrary way, being much in liquor. Rockett ordered Redmond and I to keep off a little while, and go another way and meet them. Bevas and Steward followed behind. We went through Swan-alley, and met them all at the end of Nightingale-lane. The prosecutor said to them, I have no change, or else I would give you something to drink. I went down Swan-alley steps and hid myself, that he might not mistrust, seeing so many of us. They all walked up towards East-smithfield; then I came out, and followed behind. They went down Helvet stairs. As soon as they got him under the gateway, Bevas knocked him down with a poker, which he had from Mrs. Kennedy's house; the second blow knocked him down; then he took his watch. Rockett stood over him. All five of us were close by. I had the watch in my hand as I was going along the New Road. A woman said, next day, the gentleman lost three guineas, but I heard of no money. Bevas dropt the poker while he was riffling him.</p>

(An iron poker bent produced in court.) I heard no noise till the prosecutor called, Stop thief; he was there; he got up, and said he had lost his watch. I ran, but could not see any body.

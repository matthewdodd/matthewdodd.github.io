               <p>I know the prisoner; he was in my service once. I lost the mare mentioned in the indictment, between the 18th and 22d of March: the prisoner was employed occasionally in attending this mare, from some time in October, to some time in March: I bought this mare of one Downing, to whom the prisoner was a servant; Downing and he disputed, and he was turned out of employ; about a week or ten days after the prisoner applied to me, and requested me to employ him; I gave him half-a-crown a week to attend the mare: he had often been persuading me that the mare was too small for me: I lost her about the 22d of March; Burrows told me that Alderman Curtis had taken a liking to the mare, and that if I would let him take her to the Alderman, he would give a good price for her; I told him, I had no objection, if I could get a good price, to part with her; he said, I had better write a line; accordingly I wrote, and mentioned, that if he liked her, the price was twenty guineas; the prisoner took it, as I understood, with intent to take her to the Alderman; he returned at night, and said, the alderman was not at home; I told him, I was going to ride her next day, and I had altered my mind; I gave orders that the prisoner should not have the care of the mare, or the keys of the stable; I rode her the next day down to Canons, to Mr. O'Kelly's; I saw her the next day; and about two or three days after that I missed her; I received a letter from Burrows the 26th; that was the first intimation I had of Burrows: (produces the letter.) I had given no orders that he should take her; but the contrary: I never learned where the mare was till the 28th of last month; I saw him in Bolton-street, and I pursued him, and came up to him, and he stopped, and I caught hold of him: he attempted to strike me: a man came up, and I gave charge of him; he was taken to Poland-street; there he confessed that he had taken the mare to Paddington, and sold her for eight guineas; but he would not tell the person's name.</p>

               <p>Did you never authorize the prisoner to offer the annuity on Norris's life for sale, in order to engage in partnership with the prisoner, in the horse dealing business? - He often asked me to lend him fifty pounds; but upon my honor he never had the bond, nor the assignment of the annuity in his possession in his life.</p>

               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am struck with so great an awe, appearing before this grand tribunal, that I fear I shall fall very short in making a defence to meet so heavy a charge as that on which I stand before you; at the same time I feel myself happy that I am before a jury who are men of property and character, and where I may expect that justice which is the grand characteristic of an English jury. The situation I have always held in life, I flatter myself, has been very respectable; my connections have been amongst the bettermost kind of people; and although from the first of my entering into life I have been unfortunate, I cannot accuse myself of being any ways criminal. At the age of twenty years I found myself in possession of a sum of money very little short of ten thousand pounds, an age much too young to turn it to advantage: I thought mankind honest as myself, therefore I the more easily sell into the snares that were laid for me; for every one seemed to court my friendship; and it was who should be first to serve me. At the age of twenty-five I formed a connection with a man who at this time is in a very great line of business, and lost very near five thousand pounds; and I was almost the only sufferer, as a scheme was laid for me, being known to be a man of property; and I was continually arrested, and sometimes imprisoned, while those who were in partnership with me went unmolested: I do not mean to cast any reflection upon my partner's conduct; but it had been better for me during the distress I have since suffered, if he had been endowed with a more liberal heart. That every one to whom we stood indebted, might receive their just demand, I put into the hands of a worthy alderman all my estates, which were sold at public sale to the best advantage, and paid every man twenty shillings in the pound, after which I believe I had a surplus of near one thousand pounds, which I went into business with in the drapery line, in Cheapside; but still fortune was unkind; I was continually harrassed, and became a bankrupt; but so good an opinion had my creditors of me, that upon my examination not one appeared against me, but pitied my situation, and liberally assisted me afterwards; for the course of seven years I indured every kind of distress and hardship; penury and want were continually my companions; still I did not swerve from that which is just, but bore my unhappy situation with a becoming fortitude, and would rather starve than be guilty of a meanness. Fortune once more smiled, and I found myself happily situated as master of the riding school in Gray's-inn-road; there I thought my sorrows and sufferings were at an end, and that the latter part of my life would prove much more favourable than the beginning; my business flourished, my family seemed happy, and I was quite contented: when, dreadful thought! I took into co-partnership a young man from the country, who soon formed an unlawful connection with my wife, robbed me of most of my property, set off for France, and remained there three years, until they had squandered all away; once more I was reduced to poverty, in which state, gentlemen, I now stand before you: and, gentlemen of the jury, as men, as Christians, and no doubt, many of you fathers of a family, picture to yourselves my distresses; robbed of my property, of the partner of my bed, by whom I had had seventeen children; but what must her feelings have been upon cool reflection; she, that should have been the protectress of her family, in one moment, by one base act, brought into a state of beggary; I hope God has forgiven her. Gentlemen of the jury, I have now living five children, which I am happy to say have been taught a proper sense of their duty both to God and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150146"></xptr>man, that I make no doubt they will make worthy members of society, and I hope will enjoy more comfort than their truly unfortunate father. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, the case now before you is for stealing a horse: can it be supposed, considering the various scenes I have been through, the character I have supported under such distressing circumstances, that I am capable of so base an act? No; I shudder at the thought: the just character that will be given to my prosecutor during the course of my trial, I am sure will operate in my favour, and convince you that it is a malicious prosecution; not content with starving myself and family, he wishes to rob them of their protector, by striking at my life. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, is it possible I could steal that which was partly my own property? as the prosecutor sent one Cook to me, desiring I would call upon him; the purport of which was to propose a partnership; and the first condition, that I should take the mare at the same price that he had given for her; from that time I considered her as part my own; took the whole care and management of her on myself; rode her; kept the bridle and saddle at my own room; and frequently obliged my friends, by letting them ride her when Mr. Moore nor myself did not want her, as will be proved by the evidence of several gentlemen of property and character. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, can it be supposed; can it carry the least shadow of truth, that I should lend a horse for my friends to ride, that I had no property in? Thus has the prosecutor promised from time to time to advance the money, and kept me in suspence for upwards of five months, until I was under the necessity of pawning all my own wearing apparel, as well as my children's, for support; at last I was obliged to sell my houshold furniture at less than two thirds of the real value; still he assured me the money should be advanced, and that I should be properly recompenced for my time, trouble, and loss I had sustained; that we should not stand still for money, he having it in his power to procure any sum we should stand in need of; and if we went on well, nothing should be wanting My lord and gentlemen of the jury, this language seemed very pleasing to me; my situation required assistance; and a distressed man lays hold of every thing; little did I think I should be so gratefully rewarded, as to be tried for my life! My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I was poor before, but to rob me of all I had, my good name, the only thing left to protect me and my family in this world, is cruel beyond expression: still buoyed up with hopes, I took the resolution of requesting Moore to be open, and acquaint me if he had any doubt of advancing the money, as I had been so long in expectation of it, that I could not wait any longer, as the last thing I had to dispose of was my table-cloth, my sheets, blankets, &amp;c. being already gone; he informed me the money he could have as that day, but was sorry to say upon such disagreeable and unjust terms, as he could not accede to it, therefore required I would endeavour to dispose of an annuity of forty pounds per ann. during the life of Dr. Norris, and set the piece at one hundred and twenty pounds, and assured me, that as soon as sold, I should have part of the money, to immediately begin business with it; every endeavour was used by myself; I made every application in my power to dispose of the annuity, and spent upwards of two guineas in about a fortnight's attendance, on different people, and at different parts of the town; but found to my sorrow, that the annuity was not marketable, as Dr. Norris was advanced in years, and in a very infirm and poor state of health; I waited on Dr. Norris himself, who would not purchase it on any consideration: thus I found I was amused by Moore, to answer his villainous purposes. My Lord and Gentlemen, the latter end of the month of February, Moore rode the mare out, and not paying attention to the road he was going, the mare and himself fell into a place opened in the road to lay down some pipes: the mare received great injury; Moore was very little hurt: he returned home, and immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150147"></xptr>sent for me, but being from home, I could not attend her. In the evening, I went to the stable and found her in the following state; her knees broke, her chest damaged, and her eyes very much hurt. The next morning I acquainted Moore with the state that I had found her in. Moore requested I would immediately fell her, as he was convinced she was not safe to ride. I acquainted him, in the state she was at present, no one would purchase her, unless she was sold on very low terms; therefore we agreed to keep her until the damage she had received should be hid, which, from the attention I paid to her, was accomplished in about three weeks or a month, as it was a time horses shed their coats; and her colour being grey, the blemishes were very little seen. Now, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, comes the most particular part of the transaction, and which I hope you will pay attention to, as it will throw a proper light on this cruel, unjust, and malicious prosecution. I informed More, as the mare was unfound, and almost blind, it was necessary a letter should be drawn as though she came from the country, and directed to me at a different place from where I resided: he desired me to draw the letter, bring it up to his house, and he would copy it, at the same time throwing down one shilling for luck, in the presence of the witness, which will be produced. I 
               <persName id="t17900915-109-person1078">
                  drew

             the letter (intended only as a copy), Moore read it over, and said there was no need to copy it; it would do as well if he signed it, which he immediately did, and with the same ink. I dated as though he lived at Hendon: this was on the 17th of March. I continued in that neighbourhood, I think about a week, as my landlord will prove, and every day rode the mare out, endeavouring to fell her: but, being unsuccessful, I took her to Paddington, and there sold her for eight guineas, a price much more than she was worth; and acquainted Moore by letter, as soon as I could I would wait on him, but hoped that I should have no more equivocations about advancing the money. Moore, conscious in himself that he meant to deceive me, sent one

                  William

             to meet me at a public house, behind Mr. Fozard's Yard, Piccadilly, who informed me he was sent by Moore, and that I had swindled him out of a mare. I told him I had sold the mare; but Moore being indebted to me for trouble and attendance upon him for upwards of five months, I should keep it for my own use, and desired him to send for More, which he did; but, not attending, after keeping me in custody from twelve at noon until six in the evening, he let me go about my business, at the same time saying, had he known the business, he would have had nothing to do with it. Thus matters rested, until Moore met me, and took me before Justice Read, Poland-street, where he swore he had neither signed any letter, or given any verbal orders to sell the mare. Gentlemen of the Jury, the proofs that I shall bring, which are all respectable, cannot leave any doubt on your minds, that he gave both written and verbal orders to sell the mare, and left the disposal of her entirely to me as his partner, but that he now wishes to make a property of me. I rest my case entirely on the candour of the Jury (being convinced I am in a just cause) who cannot fail to see into the prosecutor's intention, and that all the evidence given by himself and witnesses, cannot carry any foundation of truth, and hope this Honourable Court will treat it with the contempt it deserves. I now, Gentlemen, trust my life in your hands, resting assured you will acquit me of the whole of this charge, and restore me once more to my truly distressed family.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. May it please your Lordship; my Lord, I stand at this moment in a situation, in which I hardly know how to address myself with proper decorum to the Court, because I have to night experienced one of the most uncomfortable scenes that can belong to human nature, in the course of having been called upon as a feeble and very unworthy member of a very honourable profession, to endeavour to preserve the life of a fellow subject; and I have had the good fortune to assist an enlightened jury; I have had the good fortune to be (without any of the affectation of those who talk of the divinity of their nature) able to defeat as nefarious, as abandoned, and as profligate a prosecution as the annals of human depravity can afford; but, my lord, my duty will not permit me to stop here, and your lordship, I will be bold to say, would not do your duty if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150149"></xptr>caused me to stop here, if you denied me the requisition I ask: my lord, without meaning to give any offence (for it cannot be my interest, and it is not my inclination) I DEMAND of your lordship, that this innocent, this injured, this oppressed man, whose life has been attacked by perjury, and by the denial of the hand-writing of the prosecutor, may be furnished with the means of further vindicating his injured innocence: your lordship knows, you have the means of damming up the fountain of justice; and though he would not have much to lament, I agree, after the reparation which he has already had; after twelve of his fellow citizens; careful, intelligent, enlightened men, hearing this prosecutor's story; after such a jury have, without any directions from your lordship, without any witnesses to his character; with hearing half his case; when they have said, that they cannot see it necessary to continue the trial any longer; God knows, the prisoner is a happy man, and may retire with comfort and satisfaction: he has been deluded into a situation of ruin; and he has after all, after he has, under the hand-writing of that prosecutor himself, proved, by every witness in the cause, not denied even by the prosecutor himself, (for it is not to be added to the aggravated guilt of this man, I should not do him justice if I asserted he did deny it); the prisoner has proved a written authority, produced before the sitting magistrate, for that, for which he is dragged to the bar of a criminal court, charged with a capital offence. My lord, I ask no commitment of this prosecutor for perjury, I repeat it, for murderous perjury; let him go to his bed with that peace he can enjoy; I do not ask you to set him in the pillory; I do not ask you to confine him within those walls, though he is the only man in court who does not feel that he deserves such punishment, for the wickedness of that perjury, which must have been fatal to the life of that innocent man, if indeed the ways of providence were not above the the ways of those weak, miserable mortals, who fancy they can elude its all searching eye; my lord, all I ask is, that you do not deprive the man at the bar of the means of applying to the future justice of the country; your lordship knows, that without a copy of the indictment Mr. Burrows cannot maintain an action against this prosecutor, which, by your lordship's granting that copy, and the assistance of some generous spirits, who are more disposed to do in secret than to proclaim in publick, he may be enabled to maintain, and to prove, that a malicious prosecutor he was; that he aimed a shaft at the life of an innocent man; and to call for a satisfaction before twelve other men, in the character of a civil jury; my lord, will any body say this is not a demand of justice? let this man put his defence on the record; let him justify his conduct, and join issue with us on the fact; I desire to meet an English jury; I desire to come to an investigation, that is all I ask; I only ask the means of bringing an action, which I pledge myself the poverty of Mr. Burrows shall not prevent his prosecuting with effect.</p>
               <p>The court granted a copy of the indictment.</p>

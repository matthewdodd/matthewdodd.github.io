                  </hi> I am groom to Mr. William Mason. The prisoner was his gardener—in October there were a number of deal boards brought to our premises—they were put under a shed and counted in my presence—there were 105—some time afterwards there was some inquiry made and they were counted again, there were then 103—on 11th Oct. I saw the prisoner leave the premises with a piece of board under his arm—it was a part of the 105—we had no other description of boards on the premises—on the following night, I saw him with a box and three other boards of the same description as the other, but they were not the length that they had been, they were sawn into two pieces—I gave information to the police—I afterwards saw some boards that the policeman had—I believe them to be some of the boards off my master's premises—I saw this box—there is a stain inside it—I know it to be my master's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 346). I searched the prisoner's lodging on Sunday, 21st Oct—he was then in custody in the back bed room, the door of which was locked—I found there four pieces of deal board and about eight bushels of potatoes, and in the front bed room about four bushels more—I found this box in a shed behind his cottage—the door of the shed was locked also—there are some stains in the bottom of the box—it was shown to Cox and he recognised it, and claimed it as his master's—the boards were shown to Cox—they had been recently sawn—these two (<hi rend="italic">fitting the ends to<lb></lb>gether</hi>) have been one board, and these two also—this is the box—it was sent from some foreign part with some preserves in it, the jars broke and made these stains in the bottom.</p>

I am foreman to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests—the house No. 16, George-street, Bloomsbury, is their property, and is to be taken down for the improvements—on the day fter this happened I saw this lead, and compared it with the remaining part of the lead on the roof of the house, it fitted most accurately—it was worth about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 27th of May, I was in the house opposite to the house 16, George-street—I saw the prisoner on the parapet of the roof of No. 16—he appeared to be ham<lb></lb>mering up the lead—I saw his arm move—I noticed two other men that got away—they were doing the same as the prisoner.</p>

On Wednesday, the 16th of November, I got an officer, and searched a box, which she said was her's - she gave the officer the key. I found in it a bottle of gin, which I believe to be mine, by the flavour - it is a manufactory peculiar to myself - I am a distiller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. I have carried on the trade of a distiller for many years, and have sold many thousand gallons of the same flavoured gin as this is - she might have bought it at some of the houses which I supply.</p>

I told her I was an officer, that she and another woman were suspected of stealing gin, and I was come to search their boxes; when I searched one box the prisoner said, "The gin you are looking for, you will find in the other box" - I found this bottle of gin there; she said, "Eliza and I took the gin the day before yesterday;" they both went down with me and pointed out the vat, No. 10 - the prisoner said the other drew the gin. The other woman was taken and discharged.</p>

            . I am a boot maker, I live about five houses from this warehouse. On Friday the 13th of December, about five in the afternoon, it was dark at that time, I was standing at my own door, I observed four men, the prisoner was on the opposite side, shortly after they passed my house the prisoner joined them in company. Suspecting that they were on something bad I watched them, and just as I got to a house adjoining Mr. Hankes I passed on and the four men and the prisoner separated, three men took their station against the church nearly opposite the prisoner, and another turned round the corner of the hord, and at that instant I lost sight of them. It had not been a moment scarcely before I discovered the prisoner open the warehouse of Mr. Hankes and Lee, it was by the glimmer of the light at the extremity of the warehouse that I discovered the prisoner, at that time he had got his head and the forepart of his body in the warehouse, at that instant I jumped up and got hold of him by the neck, I then called out Mr. Hankes, the warehouseman came running down to me, I told him my opinion of the prisoner. There was a great deal lumber box and other things that he might have concealed himself in to have robbed the warehouse, which I suspected was the case.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the four companions. - A. They all decamped, then the prisoner was secured. The other four were grown men, one of them was convicted here last night, he went by the name of Joe the marine, he was tried for knocking down the bell-man of St. Bride's. I sent for a constable, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150076"></xptr>searched, nothing was found.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hankes and Lee, I heard Mr. Groves make the alarm, I had not been to the door for near half an hour, in consequence of the alarm I immediately ran forward and found the lad in the possession of Mr. Groves. Our door is a very heavy door and a pulley, if any person opens it it will shut itself, I sent for an officer, he knew him, and at the Mansion-house he was known by the officers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Watling Street to go to Billingsgate to see if any fish had come up, this door was a-jar, I thought I saw somebody go in that I knew, I put my head in, and Mr. Groves seized me.</p>

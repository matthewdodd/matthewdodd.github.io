Ten days before the day stated in the indictment, he came to the sacristy, and spoke to an English chaplain of the chapel. On Sunday, the 1st of March, the prisoner presented himself at the altar of the chapel to receive the sacrament. I conceived him not fit to receive it, and so I passed him over, as I thought him mentally deranged. I could not have refused it if I had not been confident of his derangement. I said nothing to him, I only passed him by. Immediately as mass was over, he came into the vestry, and asked me why I refused him the sacrament? I told him I had no intention to affront him, but that I considered him under mental derangement, and if he would give me the name under of his confessor, I would speak to him, and that if he said he was fit to receive it, I would give it to him immediately, and make any apology he wished. He did not appear satisfied, but went out quietly. I saw nothing of him until Sunday, the 15th of March, about eight o'clock. After I had blessed the palm, and at the end of it was going to pateronster, I heard a little noise, but did not notice it-my back was toward the congregation. I heard a shriek, turned round, and saw the prisoner getting over the communion railing just by me, with a double-edged sword. I jumped over to the vestry - He followed, and gave me a stab, which cut my vestment. I went to the door, and tried to push it too - He put his feet between the door, and prevented my shutting it. He tried to stab me. I struck the sword, it cut my arm - He passed it to me and cut my arm. At that time I grasped the sword - He cut five of my fingers in struggling for it. In two minutes about thirty of the congregation secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You entertained an opinion that he was insane - A. I did by his conduct. He had a belt hung over his shoulder, and a scabbard. I never did any thing to offend him.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Foley-place. On the 18th of March, about eight o'clock, I was at the chapel. I saw the prisoner enter with a drawn sword in his hand - He advanced to the middle of the chapel; the women screamed out. When he got to the railing of the altar, Mr. Mathias turned his head and jumped from the altar to the vestry door. The prisoner got over the railing, and struck Mr. Mathias with the sword - I saw him put his sword between the door and the post. I ran to the vestry, and found Mr. Mathias bleeding in both hands. Several people seized the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Palm Sunday is a very particular day with you - A. Yes. On entering the chapel it is usual to make the sign of the cross, and approach the altar with great solemnity.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in Seymour-street, Portman-square. I was called in to attend the prosecutor about nine o'clock of the 5th of March, and found he was wounded in the right arm, between the wrist and elbow-his fingers also were wounded. It must have been done with some sharp instrument. The wound in the arm was a serious one-the integuments were cut through; there was also a vessel cut.</p>

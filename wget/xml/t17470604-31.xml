               <p>Butcher. Not till the Time that she had robb'd me. I always took her to be a very honest Girl till that Time, I went out to buy something, when I came home I found my Door and Drawers were broke open; my Door was broke all to Pieces, she confess'd she broke the Door with the Poker; we ask'd her how she came to do it, and she said the Devil put it into her Head. The Prisoner had nothing to the Purpose to say in her Defence, but referr'd the Court to her Character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a tea tray on the 4th of February last - A. I did; about six o'clock in the evening I heard the door pushed open; I immediately went to the door and found the tea tray out of its place; the tray was taken from behind the street door, and on my looking up Queen street I saw a man going along, I run after him, I saw he had a tea tray under his arm. I took hold of it and said, my friend that is my property; he gave it me; I then stepped into the middle of the road; I told him he must not depart from me, he had stolen it out of my shop; I did not lay hold of him, I was alarmed; he walked on very fast and I after him; I told him if he did not stop I should have him apprehended; he ran, and I called stop thief; he stopped and made an attempt to come to me; I ran away from him and called stop thief again; then he stopped and came back running down Dartmouth row; I took hold of his coat and brought him into the shop and sent for an officer; he was never out of my sight after I took the tea tray from him; the greatest distance he was from me probably was five or six yards; I valued the tea tray at three shillings.</p>

               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the case laid to my charge. He told the magistrate that he believed I was not the man that took it. I was intoxicated at the time.</p>

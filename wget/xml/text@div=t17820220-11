            , the prisoner, with the horse, I have known him two years, I saw him with it between eleven and twelve at night, at Mr. Gurnel's door, he had a sack well loaded upon it; this was in the road, I did not see him come out of the gate, it was just by the gate, Mr. Gurnel's gate; the horse belonged to Mr. Gurnel, it was lost on Sunday night, I know the horse by describing him, he had a white star in the forehead, he followed me and offered me half a guinea not to say he had been there.</p>
               <p>Describe the horse, what colour? - A reddish-colour'd horse, with a white star in his forehead, it was moon light, when he offered the half guinea I went away from him, he told me he had been buying some lambs, but the sack was cramm'd with these fowls; the gentleman said he lost them, I only know by that.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I am sure I saw him near the gate, it might be a pole from the gate; he was turning the head to the cart way, it was between eleven and twelve on Sunday night; there were two of them, they went towards Little Ealing, he lives at Brentford.</p>
               <p>From Prisoner. Ask whether I asked her half guinea or not; I was at home having my shirt washed.</p>

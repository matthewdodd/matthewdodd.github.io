               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether she was in your service on the 15th of November last? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your house when she was in your service? - A. A number of articles, particularly the four table-cloths; the four table-cloths are the only articles that I have found.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. Twenty-five or twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss them? - A. Some time in October; I did not suspect the prisoner to have robbed me at that time; she had been in my service about a month or six weeks, then I suspected her, and taxed her with it; and in consequence of a search-warrant, I found them by a woman that was an accomplice with her, who is in Court now, to give evidence; it was on the 16th of November that I found the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. You came at the knowledge of these things by the accomplice of her? - A. Yes, she is an acquaintance of her's; I had a search-warrant and searched for the tickets; she then said, she would tell us all the other woman did.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the house of this witness, and found the duplicates there? - A. No; we found several duplicates, but none of my goods were found; she told me she would explain every thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you about the latter end of October with any thing? - A. It was some time in October, I cannot recollect exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bring you? - A. Three tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she got them from? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she bid you do with them? - A. She asked me to pledge them for her, and I pledged them with the two gentlemen that are in Court; I pledged five in the whole, Mrs. Spencer gave me three, and two I took from the house of Mr. Diggles.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have access at Mr. Diggles's house? - A. I went to see her two or three times while she was servant there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to see the prisoner; did the prisoner give them to you, or did you take them yourself? - A. She gave them me for the purpose of pledging them.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me she only gave you three, but, by your account, you had five? - A. I had five in the whole, they were at different times: she was in the habit of going backwards and forwards to Mr. Diggles, they were acquaintances; and when she was in better circumstances they used to visit each other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. She had them for her own use.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mell.) What did you do with the money? - A. It was to replace the things that she had made away with in her lodging, prior to her going to service to Mr. Diggles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is my landlady will answer, that, when I gave up my lodging, every thing was replaced before I left it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Mell.) In what line of life was the prisoner in before she went to service? - A. She had been kept by the Hon. Lessian Blackwood.</p>

             sworn. - On the 27th of October, Mrs. Mell pawned two table-cloths; I produce them, they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Has that woman been in the habit of pawning goods at your house? - A. Yes, I have known her these two years, she pledged the table-cloths in the name of Jennings. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Mrs. Mell has told us, that this woman was an acquaintance of your's before she came into your service? - A. The way she was acquainted with me, I knew the Hon. Captain Blackwood five years ago, and the prisoner was living with him in the situation you have just heard; I used to see her and Captain 
               <persName id="t18041205-37-person490">Blackwood</persName>
             almost every day; Captain

             is gone to the Isle of Jersey; some time after this I saw her in distress, and I wished to know how her circumstances were; she called upon me at my house; she said, she was in great distress, and she said she wished to get into service if she could.</p>
               <p>Q. When she called upon you, did she ever stay much in your company? - A. I treated her with a deal of kindness, and in summer time she came and assisted in the kitchen in pickling and preserving.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am in the profession, I am an attorney and solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her into your service? - A. About the middle of September.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to Mrs. Mell, do you know much of her? - A. I never saw her but twice before; I was at her house in order to search for the things, I never saw her but once at my house; after I had been robbed, I suspected every person that came into my house, and this Mrs. Mell came; I desired her to walk out, I had to go out to attend to my business; when I returned, I understood she had been there a second time on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew she was not in the habit of visiting any person in your house? - A. No other than the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you a married man? - A. I am; I have been married some years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Me and my prosecutor were always in the habit of visiting each other before I went into his house, and when I went I was not as an hired servant, I was as an intimate friend to assist till they were suited.</p>

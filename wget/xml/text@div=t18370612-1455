I am in partnership with Mr. William Cook, a coach manufacturer, carrying on business in King-street, St. James's premises are very extensive—the male prisoner was our gate-keeper—after after the workmen leave at night he has charge of the entire premises, and has two apartments over—the back gateway for himself and his wife—I live out of town, and so does my partner—I have a sitting-room on the premises Mr. Cook has two sons, who are my nephews—they occupy another room in the factory—they leave on Saturday night, to go to their father's, and return on Monday—Mrs. Walls generally looked after my room for me—she had nothing to do with Messrs. Cook's room—my sitting-room was next to the prisoners' rooms—Mr. Cooks' room is on the same floor—there is a staircase from the counting-house to Mr. Cook's room, at one end of the building—it was usual to have a taper candlestick kept in the counting-house—we invariably burnt wax in it—on Saturday afternoon, the 6th of May, I was in the counting-house as late as half-past four o'clock, and much later—I sealed a letter with the taper at half-past four o'clock—the candlestick contained about an inch and a half of wax candle—this is the candlestick—I left the premises at near seven o'clock, and returned as usual on the Monday—in the afternoon of Monday I saw the taper placed on the mantel-shelf in the counting-house, where it usually where it usually stands—Mr. cook, Sen., was there at the time—we sent for the male prisoner, and ques<lb></lb>tioned him—the man who cleans the candlestick had brought it back—the prisoner was asked why this candlestick was so dirty—(I had not seen it dirty myself)—he said he took the candlestick when he broke the room door</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for to the prosecutors' premises, and went there on Tuesday, the 9th of May, about eleven or twelve o'clock—I saw in Mr. Cook's inner room, a quan<lb></lb>tity of things spread about, partly burnt and wet, and a cheat of drawers very considerably burnt by fire, the top long drawer was very much burnt, and the drawers upward from that, having the appearance as if a light had been put in about the centre of the right hand part of the drawer—the drawers had a lining to separate one drawer from another, and imme<lb></lb>diately over the centre of the right hand part the fire had nearly got through, showing that the fire was in that part of the drawer, and had burned there more than other parts—in that part the fire was spread, and had burnt through the front, and burnt upwards—none of the drawers were burnt below that one—it bad burned completely through the back part of the drawers—there was nothing burnt in the room but the, drawer and the things that were in it—the fire had just reached the ceiling but not burnt it, only blacked it, but in five minutes more I should think the place must have been on fire—I then looked at the door, leading from, top of the stairs into the outer room—that is the door opening from the counting-house—there was grease against the front of the door, as if a tallow candle had been accidentally pushed against it outside, and on the right hand side of the jamb the candle had also been against it, and I saw the fastening of the door was broken quite to pieces—it was a common, catch, and there was also a piece of the door jamb broken out, as if by an instru<lb></lb>ment—this was inside the door, immediately under the fastening, and I saw that could not be done by breaking the door open from without—I put the door to, in order to show the effect of it, and it was impossible to get a straw in where the piece was broken out of the door post—it is an iron box, which the door lock shoots into, and it was under that that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183706120058"></xptr>
               <p>pieces were broken out of the door post inside, and that could not have been done while the door was, shut, it must have been done afterwards—the effect of forcing the door would have bulged out the iron in the centre, and made the door faster—there were marks inside of something have been put in to force it out—it was utterly impossible to get a straw in outside✗—the poker was shown to me, but it had then been straightened—I have no doubt the marks inside the door had been made with a poker, because it was a sort of three cornered mark—if there was an inch, or an inch and a half of wax candle in this taper stand, it could produce the fire—on the front edge of the drawer there were marks of wax, and one or two ✗ of wax in the drawer—I called Mr. Rowley's attention to this afterwards—I did not observe the spatters at first—I asked for the male prisoner to be sent for—he was brought to me, and I told him I was an officer of Bow-street, and had come to inquire respecting the fire, and then I asked him✗ what called his attention first to the fire—he said he was sitting up stairs with his wife, and that she went down stairs for the purpose of getting some water, and returned and told him she smelt fire—that he took his✗ lantern and went down, and proceeded up the yard as far as the pump, (which I found was about thirty-six yards from the door which enters the house stairs,) and that on turning his head round he saw fire, and sparks of fire lying before the window of Mr. Cook's room, and he immediately went and burst the door open with his foot, and in doing so his lantern fell down and the light went out, that he then went down stairs into the counting house, and got the wax taper, or candlestick, from there—I said "That had wax in it, had you no tallow candle?"—he said, he had not, that✗ they did not use tallow candle at all, they had none in the house, that they always burnt oil—I said, "Do you mean to say you have no tallow candle in the house at all?"—he said, that he had not—I then left him with Mr. Cook, and went to the female prisoner in her room, and asked her the same questions as to what called her attention to the fire on the Saturday night—she said she went down stairs to get water, and smelt fire, and returned and called her husband; that he went down for the purpose of putting out the fire, "she went to the public-house and called Davis, who came and assisted—I then commenced searching the prisoners' room—one part of the room is partitioned off, and forms a closet, and in the joist at the side I found the gloves—I afterwards searched the prisoners' bed✗ room, and found this coat among some things at the side of the bed, and at a subsequent search I found this scarf among the bed things—I had another scarf which I found there, but am afraid I have lost it—I returned to the male prisoner, and after putting some other questions to him he said, "I hope you do not suspect me?"—I told him that I did, and that I was satisfied he had broken off the fastenings from inside the door, and put on an appearance—here is also some address cards of Mr. Cook's, with an engraved plate, which I found in the prisoners' room—none of the articles I found in the prisoners' room were either burnt, scorched, wet, or damp, (except that I found part of a pair of stockings in a tub of dirty water, after the male prisoner was taken into custody) the articles I found in the drawers were all more or less scorched or wet—I took the male prisoner to Bow-street office, leaving a person to take care of the female prisoner—I returned immediately, and went to the room where the female prisoner was with her children, and observed that the fire had been fresh made, there were fresh coals on it, and bits of wood sticking out in front, and I observed a cotton glove burning on the top of the fire—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183706120059"></xptr>
               <p>—I said, "What is this for?"—she said she did not know, she supposed the children had put it there—I said, "That cannot be, for I saw that glove on the shelf in the cupboard, and they could not get at it as it was above their reach"—I took up the poker and began to poke the fire out, and at the back part of the bottom of the grate I found this part of a vel<lb></lb>vet waistcoat and the tops of a pair of stockings with the initials H. C. on them, and I found the leg of this stocking afterwards in a tub of dirty water, the tops have been cut off; I also picked this watch key out of the fire—I showed her the things and said, "What can you say to this?"—she made no answer—I said, "Now, after this, what have you done with the table cloth?"—she said she knew nothing about it, she had never seen it—I made diligent search but found no shirt studs—the clothes I found in the closet of the room could not have been in the drawer where the fire was while the fire was in it, and present the appearance they did, for they were perfectly dry and had not the least smell of fire—tile other things all smelt strongly of fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachsmith, in the employ of Rowley and Cook. I remember when the fire was supposed to have happened—I left the premises about eight o'clock that night, and went to the Welsh Harp public-house; the female prisoner came to me a long time afterwards—it might be about nine o'clock—she called, "Davies," and I went with her; and when I went into the passage leading to our yard, she told me Mr. Cook's room was on fire—1 went into the premises, and went to the counting-house stairs, leading to Mr. Cook's room, and saw the male prisoner in the room—the upper part of the drawers were on fire then—I turned round, and went down as quick as I could, as George Wall called out for water, and I did not see what he was doing—there are two pumps in the yard, and there are pails kept by the pump for the use of the workmen—it is the custom to keep the pails about there—Walls knew that very well—I went and found a pail at the pump, and went part of the way up the yard—I fell over a ladder, and spilt the water—I went to another pump, filled the pail, took the water up to the room, and then the male prisoner was not there—he was down at the pump, with a square box, with a bit broken from the side of it—the box would not hold water to carry up stairs—it would not hold it long enough—I do not know whether he had that box in Mr. Cook's room—I assisted in putting out the fire—when the fire was out I asked him how it happened—he said, God Almighty knew, for he did not—he told me he had burst the room door open with his knee—he</p>

               <p>showed me how he did it—I asked for a light when I fell over the ladder, and the female brought a tallow candle—I am certain it was tallow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 35, Portpool-lane. I was in the prosecutors' employ at this time. On Saturday night, the 6th of May, I left the premises about a quarter after eight o'clock—I saw a light as if of a candle in Mr. Cook's sitting-room, as I went down the yard to go out, and the male prisoner was at the gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shopman in the employ of the prosecutors. On the Monday morning after the fire the prisoner gave me that taper stand, Bear upon ten o'clock—I am not certain whether he said I was to clean it, but he told me the extinguisher was lost up stairs—the top part of it was very black with smoke—the lower part had a great deal of wax about it, appa<lb></lb>rently as if the wax had run down, being melted, as if it had burnt down in the socket, and melted down on the bottom—I cleaned it with boiling hot water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant gaoler at the public office, Bow street. I saw the male prisoner when he was brought into custody, on Tues-day the 9th of May—I went into the lock-up room and saw him there—asked him how he came there, (as he had been put there in my absence)—he told me it was something about his wife, but he should be all right if it was not for his wife <hi rend="italic">splitting</hi> on him—those are exactly the words he used.</p>

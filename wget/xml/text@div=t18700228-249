                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 24, Milk Street—about 1st January, the prisoner called at my warehouse and requested me to give him a commission in connexion with others that he had in the trade, upon orders for account books and printing, to which, after making inquires, I ac<lb></lb>ceded upon certain terms; he was to have 5 per cent upon one particular class of goods, and 10 per cent, upon another—he asked bow I paid my commission travelers—I said once a month—he said he was rather in low water, and if I could make it once a weak he should like it much <hi rend="italic">better</hi>—I said it made no difference to me, I would break my rule for once—on 8th January, he brought me five or six orders, amongst them from Mr. Pearce, of Camden Town, for a ledger at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner's commission upon that would be about 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he took his commission for the whole week, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be included in that—on 15th January he brought me eight order, one was from Mr. Parsons, of Brentford, amounting to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for a ledger and two dozen pass books with his name printed on them—he was paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on the whole of the orders that week, including that—the goods were sent in pursuance of these orders and were returned to me as never having been ordered; they were all spurious orders—the other orders were from Robert Gough, of Windsor, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mr. Gurney, of Matthews, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Mr. Richardson, of Turnham Green, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and Mr. Coles, of Brentford, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him his commission upon all those orders, supposing them to be genuine—he said he had received the orders from all those persons, and he entered them in this order book—some time afterwards, in consequence of what I heard, I gave him in charge—he said, "It serves me right all I get, you have been a good friend to me, and if you come to my brother-in-law in Holborn, he will pay you the amount, what<lb></lb>ever it is"—I had lent him money to go on his journeys—he asked me the amount I should lose by him—I said I had not had time to go into it, but I should think it would be very little short of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

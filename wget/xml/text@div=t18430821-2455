               <p>Mr. Prendergast conducted the Prosecution. George Lightfoot. About nine o'clock at night, on Saturday, the 12th of August, I was employed as wagoner, at Mr. Pickford's wharf, in the City-road—I was near the bank where the goods are landed—I saw the prisoner and another near the bank—I afterwards spoke to Hawkins, the watchman—the prisoner was standing at the end of the bank, and when I came back with my ropes he was gone—he appeared to be watching Hawkins—the ale was deposited under a shed, within three or four yards of the bank—as I was going past I heard the pail handle rattle—I informed Hawkins—I had then missed the prisoner and the other man from where they had been standing—the shed is rather dark—Hawkins went away from me directly.</p>

            . I live in New-street, and deliver hand-bills. I went down St. James's-street, and saw the prisoners in company, whom I knew before - they went into the mob, I watched them, they placed themselves direct in the rear - Newman put his right hand into Ashton's left hand coat pocket, and drew out a handkerchief; I said "Holloa, my lads, what are you at;" the prosecutor missed his handkerchief - I saw Newman give it over to Hodgeman, who shoved it under his waistcoat, and slipped through the crowd - I could not get hold of him; I pointed out Newman as the man who took it; he was taken by a soldier, who gave him to a constable; I knew them both perfectly well, and am certain they are the persons. On Tuesday, the 16th, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw Hodegman go by Charing-cross with a woman; I seized him, and charged him with being concerned with Newman in a robbery; he said, Why did I not take him in St. James's-street, and refused to go with me, he resisted, his girl laid hold of me, and he escaped across the ruins into Cockspur-street - about an hour after, I saw him close to the Duke of Northumberland's, coming towards me; I told him to stop, he ran off towards the Horse-guards, and nearly upset every body who met him - an officer secured him, after some resistance.</p>

            . I lodge in Garden-row, Blackfriars-road, and am a glass-cutter. I worked with Hodgeman. On Saturday fortnight, the day the houses fell, in St. James's-street, I was with him five minutes before the clock struck twelve, at Mr. Herring's, King-street, Soho, where my shopmates dine - I had not been to St. James's-street, I came out of Gerrard-street, where I work; I heard the clock strike after he came in, it is a wine-vaults - I believe I had some salt beef for dinner, Hodgeman's brother dined with me; we came out to dine at twelve o'clock, because we wanted a job (we usually dine at one o'clock), and did not return till two o'clock, as the porter would not be at the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the landlord here - A. No; Hodgeman's brother went into the house with me and the other men, Ward, Rodger's, and several others came in at one o'clock - my master's name is Kelly, he works for Sheppard and Co. - we left Ward and Rodgers there; Hodgeman's brother and I came away together, the prisoner had come there to ask if I could tell him of a job, as he knew there was an empty frame at our shop; he came out with us about five minutes after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you positively swear he was there from a little before twelve o'clock till past two - A. Yes, my Lord; he was in the house all the time; I called for a pot of beer and some bread and cheese for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this - A. Friday or Saturday. His brother told me of this on the week following - I said I would speak what I knew.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am a glass-cutter; he lived in Lambeth-walk. I cannot say where he lived at the time he was charged with this offence. Last Thursday or Friday fortnight, he was in company with me and Grose, from twelve o'clock till past two, at a house in Macclesfield-street, Newport-market; it joins Gerrard-street - the house is kept by Herring.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there so long - A. My master had hurt his eye, and the doctor came to dress it at twelve o'clock, so we could get no work, and went to dinner; he was with us both days; I had some beef steaks and gave him some, and some bread and cheese - I think Grose had salt beef; Grose and I went in together, and he came in directly after, he came to ask my master for a job on both days.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have given him an answer on Thursday - A. I could not see my master to give him an answer, We often go to dinner at twelve o'clock; I do not know why we went the other day.</p>

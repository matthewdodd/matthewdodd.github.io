               <p>On the 21st of March I discovered some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220104"></xptr>leather concealed in my cellar, I was determined to find out who took it; I had at that time two shopmen and an apprentice; on the 24th of March, when Delves was at breakfast, one of the pieces of leather was missing; on the 1st of April a second piece was missing, and I discovered one piece taken on the 16th of April; I lost a piece of inner sole leather, value three-pence halfpenny, from under a board in the cellar, where it had been concealed, I suppose by the person who took it away, it had been taken from the shop; I searched the house of the prisoner, where there was a great deal of other leather, as well as that very piece, which I know to be my own; there was one skin in particular I could swear to; there was a mark of 71 in red chalk on one; on that I had the prisoner taken up; there was a dog skin marked R. M. which I had some knowlege of; I asked him where he bought that skin; he told me he bought it at Alderman Newman's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had this man been your foreman? - About four year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>You know he had carried on some business for himself? - I told him I had heard something of it, and that I would turn him away if he did so.</p>
               <p>I believe you found at his house several manufactured shoes, so that it seems he had not followed your injunctions? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>I believe you know that he dealt with your currier? - Yes, I had heard it.</p>

               <p>Have you heard he was about to set up in your neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near was the situation he intended to set up to your shop? - One within seven or eight doors, the other in Cow-lane.</p>
               <p>The prisoner hath, I believe a wife and three children? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I may venture to ask you whether he was not a very industrious and honest man till this happened? - He was, and I kept him for his honesty.</p>
               <p>He had such an impediment in his speech that he was a great hindrance in your shop, but his honesty got the better of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What a good thing then he hath somebody to talk for him now, as he cannot talk for himself; had you not somebody else in your service whom you know had pilfered you? - No.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he was more a pilferer than the word imports? - The boy once went to buy something, and he charged me more than he gave for it.</p>
               <p>This boy is still continued in your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect your foreman more than this boy? - He was not my foreman.</p>
               <p>How came you to acknowledge him such before, who looked after your business when you was from home? - Either of my men.</p>
               <p>What quantity of manufactured shoes did you find in the prisoner's room? - About one or two and twenty pair.</p>
               <p>Were any of these your property? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>On your oath, did you not know they were not your's? - They were not.</p>
               <p>How happened it that you let this piece of leather lay so long; did you look at it every day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which was the first, taking the man up, or getting the warrant? - I first got the warrant.</p>
               <p>It was something about the size of this book, and the value about the price of a pot of beer? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was that the room where the work was carried on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All you have produced you are sure you found there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to take the shoes? - I had an order before the Alderman to take care of all the things.</p>
               <p>Are you the person that was tried for a misdemeanor on the city of London? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are not tried yet? - No, that has nothing to do with this.</p>
               <p>But it has to do with your character, it certainly must be for some good, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Miller. Can you pick out any of that leather you yourself can swear to? - Yes, this piece I can swear to.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - There is an odd kind of a stain upon it, which was on it when it was under the board.</p>
               <p>Were the letters on it now, on it when it was under the board? - No, I put it on it to know it again when it was brought on trial.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that, if you was certain it was yours? - Some person stood by advised me so to do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mumby. I know this was mine once; I really believe it is the piece I sold to Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Did you never sell any of that parcel to any other person but Mr. Miller? - I think not, but I cannot say positive; but I am sure it was never retailed out of my shop, but it was sold in a lot.</p>

               <p>Are you able to say this sole was sold to Mr. Miller, or some other person? - I am certain it was sold to Mr. Miller, because I save all I get of that price for Mr. Miller for this twelve-month last past.</p>

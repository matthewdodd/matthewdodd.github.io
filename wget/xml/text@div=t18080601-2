               <p>Q. You are the only person concerned in the business of this shop. - A. Yes; I have a little son and a servant girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it your house was robbed. - A. On Tuesday the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your house been broken into before the 1st of March. - A. Yes; on the the Wednesday evening before that a square of glass was broke or cut through; I lost on the Wednesday, two caps, two silk handkerchiefs, a stock stiffner, and about thirty five yards of British lace. On the Tuesday morning following that, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, from the information the servant girl gave me, I perceived the same pane of glass broken, which had been repaired.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the same pane taken out, or broken. - A. It was not all taken out; it was broken, and about half out; I missed a plad handkerchief which laid against the glass.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the colour of the handkerchief. - A. A green and dark blue; I had seen it the evening before lying near the pane of glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning. - A. A quarter before eight: my servant girl got up before me, she saw nothing of it; I saw nothing of it; the neighbours gave me to understand that I was robbed and that they knew the parties.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was a quarter before eight o'clock when you discovered the window had been broken. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was quite light at that time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>LEITH DUNBAR. Q. You live at Ratcliffe Highway, do you. - A. Yes; I am a cooper. On Tuesday the 1st of March, a quarter before eight, I came down stairs with intent to go to work; as I was coming I saw two men standing at Mrs. Milton's window; the prisoner was one; I stopped at the watchhouse; the prisoner looked very hard at me; they both went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from you when you first saw them. - A. It was about three doors off where I first saw them; they turned up another street; they came back in about a minute or two; they looked very hard at me again.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood where you was. - A. Yes.</p>

            , he is a crown witness; the prisoner at the bar I knew before; they looked hard at me again and went away again; they came back again to Mrs. Milton's shop; in the mean time. I shut the door and went into the lock up house and looked through the iron grating at the end of the lock up house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lock up house on the same side of the way as Mrs. Milton's - A. There is only a pavement of about a yard and a half wide between it and the houses adjoining Mrs. Milton's; after I stood there some time, I saw the two prisoners there again; I saw them trying to force the windows in with their thumbs, both of them; the prisoner went about four doors off; there were two or three people coming by; a milkman came by with his pails; the prisoner went down with him towards Shadwell, about twenty doors off; they got out of my sight; while I was gone Nathan Levi turned round and missed him; in about a minute and a half after he missed him he saw him coming towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him too. - A. Yes. They both came to the window again, they both tried the pane of glass with their thumbs again as they did before; I saw the prisoner take and put his hand into his pocket; I could not observe any thing that he had in his hand, they both stood close together. I heard the window in about half a minute crack; they both walked away directly.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see either of them put their hands to their pockets after you heard the crack did you. - A. No. When they walked away I went out of the watch-house and crossed over the way to the public house; I told a gentleman that these two men, that were over the way had broke a window; they came back to the window while I was at the public house, and forced a piece of the window in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of them or one. - A. Both of them together; I saw

               <p>Q. Do you know who had given the alarm to them. - A. Yes; Mr. Ayres went out of the public house where I was and told them; in about five minutes after that I went to Mrs. Milton's shop. I perceived the window was broken, and one or two handkerchiefs were rumpled; Mrs. Milton came into the shop, I asked her if she had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of Mrs. Milton's family in the shop during the time this was done. - A. No; after it was done the servant girl came out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know this, do you, whether the window was broke before they came up to it. - A. No, I could not; it was a bow window, and this was one of the farther side.</p>

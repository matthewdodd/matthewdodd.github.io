On the 5th of September, about ten o'clock in the evening I saw my harness in the cow-house; I missed it about six o'clock next morning. I saw the witness Hills on a Saturday, about a fortnight after, and went to the prisoner Cane's shop, in about three hours after that - he keeps a shop next door to the Cherry Tree public-house, Kingsland-road - it is a sort of harness shop, and he deals in marine-stores. Cane was in the shop - I asked if he could suit me with a good second-hand harness; he said he might, but it wanted looking out; I said if he could I should feel obliged; he asked where I lived; I said, at Enfield-highway, and I would call again - he asked when- I said in a week or two, or perhaps next week. I went again on the Monday, and asked if he had got it - he said, "Are you the young man that lives at Enfield-highway?" I said Yes - he then showed me one saddle, and asked if that would suit me; I said No; he showed me two more, to which I objected; he then showed me my own - I immediately recognised it, but the four W's were taken off, and four brass-plates put on in their places; there was no other alteration in it; I saw a friend pass, and said, "There is a friend I want to speak to" - I went and told him to send me an officer - I waited in the shop; two officers came: I said, "I want you to take charge of this, which I lost about a month ago" - and said to Cane, "You may as well fetch up all, it will make it better for you;" he then brought up all except the reins; I asked how much he might give for it; he said 12s., and that he had bought it of two young men whom he did not know; he had said he should expect about 2l. of me for the set of harness; the reins were found behind a door, which divides the shop from the parlour; he was then taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Hills? A. He is ostler at the Thatched House, Islington. I told him if he could do any thing in it I should be obliged; I knew him from having formerly lived next door to him for seventeen years; I thought he might get information, as he lived near town - I applied to every body to look out; I said I would give him a sovereign if he could get it, as I knew Camplin was a noted thief, and I suspected him; I did not give him the sovereign; it depends on how he swears to day; if I get my harness back I will pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him the result of the trial depended on his fixing the guilt on one of these parties? A. No - he is the only witness against Camplin; he knows I shall not pay him unless I get it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Unless he does the business well to day, he will not get the sovereign? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cane showed you several saddles? A. Yes. I found all my harness there - it is common to hang reins behind a door; I have not found the four W's - I did not lose the collar.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Thatched House, Islington. Ward spoke to me about his harness; I saw Camplin on the Friday following, I think - I said, "There is some disturbance about Ward's harness - do you know any thing of it?" he said, "Yes - we collared all but the collar;" I said, "Sometimes I may have such things myself - where is the best place to get rid of them?" he said, "Somewhere near the Cherry Tree, Kingsland-road, but the old b - r will not give much for it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not care about it? A. I had known Ward seventeen years, and he had said if I could get information he would satisfy me; he said nothing about giving me 10l. - I would not take it if he did; he said he would not mind a sovereign if he could find it; I would take that. I expect to be satisfied for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not your expectation of the sovereign depend on the prisoners being convicted? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of October I was in the Kingsland-road, with Holt; we went to Cane's, where I saw Mr. Ward, who said he had been robbed of some harness about a month ago, and that a saddle which laid there was his; we desired Cane to fetch up the rest, which he did - he might be half an hour fetching it all from different parts of the house; he produced all but the collar and reins; he said he bought it of two men for 12s. - that he might know the men perhaps, if they were brought to him. I found the reins behind the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were there not other reins there? A. Yes; his boy was afterwards brought, to see if he could identify Camplin, but he could not - he said two men sold it, and he could identify them.</p>

            . I am a saddler and harness-maker, and live at Hackney. I have known Cane three or four years; he bore the character of an honest respectable man; harness sells for less money about Michaelmas than in the spring - it would not fetch above half as much; if this harness had been brought to me without the brass, to be repaired before I could sell it, it would not be worth above 12s.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What would you make such a harness for? A. Two pounds, twelve shillings; if it had been a gig harness it would be worth more; it is a cart harness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 12, Michael-place, Brompton. I knew the deceased, Mr. William Marcooley—I saw him a few days before his death—I was attending a child of his—I was not attending him particularly—he complained of a pain in his chest and stomach, and I advised him to have a dose of castor oil next day or the day after, if he did not feel better, and to have a mustard poultice—he was about thirty-five years old, I should say—he was living at No. 6, Brunswick-place, Brompton—I did not see him any more until 27th Dec, when I was called in about 10 or a quarter to 10 o'clock in the morning—I then found him on the ground, convulsed, and apparently dying, senseless, unconscious, and gasping—I applied ammonia, and the usual remedies, and the stomach pump with-out effect—the stomach pump would not act—I remained with him until he died—it was not until after his death that I found out the cause of it—I then perceived a bottle containing some prussic acid, and a small portion of castor oil; less than a teaspoonful altogether; the rest had been swal<lb></lb>lowed—I took it from a table into the room—I put it in my pocket, and afterwards examined it—I detected it first by smelling it—there was no difficulty in detecting what it was—I opened the bottle directly after his death—I analysed the contents, and afterwards Mr. Rodgers did so—upon the analysis I detected the presence of prussic acid—two drops gave a sufficient test of the presence of prussic acid—I could detect it perfectly—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion the prussic acid was the cause of death—that is my positive opinion—there can be no doubt of it—I did not find much prussic acid in the inside—it is very volatile.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of William Marcooley, of No. 6, Brunswick-place, Brompton. On 27th Dec. he was unwell, and I sent for some castor oil-—I directed the servant Jane Beer to send for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, without giving her any direction as to the shop that she was to go to—it was brought back to me about 9 o'clock, in a small phial—I poured it into a tumbler, and my husband took it off the table—there was a little brandy in the tumbler, which he had put in himself—before the brandy was put in the tumbler had been washed out, and was perfectly clean—as soon as he had taken it he observed that it tasted very bitter, and I walked to the door and called another servant, Sophia Fowles, to inquire if the bottle was clean, and before she bad, time to come up, he fell on the floor, and he never spoke afterwards—Dr. Cahill was sent for, and Dr. Christian subsequently, and a surgeon—my husband died about half an hour after he had taken the castor oil—I had not seen the phial which contained the castor oil that morning, but I had seen it before, it was kept in the larder—it had previously con<lb></lb>tained a draught which had come from Dr. Cahill—I had no prussic acid in the house, or anything of that nature—I saw Dr. Cahill take the bottle from the table, which contained a remnant of castor oil—that was the same bottle from which my husband had taken the castor oil.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and lecturer on chemistry. I received the bottle with some small portion of castor oil—I analysed the contents, and found prussic acid in it—if that bottle had been half full, judging from the proportions I found, there would have been about eighty minims, nearly a drachm and a half—that would be a great deal more than sufficient to cause death—twenty minims is considered to be a fatal dose—I analysed the contents of the stomach, and detected prussic acid there, but not sufficient to account for death—it was tested on the 4th, death having occurred on the 27th—it is a very volatile spirit, it requires great care to preserve it from evapora<lb></lb>tion—I received another bottle, which I have here; it contains a lotion—I analysed the remains of it; I detected merely a trace of prussic acid in it—the analysis for prussic acid is extremely accurate—I should not have the slightest difficulty in detecting a very small portion, I could detect the thou<lb></lb>sandth part of a grain—I detected merely a trace; nothing that you could weigh or measure—the quantity I found in the castor oil bottle corresponded with one minim of Scheele's acid—I was speaking of Scheele's strength when I spoke of twenty minims causing death—a minim is considered to be the bulk of one grain of water—supposing two drachms to have been put into the other bottle, there must necessarily have been more prussic acid than I detected—hydrocyanic acid is used by druggists in two strengths, one according to the Pharmacopoeia, and one an old acid, known as Scheele's strength—hydrocyanic acid is synonymous with prussic acid—that is the general term.</p>

               <p>chemist's assistant before that, I believe, for three years—it was his duty to dispense medicines, and occasionally to serve retail customers, under my superintendence—he was so employed on 27th Dec.—the whole of the poisons are kept in a small cupboard on the left hand side of the shop near the door, and are all labelled "Poison"—the hydrocyanic acid was in that cupboard that morning—I cannot tell what the red bottle would be which the boy has spoken of as being taken from a shelf opposite the door—I did not see it, not being in the shop at the time—the prescription contained wine of opium—I should judge that that bottle contained wine of opium, but I cannot say positively—that is of a red colour—that bottle is kept on a shelf opposite the door—the castor oil is kept on a shelf to the left of the door, where all the oils are kept—that is a sort of yellow white, nearly white—the wine of opium bottle is a small eight ounce bottle; the castor oil bottle is a quart bottle, with a tin cap to it—in making up the prescription he would also use elder flower water, which is a three pint bottle; that is at the left hand side of the door—a cash book, day book, and prescription book were always kept in the shop.</p>

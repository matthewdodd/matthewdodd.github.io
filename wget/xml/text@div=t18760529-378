On Sunday Morning 16th April, about 2.45, I went with Peek another constable to the garden of 431, Mile End Road, there was a man in the garden sitting on the step of the house—he was either unconscious or asleep—I shook him ank rubbed him till he came to—while rousing him the prisoner came in at the front gate, 2 or 3 others were with him—he wanted, to know the number of the house—I asked him what he wanted to know that for, he said he insisted on knowing the number I told him it was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—seeing that he was drunk I requested him to go away and not interfere with me in the execution of my duty—I asked where he lived, he said "Here" I said "If you live here, go in and hen I shall see he the Said that he lived higher up—I said Where" he said "In Jubilee Street," I again told him to go away—he then caught told of the man we had in eustody to pull him away—Igot inside the gate when the prisoner struggled with me violently—I had my gloves on and finding I could not hold him I slipped my right hand glove off and was in</p>

I live at 6, Chaiinelsea Court—on the morning of 16th April I was in the Mile End Road; I saw Peek there—my attention was called to a man lying on a gentleman's doorstep—Horne came up after<lb></lb>wards, and he rubbed him and brought him to—he was bringing him down the garden to lock him up for being there for an unlawful purpose, the pri<lb></lb>soner and two others came up and asked Horne what he was going to do with him, he said to lock him up for being there for an unlawful purpose—he told Horne that he lived in that house—he said if he did why did he want to know the number (he had demanded the number)—Horne brought him up to the door and turned his bull's eye on it, and then he said "I will lock you up for interfering with me in the execution of my duty"—the prisoner then turned and knocked Horne down twice, and afterwards he knocked a woman down in the path and ran away—I made after him and caught him, he got away, I captured him again and gave him into custody to 604—Horne struck him him once with his truncheon, but not very heavily, he was very violent and used threatening language to me—he was very excited—I don't know whether he was in liquor—the blows he struckr Horne were very hard, I should not like to have as hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Kent House, Bow—I was at the station-house when, Horne came in—he had a wound, over the left eye brow about three-quarters of an inch long—both the nasal bones on the bridge were fractured and displaced—I replaced them; there was an immense amount of swelling ou both sides the nose, which was twice its natural size, and there was a good deal of blood—he was also suffering from conoussion of the brain, he did not know what was being done to him when he came into the station—he was in most extreme danger, I have been constantly attending him ever since; he has been unable to resume duty indeed he is barely able to come here now—I don't know that he will ever be able to go back to duty—the extreme seriousness of the case other than its remark<lb></lb>able violence was hardly shown till twenty four hours afterwards, when he became delirious for two or three nights—since then the more urgent symptoms have subsided, but he has now all the symptoms of a severely shaken nervous system, constant headache, and he cannot rest at night and all his bodily functions are upset.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had been unwell previous to this, and had only resumed duty about four days; he had caught a cold in the diseharge of his—duty, and that was succeeded by a cough—I should not call him a strong man by any meaus, he is not consumptive—I should doubt whether such an injury could have been inflicted with the naked fist—I have been of that opinion all along, and have said so—the man must be an exceedingly powerful man to smash the nose as he did—the prisoner is a very well-knit man, he is an engineer—the injury to the eyebrow might possibly be cansed by a fall on he gravel, but there was no gravel about the weund, and I think the man fell on the flat of his back—a man struck on the nose would be more likely to fall back than on his face—I, happened to be at the station attending to a wounded prisoner when Horne was brought in, he staggered in and had to be accommodated with a seat—his head is bound up to relieve the throbbing, not for any wound.</p>

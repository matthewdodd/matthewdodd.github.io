                  </hi>. I am a basket-maker, and live at 58, Portpool-lane. On Saturday night, 16th October, I was in Leather-lane about half-past 12 o'clock—there was a disturbance—I was passing by, and went to see what was <hi rend="italic">up</hi>—there was an old woman dressed in black, drunk, and some of the people were insulting her—I said it was a shame to say anything or to hit a drunken woman, and I received a blow which knocked me down—I cannot say who gave it me—I got up, and tried to escape up a turning—I was knocked down, and when I got up again I found a wound on my cheek—I was knocked down several times, and kicked—I cannot say who knocked me down the second time—I was stunned—when I rose, I thought my jaw-bone was broken—my face was all over blood—the blade of a knife was afterwards extracted from my cheek by the surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wood, a cage-maker of 35, Baldwins-gardens—early on Sunday morning the 17th, I and my husband were just going to supper, and I heard a woman screaming—it was about half-past 12 o'clock—my husband ran down stairs, and I followed—when we got to the corner, I saw the prosecutor reeling, as if he was going towards the prisoner—they were round the turning where I live—I saw no one but the prisoner, the prosecutor, my husband, and a boy who lives there—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man I saw—he had a red stripe down hid trousers, and bright buttons up him—he went to run in the shop where I live, after he did it—there was a light in the shop—the prosecutor's face was not bleeding when I got to the top of the turning—he was reeling towards the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner up with his hand at him, and I saw the blade of a knife in his hand—I saw the point of it—the prisoner then ran up the Gardens, and two more followed him—I heard the prisoner say, "I have done for the b—"—they ran through a hole in the wall, which is a passage that comes out into Leather-lane—it was in the face that the prosecutor was struck—the blood came right from his face on to my face, I was so close to him when it was done—I saw the prisoner run up the Gardens, and the other two follow him—they were all three running—I did not see the prisoner again till Monday week—I am positive he is the man, because I looked well at him; he has got on the same coat now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>and the prisoner came and hit the fishman to make him let go—I saw the fishman lay hold of the brother—he was not the man that stabbed the prosecutor—the prisoner was the man that stabbed him—they were not out of my sight before the fishman seized one of them—he seized him directly—the mob had collected then—when they heard the man was stabbed the prisoner's brothers ran over from the mob—I had this man in sight until the time when the fishman seized his brother, and I am sure that the person seized by the fishman was not the man that stabbed the prosecutor; it was the prisoner—the fishman was examined at the first hearing, and he was quite satisfied that he was wrong when he came out of court.</p>

I am the wife of John Redding, of 35, Baldwin-gardens—about half-past 12 on Sunday morning I was in the shop, and I heard a bit of a bother, and ran out to see—it is a butcher's shop—I saw a mob—I saw the young man run that had been stabbed, and then I saw the prisoner—I did not see any one else run, only the prisoner—he ran before the prosecutor, <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and hit him in the face, and the man fell, and afterwards the mob ran up towards him and the prisoner ran away—I saw no more of it—I did not see that he had anything in the shape of a knife in his hand—he had something in his hand; I could not tell what, I was not close enough to him to see—I did not see the prosecutor's face afterwards; I was called into the shop and saw no more of it—three persons ran after the prisoner—I know it was the prisoner, because he had the same things on that he has now; the red stripe down, and the buttons—I saw him next on the Monday following—I say it was the prisoner because he had the jacket with those buttons, and the red stripe on his trousers; the same that he has got on now—I could see the size of the person; it was about the size of the prisoner—he is the man and no other.</p>

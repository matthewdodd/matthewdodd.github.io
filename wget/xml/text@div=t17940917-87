             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a bricklayer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You live next door to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alarmed at this fire which happened on the 4th of September? - Yes, I was alarmed by the watchman, and then by Mrs. Moon's coachman, before I could get my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mrs. Moon's house? - Yes, I went to the forward side of the house, and there I saw a light of a fire; and then I went to the back of the house, and then I saw, as if it was from Mr. Molyneux's house; I then went to Mrs. Moon's house, and I knocked at the door, and there were several more together, I went and when I got up stairs to the upper room, the top gallery, three pair of stairs, which is built of wood work, above the brick work, there I observed a smoak.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better produce the plan of the house if you have it there.</p>
               <p>B. COOPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce the plan of the house.(Produces it) - This is the side of Mrs. Moon's house, that comes against Molyneux's roof, it is weather boarded and painted; in Molyneux's roof there is an aperture of thirty-eight inches in length, and eleven wide, so that any person might get out of Molyneux's house, and command about eighteen inches of Mrs. Moon's house, above where the weather boarding began; this part of Mrs. Moon's house, which come against Molineux's roof, and where the hole was made, has a gutter all covered with lead; when I went to these premises, I went into the man's chamber, Mrs. Moon's servant, which is here in the inside, that was that part of the house that was raised by weather boarding, and, as I understand, was wholly raised after the house was first built, they cannot build in that manner now; I soon discovered by going into the chamber, the mode by which the string was done; I then desired that a carpenter might be sent for with some tools, to take down some timber; the witness, Osborne, came to me, being Mrs. Moon's carpenter; he got into the gutter, and cleared it, for all the materials had been cleared out of Mrs. Moon's into this gutter; on looking at the lower board of the weather boarding, I clearly discovered the mode by which the fire had been communicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be done on purpose or accidentally? - Certainly, on purpose; I had not been there five minutes, before I could determine that perfectly; the board is in court. (Produced.) It has been kept sealed up in this box ever since the time it was taken down by my directions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Did you see these boards taken down? - They were taken down by my orders, and I here wrote on each of them, that I might know them again; these are the bottom boards that lay against the front of the house, weather boards; when I came to look at this boards; I observed that here it was cut away by a knife, and that this board, as well as the other, had been cut in that way; the fire had not got any higher than this, for it went in a sliding direction above this part, by which means the mode in which this was done, was not concealed; this is the bottom board, on which these boards lay, and here is the place where the fire actually commenced; this is the bottom part of the brace, the partition which is shewn by the model, as your worship will see, the slope of it here, and which I have no doubt at all, was burnt by a poker, or red hot iron, because without some additional heat, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170189"></xptr>would not have burnt so rapidly, as to set the whole on fire.</p>
               <p>The jury shewn the model.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Cooper. Did you observe any combustibles inside? - Yes, I did; this man's chest and a portmanteau flood close against where the firing was, the skin of the portmanteau was burnt off, and if it had not been for that, the poor coachman must have been burnt in his bed, for the heat of the plaister had actually burnt the skin of the portmanteau off, and had actually fired the board, so that it was with difficulty they prevented it breaking into the room violently. Here is the piece of a brace which stood in this manner, and which evidently shews to be burnt with a hot iron, or poker, or something of that sort, in order to continue the flame. (the portmanteau produced) There is the back of the portmanteau, if this had not lain very close to the plaistering, it must have been very fatal indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. In what position was Molyneux's house? Was there any fire in that? - None at all. This opening of the roof of Molyneux's house was evidently done from inside, it looked as if the tiling had broke in by something falling on it. When I had got in, this man Osborne, had cut away these different matters, and searched the gutters for things that had been thrown in, I found amongst other things, these, here are some matches, some burnt and some unburnt; here is a piece of tarred oakum or rope that was laying there by it; the roof had all remained just in the same state at the time that I saw it; there was a variety of more, but it was unnecessary to bring a large quantity. In going at another time into the prisoner's house, while I was making the observation of the mode in which a person might get through to the roof, a person desired me to go into the front room, and there was in the front garret this handful of tared junk, in a hole of the plaister stopped, it is oakum very much tared; it was this, but when picked out very fine it made a very large bunch; this was placed between the plaister, and part hanging out between the rafter; if the fire had got to any considerable height here, it must have fell through the roof in Molyneux's house, where there was a quantity of shavings, perfectly clean, and which must have been lain there very recently, because every thing else in his house was very dusty.</p>

               <p>Q. What business is Molyneux? - A mason.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these shavings near the oakum? - No, it appeared as if they had dropped somewhere on the gutter, some lay in the passage loose by the hole, and some partly burnt; it appeared that those that were burnt had fell from this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the burnt shavings and clean together? - The clean ones were in this place, and some clean ones in the passage; but the whole part of the house of Molyneux upper part, was like a gentleman's house, not a particle of dirt all about; the plaister likewise, where this tar junk was set in was evidently cut away, very recently for it lay on the floor, so that it was evidently laid there within a short space of time, it was evidently newly broke; by the mode in which combustible matter had been placed, the fire had ran on each side of the brace, it had burnt both sides of it, and this is a quarter which had been burnt totally about this, and had communicated to a piece called an intenslice, which prevented the progress of the fire; it requires very little examination to see how it began, and what part; in one of these bars, and in another that matches, it proves the hole was cut, and the combustibles dropped in here, and an hot iron<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170190"></xptr>applied to the brace, and the fire was communicated to it underneath by means of this hot iron, or a candle. These boards which came from the bottom is evidently cut with a sharp knife, so as to avoid being heard by making any noise.</p>
               <p>Jury. Supposing any body for a moment might have dropped a candle in, would not that have fired the place? - It appears very evident from every thing that fire had been placed from the outer part, and not from the inner, for there is the mark of some kind of liquid put outside, as that board will shew you considerably.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not that possible to run out of the deal? - The deal was painted, and therefore not very probable; this is the piece of timber that has the appearance of being burnt with the hot iron; it is an outside piece, and the skirting board on the inside was very much burnt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have described pretty accurately the situation of these parts of the premises; according to your observation of the whole in Molyneux's house, how many tiles did there appear to be removed in order for this aperture to be made? - As to the number of tiles I should suppose there were fifty; the aperture was thirty-eight inches, by eleven; but every lath was evidently broke from withinside, and the bottom laths were evidently bent considerably, by a person standing on them to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the tiles placed that were removed? - Merely as they had slipped down, they were in the gutter.</p>

               <p>Q. You of course being called in some time after the fire, other people had seen the situation of the two houses before you come? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. With regard to the aperture, I think you say, that the ceiling of that part was broke through too? - Yes, so that a person might get out of the garret very easily; I could get out myself; I have got out of openings through buildings less than that, many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You certainly seem to have paid a very laudable care in the examination into this business, you say the place where you suppose the fire to have originated, was a place in which a poker might have gone in, because of the appearances of the wood, is it not possible that a knot of the wood might have fallen out, and that to appearance would it not have made a similar mark? - No, it would be quite a different appearance, and when I view the boards, and see the nature of the materials, there is scarcely a knot in them.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to judge from one part of a board whether there may not be knots in the other? - This board was so very near the place if you examine it, you will find it so.</p>
               <p>Q. You observe that this trunk was inside of this aperture? - This chest and trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. And you observe also that on the sloping boards there are marks of something having run out as from that place; might not the appearance be some liquid substance that run out from the inside? Supposing this combustible matter had been placed behind here, would not this liquid naturally have oozed out? - Not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean that this might have oozed out from the boards, but out of the combustible matter? - No, that, is a very different kind of matter; and if it had oozed out of that, it would have had a very different appearance; what is on the boards has the appearance of some kind of strong turpentine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at the time you made the subsequent enquiry, you went to the prisoner's house and found these things? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards? - Six or seven days.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170191"></xptr>Q. In point of fact you found it there a number of days after the fire happened, consequently if he had put it there he might have removed it? - He was taken into custody before.</p>

               <p>Q. That aperture in the prisoner's house was immediately under the place where the fire had been light; and such a one that he might have gone in and out for the purpose of cleansing the gutter? - Yes, for any occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. These premises we have heard are insured? - I have only heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. If this had been done by the prisoner in consequence of a resentemnt, which we have heard of by the learned gentleman that opened the prosecution, to Mrs. Moon, if that resentment had been in his mind, and he had purposed to have done it, would it not have been done with no more execution by first setting fire to his own house? - It would have been less likely, because it is four feet nine inches above his brick wall, where this timber begins.</p>
               <p>Q. Then supposing. Mr. Cooper, the prisoner had purposed doing it, in order to secure to himself the amount of the insurance he had on his house, could he have done it with more effect, and with less probability of discovery, by setting fire to his own house? - I think it would as effectually have fired his own house as if he had done it in this way, for in a very short time it must have fell into his own house, because there were dry shavings, and it must have caught to whatever part of the timber was there, which was very light, and very dry; there is no boards under this place but only joists; and I am only astonished that the ceiling did not fall in, that it did not take fire and run all through the house.</p>

            Was it not possible, and more than probable to suppose, in case he had a mind to consume the building, that he had best to set fire to some part or other of his own house? - If the fire had fell in there through the house, and come in with a body of slame, this tared oakum would have took fire immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he kept any servant? - I never see him till I see him before the magistrate; I knew neither party till I was sent for. I don't know that it is proper for to mention an opinion, but the fire after burning his house would have taken away all suspicion from him, and that, I should hope, was the sole motive.</p>
               <p>Q. You will observe, and the principal ground where upon you have been led to form your opinion, that the fire began outside is, because that in some parts there appears a greater aperture outside than inside. Do not boards sometimes burn uneven according to the quality of the boards? - Certainly.</p>

            you armed on this occasion? Tell us what past? -  The first I heard of it was by the watchman's rattle, I laid just opposite, I got out of bed in my shirt and found Mrs. Moon's house all in flames, it appeared so, I went out and I knocked at Mrs. Moon's door, there was no entrance there, I went to Mr. Molyneux's door and knocked with a brick till I broke it in pieces, then after I knocked at Mr. Molyneux's, I saw the maid at Mrs. Moon's door in her shift, then I spoke to the maid, and I told her that I thought the house was on fire, she said it was not her house, it must be next door, I went next door again and there was no appearance of any body coming, I went over the way, I crossed and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that take up? - I do not think the whole course of time was ten minutes, when I came back I put my coat and waistcoat on and returned, I found the door not opened, then I went up in Mrs. Moon's house, up stairs, where there were three or four people in the room were the servant's bed was, one of the young men that was up there, took the bed from the bedstead and chucked it out of the window into the garden, I looked to see where the bed was a going, and I saw Mrs. Molyneux standing at the bottom of her yard in a bed-gown, which I thought from the appearance that somebody was a washing.</p>

            What age was the child? - About five or six years old, and Mr. Molyneux at the same instant was carrying something towards them, a kind of a bundle, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Molyneux appear as to his dress? - He was dressed in a blue coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he dressed completely? - Yes, as far as I could see of him, he had a coat on, I returned from the window and went towards where this mother appeared, which as soon as the bed stead was turned up, the people pulled away some trunks, and when the trunks were pulled away then the fire was seen through the plaistering; the trunk is in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How close was this to the servant's bed? - There was only a chest that stood between; the chest stood at the feet of the bed. Then I bursted the plaistering and made a hole right through with my hands, and I got a blanket and dipped it in a pail of water, and put it through the hole; as soon as we could assist with water sufficient to pull the fire away, I made a hole in the top of Mrs. Moon's room, which was on fire, and got out into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not put the fire out enough to go out at the window? - I had it put out so far as to go out through the hole but the fire was most generally on the outside, and after I got outside, I got the fire out, by pulling down the boards and the assistance of the people bringing me the water, and when I got out I saw a hole in the roof of Molyneux's house about two feet long and one broad; I perceived that before I was out, in getting through, I stood on the roof of Mr. Molyneux's house, and I pulled off the weather board that was hurning, and by the assistance of water that came, I put the fire out; after it was put out I went through the hole back again, that I had got through before. I went down stairs, and got into Molyneux's yard; the door was open, and I was called in to aid and assist to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing between Mrs. Moon and Molyneux? Did you say any thing to Molyneux, or Molyneux to you? - Not any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Molyneux taken into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the fire had been put out? - Immediately afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had entinguished the fire did you go to Molyneux's house? - Yes; I went into the parlour first.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us every thing you have seen and observed there. - There was a deal table stood against the wall, and there was part of a glass or a kind of frame of a picture hanging on the side of it, and five or six plates in the cupboard. I looked at the fire grate, and there was a piece of wood on the fire about half consumed; there were two tongs at the side of the grate, and two pokers under it. I went from that to the door of the back room, and all that I saw and could find was two hat boxes, one upon the other. No more furniture at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did you see the deal table? - In the parlour a kind of a deal table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs? - I did not; I returned to the garden, and the constable told me to aid and assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in his garden? - Not quite down to the bottom; there was linen and furniture down at the bottom of the garden; and I saw a cradle stand.</p>
               <p>

            How long was it before you got into his house from the time that you came first to Mrs. Moon? - I suppose it was the best part of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What furniture did you see in the garden. - I saw linen and a candle; I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170194"></xptr>Q. Then there may be chairs for what you know? - There might, but I did not perceive any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation when you was about extinguishing the fire in the weather boarding? - Three holes; two of them rather small, and of them a largish hole, that I could put my thumb in; it appeared to me to be made as if a poker or something hot had been run into all the three.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the other two holes? - Not quite so big.</p>

            From the judgement that you formed on the spot, with all the circumstances about you, did it or did it not strike you, that the fire was by these means? - Yes; it appeared to be done with something of a poker or a piece of iron of the same size, burnt in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You observed, that after you perceived this fire, you got up a brick bat, and knocked at both these houses, Mrs. Moon's and Mrs. Molyneux's? - I I knocked at Mrs. Moon's with the knocker.</p>

               <p>Q. Some time after this Mrs. Moon's servant came to the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went into the house, and so out along to the garret, where the fire was particularly observed? - I returned over the way first, where I had lodging, to put my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to this garret, you pushed out a parcel of these boards that were on fire? - No, when I came up, there was a young man putting a bed out of window.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact. You pushed something out of window; you pushed against these boards that were on fire, of consequence part of these boards must have fallen down into the gutter, and likewise all these things might have fallen down with the boards for any thing you know? I take it for granted, that pulling out these boards made a number of holes or apertures in these boards? - It was a part that I pushed out where I had seen these holes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man in his garden, saving some of his furniture? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said something about a piece of wood in the parlour grate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was no danger to be apprehended from that. You asked for a light I understand? - I was not the first person that entered Mrs. Moon's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask for a light there? - I did not.</p>

            After you had rapped at these doors, and after you had gone back to your own house, and came back again, you then observed, that the prisoner was endeayouring to save his furniture; and that his wife and children were at the end of the garden, and also endeavouring to carry away furniture? - No, his wife and children were not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you the least idea that your pushing against these boards could have occasioned these three holes? - Not in the least.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed on this night by the watchman; I got up into Mrs. Moon's apartment; I looked about, and see no fire, but smoke; I got out at the front window, which was the garret, and went on the parapet to Mrs. Molyneux's gable, and got to the ridge of the gable end, and there I saw the fire. It had the appearance to be lighted on the outside in three places.</p>
               <p>Court to Emery. What occasion had you to make a hole? - Because we could not get into the gutter without getting down six or eight feet.</p>
               <p>Banks. I went out of this window to see where the fire was; I goes then from this place again into Mrs. Moon, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170195"></xptr>told her, it was not Molyneux's house, it was her house, on fire, which I conceived was set on fire; the fire seemed to come from three places; and I then run down to my own house.</p>
               <p>Court to Emery. You saw three holes. How far did they appear apart from each other? - About five or six inches apart.</p>
               <p>Court to Banks. You say the fire appeared to be in three places. At what distance did they appear from each other? - I cannot tell the distance; it looked to be light in three places, and they soon consumed together. After I had been home I came back again, and they seemed to have damped the fire, and I went down again, and told my wife to stop taking the things away, for the fire was mastered. I was employed to point the tiling of her house three or four weeks before this happened; I saw that hole in Molyneux's house on the 14th of August last, because we were above there on her building.</p>

            Was there any thing to cover that hole? - There were two bits of boards put together, and a bar laid across it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these premises after the fire? - Yes; and then the door laid by the side of that hole, when I saw the flames not covering that hole, but by the side of it, I could see the hole plain, I said it was set on fire on the outside, but I cannot say who set it on fire. It was impossible for any body to get into this gutter without a ladder of thirty feet long, or else a person must have come out of Mrs. Moon's premises the way I did, and get down six or eight feet, or else through that hole in Molyneux's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You seem very positive that this fire must have been on the outside. You cannot be positive sure? - Yes, I am. I saw it burning outside, and not within, and nothing but smoke in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem also to have said, with not a little emphasis, that when you perceived the fire, you was at your own house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's house is between you and Mrs. Moon's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, when you went to the prisoner's house, ask for a light? - No, I never went into his house at all.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it must have been set on fire on the outside. Could they get there from your house? - No, they could not; there are no parapets, they are old houses.</p>

            What was the circumstance that happened to take your attention? - I was going to bed, which is the general hour I go to bed, and my family likewise; before I get to bed, I always make it a constant rule to look out at my bedroom window, to see that all is safe; and when I was looking out, I see the prisoner Molyneux with a lighted candle in his hand passing to and fro, from a little wash-house that adjoins his dwelling to the further end of the shed, at the bottom of his garden, and some person with him, who appeared as a woman, I apprehended he meant to move off, and go away. The shed stands in a narrow place, about the width of this table; there was some person with him, by the hand it appeared to me to be a woman's; and I only see the hand, handing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170196"></xptr>things to him; it struck me at that time he was moving off. I rather was curious in seeing what he meant to do; it obliged me to fit up till almost two or three o'clock; I missed him several times in the night, and I saw a light glimmering in some part of his windows, sometimes in the back part of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more particular strike you? - I was apprehensive, my stable being broke open before.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge now is whether that man set fire to your house; he is not charged with any one thing beside, therefore do not tell us of any suspicion. - I do not know any thing about that.</p>

            What is your family? - Myself, one maid servant, and one man servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the family of the prisoner consists of? - He has a wife and two children, the oldest about four, and other about two, both girls.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was alarmed by the cry of fire what did you? - When the watchman knocked at my door I instantly got out of bed, and I said, Holt, what is the matter, he said there is a fire next door; and as I was running to my next room, I called to my servants directly to go down and open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did the fire make this apperance? - In the room where the boy slept, and the adjoining room, where my maid slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room yourself? - No; all was done by other people that came in when the door was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man, or his wife, any farther than living adjoining to them? - He went away two years and a half from the premises; in his absence the children were always still and quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of going into the house, to see how the furniture was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Molyneux at all that morning? - After some neighbours had got into the yard, and they seemed not very hasty in taking him, I said, Oh! you wretch, you have done it, for I have watched you till three or four o'clock this morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they either of them make any answer to you? - None at all.</p>

               <p>Q. It seems so, because the very moment you called them they came down stairs; I take it for granted they could not be very fast asleep at the time you called them. You say you don't know any thing of these people before, only neighbours? - No, only neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact you never had paid a debt for the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did.</p>

            Then how can you pretend to say, that you never knew them before? - I have got no further to say, than that they only asked me that favour.</p>
               <p>Court to the Counsel. She told you that she did not know any harm of them, and that they behaved peaceably before, and you are not satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Have you ever gone to the prisoner's house since he left it. - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you ever remember having any conversation with the wife of the prisoner at that time? - I went to speak to her, and I gave three shillings and sixpence for the rellef of her and her children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to this woman, that if you did not convict the prisoner for this indictment, that you would prefer some other against him, and endeavour to transport him? - No, not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any thing like it? - I do not recollect.</p>

He went down stairs, and I went down after him; with that, my mistress gave me the keys, and told me to go down stairs, and open the street door; with that, when I got to my mistress's door, my mistress said, Mary, they don't hear at the next door; with that my mistress rattled the rattle out of window, and I went to mistress's room window, and looked out, and there I saw Mrs. Molyneux standing in the yard, and her little girl Nancy by the side of her; she was quite perfectly dressed, had on a black stuff gown, quite dressed, with a round eared cap, with a little bow knot.

            What time was you alarmed? - About twenty minutes past four, as near as I can recollect. I went to the spot; I immediately went up Mrs. Moon's stairs into the garret where the fire was supposed to have communicated. On inspection of the premises a very violent suspicion was immediately impressed on my mind that it was the effect of design beyond all question. I went down stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170200"></xptr>went into Mr. Molyneux's house and saw a woman in the yard, and found it was Mrs. Molyneux; she was with her two children, and seemed to have some kind of bed clothes in the yard. I enquired where her husband was? she informed me he was in the house. In searching for him I was informed that he was up stairs shewing one or two persons the premises. As soon as I got to him I immediately gave him in charge to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or he to you? - Nothing, only which is Mr. Molyneux? I am, says he, I gave him charge, and the constable took him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the house, whether there were articles of furniture about in different places? - I examined the house very minutely, and that confirmed my suspicion; out of nine rooms there were seven compleatly empty.</p>
               <p>

            What were the articles that you noticed in these rooms? - In the one pair of stairs there was one bed, in a very miserable condition; it seemed to have been a post bed, but there were no posts, and the bedding in a confused state, as if it was wrapped up with the intention of being taken out, and a broken chair or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any box that you directed to be opened? - Yes, it was in the back kitchen. I afterwards went into the back kitchen, there I saw a box; I directed it to be opened, and found it full of clean linen, and removed from the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How large might it be? - Considerable large, as much as two men with difficulty could carry; the linen all clean, and packed in that box that stood in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observations of what there might be there, or in the shed? - I went into the shed that communicates with the back kitchen, and found there some china; there was a trunk which I directed to be opened, and found it contained his papers; he is a professional man as an engineer; paper and other things of considerable value; and in that shed there was a door through which it could have been conveyed if there had been any apprehension of the fire spreading: all these things could have been conveyed through that door without any difficulty into the garden.</p>

               <p>Q. Out of the garden could they have been conveyed? - O, yes! Indeed his wife begged that the greatest care might be taken of these papers, because they belonged to her husband, and they were of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time you did not hold any conversation with him? - Not at all. I desired immediately another constable to go with him, because I felt it my duty to have the woman apprehended also, and desired that no communication might pass between the man and his wife till they were brought to a Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was taken to the watch house? - She was in charge of a constable, and in the course of the day taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. When you saw the house on fire; undoubtedly you was angry and irritated, supposing a man capable of doing such a transaction? - The fire was extinguished before I arrived.</p>

            Still resentment continued? - No. I never knew the man, I thought it my duty to act wherever a suspicion would have harboured in my mind, I would have taken you up if I had any ground for suspicion, but I had no agitation of mind than what arose entirely in the mind of any man.</p>
               <p>Court. You see these things ready to be removed and packed; was there any thing in the appearance of these things which led you to think they might not all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170201"></xptr>he put in that condition in the course of a few hours? Might not the linen be packed in that trunk, and the china be so placed in the course of half an hour, if they knew there was a fire in the house, and they wanted to remove them? - From the time that the fire was said to happen, and from the time that I was in the house, there might be time, but it appears to me there were people in the house a quarter of an hour before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not these things he packed up in the course of half an hour? - I think they might.</p>

I went to the prisoner's house on the occasion of this fire; the fire was extinguished when I got to the prisoner's house, I got up stairs before Mr. Thirlwall came to the house, when I first went into the house, the prisoner at the bar was in the yard just at the back door, our night constable was standing by. I asked the night constable if they had been up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - I suppose it was about twenty minutes, or half past four, and the prisoner came into the kitchen and struck a light.</p>

            ; the prisoner was in the garden, and he went into the kitchen and got the tinder box, and began to strike a light; they had none when I went in, and with his striking a light, I said Mr. Molyneux I wish you would make haste; the answer was, I will make as much haste as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not day break? - It was light.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you want a light for? - To go up stairs; he got a light, and I desired the prisoner to walk up first, and he did; and the night constable I desired to follow him; I then followed the night constable; I looked into each room as I went up stairs, the first, second, and third floor; as I turned to look into the room on the third floor, somebody says, here is the room where the fire has been, I turned myself short round and see a hole cut in the roof of the house between two rafters, the lath and plaistering cut away just opposite where the fire was on the third story over the landing place, I then went to the place and put myself out of the hole, and see where the fire had been, I immediately turned round, and I said to the prisoner, Mr. Molyneux, what was this hole for?</p>
               <p>Court. You observed this hole in the rafters? - Between two rafters, the lath and plaistering cut away, and the tiles off, I then asked the prisoner what that hole was for? he told me to go out to repair the top of the house, or words to that effect. I told him Mr. Molyneux this has a very bad appearance, and much about that time Mr. Thirlwall came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Molyneux make you answer to that observation? - No answer at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. I believe the prisoner got this light when you desired it? - He did not hurry about it, he did get it.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon and apothecary, I went to the prisoner's house this day. On Thursday morning, a little after four o'clock, my bell rang very violently, I got out to my window, and they told me there was a fire in Mr. Moon's, or the next door to it. When I went to Molyneux's, the door was just opened, and the night constable and several more going in; they had requested Molyneux to strike a light which he hesitated very much about.</p>
               <p>Q. You desired him? - No, he was desired, not by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take the light with him? - He took the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him up stairs? - I, and the night constable, and him altogether went up stairs. We looked on the first floor, went into the room on the first floor; there was nothing particular there; we then went up to the second floor, there was nothing particular there; he then made a stand, and hesitated about going up further, saying, how there was nothing more to be seen than what we see there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the fire was out? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the fire to be out at the time? - They told me the fire was just extinguished.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you persist in going up stairs not with standing this? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing else when you did persist in this? - I don't recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go up stairs? - He went up stairs; we went up to the upper story immediately, on the landing place we discovered a hole big enough for a person to get out; some one person asked him for what purpose that hole was made; he answered it was for repairing the house. He was then asked how long it had been there? - he first said two months, then on being asked by somebody else, he said three or four months, we see then evidently through that hole where the fire had been applied.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe particularly the appearance of the hole. - The hole was made in the roof, between two joists, against, it there was a gutter, and at the other side of the gutter was Mrs. Moon's house weather board, at the bottom of which there appeared to be some holes made for some reason or other, apparently by some hot iron, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner and his wife and children at that time? did they appear to be dreft? - They were.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I took the prisoner to the watch house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner while he was going to the watch-house? - Not between me, it was between his wife and him. After the constable was given charge he charged me to aid and assist. I went into the yard with him; he said he wanted something to say to his wife; when he got to her he told her that he was going to the watch house, and as soon as the people were gone out of the place to shut the door up and come with him to the watch-house; he then went, as if he was going out to the road, and he then went back again and asked her for some money; she gave him a shilling, and then he went out; as he was turning again she said this is all through you; he immediately turned back, and says this is not a time to have any words.</p>
               <p>Jury to Emery. I wish to know whether that stick that you saw in the grate, in the parlour, was on fire? - It was not to my appearance; it appeared to have been on fire, and about half consumed; but it was not on fire then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it warm? - I did not feel.</p>

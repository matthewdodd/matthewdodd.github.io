               <p>I am not an apprentice to Mr. Lavally, I live with him, I have done so these four years; at this time I was alone in the shop, and the prisoner came in and asked for a pair of shoes; I got up and served him with a pair of shoes, I went and shewed him three pair, he tells me they would not do, he asked me the price of them, I told him, he said that would not do; I hangs them up, and he pushes to the other counter, and I think he took up the shoes and put them under his coat; I did not rightly see the man, he went strait forward to the counter, after I had hung up the shoes, and immediately he goes out of the shop and never says any thing; these were other shoes, not those that I hung up; I did not miss the shoes till the man was gone; I saw the shoes lay about half an hour before on the counter, four pair, I missed them immediately, I looks about, and I runs out after the man, and another gentleman caught him; I hallooed out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he caught from your shop? - I cannot rightly tell, it is a little short street and he was quite at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was the person stopt? - He was, I think he was the person that had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean to say I think? - I cannot rightly tell whether that is the person, because he is quite in a different dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that was stopped in the street, the same man that had been in the shop? - Yes, it was the very same I am sure of that, I knew it was then, but his dress is different now; another man brought in the shoes, I did not see them till the other man brought them in.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 1st day of February, eight o'clock at night, I ran out and I saw a crowd coming back again, I asked what was the matter? they said that the prisoner at the bar had thrown down some shoes just by the shop window; I have a cheesemonger's shop in the same street, and a little from my shop window the way that he ran, I found a pair of shoes in the kennel, I took a candle and looked, this might be about an hundred yards from Lavally's shop or better; some body looked round and they saw two more pair, and another person brought one pair; neither of these are here; the boy came and told me they were his master's; I knew where Mr. Lavally lived, and I took them to his master, the boy claimed them at once, and he said the man that the other had hold of, was the man that stole them; when I went into the shop I gave them to the master, the master wished me to appear the next day; I appeared, and gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>There is one thing which I wish to inform your lordship; the prisoner'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200138"></xptr>friends has been treating with the prosecutor, and got him to take a bribe, I believe the prosecutor was innocent in taking it, but he has given it back.</p>
               <p>Court. He was excessively wrong in taking of it.</p>
               <p>- PEARSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was standing in my shop and I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran out; I ran after the prisoner, I saw him running and by some means he fell down off the pavement, he was running as from the shop of the prosecutor; and I laid hold of him and pulled him up on his legs, and brought him to the light and looked at him; and when there was plenty of people round him, I went into my shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your shop to Mr. Lavally's? - Nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy at that time insist that that was the man, that had been in the shop? - I don't know. I did not go into the shop; that is the same man that he was running after, he was crying stop thief.</p>

               <p>The constable who had him in possession he has likewise took a bribe, he has taken ten shillings of the prisoner's wife, his name is Kettle.</p>
               <p>Court to the Clerk. If there is any recognizance of Kettle's let it be estreated.</p>
               <p>Court to Lavally. How came you to commit such an offence? - The constable told me it was right.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had kept the money, you would have been in as bad a condition as that man there. (The shoes produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Pearson. At the time of going before the Grand Jury, the constable and another advised the boy not to say what he did at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going on some business of my father's in Poultney-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran and they detained me for it, that is all that I have got to say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

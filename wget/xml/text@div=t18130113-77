I lost the halfpence on the 14th of December, about a quarter past seven in the evening; I was in the back-parlour. I had not been in the parlour a minute when I saw two boys; one of them was on the counter. I came out, and asked them what they wanted. They made an excuse. I said, I suspected they wanted to rob me. They said, no, they did not. I opened the door for them to go out; one of them ran away. I catched hold of the prisoner. He dropped a paper of halfpence on the door way. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should like to know whether the halfpence belonged to him.</p>

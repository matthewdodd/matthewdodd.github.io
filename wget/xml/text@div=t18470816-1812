                  </hi> I keep the Globe-tavern, in Bow-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner formerly lived with me as under-waiter in the Hay-market—he has since applied to me on several occasions to take him again, and I took him on the 4th of July—it was his business to receive money from the customer's to pay in checks to the barmaid, and to account afterwards—on the 10th of July I found that he was gone—I counted the checks which he had paid in the day before, and they amounted to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he had not accounted for—on the 12th of July he came to my house—he said he had been to Norwood and spent my money,</p>

               <p>and he would pay me—I gave him into custody—he was paid by the cus<lb></lb>tomers, and I told him if he were not satisfied I would give money, but my waiters get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and are better off than I am myself—he told me when he came there that he had no work, and was in great distress—I said I would employ him if I could—he is clever—he speaks French very well, and is a good cook—I took him, and he asked me to let him have two or three shillings—he came; and went on very well, till he absconded—he has sent me letters, saying he is very sorry for what he has done, and hoping I would be merciful to him.</p>

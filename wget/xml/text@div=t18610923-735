                  </hi>. I am a superintendent of police—I took the prisoner—a gentleman named Russell pointed him out, having a warrant for his apprehension for robbing Mr. Kearcs—the prisoner was driving in four<lb></lb>wheeled pony-chaise in High-street, Margate, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—three others were with him; two appeared to be young gentlemon, and one was a sailor.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left the ship <hi rend="italic">Ada</hi> on, I think, Thursday; I paid as much of the freight as I could, and had a balance left in my hands of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I went to my lodging with the full intention of putting the money in a drawer, but I went away in a hurry and forgot to take the money out of my pocket. I then went up to Oxford-street, had supper, and then went down to the Haymarket; whilst there I went into Mr. Isaac's and met Miss Graham; I recollect being there and drinking—besides what I had from Mr. Kearns, I had about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a few shillings in my pocket, of my own; from that time to the following Monday, I was in such a state that I was not master of myself during any part of the time. On the Tuesday I left Miss Graham, having only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket; how the other went I cannot tell; I had a slight attack of delirium tremens, and I went to Mr. Makiva, a friend, to ask his advice, being very unhappy; in a day or two afterwards, when I got better, I wrote a letter to Mr. Kearns. As to the bill of lading, I most solemnly swear I did not know it was in the pocket-book; I then wrote to Mr. Hudson, a gentleman who was stopping at Margate; I knew an old sailor down there who knew me and my family very well for many years; I wrote to him to search Mr. Hudson out; I got rather anxious at the end of the week; Mr. Makiva thought I had better go down myself and see after it; he went down with me; we missed the train that we were going by and took the steam-packet; when we got there we went to the Ship hotel and had something. I saw the sailor, and he told me that his mate had taken the letter to Mr. Hudson, who gave him a shilling, and said all right, be would attend to it. We then took a trap, intending to go and see Mr. Hudson and then to catch the train to come back directly to London to Mr. Kearns; to show that I had no intention of taking the money, the day before that I had 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Kearns in my possession, and the next day probably I should have had a great deal more. Mr. McDonald can prove that I started for Margate on the Sunday morning; Whilst I was at the station-house at Margate, Mr. Hudson came to see me with his cheque-book in his hand, but the officer that was with me, not knowing the case, would not let him see me.</p>

I live at 101, Westmorland-street—McDonald's house—you expressed a great desire to go down to Margate to see your godfather, in order to get some money from him to pay Mr. Kearns the money which you had either lost or stolen—you were very ill indeed while you were at the house with me—you tried every means, as far as I could tell, to get the money.</p>

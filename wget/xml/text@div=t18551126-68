                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser, of London, and live at Wanstead. On Sunday, 18th Nov., from a quarter to half past 10 o'clock, I had three tame goats turned out in the forest—I received information about half past 10 o'clock, went into the forest, and found the prisoner taking a sack from round the goat's neck—it was about 400 yards from where I had last seen it safe—I could see the prisoner taking it off, through the bushes before I got up—I saw him move—the goat was trying to get away—I said, "Halloo, my man! what are you doing with that goat?"—he said, "It is my goat, I brought it from my uncle's at Woodford Bridge, and am taking it to Lea Bridge"—I told him I would soon settle that, and would take him to the station house—I took him there, we had to wait some time for a policeman to arrive—he began crying, called me on one side, and said, "Mr. Evans, I stole the goat; pray forgive me, for the sake of my mother"—I found that his mother had been dead some time previously—I am sure it was my goat—it was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live at Wanstead. On Sunday morning, 18th Oct., I was in the forest on my way to church, and saw the prisoner leading a goat by the side of the path, with a sack tied round his neck, and a handkerchief tied to the sack—I knew the goat to be Mr. Evans's, and said to the prisoner, "That is Mr. Evans's goat, what are you going to do with it?"—he said that it was his goat, he had brought it from Woodford. Bridge, from his uncle's, and was going to take it to Lea Bridge—another boy, Benjamin Gouldstone, then came up and said to me, "That is Mr. Evans's goat," and called me on one side and said, "You stop here, and I will go and tell Mr. Evans"—he left, and the goat went into the forest, and the prisoner followed it—he had not let it go at liberty, he let go of it, and caught it again, and then Mr. Evans came up and caught hold of the prisoner, and took him to the station—I did not hear what took place between Mr. Evans and the prisoner.</p>

On the 1st of September the prisoner purchased a piece of beef, and paid 1s. 8 1/2d. for it -I had been watching him - he brought in one piece to be weighed, but had taken two off; I saw him put the other piece in his jacket - when he had walked out I followed, and took him into custody; I found the other piece of beef on him, tied in a handkerchief - it weighed 3 lbs. 2 ozs. - I knew it from its appearance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop I asked him what it was a pound - he said 7 1/2d.; I said, "If I take two bits will you let me have them for 7d.?" he said No - I took one piece, and put it into the scale; he then said, "You shall have the two pieces for 7d.;" he said they came to 3s. 9d. - I gave him two half-crowns, and he gave me 1s. 3d. out. Witness. It is not true; I never sold him the two pieces - he brought it under his coat, and did not pay for it.</p>

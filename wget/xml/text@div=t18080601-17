               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, a married man and perfectly sober, to go to her apartment - A. I cannot give any account for it. After I was in her apartment some time I found her hand in my pocket; I found that she had taken a one pound bank note, and two seven shilling pieces; when she took her hand out I told her that she had robbed me of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. That I suppose was no more than you expected - A. Yes, people do not expect to be robbed. I told her that she had robbed me of a one pound note and two seven shilling pieces, I saw her stoop down and put something into her stocking; I asked her to take her stocking off to see whether she had the quantity of money there that I had lost; she pulled the stocking down and one seven shilling piece fell out she put her foot upon it; I got it away; I asked her for the remainder, she immediately took up a poker and knocked me down. I got up and took the poker away from her; then she took a knife out of her pocket. she swore she would stick me if I offered to say another word. I got the knife away from her after some time, then she called three or four men's names and put the candle out, and by the assistance of these men I suppose she was got out through a trap door into the street; it was sometime before I could find my way out; the room was down stairs; they shut the door below. I was obliged to go up stairs and go out that way; when I got out in the street I saw the prisoner standing with some men; I saw the patrol, I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any man in her room did you - A. No. She was taken to the watchhouse, nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you loose after all - A. One pound note and two seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. I perceive according to your own account, you were strong enough to resist her upon different occasions that you have mentioned, I want to know how you came to let her take the money away - A. I could not prevent it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were strong enough to take the knife away, then why could not you take the money from her; you have indicted her for her life, by taking violently and forcibly from you. I want to know why you did not prevent her from taking it. - A. I could not.</p>

            . I am a patrol. In going my round I heard a great noise in Parker street, Drury lane; when I came there, there were from fifty to a hundred people; I saw the prisoner in the crowd; the prosecutor came out of the house he had been confined in, he gave charge of the prisoner for assaulting and robbing of him, his face was scratched and tore as if with nails and all over blood; the blow of the poker was under his hat. I took the woman to the watchhouse, she was searched, I found nothing on her but to the amount of sixpence. The prosecutor had a seven shilling piece that he said he took from the woman after she robbed him, and he had the open knife that he took from the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober - A. He was sober; he told the constable where he lived, and that he had a wife and family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you my lord about eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010017"></xptr>o'clock at night I went for a kettle of water at Queen-street pump, this man asked me to go to a public house; he said I should have something to drink; I said, no; he followed me home, he asked me to go for something to drink; he said he had four children and a wife, he gave me a shilling, I went for a quartern of gin, and I went down stairs; he said, I am robbed; he opened his breeches and there fell out a seven shilling piece; I said I have a right to half of that; he took me by the neck and said he would kill me; he half choaked me; he was half intoxicated. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When you saw this woman first, had she her kettle or any thing with water in her hand - A. No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children have you. - A. Four; I never told her; I have five now; I had four then.</p>
               <p>Baxter. She might have heard the constable examine him; he examined him as strict as he did her.</p>

I had in my pocket the money mentioned in the indictment and more, I counted it over there; then we went to the prison's house again: she took my hat and wig from my head, and threw my wig in my face; while I stooped to take it up, she ran me backwards against her bed; I fell down on it, and she upon me; I felt her hand in my pocket, the candle was put out before. She rose up and dropped a guinea on the floor; she said she would go for a farthing candle. I stooped down to look for the guinea, and she slew out of the house. Then I felt and found I was robbed of my money, the same as in the indictment, (mentioning them by name)</p>

            . The prisoner and I were at supper; she asked him to eat; he did, then the prisoner and I went out and left Poll Barry and him together; after that Poll went home, he came to the public-house to us, and pulled his money out and told it, but I do not know how much there was of it. Then we went home again, and he and the prisoner sell to play; she beat his hat off, and said he should not have it till he had paid for the use of the room; they were on the bed together; she got off, and said there was a halfpenny sell, and she must go and get a candle: she went out; he then called the watchman in, and there they found a guinea on the floor.</p>

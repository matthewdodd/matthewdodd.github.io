Turner used to come to our house, at times; we suspected her; she was taken up, and she confessed she had taken them, and in what manner she had sold them; this was last Monday: she said the other prisoner took the things of her, as she gave them to her out at the window.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane; the prisoner, Turner, sold this tub to me: she brought flocks, at three several times, and linnen and woolen rags: I buy old rags, old iron, and old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not bring you sheets?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. Upon my oath she did not: she brought nothing but rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a pillow?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. There was; they came as rags, and went as rags.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the tub?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. I gave a groat for it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Heath. These things are not what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mason. What do you mean by bringing that parcal here?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. These are the same things that the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring a flock bed to you?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. She brought a tick, with some flocks in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Heath. She has brought 40 lb. of flocks, and mine weighed but twenty; these are not mine: mine were as white as snow; these are dirty things.</p>

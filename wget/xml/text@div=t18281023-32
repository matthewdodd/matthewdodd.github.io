            . I am a watchman. I was on duty in Wentworth-street, between eleven and twelve o'clock last Tuesday night, and heard the prosecutor cry Watch! and Murder! I was about eighty yards off; I came down as quick as possible: Jones said he had been knocked down and robbed - the prisoner then directly ran away; I followed him into Sugar Loaf-court, Essex-street, Whitechapel, and there found him lying on a dust-bin, as if he were asleep - I took him, knowing him to be the man that Jones had pointed out; he feigned to be asleep - there was no other person up the court, it is not a thoroughfare; I never had him out of sight, till he turned into the court - he was down on the bin, pretending to be asleep, in a moment; Jones was quite sober; the prisoner seemed the worse for liquor, but could run very well - I found no money on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home intoxicated, heard the watchman called and ran away; the watchman laid hold of me - Jones was drunk when he came to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>EDWARD JONES. I had only had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you not been drinking in the same public-house as me, all the evening? A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>

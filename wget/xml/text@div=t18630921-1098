                  </hi>. I am manager of the Royal Liver Friendly Society—the trustees of that society are Mr. Gregg Rathbone, Mr. Rawlins, and Mr. M'Gregor—the prisoner has been in the employment of that society for about five years and a half—his duties were to go round and collect the mem<lb></lb>bers' subscriptions, and bring them to the office in New Bridge-street—that was the course of duty prescribed for him by the rules of the society—he has acted by those rules during the time he has been in the employ—he was paid a nominal salary of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 25 per cent for collect<lb></lb>ing—his earnings at the present time averaged about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—when a collector commences in our society his duty is to solicit parties to become members, and when they are enrolled his duty is to call upon them once a week, or once a fortnight at longest, and receive their subscriptions; to place on their cards the amount he receives, and also to enter the same amount in corresponding columns in a book—the cards are held by the members as their receipt and claim on the society—on 28th July he has entered on Russell's card 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received, and in the book it is only 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 11th August he has entered 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received from Kidd, and on Kidd's card 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been connected with this society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two and a half years—I was previously connected with a kindred society in Liverpool—at the time I joined this society Mr. Swann was the chairman, and he is now—it was not he who gave the prisoner into custody; I believe it was Mr. Liversedge—he is not here—he was before the Alderman, but was not examined—I was present when he was given in charge—before that I told him that his accounts were not cor<lb></lb>rect</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186309210021"></xptr>
               <p>—he did not reply, "Well, that may be so, but I am quite willing to go over them, and to call upon any of the members you please"—he at first refused to go with me—he did not offer to go over his accounts with me; he offered to call on any of the members—I told him to go to the nearest—I opened the books, and said "Now, let us go to these"—amongst them were Kidd and Russell—the prisoner accompanied me there—the name of "John Murphy" on these cards is the prisoner's writing—the amounts he receives are entered in figures—the cards are printed for every Monday—the 27th July was on a Monday, but he received Russell's money on the 28th, and in the same way with Kidd's—these books are in the prisoner's writing—6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered to Russell on the 27th July—Kidd's is in the same book—they live in the same street—these payments are made fortnightly—the clo<lb></lb>lector collects every day, and is bound to pay in the money he receives every week, on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—the prisoner always paid his money in on Friday—he would hare to collect from about 1,200 names during the week, all in small amounts of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that ought to be done without mistake, and we expect it to be so—I have not yet found that any of the collectors have ever made a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> mistake—I have been a collector; I was a collector at Liverpool—I never made a mistake while I was a collector there to my knowledge—I am not aware that it was ever alleged—I believe every book I held corresponded with my cards, as every collector's ought to do—I was with the Liverpool Society in 1860—I left them in 1860—there was no allegation of any mistake on my part—I left them to come over to this society—the Liverpool Board of Management heard that I was coming here, and demanded all my books—I believe the party who is the instigator of these questions is the man that got me dismissed, Mr. John Lawrence—the managers did not complain of my mode of collection; they complained of my not paying over the money to them—I did withhold the money until I was satisfied about turning over to the Liver Society, and I withheld the books also—that was made the subject of inquiry in a court of justice, and they punished me for refusing to give up the books—I was not convicted of embezzling the money of the society—I do not owe them a farthing, nor did I when I left—I was charged with the money that I held up to the time of appearing in court—I believe it was a criminal proceeding—I was indicted—the result was a penalty of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or three months' imprisonment, according to the Act of Parliament—I did not pay the fine, I suffered the three months, and I would again—there was no charge of any wrong entries—I did not know the prisoner at that time—when I came to the London Society the Board of management here appointed me—Mr. Stevenson was then the secre<lb></lb>tary, he is now the treasurer, and secretary too, I believe; he is not the pre<lb></lb>sident—I am the manager of the London district—I do not receive 25 per cent, on the collection—the collectors, on obtaining new members, are per<lb></lb>mitted to retain the whole of the first six weeks' subscription; that is, besides the 25 per cent.—that is supposed to be an equivalent for getting the new member—I am paid by a salary—the secretary and treasurer are paid in the same ratio—I do not know what they get; their salary is appointed by the general public meeting.</p>

ABEL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it come to the ears of the Liverpool society that you were in treaty to leave them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that gave rise to the ill-feeling—I was a collector of that society seventeen years—there is no pre<lb></lb>tence for saying that I appropriated the funds of that society—I retained the books in order to turn all the members over to the Liver Society—it was at Mr. Lawrence's suggestion that I did so—he was then secretary to the Liver</p>

               <p>Society—he is not now—he has been dismissed, and now he wishes this to be brought before the public for the benefit of the society with which he is now connected—notwithstanding the charge made against me, I was appointed by the management of the Liver Society, with a full knowledge of what had occurred in the other society—the sums which the prisoner is charged with taking from Kidd were not part of the first six weeks' subscrip<lb></lb>tion; he has been a member two or three years.</p>

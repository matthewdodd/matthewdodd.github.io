            . I am a drawing-instrument maker, but having no employment, I drive a cab. I was on the rank in the Strand - the prisoner came and asked what I would take him to Exeter-hall for, and back to Chancery-lane - as he came back he asked me to drive him about to different places, where he said his master had sent him - I drove him about for thirteen days or a fortnight; he paid me for it - he told me Mr. Crofts was his master; I drove him once to Stratford, Kennington, and Chelsea, and different places - the most I received from him at one time was 6s.; he generally appeared to have plenty of money - I know nothing of the 10l. note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you driven a cab? A. About three months - he paid me 6s. one Saturday night for taking him to Stratford, over the second bridge; I waited for him at the end of the bridge - I once took him to Kennington, where he said he had a letter to deliver; he always had a letter with him, which he said he was to deliver - I at last suspected something; I told him I had rather not carry him any more, for I was afraid I should get into trouble - I have often driven him to his master's door; I asked him if his master was at home - the other boy used to come to the door when he jumped into the cab, and I, of course, thought all was right - he once changed a sovereign - I never gave him a bad half-crown.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was sent for and took charge of the prisoner in the shop; I found 22s. 6d. on him in silver, a 10l. Bank note, and a purse in his right-hand trousers pocket - he said he found the note under Mr. Crofts' writing-desk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say so in Mr. Croft's presence? A. Yes, he said he found it under the counter, loud enough for Mr. Crofts to hear.</p>
               <p>MR. CROFTS. I can distinctly swear to the note; he said at Bow-street that he found it on the desk, rolled up.</p>

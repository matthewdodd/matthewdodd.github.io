               <p>Smith. After the cargoe is deliver'd, that which is left, trod under foot, we call sweepings. I took up Neal, and he confessed receiving it, and that he sold it to a Dutchman, whose name he refused to mention. This was all before Justice Fielding, in my hearing.

I asked him if the Captain had given him liberty so to do? he said no, he had not: after Neal was taken up, he acknowledged he gave the mate a thirty-six shilling piece, two guineas, and a half guinea for it; one acknowledged the paying the the money, and the other receiving of it.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Captain Smith; Neal us'd to come on board early in the morning, and would get the hatches open; the mate had the care of them. I have seen sacks tied up, which they have taken away full of something, I cannot tell what. They put log-wood dust in just at the top. Neal told me to say nothing of what I saw, and he would give me a coat.</p>
               <p>Ford's defence.</p>
               <p>I sent some log-wood and sweepings on shore by Neal; the Captain bid me do what I pleased with it, and I got two guineas of Neal for it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cockeril. When you saw these sacks taken away, was the ship delivered of her cargoe?</p>
               <p>Cockeril. No, we was not got to the second tier.</p>
               <p>Neal's defence.</p>
               <p>I never promis'd him a coat, nor no such thing. It is customary in the river Thames, for the mate to have the sweepings of the sugar; this man had money bid for them, I said I would give him as much as any body; accordingly, he let me have the preference.</p>
               <p>Ford. I desire my Captain may be examined to my character.</p>
               <p>Smith. He always behaved well 'till this; I had always a good opinion of him; I have trusted him with money, and found him always just 'till now.</p>

               <p>Price. I cannot say I have ever heard he committed any felony in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>

               <p>Q. How does he get his livelihood?</p>
               <p>Golding. He was a chair-man at the other end of the town, I knew him there, and I knew him since he came down to the waterside.</p>

               <p>A witness. I have known Neal sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Answer. He is an honest man, he ow'd me money, and paid me honestly; he works at chair-carrying and coal-heaving.</p>
               <p>A witness. I have known him seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Answer. He is very honest and just, he pays every body twenty shillings to the pound; he has carried lords and ladies, and when he could not get work he went to coal-heaving; I once belonged to a ship; I have known sweepings to be given to the mate; it a customary thing in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call sweepings?</p>
               <p>Answer. That which is trod under foot, and not fit to be put into the cask again, for fear it should spoil the rest; if the officers thought it would pay duty they would never leave it there, but carry it to the Custom-House.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there is a great quantity of sugar on board, and before the sugars are delivered, and some falls to the ground without being trod upon, would you call that sweepings?</p>
               <p>Answer. No! no! I don't call that sweepings: that is to be put into the cask again.</p>
               <p>Neal. I have a great many witnesses in court for me, but I am afraid they are gone home.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday, 18th July, I went away and left my house in my sister's charge—I returned on the Tuesday night, at 12.30, and called at my sister's and got the key—I just lifted the latch, went to the back-door, lit a candle, and saw the prisoner and two men, who have been con<lb></lb>victed, standing in the lumber-room, at the back of the wash-house, with their backs towards me—I asked them what they were doing there—they immediately blew out the light, and tried to escape—I stepped back to the door, bolted it, and called "Police!"—the prisoner tried to pull me from the door, but I pushed him back—Priddeaux then put his arm round my throat, and held me while the prisoner and Smith escaped—Priddeaux then went out—I saw a constable, and gave him the names of the three—I knew them all—my sister came back with me, and missed some money from a box, which was broken open—the house is in Lambeth.</p>

I took the prisoner on 20th November, at the "Prince of Wales" beer-shop—I had been looking for him a con<lb></lb>derable time—I told him I was going to apprehend him for being concerned, with two others, in breaking into the house he was then in—he said "All right!"—on the way to the station he said "I was drove into it"—the other two have been convicted at Guildford Assizes.</p>

I said "You cannot; the house is closed." They left me and went back; I went to see where they were; the gate was open, and I went in and found them, and Mr. Wood came. I did not know what they were going to do.</p>

               <p>in about 5 or half-past, and asked for some bacon—I served him with half a pound, which came to 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him change, and he left the shop—I put the shilling in the till; there was no other shilling there—a few minutes after he left, Mr. Byatt, a butcher who lives in New-cut came in—from something he said to me, I looked in the till and took out the shilling I had just put in—I examined it and found it bad—I put it by itself on a shelf—in about a half or three-quarters of an hour the prisoner came again—I saw him when he came in—I knew him again—I spoke to my husband and called his attention to him—I saw my husband serve him—the prisoner gave him a half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—on the evening of Tuesday, the 7th, at half-past 5, I saw the prisoner at my house—my wife made a communication to me when he came in—the prisoner asked to be served with some pork chops—I served him—they weighed just a pound, which was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a half-crown—as soon as he put it down on the counter I said, "This is a bad one, you are the same man who was here half an hour ago with this bad shilling"—he said, "No, I am sure I was not"—I then sent for a constable—just before the constable came he said, "Well, here is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to square it, you are not the man to hurt me," and he threw down a good two-shilling piece—the constable came in, and took him in custody—I gave the constable the half-crown, and also the shilling from the till which my wife says she took from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If I gave her a bad shilling, it is not likely I should go and offer him a bad half-crown, I said, "Well, I have been drinking in a public-house not far from here, but I know where I took that bad half-crown." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You did not say anything of that—you denied being in the shop before—you did not say that you knew where you had taken the half-crown, and that if I would send a policeman with you you would show him where you took it.</p>

I am barman at the New Inn, Westminster-road, which is, I should think, about a dozen yards from the New-cut—on Tuesday, 7th January, the prisoner came there about from half-past 4 to 5 in the evening—I served him with a pint of porter, which was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I noticed it was bad, broke it in two, and put one piece on the counter—I told him it was a bad one—he did not say anything—he took up the piece that I put on the counter, put it in his pocket, and gave me a good</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Tuesday I took my money where I had been at work. I went to have something to drink; a woman came in while I was drinking, and asked the barman to give her change for a half-crown. He said, "I cannot;" I said, "Well, I will oblige you," and I gave her five six<lb></lb>pences for the half-crown, which I put in my pocket along with some other money which I had. I came out about 5 o'clock, and as I was going towards home the pork-butcher asked mo what I would like to buy. I had a pound of pork chops, which he said I could have for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; his wife said, "You have been in the shop before, and given me a bad shilling." If I had been there before, is it likely I should have given him a bad half-crown? I was never there before in my life, nor was I in the public-house before. They gave their evidence at the Court that I was in their shop on Wednesday evening, the 8th, when at that time I was in Horsmonger-lane gaol. I was taken on the 7th.</p>

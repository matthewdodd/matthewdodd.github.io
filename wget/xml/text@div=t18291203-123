               <p>JOHN CRAWLEY LITTLE. I am a Police-constable. On the 1st of December I was at Mr. Dobree's, a pawnbroker, in Oxford-street, on business, and the prisoner came in to pledge a piece of velvet; he was asked his address, and gave John Wells, 27, Well-street, Oxford-street - the pawnbroker said he must make a mistake, for he knew the people at No. 27; I then stepped round to the side box, where he was, and told him he must go with me to No. 27, and see if it was correct; he went as far as the door, then told me it was of no use knocking, for he knew nobody there - I asked how he came by the velvet; he said, "To tell you the truth, the fact is, I went home with a young woman last night, gave her a sovereign, and she gave me this velvet, as she had no change to give me, and I thought a sovereign was too much for her:" I said he must go to the watch-house, and on the road he begged me very hard not to handcuff him, or lay hold of his collar - I allowed him to walk by my side, and he ran away some distance; I hallooed, and he was stopped - I overtook and secured him; I searched him at Marylebone office, and found three new silk handkerchiefs in his pocket - I went next morning to Mr. Eyles, and searched a box, which the shopman pointed out as his, in his bed-room, and found four silk handkerchiefs, two gauze scarfs two gauze shawls, two gauze handkerchiefs, a pair or two of gloves, and other things: I found eight duplicates in his trunk, and one in his possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you know him? A. Not before; I am certain of his person - he brought the velvet into the boxes, and the silk into the shop.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Gray, pawnbroker of Fleet-street. I have four silk handkerchiefs, and a remnant of silk - two of them were pawned by the prisoner, on the 24th of October, and the 25th of November; I did not take the others in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known him before? A. No; I cannot swear to all our customers, but recollect taking these articles of him.</p>
               <p>PHILIP EATON. I am a pawnbroker, and live in High Holborn. I have two yards and a half of velvet, and a piece of silk handkerchiefs, pawned on the 26th of November - I believe the prisoner to be the person who pawned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Why do you say he is the man? A. From his appearance; he is rather a remarkable young man - we are not in the habit of serving many so respectable in appearance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many young men have you? A. Eight - three sleep in the prisoner's room; all the clothes in the box are the prisoner's, and as such I believe it to be his box - I have every reason to believe the velvet is mine; here are patterns corresponding with one piece -I bought it of a wholesale dealer; it is a common sort - the handkerchiefs have our shop mark on them; shopmen at times purchase articles, and put them down to their accounts - the prisoner has done so; I am confident these articles are not entered - I have no private mark on any thing but the handkerchiefs: the tickets have come off since they were found - a loose ticket was found in the prisoner's box.</p>

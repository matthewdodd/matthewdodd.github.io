                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 268.) On Monday afternoon, the 16th of March, I saw the prisoner and two other boys in Kirby-street, Poplar—the prisoner had got a bag on his shoulder—I asked what he had got there—he threw the bag down, and they all ran away—I pursued and caught him—the bag remained where it was—I asked him what was in it—he said only a few chips—I examined it, and found it was lead, which I now produce—I asked where he got the lead—he said the two boys asked him to carry the bag—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Papineau, of Albion-wharf, Old Ford. I have examined this lead—to the best of my knowledge, it is my master's—I know it by the holes bored in the bottom of it—I bored them myself because the suction of the pump threw the mud into it—it was at Albion-wharf, Old Ford, in the river Lee, adjoining my master's premises—it goes through the wall of the premises into the river—there was lead gone from that place—it was fixed to my master's premises.</p>

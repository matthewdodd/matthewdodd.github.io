                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, at No. 2, Market-street, Mary-lebone—on Sunday, 3rd December, the prisoner came into my shop and bought some trifling article—she gave me a shilling and a sixpence—the sixpence was placed on the top of the shilling—I put the money in the till, and found a bad shilling on the Monday morning—I think there had been</p>

               <p>another shilling there—I did not take another after she came, but I might before—I was the only person thats served in the shop—I threw the bad shilling into the fire—on 17th December, the prisoner came again, and asked for a piece of pickled pork—she gave me a shilling and a sixpence—the sixpence was placed on the top of the shilling—I gave her a few halfpence change—after she had gone, I examined the till and found a bad shilling—I had not taken any other shilling—I am positive of that—I was the only person that had served in the shop—I nailed that shilling on to the desk—on 24th December, the prisoner came again, between 10 and 11—I recognised her directly she came in—she asked for some pork, and gave me a florin and a shilling placed on the top of it—I told her the florin was bad, and that she had been into the shop before; that this was the third time, and that I should give her into custody—she said she had not been in the shop before—I said I could swear she had—I sent for a constable, and gave him the shilling of the 17th, and the florin of the 24th—my father asked her where she lived—she said, "I sha'n't tell you."</p>

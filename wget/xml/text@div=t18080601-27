               <p>Q. When was it this happened. - A. On Friday the 13th of May, between the hours of three and five; the constable brought the prisoners in; he took from one of the prisoner's bosom seven yards and half of lace, which was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner - A. No.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PEACHCY. I am shopwoman to Mr. James on Holborn hill. On Friday the 13th of May, between the hours of three and five in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into the shop, the youngest of them asked for ribbon; the lace box was on the counter, she took up some lace and asked me the price of it; I told them it was too dear for them. I took up some other lace and told them the price; they asked me if I had none cheaper; I told one of them no; one of them walked out of the shop and the other followed; I did not shew them any ribbons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else in the shop - A. There were three or four customers on the other side of the shop, Mr. James and a shopman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there - A. Three months.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had looked pretty sharp you might have seen what passed - A. I was paying attention to my business.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing done by them to take off your attention - A. I looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not send you to the other end of the shop to get lace - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the women - A. Yes.</p>

            , Newport street. On the 13th of May I was coming by Mr. James's door, I saw one of the prisoners drop part of the lace; she picked it up and walked on a few steps, and the other prisoner came up by the side of her; she gave the lace to her, and walked across the way; she went as far as Swan yard, and the other followed her; I went into Mr. Jame's shop, and told the shopman of it; the shopman and I followed them, I pointed to him the person that had got the lace, her name is Martin; she run across the street to Fleet market; we brought her back to Mr. James's shop; a constable going by brought Lyons; I could see the lace in Martin's bosom, she took it out in Mr. James's shop.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified)</p>
               <p>Martin's Defence. I went into that gentleman's shop to buy a quarter of an ounce of thread; a tall young woman served me, not that lady; at the corner of Fleet market I picked up the lace, close by the grocer's shop, and a young man tapped me on the shoulder, he said I had picked up something that did not belong to me; I said if it belonged to him he might have it; the street keeper came up to me and took me; I never saw this young woman before; she came up when somebody catched hold of her.</p>
               <p>Lyon's Defence. My mother goes out with a barrow; I asked her if she would buy me a ribbon; yes - she said, when she came home if she had money enough; she had not money enough, I went and pledged something for a shilling; I was coming by Mr. James's shop, I asked the price of ribbon, they told me; coming out of the shop I saw a mob at the corner of Fleet market, I went over and somebody laid hold of me, and said I was the person that was in the shop too; this young woman, I never saw her before to my knowledge; I know no more about it than any of you do.</p>
               <p>Lyon called no witness to character.</p>
               <p>Martin called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . On Friday evening, the 28th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw Lacey, Newman, and another with Coles, who was very drunk, and had had a fall; they were in Turnmill-street - I saw Lacey turn up the skirt of Coles' coat, and take from his pocket a handkerchief, which he delivered to Newman; they went round Clerkenwell-close, and when they got to Corporation-lane I met a watchman, and told him; Lacey was then taken, and locked up; as I returned I saw Newman with a different hat to the one he used to wear, which he was offering for sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. What description of boy was the other? A. He said he was an apprentice - he was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

            . On the evening of the 28th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the three prisoners and Coles in Cowcross-street - he was very tipsy, and had a desperate fall; he dropped the umbrella out of his hand; it rolled into the kennel - I saw Wright pick it up, and walk by the side of Coles, and then go down a court by a public-house. I then saw Lacey, Newman, and another follow Coles, and at the corner of Clerkenwell-close I saw Lacey take the handkerchief, and by the New Prison Newman took Coles' hat off his head, and put his own hat on Coles' head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Hey, of Coppice-row. I knew Wright, by seeing him on Clerkenwell-green - he had the same dress he has now - I was not a yard from him - there was light by the public-house; he put the umbrella under his arm. I never stated that he had light-coloured trousers on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WRIGHT. He stated at the office that the boy who ran away took the handkerchief and umbrella? Witness. No, I did not; he took up the umbrella, and put it under his arm; he then turned into a court, as if he was unlocking a door, I thought, and two children followed him. The prosecutor was quite senseless; Lacey took hold of him, and was dragging him along; Newman took his hat off.</p>

               <p>NEWMAN's Defence. I met two or three people selling the hat - one man said, "Look at it?" I said, "What do you want for it?" he said 2s. 6d. and my old hat.</p>

On the 13th of February the prisoner was finishing the last floor, I said, Davey, you have got boards enough to finish this floor, he said he should want one; there was nobody employed in finishing the floor but him. I found boards put away in a private place; I marked four of them, they remained in the place till the 27th; I found them gone in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must only enquire about them - on the afternoon of the 27th you found four boards gone away - what is the worth of the four boards. - A. About three shillings and six pence; I went with the constable to the prisoner's room, there I found the boards which I had put the private mark on, they were in the fire place; the prisoner said he had had the boards a long time before he came to work for me; I saw the private mark on them; he had planed them over, but not so as to take out the private mark.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

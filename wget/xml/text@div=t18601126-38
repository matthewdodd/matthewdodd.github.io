I am the wife of James Mead—he is a labourer, living at Hammond's-cottages, Lea-bridge—I know the prisoner, she came to live with me—I don't know what day of the month she came—I think it was about two or three months before she was confined, as near as I can judge—after she had been with me about two months she was delivered of a male child, at my house—Mr. Brook, the surgeon, delivered her—she continued to live at my house until the 28th of August—she lived there till 27th with the baby, and went away on 28th herself—before she left, I used to wash and dress the child—it was a very healthy child—I noticed a mark on its little navel, it was a sort of mark of a finger or thumb—red—it was what is called a mother's mark—on 27th August, between 11 and 12 in the morning, the prisoner went out with the child—she said she was going to meet her sister at Paddington station, for her to take the child down into the country to bring it up for her—she said it was a sister-in-law, her brother's wife—she did not tell me where she lived—I washed and dresbed the child that morning—it was then quite well and in good health—it was dressed in a little spotted dress, and flannel petticoat sewn with black cotton, and little worsted shoes (<hi rend="italic">looking at some clothes produced by the inspector</hi>)—this is the dress she took the baby away in; this is the flannel petticoat; I tacked it with black cotton myself the morning they went away; it is on it now—this pinafore is marked B., the child had it on;—I did not mark it—these are the shoes, they had but this one button on</p>

On 19th September, I went to the privy at the back of the house; it is about six or seven yards from the house—you go along the garden to it—there is a man's shed behind it, another water-closet, but they do not touch each other—there are open fields beyond that, back and front—there is a wooden fencing—persons can get to that field at the back from the high road, and a person could get from the field into the garden, so as to go to the privy, without any difficulty—it was between 10 and 11 in the morning when I went to the privy—I saw there the body of a male child; it was lying with its legs upwards, and opposite the door as I went in—it was covered over with mess, all but the legs, I could see them—I had used the privy before, since the prisoner left, but I never noticed anything before—when I saw it, I sent for my husband and a police-constable, and they came and got the child out—it was quite naked and the left arm was off, just before you get to the shoulder—I did not notice any mark on that day—I next saw the child before the jury—the arm was taken off higher up than where the vaccination mark was on the prisoner's child—when I saw the body at the inquest, I noticed a mark on its navel—it was a similar mark to that which was on the prisoner's child—the child looked very much like the prisoner's child—the prisoner said she had named the child William Augustus Bryant—that was the name it was</p>

I knew the prisoner when she was living at Mr. Mead's—I delivered her of a male child on 26th June, and attended her during her confinement—it was a fine, full-grown child, and in very good health—I vaccinated it on 11th August, on the left arm, near the shoulder—I saw the child again on 18th August—it was to be brought to me that morning, and from its not coming I went down in the evening and saw it, and took some lymph from it—the wound had not healed at that time, there was a beautiful vesicle, finely formed—I think that was about the last time I saw the child—if I did see it again, I don't recollect it—it was in very good health on 18th August—I saw the child after that, when it was taken-from the privy, I was sent for to examine the body—I saw that the left arm had been removed above the place where I had made the vaccine mark—being a very fine grown child, had I not delivered her of it I should have supposed it to have been about three months old—I cannot say positively from the examination of the child whether it was the same child; it was so greatly decomposed, and the muscles of the face were so swollen, I could not recognise it—I did not make the post<lb></lb>mortem examination.</p>

               <p>of a male child, at the Homerton workhouse—the body was considerably bloated and discoloured—it was apparently the body of a fine, well developed child—I could not exactly tell its age, but from the circumstances attending my examination, I could do so nearly—the head was very much bloated, and the body also, but not so much so as the head—it was of a livid colour, but in parts it had been stained by the soil of the privy—the livid colour arose from the stains of the soil to a great extent, it was not from decom-position or putrefaction—the eyes were considerably protruded, not sunk in as is usually the case with dead persons—the ears and the nose were compressed, as were also the lips—the nose appeared to have been violently compressed—the tongue was swollen and livid—the tissues of the mouth were far gone in decomposition, and eaten by maggots—the gums had separated readily from the jaw—the left arm had been removed within about an inch of the shoulder joint—the wound of the integuments was jagged, it appeared to have been cut by a moderately sharp instrument—the surface of the stump was considerably decomposed, and also maggot-eaten—it was a conical wound slanting from the skiu to the bone—the bone had, been apparently broken across about an inch below the head of the bone, and was splintered against the chest—the large artery was but very slightly contracted at the orifice, and contained no blood—there were three cuts through the skin, within a very short distance of the edge; one towards the chest on the inner side, and two on the opposite side—those cuts were parallel with the edge of the flaps of skin in each—the amputation was by a circular incision, and in a line with that incision were these cuts, parallel to the edge of the skin—I did not see the arm, it being lost, but the edges of the skin remained—each of them were five-eighths of an inch in length, and they gaped but very slightly—the left side of the chest contained a quantity of bloody fluid—both lungs were extremely solid and shrunken, and of a deep livid colour—the right lung sunk very readily into water, and, as far as I could judge, was entirely free from air—a portion of the left lung sunk half way, it was about the same specific gravity; it sunk slightly, but did not fall to the bottom of the vessel—on examining the ribs, I found that the second rib was cut through at the angle, which was against the I wound made in the amputation of the arm on the left side—the heart was I rather flabby, that might have been from the post mortem changes, and with the vessels, was empty of blood, but the tissues were blood-stained—I then proceeded to examine the abdomen—the mucous membrane of the stomach was of a deep livid colour throughout, and the stomach itself contained a little mucus—in the upper intestines there was a little food and I think some milk; and in the lower intestines, focal matter, the usual contents—the liver was very much congested, and of a deep purple colour—it was also shrunk, as well as the lungs—I examined the brain—the scalp had separated from the skull in consequence of decomposition—on cutting through the scalp at the back of the head, I found a little extravasated blood—the bones of the skull had separated from each other from decomposition, and the two parietal bones over-lapped each other very considerably—the brain was reduced to a pulp—my attention was called to the skin, by the coroner, and I took a portion of the skin of the abdomen, and put it in some river water—I found that that took out the livid marks, and left behind a mark on the right side of the navel—that mark was of a conical shape, the point of the cone being about an inch to the right of the navel, and from thence it took its course downwards and rather outwards, slantingly—it was about three-fourths of an inch broad at its broadest part, and about an inch and three</p>

               <p>quarters long—I subsequently examined the jaws—they contained five milk teeth, and the rudiments of the permanent molar teeth—the milk teeth had not been cut—they were within the jaw—the mark on the abdomen was a dis<lb></lb>coloration of the skin—I believe it to be a congenital mark—that is some<lb></lb>times developed after birth, generally within a few days after, but that is very uncertain—it was a peculiar mark—it was a simple discoloration, not a number of blood vessels as is sometimes seen—there was nutriment in the stomach—some of the conditions of the body, I think, might have been due to post mortem changes, such as the state of the skull, the alight extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood at the back of the head, and the colour of the stomach, but I do not think the state of the lungs could have been the result of post mortem change—my impression was, that the child died from asphyxia, suffocation, whether caused by compression or by drowning, I could not undertake to say—the compression of the nose and lips might possibly have I been caused by the body having been, at some time after death, in contact with some unyielding substance—I did not find any trace of disease in the heart, lungs, or any other part of the body that would account for death—it is very difficult to say whether the arm was removed before or after death, I can only state my impression—my impression is, that the arm was removed immediately after death—I think so, first, because there was nottho retractation of the skin that you would meet with had the amputation been made during life; and secondly, there was no evidence or appearance of clot<lb></lb>ted blood in the neighbourhood of the wound; that, however, might have been removed by the fluid in which the body had evidently been lying for some time; thirdly, from the fact that the wound was through the integuments and it did not gape, it had not retracted, as is usual, if made in a living subject; then the blood vessels being empty, would rather be a reason for thinking that it was immediately after death, still I would not give any force to that, for, as I say, the blood might have been washed away, or removed by post mortem change or decomposition—the vessels being empty would make me think it was done immediately after death, but I would not give any great weight to that opinion—there might have been blood in the vessels, and it might have been removed by decomposition after death—I have described everything that I saw—this frock was shown to me, I think three days after the inquest—I found no marks on it—I submitted it to maceration in distilled water, and I discovered some few blood globules in the water after maceration—I am able to say they were globules of blood, but whether of human blood or not I could not say—I showed the portion of the skin of the abdomen, with the mark on it, before the magistrate, also to the coroner, and some of the witnesses—I did not examine for poison, but as far as my examination went, I found no reason to apprehend that the child had been poisoned.</p>

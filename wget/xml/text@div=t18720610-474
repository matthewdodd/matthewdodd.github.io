                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 311). Last Sunday morning, at 10 o'clock I was called to Blackwall Stairs, and found the prisoner and a boy with her—they were both wet—Waller, who was there, told me something, and I asked the prisoner how she accounted for it—she said that she would make an end of herself and the boy too, she would not be any trouble to anybody—I know the boy, he is her son—she smelt very strongly of liquor—she seemed to have been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman—last Sunday morning I saw the prisoner go down to the shore with a little boy, she had hold of his wrist and took him down to the water—there is no stair, it is a paving which goes to the water's edge—she dragged the boy into the water by the wrist, and both went under water and came up again—it was out of her depth—I was down in the water, trying to feel for the boy, and I pushed the woman back, so that she should not drag me in, and by that means she let go of the boy and I got him out, and then I got hold of her dress and pulled her out—she then said that she would drown the boy and herself.</p>

I am too fond of the boy to go and drown him."</p>

I am a baker, of 9, Munster-square—on 24th Au<lb></lb>gust, between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked for two penny tea-cakes—he gave me a shilling—after he left, some one made a communi<lb></lb>cation to me, and I looked into the till, and found the shilling was bad—there was no other shilling there; I put it by itself—on 26th he came again—I knew him directly he asked for two penny tea-cakes—I told him I had none—he asked for two half-penny rolls, and gave me a shilling; I put it in the detector, bent it, and said, "That is a bad one"—I walked round the counter, and said, "I had a bad one from you last Thursday; how do you account for that?"—he said, "I was never in the shop before"—I gave him in custody with the shillings.</p>

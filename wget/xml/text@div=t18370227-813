The prisoner has been in my service about four months—I gave her warning some time since—she left on the Monday evening, and on the Tuesday I missed a pair of sheets—I saw the prisoner about seven o'clock the same evening, on the opposite side of the road, and gave her into custody—a pair of sheets and a shawl were found on her—these are the sheets—they have the initials of, my late wife on them—the constable asked how she came by them—she said the took them away, but did not intend Co steal them—I cannot swear to the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written Defence stating, that being in distress she had pledged the sheets for half-a-crown, intending to replace them—that on leaving her place she had redeemed them and was waiting about the house till she saw the shop-boy, who she asked to take them into the house—that he promised to come out to fetch them, instead of which he went and told his master, who came out and took her.)</p>

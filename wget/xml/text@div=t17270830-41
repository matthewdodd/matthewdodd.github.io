               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That at the Time aforesaid; coming from the Barley-Mow at Islington about 12 at Night, the Prisoners at the Bar came up to him, and Martha Cambell said, G - d D - n him for a Son of a B - h knock him down; and getting him by the Throat, said, I'll cut the old Dog's Throat. He further depos'd, That he had been at Sadler's-Wells and saw them there, and that Martha Cambell then said, she'd have his Blood; this Martha Cambell, said he, and I, have formerly been very well acquainted, but I have married a Woman of Fortune, and turned her off, upon which I go in Danger of my Life. This gave the Court an Insight into the Truth, and occasioned such a strict Enquiry to be made in the Affair, as made it evident that there was no Robbery either designed or committed; but Martha Cambell in Consideration of her former Familiarity with the Prosecutor, and his using her with Contempt lately, was grown outrageous; and Anthony Lutford being her present Friend, (if there is such a Things as Friendship in a vicious Course of Life) had assisted her in insulting the Prosecutor: It appear'd that the Prosecutor and Anthony Lutford, had not only been familiar Acquaintance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172708300007"></xptr> but the Prosecutor had employ'd him as a <rs id="t17270830-41-deflabel198" type="occupation">Solicitor</rs>

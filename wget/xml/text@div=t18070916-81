            . I am a cabinet-maker; I work for Parrarer, Hatton Wall. I was standing looking at a print in a broker's shop, Cow Cross; the prisoner asked me if I belonged to the shop, he said he had got a deal for sale on his cart; he shewed me the plank, he said it was his own; this was near eleven o'clock in the day on the 12th of August; afterwards he said it was not his own, he was hired to sell it. I gave information to an officer, and then I bought the plank. I asked him what he asked for it, he said half a crown, I told him I would give him 2 s. I cautioned him not to sell the deal unless he came honestly by it, he must face the deal again, for I should be stopped by an officer; he took the 2 s. the officer came up and stopped the deal, and took the man.</p>

            . Q. In consequence of this man's information you stopped the deal. - A. Yes, I produce it. He acknowledged to me it was Mr. Lett's deal, and if I would let him go he would take it back again, he said he had got it out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Moore) I suppose the quantity of deals that you have in your yard, you cannot miss one piece. - A. Impossible; it is not of the same description as he had in the cart; but we have many hundreds of the same sort in our yard; he had no right to take a deal of that description, it is worth 5 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the day laid in the indictment I went with a load of deals to Mr. Waterman. Coming up Narrow Wall, I saw that deal lay in the road, I supposed it had been dropped by some timber carriage, I took it up and was going to sell it at Cow Cross.</p>

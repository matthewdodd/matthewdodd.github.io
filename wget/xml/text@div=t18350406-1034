                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 7th of April, between one and three o'clock, I received information that I had lost a gown—I sent my servant out, and afterwards heard that I should meet the person in the act of pawning it—I went to a pawn-broker's, and saw the prisoner and a gown, which I said was mine, but when I got it home I found it was not—I then received more information, and went to Old-street—I saw the prisoner there with my gown on her back—I said, "You have got my gown"—she said it was not—I said, would she go with me—she said "Yes, any where"—we went down a street, and then she refused to go unless I got a policeman—I sent, but could not get one—I persuaded her to go to my house, which she did, and when she</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-place, City-road—I have been a builder but am now living on my property—the prisoner, I understand, is a builder and carpenter—he represented himself to be so on the 25th of Jan., 1842—he came to my office at the back of my house, and presented this bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, accepted in the name of Islet Odell, as it is now—I looked at it, he said it was the acceptance of Odell—I did not know Odell personally, but knew there was such a person—I rather hesitated, and he said, "Take a day' or two to inquire, and I will call again"—he said he was employed by Odell as a carpenter and builder at the time, and had drawn on him for work done—he left, taking the bill away with him—it was indorsed—he called again by agreement, in a day or two, with the same bill, and said, "Have you made the necessary inquiries?"—I said I had not, I had been so engaged, but it was of no consequence, I was satisfied Mr. Odell was a respectable man, and I gave him cash for the bill—it is dated the 7th of Jan., at two months, on Mr. Odell, Upper Clapton, payable at Messrs. Everett's, Finch-lane, City—when it became due I had it presented by one of my workmen, and it was detained—I knew Everett, and he called on me the same evening—in consequence of what he said I looked after the prisoner and went to Shackell of the G division, a week or two after, but could not find the prisoner till just before the last session—I believed the acceptance was genuine at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Dalston—the prisoner was employed by me about five years ago, but not since—not in 1842—he was foreman of the carpenters—he was in my service—the acceptance to this bill is not my handwriting—I did not authorize the prisoner or anybody to write it for me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive the advances from Rhodes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was obliged to take care of myself as well as I could, but did not secure myself—I may have given bills to tradesmen in transactions with him, if so I paid them—I cannot positively say, as it is five years ago—he could always have his account—every paper is balanced—I met him about a fortnight before he was taken, in Lon<lb></lb>don-wall, and said Wilson wished to see him—he did not tell me if I had paid him 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would not have happened.</p>

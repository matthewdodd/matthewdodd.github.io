            . I live in Silk-street, Grub-street. On the 20th of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Quebec-street, I was a little intoxicated, and met the prisoner and another woman in Barbican; I refused to go with them, they took me to a public-house, and we had a quartern of gin; I stood away from the counter, and removed my watch from my fob into my coat-pocket, they both came out with me, and in less than five minutes I missed my watch; I charged the prisoner with taking it, she said No, and laughed. I said I would give her a pound note to return it; she said she would, if I gave her a note. They walked home with me to Chapel-street, close by and waited. I went home, and brought out seven one pound notes rolled together; the prisoner rubbed me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"No have got your watch," she put her fingers in my waistcoat-pocket, and took the notes out, I seized her, she reached her hand over to the other woman, who went away; I gave charge of the prisoner, she then said she did not think I had lost a watch, but said so to get the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give information to have the other woman taken - A. She took the watchman out, and brought in a woman, I cannot say whether she was, or was not the woman.</p>

            . I took charge of the prisoner, she was brought in by the watchman. I found nothing on her, she gave me the name of the other woman; I sent her out with two patrols, they brought a woman in, who answered to that name, the prosecutor could not be certain about her, he was much intoxicated.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I met the prisoner and prosecutor in Bowling-alley, Whitecross-street, standing with another female; they were making a great noise, I told them to disperse, he said he was robbed of a watch,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280033"></xptr>I wanted him to give them in charge, but he would not; he said you are an honourable girl, and if you will go home with me, I will give you a pound note; she said</p>

On Friday, the 6th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I left my house with my wife - I locked the house, and fastened the window with a gimblet; I came home ten or twenty minutes before nine, and saw a man, with one leg inside my parlour window, and the other leg out - that was not the prisoner; I had a child in my arms - I saw the prisoner at the same time, standing with his back leaning against the wall, opposite the window, within two yards of it - I gave an alarm, and they both ran away together as soon as I called Stop thief! the prisoner was pursued, and I overtook him in Hackney-road - I am certain he is the person; there was a glimmering light from the opposite side of the street, which shines down the court - I saw him running and ran after him, after throwing my child down; I lost sight of him myself, but am sure he is the man - when I got back I missed my fire-irons and tea-caddy, which I had left on the drawers in the parlour; the window had been forced open, apparently by a chisel or something - the wood where the gimblet was was broken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170022"></xptr>out; I saw the fire-irons and tea-caddy that night at the station-house, Mile-end-road, in possession of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. Does the gas shine on your house? A. No; the reflection of it throws a light on the house; it is opposite the court on the other side of the street; you turn round four or five houses to get to my house - it was not exactly dark at the time: it was near nine o'clock - there were lights from the different back windows; I saw both the men run away: a man, named Gangey, was taken up as the one who got out of the window, but I did not believe him to be the man - my wife swore to him by a cast over his eye; I swear I fastened the window that night - the prisoner ran away the instant I collared the other; having a child in my arms I could not hold him - I did not see him with any thing; the fire-irons were new, and had come in that morning.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was coming home with him on this night; I was behind him, and heard him give an alarm - I had just turned into the entrance of the court, when I saw the prisoner run down; the gas-light was shining up the court, full in his face - I am sure it was him; he had something under each arm, and when he came to the end of the court I drew back to let him pass, and he dropped the tea-caddy at my feet - I heard something drop a little further, which rattled like iron; he came within a foot of me - I am positive he is the man; the caddy remained there - I dropped a ring of wire, which I had, and then pursued him; he was taken in Hackney-road, about three hundred yards off - when I came up to him again, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What prevented your taking him? A. I had a ring of wire weighing above 40lbs., on my shoulder, and a bundle in my hand; I drew back out of the court, and he passed me - I did not see a man come up to the window; I was not up the court - I lost sight of him as he ran; I saw him for not quite a minute - I am positive he is the man; the gas-light shines right up the court - he had a hat on; it had not a broad brim - there were other people in the street; my brother called Stop thief! and that set other people running - I heard nobody say he was not the person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a pot-boy? A. Yes - I lived with Mr. Edwards then, but not now; I gave him warning - we both gave warning together; I got drunk three times while I lived with him, when I had a holiday; he did not discharge me for getting drunk - I never said this was after nine o'clock; I could have had two places if it was not for this - I was about a foot from the court; I had a tray on each side of me - I saw him for about a minute, when he passed me with the fire-irons; I did not see him again till he was at Lambeth-street - I did not go and tell the prosecutor I knew him; I did not want to have any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The gas shines right up the court? A. Yes, and Mrs. Sales, whose door I was at, had a candle in her hand; these are the fire-irons and caddy, which I picked up.</p>

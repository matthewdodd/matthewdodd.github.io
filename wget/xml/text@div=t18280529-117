            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre. On the 17th of May I saw the two prisoners, with another person, at the top of Cow-cross, at near eight o'clock- Ross had two lamps, wrapped up in a cloth; I watched them for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then took Ross and the other man to the watch-house. Ross said he had formerly kept a shop, and that the lamps came from there, and the brackets were left in the window - the other man who was with them was discharged. I saw Shaw go into a shop, as if to ask if they would purchase such things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SHAW. It was the other man - he has confessed it since.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES TERRY. Q. Then why did you take the other man? A. Because they spoke together, and Shaw was gone then.</p>

Shaw was in liquor; and when I got him to the watch-house he acknowledged that he was with Ross, but said he knew nothing about the lamps.</p>

            . I am a broker, and valued the goods; there were globe lamps of this description in the house - but I cannot swear to these; I took the inventory about twelve months ago, and again on the 5th of May - there were then two lamps lying in a dark cupboard; but I did not notice them.</p>
               <p>SHAW'S Defence. I never saw nor handled them; I was away when they were taken, and on the road home, I was told that Ross and Anderson were taken into custody; some persons persuaded me to go away, because there was an officer after me - I said, I had never seen them, and I stopped till the officer came and took me; Anderson was the man as he has said himself, who went and asked the question, which the watchman says was me.</p>
               <p>ROSS' Defence. Anderson told me he had two lamps which he brought from Scotland; he told me to hold them while he went into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Uxbridge, and am a sawyer. On Thursday he 26th of November I was at the Red Lion public-house, at Uxbridge—I met the prisoner there—she drank with me—I then had a pony chaise, and took her to her own house, in Wexham-street—that was about five miles—I had never seen her before—I put it up at the Plough public-house, which is close by her house—she left and was gone half-an-hour—she then came back, and said she would not stop at home, she would go back to Uxbridge with me—she got into the chaise, and I drove back to the house at Uxbridge—the landlord said, "The man has been at the expense of taking you home, and you shall not come in"—I went into the Red Lion, and sat down, and when I went to see the time my watch was gone—I had had it safe when I left the Red Lion—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you first meet her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At half-past eleven o'clock—she was there drinking gin with a man I knew—I joined them—I suppose I sat there two hours, but I was not drinking the whole of the time—I went out—I was not drunk when I left the house, and I do not think she was—I hired the horse and chaise at Uxbridge, and drove to that place, which is in Buckinghamshire—I do not know how many miles it is from London—the watch was found at Eton, in Buckinghamshire—something occurred between the pri<lb></lb>soner and me in the chaise, as we were going, about half-way between Uxbridge and the other place—I do not know whether it was in Middle-sex or Buckinghamshire—we then went on to the Plough—I had one pint of beer, while the prisoner was gone to take the key of her father and mother's house—I paid her half-a-crown—I did not give her the watch—I was not so drunk that I cannot recollect any thing about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the watch when you left Uxbridge with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and when I came bark to Uxbridge I was not with her more than three minutes—the watch must have been taken before we came back—I cannot say whether it was taken when we stopped on the road—there was a house about a quarter of a mile from Uxbridge where we stopped as we came back—it might have been taken there—I will not swear I had it there.</p>

               <p>a carman—on 29th June, I went to the Central Bank to cash a cheque, and in exchange they gave me eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, with consecutive numbers, 03721-03728, dated 20th March, 1876—I placed them in a pocket-book—there was in that pocket-book a memorandum-book, and my name and address were written in fall on the outside—I fastened it with the keeper when I put the notes in—it could not be opened without my address being seen—I put the note-book in my breast pocket while inside the bank—I went up Cornhill, through Leadenhall Market, to Fenchurch Street Station, and to the West India Docks—when there I missed my pocket-book, together with the notes—I then gave information to the police, and went the next morning to the Bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The strap that went into the pocket-book was a common piece of leather, running through without any buckle or fastening at the end, and the keeper was a cross piece of strap—it was not a new book—I had the pocket-book seven years—the size of it was about six inches by four—it had one pocket—if there was much in it, it would bulge out—the memorandum-book was fixed in the pocket-book, and belonged to it, it had been in the pocket-book seven years; it was made and bound up in the pocket-book—there was other writing in it besides my name and address, pencil marks, figures, and so on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was a common pocket-book with the memorandum-book in it—on the outer leaf of that was my name and address, as distinct as the day I had first written it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 29th June the prisoner showed me four or five bank notes; I did not see where he took them from; he said nothing about them, only that he wanted me to do him the favour to change one or two for him—I went with him to the last witness', to Mr. Lowther's—I saw him change one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw the notes in his possession—he sent to my place for me and I went to him at his place at Bermondsey—I next went to a licensed victualler's named Elwood—I got change for a note, but I will not swear to the number—I next went to Mr. Trusta's—I cashed one also at a place in the Borough—I went to a detective and found where the notes were changed—I changed three and one the prisoner changed—I saw no pocket-book or memorandum-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Elwood had known the prisoner as a respectable man; he had four children; there never was anything against his character—I did not tell him I should put his name on the note, but of course it was not mine and I should put his name—he is a badly educated man—I saw him sign his name at the clothier's—I did hear him some week afterwards say he had never seen such a thing as a bank-note before—he lives at 18, New Street, Dock Head—the signature produced is something similar to his usual writing as far as I know; it was written at the clothier's—on 29th June, after he had his new clothes, we parted company between 8 and 9 o'clock at night—I did not see him for three or four days afterwards.</p>

I received information about the loss of these notes and went to the prisoner's house on 18th July—shortly afterwards the prisoner came in—I told him I was a police-officer and had come to make some inquiry about some 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes he had been dealing with—he said "I know nothing about any Bank of England notes at all, I have never seen them"—I said, pointing to the witness Power who was present, "Yes, you have, you went with this man to Mr. Lowther's in the Borough and purchased a coat and waistcoat, and you have also given him several others to pass away; there are eight of these notes, what have you done with the remainder?"—I traced four of them—he said "They are all gone, the public gave them and the public have got them again"—I said "What have you done with the pocket-book?"—he said "I gave it to the children"—I said "What have they done with it?"—he said "They have been playing about it"—I said "There was the name and address on the pocket-book of the loser of the notes"—again I said "Where is it?—"Oh," he said, "it is burnt"—the wife, who was then present, said it was burnt—he said "I have never seen a bank note before in my life, I did not know the value of them"—I replied "Well you very soon found out the value of them, for you changed two or three of them the same night that they were lost"—he said "I am very sorry; if I had known they belonged to a poor man I would have taken them to him"—he was taken to the station—I searched his house and found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I have made inquiries about him; I believe he is a hard working, honest man, I have heard nothing against him—I did not know that his wife was a needlewoman—she said that the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. belonged to her and it was her own earnings as a needlewoman, that she had earned it at different places; she could not give me the name of anybody from whom she had received it—I think the prisoner is an uneducated man.</p>

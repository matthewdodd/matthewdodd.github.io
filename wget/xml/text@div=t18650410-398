                  </hi>. I am a nephew of the last witness—I have heard what she has said; it is correct—when I handed Green the florin he said that he was a respectable man, and if I would go with him he would take me to where he lived at the top of the street—I went out at the private door as he went out at the shop door—I saw Shakespeare on the other side of the way, Green went down the next street and whistled to her—she crossed the road to him and both went down the road together—I followed them along the Cambridge-road and pointed them out to a con<lb></lb>stable—Green went into the Star and Garter and the woman waited outside on the same side—the constable went in and took Green—I afterwards went in—Shakespeare moved a little farther from the Star and Garter towards some railings and then walked back again—I pointed her out.</p>

On 22d February, about quarter or twenty minutes past seven I was on duty in Oldfield-road, Bethnal-green and saw Green pass something to Shakespeare, who was standing in the dark—she crossed over and proceeded along the Cambridge-road when Sibley came and spoke to me—I followed the prisoners forty or fifty yards, they were talking together, and I saw Green go into the Star and Garter beer<lb></lb>shop—there are some low bushes there for a fence—I went in when Clevely called me and told Green I should take him for attempting to pass bad money at another house—he said that he had not done such a thing—I said that I should search him, he said that I should do no such thing—I searched him and found two half-crowns, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. good, and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. lying on the bar—he tried to escape and get to the door—I caught him by the collar, he became very violent, we had a struggle and both fell inside the door—I afterwards received this bag from the female searcher, it contains six paper collars, a newspaper, a tooth-brush, three cigars, and three cakes—I had seen Shakespeare carrying the bag on her arm—next morning I went to where I had seen her standing and found the black bag hanging on the bushes over the rails—it contains 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in counterfeit money, wrapped up in paper, three florins, and seven shillings—it was within reach of the place where she stood.</p>

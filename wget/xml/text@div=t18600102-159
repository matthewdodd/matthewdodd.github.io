                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and live at 3, Dock-place, Victoria Dock-road; my wife is a laundress—the prisoner has been in her service; I can't say how long—on 7th December, I saw five shirts and a sheet safe about 9 o'clock—they were lying on the arm of a sofa in the frout parlour in my house—I missed them next monning between 7 and 8 o'clock—I have seen the shirts since, but not the sheet—I saw them on the Sunday following—when I missed them on the Thursday, I examined the back of my premises and saw there were marks of a female foot—it was very muddy,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020064"></xptr>
               <p>and there were marks of a person lying down on the sofa—I saw the prisoner on the Sunday morning; she was coming to the house—I asked her why she did not come in the front way, instead of coming the back way when she come home on Wednesday night, and I told her I believed she had robbed me of some shirts and a sheet—she said, "I have taken the sheet and shirts to iron"—I told her I did not think she had taken them to iron, at my wife never gave out anything to be ironed by her—she went out in the back yard and tried to get away—I said to her, "Don't tear the pawn<lb></lb>tickets up if you have pawned the things"—she said, "I have not pawned them; and if you will let the matter drop I will take you to Woolwich to the woman's where I left them, and will get them for you"—I said, "It is very cruel of you, and I will give you in charge"—I gave her in charge and I and the policeman went to the place where she said they were, and found the five shirts—they were lying in the room at the foot of the bed—they were rough dried, ready to iron—they had been starched when they were on the sofa ready for my wife to iron—the prisoner used to come to work on Wednesday, and she left on Thursday and went to Woolwich—she had lived entirely with us—she got work elsewhere but usually returned to us on Wednesday night—I did not see her on that Wednesday night at my house; she got in at the back, and the window was left open at the back—the boy got in at the window and unbuttoned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The window fastens with a button—we did not know that it was undone—the other place was where she lodged the three nights she was away from us.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 207). I took the prisoner in custody—I told her the charge—she said she was very sorry for it, she had only taken the things to iron—I took her to the station, and then went to the place where she said she had left them, to Mr. Sheeley, a common lodging-house keeper—I found the shirts there, and there was a ticket of a sheet found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this carpeting missed - A. Between the hours of four and five, it was safe about a minute before it was missed. The carpeting was placed outside of the door; part on the pavement and part on a chair; I was sitting at work about six yards from where the carpeting lay; I could see a part of it as I sat, and when I turned my eye that way, I missed it. I went to the door the carpet was gone; I saw the prisoner at the bar with it: he was walking towards Holborn, I pursued him; he turned into Maryland buildings. I was very near him; stop thief was called; he turned his head and looked at me and dropped the carpeting; I knew it to be my carpeting; he was brought back to my shop and taken in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. SENIOR. I am a baker in Kentish town; I was coming from Kentish town on the stage; I saw the prisoner walking along with the carpetting; a few paces beyond Mrs. Fothergill's door. I saw Mrs. Fothergill come out and look round; I kept my eye upon the prisoner; he went into Maryland buildings, and when he came out at the other end then I jumped off the coach and ran after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him - A. No further than while I was turning the corner; I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you catch him - A. I run him down Tash street, through Baldwin's gardens into Black horse yard; there he went into a stable and shut the door after him; when I took hold of the man I found I knew him; I said to him I know you; he said do not hurt me Mr. Thurgood, my name is not Thurgood though he called me so; going down Liquorpond street, I delivered him into the officer's custody.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

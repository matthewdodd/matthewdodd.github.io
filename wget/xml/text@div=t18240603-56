Three shillings were left with me on Sunday morning, the 25th of April; I laid them on the table, and had occasion to go to the door. The prisoner came in - I thought he was a surgeon. As he went out again I saw something strange in his appearance - I looked on the table, and the silver was gone. I went after him, and brought him back - he said he had not stolen it; did I mean to say he was a thief? I said he had taken 3 s., and I could swear to them - he said,</p>
               <p>"Sooner than have words I will give you 3 s.," which he did, and I saw that one of them was one of the shillings I had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say it would be better for him to give you 3 s., and go about his business - A. I did not. I had looked at the shillings, and had noticed a mark on one of them; I had been in the habit of looking at the money that was left to see if it was good, and I saw a mark on the neck of the first shilling. They had been left in the hall where the porters generally sit. I had only gone to the bottom of the steps, and had but just left the room. The money was left for a patient of the name of Whitworth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to dine with a friend, and saw the door open; I went in, and read a board over the fire-place. I had got a little way from the infirmary, and he came and asked me to come back with him, and told me to give him 3 s. which I had taken off the table; I said,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about them;" they said they would fetch an officer, and I told them I would rather give them 3 s. than have any piece of work about it. I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 3 s., and then he said,</p>
               <p>"I can swear to this shilling."</p>

            . Q. Was there any person with him at the time - A. No. I am positive as to this shilling. There were persons who saw him give me the 3 s., and I immediately identified this one. I could see any one who entered the room - I am certain no person could have come from the interior of the Hospital without my seeing them; I was not down the steps more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there no other doors which lead to the hall - A. Yes; one leads to the surgery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The hall, I suppose, is the place that admits you from the street to all the other parts of the building - A. Certainly, my Lord. I was at the bottom of the steps when he passed me; I did not suspect him. He was going down the steps as I came up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had stood at the door while I read a printed board before I went in, and there was not another person in the hall - when I went in I read a large board of the rules of the place.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he go into the house. - A. He went with me inside of the house, I saw him go up stairs, the door was open; on the 4th of March, my sister met him in the street and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get out. - A. When I enquired how he came out, all the servants came about me, they said is this the man, I said no, he went up stairs one way and came down another way, he went through the hall and went off; the duke of Cumberland was coming in at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mrs. Harris) How soon did you meet this man afterwards. - A. The very next day; I am sure it is the same man, he had all my things on almost. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

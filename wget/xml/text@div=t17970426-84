I took them to the watch-house; they told me it belonged to a person in Rose-street, Soho, opposite St. Ann's workhouse; I went there and found it was so; the truck is in my possession in the Court yard.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) Have you looked at that truck in the Court yard? - A. Yes; it is my truck.</p>
               <p>Newman's defence. Yesterday morning I saw this young man, he told me he had found this truck near Compton-street, I was going to work; I saw him again in the afternoon, about four o'clock, and told him I had heard of a person that had lost the truck; we both directly went to the place where he had taken the turck to, and we agreed to take it home; we were getting it out of the yard to take it home when the constable stopped us.</p>
               <p>Collins's defence. On Thursday night, about half past ten, I saw this truck lying in the middle of the road, with one of the wheels off; I put the wheel on again, and brought it to Bowling-pin-alley; I asked Mr. Brooksbank, she head porter of Lincoln's-Inn, whether I might leave it there till I found the owner; and he said, I might; I saw this young man the next day, and he told me he had heard of a person that had lost the truck; and we had got one wheel on, and was going to put the other on, when the constable came up, and we told him we had heard it belonged to some person in Rose-street.</p>

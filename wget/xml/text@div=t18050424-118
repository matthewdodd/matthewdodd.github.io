            ; I told the prisoner I came to demand a letter that my servant girl had from her mother, inclosing some money, the girl having told me her mother had sent her a letter with some money; she answered, with a good deal of apparent surprize, that she had received no letter; I told her it was certainly a mistake; she said no it was not; I asked her if she had seen my servant that morning before; she said she had not; I asked her if she had not given her a seven-shilling piece that she had received from her mother; she said, no, she had never any thing to do with the girl in her life; she never saw her before last Monday week; I then turned round to the girl and said to her, is this the truth, and she sighed; I then begged Mrs. Baker's pardon for having expressed myself so very angrily, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live? - A. Immediately against my garden-gate; when the girl had taken her bundles, I and my nephew pursued her, and we took her in Charlston-street; we brought her back to my house in Marybone-park. When I went in, I found Mrs. Baker there; she said, O sir, you have taken Nanny, I have brought you in a pocket-book with two two-pound Bank-notes, which she gave to me; I said, how could you be so vile a woman as to tell me in the morning that you never had any transaction with her in your life; she then said she had seen her, and that

             asked her to counterfeit a letter, as though it came from her mother, and to say in the letter that the seven-shilling piece was all that the mother could send her at present; I asked her if she agreed to write the letter; she said she could not write, but she agreed that a young girl, who I believe is here, should write it. I then asked her if she had any thing more of the girl's, and she said she had not; in about half an hour, or more, I expressed I should go to Bow-street; she then said, if I would not bring her into trouble, she would tell all the truth; I said, you shall go to Bow-street, this transaction shall be fathomed; she told us where she had paid the Bank-notes away; there were two other two-pound notes she had of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Bank-notes in consequence of her information? - A. I did, I found two two-pound notes in the pocket-book; she said the girl had given them to her, and she said to the girl, I hope you have not been robbing of your master.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the pocket-book and the instruments? - A. About seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got the pocket-book? - A. Yes, this is the pocket-book the prisoner brought to me, I have my private mark on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I will tell you the truth, and nothing but the truth, from the beginning to the ending of my acquaintance with the girl: the first acquaintance of this girl with me was, she came to me, and asked me to new sleeve her a gown; I told her I could not do it, but I had a young woman within doors that did needle-work; she went and brought the gown, and came in and said, will you be so good as to do an errand for me; I said, it is a job I do not like; she said, I cannot get it myself, if you will, I will take it as a great favour; I asked her what it was to do, and she said it was to buy her some necessary things, a flannel, two flowered aprons, and some cloth to make a shift, and a pair of white stockings; she came past again, and then she pulled out the notes from her breasts, and gave them to me; I put them up in the cupboard, and did not look at them; she came again in the afternoon, and said, Mrs. Baker, if you see a gown, buy it for me; she said the young woman there would go with me. I immediately, after she was gone, went and looked at these notes, and I saw that they were two two-pound notes, and I said to the young woman that was with me, that was witness to it, this girl has left two two-pound notes, that money will buy a great many things. Accordingly I saw her go by the next morning, and the young woman with me called her in, and I said, what did you give me, why here are two two-pound notes; she said, I have not had a bit of rest all night, my poor mother sent them to me out of the country, and I thought I gave you but one, and I was going to get a letter wrote to send down to my mother concerning it; she said, go and lay it out. I went and brought her the things she told me, and the money I paid for them came to 2 l. 9 s. 4 d.; she came on the next morning, and I gave her half-a-guinea and a pound note; she left them at my house for the young woman to make, who is a neighbour of mine, and who was every time there that she was, and heard every thing that passed; she said, if you do not make them till the latter end of next week, till I leave my place, it will do. On the next Tuesday she came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240097"></xptr>house, and asked me to go to town, and buy a little tea, and she gave me the pound note. On the next Wednesday morning she came running in at the door, and she said, Mrs. Baker, can you write a few lines for me to my mother, it is concerning a seven-shilling piece; I said, I cannot; the young woman said, I would do it if I could, but my hands are very bad; she ran out of the door, and threw this pocket-book at the corner of my bed's head, and out she went. As soon as I cut my children a bit of bread and butter, Mr. Gibbons came in, and asked me if I had a letter from her mother, and whether I had wrote to her mother; I made a reply, I never had any letter from her mother; he said, have you burnt it; I said, no, I never had any letter from her mother, and moreover I never knew the girl till last Monday week; Mr. Gibbons certainly did come in very rash, and he said he would take me to Bow-street; he went out, and begged my pardon. As soon as Mr. Gibbons was gone, the girl pushed open the door; I said, you good for nothing girl, where are you going; she said, I do not know where I am going; she said, keep what you have got, Mrs. Baker, and say nothing; I ran immediately, as fast as I could, round to Mr. Gibbons's, and whether Mrs. Gibbons or the nephew came to the door, I cannot recollect; I asked whether Mr. Gibbons was at home; she said, no, but the nephew was. I had this pocket-book in my hand, and I said, here, Mrs. Gibbons, is a pocket-book which the girl threw on my bed, and there is the two two-pound notes that were in it; she would not take it till the nephew came; I asked her if the girl was in the room; she said, yes; I said, if you please to let me see her; on going into the room, I asked to sit down; then I said, you good for nothing hussy, did you not throw this pocket-book on my bed, and did not you bring me two one-pound notes to buy you some things, which are now at my house, and I will go and fetch them if you please; Mr. Gibbons made answer, no, we will call for them. I dropped the one-pound note, that she gave me to buy her some tea, on the table, and there was a sleeve I had thrown on the table too, which I saw after Mr. Gibbons was gone; when he came in, I gave him the pound-note and the sleeve; he asked me if that was all; I told him of every thing that belonged to this girl; they took this girl to Bow-street. Mr. Gibbons brought a gentleman that took me, and I got bail that bailed me out; Mr. Gibbons asked if this person would be bound for my removal out of the cottage in the course of a fortnight; they said they would not do any such thing to hurt me. Gentlemen, I believe I have told you the truth.</p>

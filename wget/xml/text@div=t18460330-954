I was on duty in High-street, Deptford—I saw the prisoner in New King-street—sergeant Walton was with me—we went up to where the pri<lb></lb>soner was, hearing a disturbance—we found the prisoner scuffling with police-constable James Hastie, since deceased—he was endeavouring to take his staff from him—Hastie had no other person in his custody at that time—the sergeant went to Hastie's assistance, and struck the prisoner with his staff, on his shoulder—I then saw the prisoner take hold of the sergeant's collar—I then assisted the deceased Hastie, to take another one into custody—when I assisted Hastie with his prisoner, Wall struck me with a stick on the side of the eye—I believe the stick was something about the size of a broomstick—I was cut—the skin was divided—the mark is here still—blood followed from it—I applied for a warrant against the prisoner, and he was apprehended on the 30th of March—when he was apprehended he said, "You bloody Knight, you are <hi rend="italic">reckoned up</hi>, look out"—Hastie has since been murdered in the streets—he was found in a dying state, about twenty yards from the time spot—I went to Mr. Dowling, a surgeon, on the Monday, and he told me the blow had caught the vein of my eye, and if it had been a little more I should have lost my sight.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of Feb. last, in consequence of hearing a disturbance, I and Knight went down King-street—we went up and found the prisoner and another, (who has had fourteen days imprisonment,) trying to take Hastie's staff away—in conse<lb></lb>quence of that, I saw he was in danger of his life, and I took out my staff and hit the prisoner across the shoulder, because there were so many round him—there were more than one striking him, there was the man that had fourteen days for assisting the prisoner in getting his staff away, and there were several more round him, but these two were the worst—when the prisoner was taken away I heard him say that he would do for the bloody police—this happened between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 15th, about ten yards from the public-house—it was close by the spot where Hastie was</p>

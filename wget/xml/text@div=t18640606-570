On 16th May, at half-past 11 at night, I was off duty, and standing at the corner of Johnson's-court, Leman-street, Whitechapel, in company with two other constables in plain clothes—the prisoner, with two other Germans, came through the court, and I received a blow from the prisoner on the left cheek bone—he hit me with his fist—I said to him, "What is that for?"—he said, "Yes, you b—, I will give you something else, raising his right hand—at the same time I saw the blade of a knife, apparently a penknife—I raised my left hand, and the blow struck me at the back of the hand—blood flowed from the wound—the prisoner then ran into a house close by—I followed with the other two constables to apprehend him, and we were surrounded by about twelve or fifteen Germans—the other constables having truncheons used them for the purpose of taking the prisoner—at last, after a struggle, we got the prisoner out of the passage of the house into the street, and conveyed him to the station, which was directly opposite—the doctor attended me—I never saw the prisoner before this—he had been drinking—he spoke broken English to me when I spoke to him.</p>

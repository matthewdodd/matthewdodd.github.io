                  </hi> I am the wife of John Watson, and live in Mary Ann's place, Shadwell. On the 7th of June, about six o'clock, I missed two suits of clothes, with the exception of one waistcoat, all the property of David Watson, and a pair of trowsers and handkerchief of John Watson's, which I had seen safe on the sofa in my dwelling-house, between ten and eleven in the morning—I found a key in the parlour when I came home, and the things all gone—I have not seen any of them since.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Dean, and live at No. 6, Leading-street, in sight of Mrs. Watson's. On the 7th of June last, between one and two in the day, I was looking out of the window—my daughter said some<lb></lb>thing to me—I turned, and saw three lads, coming from Mary Ann's-place, with a large bundle, wrapped up in a reddish silk handkerchief—they came right across Mary Ann's-place, towards fox's-lane—Williams took the bundle from the one not in custody—he put it under his arm—in going along I saw something dark, like cloth, hanging out—they passed by my door, and went up Shadwell-market—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went across the wooden bridge, and saw them on the top of the bridge—I made a stop,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050027"></xptr>
               <p>and they crossed over the road, went up John-street, and across the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—when I came to the corner of Sutton-street, I beckoned to a policeman—he did not come—I went up and told him the young men had a bundle—he said, "Where are they?"—I showed them to him—they were in sight then—he said, "I am not going that way"—I turned down towards Charles-street, and returned home—the men might have got ten or eleven yards from Mrs. Watson's house when I first saw them—Jones had the bundle first, he gave it to the man not in custody, and the prisoners walked behind, while the other went on five or six yards before them, with the bundle.</p>

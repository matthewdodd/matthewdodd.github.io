I saw a number of people in the street, but nothing like a fixed mob; that is, so close, as to be called a mob; I immediately pulled out my watch to see what o'clock it was; I think it was a little after two; I put up my watch again, and put the chain within side; I tucked up the chain; in a very short time I found myself closely surrounded by a number of people; a man behind me, a tall stout man, pushed me with great violence forwards; that was neither of the prisoners; I called to him not to push, and he said he could not help it; I desired him to let me go back, and he said he could not: the prisoner

               <p>Court. Had you not a great coat on at that time? - I had, just as I have now, buttoned in the same manner; I saw his hand a second time at my fob, and knocked it down; I was going to make an attempt to get into a small recess, where I thought I might be in safety, among some ironmongery; I believe they were grates: the moment I was going to make the attempt, the prisoner saw me attempt, and forced himself with great violence into an avenue that led to this recess; then we were face to face again; I turned a little to the left, to get into this recess; then I concluded I should be robbed, and prepared myself accordingly; the first thing that was done, my hat was knocked off.</p>
               <p>By whom? - I cannot tell; the people on each side pressed in, and kept my arms down; I did not remove them to recover my hat.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you did not, or could not? - I do not know whether I could; but I did not; my arms were then pressed in with great violence, that I was not able to move them; the next thing was, I felt a hand at my fob, taking out my watch.</p>
               <p>Do you mean you felt a hand at your fob, or that you felt your watch going; because they are two very different things? - I mean both; at the time my watch was going, I felt a hand touch my left hand, as if it came from between the legs of my left hand neighbour; it seemed like a man groping in the dark; I thought that a man behind my next neighbour, had put his hands between the legs of my next neighbour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is all mere circumstances? - It is guess.</p>
               <p>Do not let us try men for their lives by guesses; pray do not tell us your guesses nor your dreams, nor any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Jury. We will be much obliged to you if you will speak from a fact, and not from what you guess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edminston. I felt a hand upon mine some time; immediately afterwards, I heard a voice, which appeared to me to be near the pavement, saying, I have got it; I was immediately released upon that; and I kept my eye upon the prisoner Connelly; he stooped to the side of the foot-way; I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240198"></xptr>went up to him, and took him by the hand, and said, Sir, you have taken my watch; he replied, I am very sorry you think so; and immediately a constable took him by the other arm; Connelly then said, says he, if you will go into a shop with me, I will shew you that I have not got your watch; we went into the shop, and he pulled out a red pocket-book with a fifteen pounds bank note in it; and he pulled out six guineas in money; I afterwards committed him to the care of the constable, and he took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Did you ever recover your watch? - The watch was recovered; I did not see it till I saw it before Sir

               <p>Upon that occasion, I believe, he produced some witnesses, in order to satisfy the magistrate what manner of man he was? - He produced witnesses on Tuesday; he had a hearing on Wednesday again.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was Thursday, at least, I observe, when that respectable and worthy magistrate committed him on suspicion of being concerned in taking your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of the prisoner Connelly before? - Never; I never saw him before that day, in my life.</p>
               <p>He immediately went with you into a shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was searched, and your watch was not found? - Not found.</p>
               <p>Though he was searched instantly? - He was searched instantly.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long it was after Connelly was actually in custody, and after he had been searched before the other prisoner, Dodd, was taken into custody? - That I do not know.</p>

               <p>I observe, that with the propriety and caution that becomes a man in your character in life, and your education, and your cloth, you said that you verily believed, that from all the circumstances together, that he was the man that took your watch? - I verily believe it; I did not see him take the watch from me.</p>
               <p>How long time had elapsed, from the time you felt your watch go, to the time you said to Connelly, Sir, you have got my watch? - I suppose, not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>This was at noon day? - A little after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>You had had with this man in the court, some conversation; some altercation passed? - Not a word; it was with another man behind me; a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner Connelly thoroughly searched; and had you any idea, that he, at that time, after he was searched, had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240199"></xptr>watch in his possession? - I do not believe he had.</p>

               <p>I was going into the city on Monday morning, about some business, to a wharf where was a kit of salmon to be left for me; it was not there; but coming back from the city, the coach was turning down St. Bride's-lane; curiosity led me to stop a few moments, as I did, and many thousands more, to look at the coach and the procession: I had not stopped many minutes, before the prosecutor said, Sir, you have taken my watch; good God! Sir, said I, I am surprised at that; if you will step in here, to any shop, I will satisfy you I have not got your watch; the gentleman in the goldsmith's shop, sent for an officer to search me; there was nothing found upon me, but a fifteen pounds note, and six guineas; the gentleman said to me, can you get my watch? I said, good God, Sir, it is impossible: Sir

               <p>Being Easter Monday, I went to see the children walk, and found a watch in the street: these men saw me in the street, and they took and searched me, and found the watch in my fob; they took me to the Compter, and brought me before the Alderman, and I was committed.</p>

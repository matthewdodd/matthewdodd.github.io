                  </hi>.

I am an undertaker, of Brixton Hill-my mother wished to dispose of two cows, and on 27th March the two prisoners called—I asked them 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the cows-Palmer spoke first; Clement stood a little distance away—they came again next day, and Palmer asked if I was going to take the money he had offered, which was 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I could not, but I would take 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-Clement called out from a distance "Can you make a deal, governor?"—I said "No, he is too hard"—they went away together in a cart, and came again on Friday afternoon together, and I sold them the cows for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Palmer paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and on the Monday evening they called for the cows and took them away—about two months afterwards I saw Palmer in Camberwell New Road, and said "How about this cheque?"—he said "Has not Mr. Clement paid it?"—I said "No, he has not"—he said "If you will let it rest I will speak to Clement about it"—that was all that passed—I have never got the money.</p>

I am the brother of John Harman-my sister handed me this cheque about the end of April, and I palled on Palmer and told him I had brought the cheque which had been sent from the bank, marked "Refer to drawer," and that it had been given for my mother's cows—he said "Oh, has not that been paid"—I said "No, it has not been paid; you need not appear strange about it, for I have heard that you have had other cheques returned in the same way"—he said "I am very sorry; I took the cheque from Clement, I will see him about it"—he said that Chivers was going to the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>, and Clement said "I wish you would take this cheque into the City to pay it to somebody," and Chivers said "No; I had rather have gold"—I said "I have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and will oblige you with that," and that he gave the gold to Clement, who gave him the cheque—he said "I will go down and see him about it to-morrow morning," and an appointment was made to meet him at his house at 11 o'clock next morning—on the next morning, about 10.15, I went to the Elephant and Castle public-house, where I saw Clement and Palmer, with others—I said to Palmer "Oh, you are not at home, I will save you the journey now I am down here; will you speak to Clement"—he said "Wait a few moments; go outside," and I went outside alone-Clement came out first, and went across the road to his own yard which adjoins his house, and in a few minutes Palmer came out—I said "Now, Palmer, Clement has gone over the road; what about the cheque?"—he said "Well, we will go over and see him"—we went over, and Palmer spoke to Clement outside-Clement said "Oh, you have come about that cheque, have you; you make my name stink about that"—I said "I have not made your name stink; I think it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman, of 21, Charterhouse Lane—on 5th August, Palmer, who I knew before, called on me and purchased meat to the value of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me in payment this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Clement—I said, "Is this cheque from the same person as you gave me one before?"—he said "Yes, it is all right;" and I gave him the change—I did not know who the drawer was—I sent it through the bank, and in two or three days it was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—two or three days afterwards Clement was pointed out to me in the market, and I told him I thought I had a cheque of his—he asked me to let him see it; I did so, and he said "Yes"—I said "I think there is some mistake about it, perhaps you will cash it"—he said "No; Palmer ought to have paid the money in for this cheque; I saw him in the market a few minutes ago; I will go and bring him over to you;" but he never came back—I saw Palmer a few days afterwards, who said that it was Clement's cheque, and he must meet it, and he would go and find him and bring him to me—I did not see Palmer again till he was in custody—I had had cash transactions with him before, and two cheques of Clement's.</p>

A few of our customers' accounts are continually overdrawn—we did not strictly pay the money according to the, directions of third persons on the slips—Palmer, who did" not keep an account with us, used to write the directions down—I dare say there are fifteen of these slips which bear Palmer's directions, they represent a con<lb></lb>siderable sum of money, which Palmer almost invariably paid in in cash—there may have been a conversation in which Clement said that he was going to oblige Palmer and give him cheques, as he had no banking account, but I do not remember it, and we should not recognise it, but had anyone paid in money to Clement's account with a direction, we should consider it.

I am a meat salesman of the Metropolitan Market, next door to Mr. Taylor—on the 16th September, Palmer called about 9 o'clock a.m., and brought a carcase of a lamb for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, dated 9th September, drawn by F. Clement, in favour of Mr. Collingham—a clerk gave him change, and referred him to me-for my permission to take it—he said "Oh, it is all right, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is Mr. Clement's account"—I paid the cheque into the bank, and it was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—I wrote to Palmer, but received no answer—I sent my clerk to Palmer's and to Clement's; I afterwards called on Clement as he was the nearest—he said "It has nothing to do with me; you must see Palmer"—I said "But you are the drawer of the cheque"—he then, said "However I will call and pay you to-morrow"—I have never received the money.</p>

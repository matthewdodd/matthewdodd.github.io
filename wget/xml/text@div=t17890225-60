(produced and respectively deposed to.) Some I found up stairs in a room which adjoins the prisoner's bedchamber, that looked like a warehouse-room; there was some hemp and some cotton, and some other articles, it was not furnished as I could see, and some in a closet up stairs; the closet door was shut, not locked; I found the rest in that room and in a closet, and some below stairs in a back-room which adjoins his kitchen; it had been a drinking room.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it an open room? - Yes, it is at the back of the kitchen, the things were laying about the back-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You went alone to execute this search warrant? - I did not, one Bear and another man went with me, who had the search warrant; the things have been safe ever since.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a headborough, I attend the Public-office in East Smithfield, and I am an officer of the four counties beside; some of the things were in a closet up stairs, and there were more in a chest, they were all loose about the floor; this man keeps a public-house on Saltpetre-bank; it was the 11th of February, the man made no objection to any searching of the house, he behaved very well to me; the man was admitted to bail at first, there was a quarrel between the other officer and Bear before he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the room below stairs, in which some of these things were found, was next the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the kitchen a place where the people used to sit and drink in? - No, there is a very large tap-room; the kitchen and the other room in which some of the articles were, is at the back of the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Was it a private room, or such a room as people might go to drink in occasionally? - Such a room as people might go into occasionally.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in that room were these goods found? - There are two cupboards in that room, but they were open, some of the things were in them, and some laying on the floor.</p>

               <p>I was servant to the prisoner at the time this happened, I lived with him three months; there was a man that boarded and and lodged in the house for a fortnight, he passed for a ship's carpenter, his name was Davis, and he left some of the things there, and there were more people came with him in company, and they left some things; he got into my master's debt to the value of five or six and twenty shillings, and he left them there till they should be called for.</p>
               <p>Did any of the other persons owe your master any money? - They owed some money for some beer, and they left these things and were to call for them.</p>
               <p>Do you know at what time any of those were left? - About three weeks or a month before Christmas; what Davis and the other man left was not at the same time, but at other times, all before Christmas.</p>
               <p>In what part of the house used these things to be kept? - My master desired me to put them in the kitchen, they were publicly open there, they were not concealed from any body; I did not continue with him till the officer came, I cannot tell how long they were there; my master never could find or hear any thing of Davis since he went away in his debt.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you live with your master? - Three months; Davis brought some tools.</p>
               <p>Which of them did he bring? - The things that were produced.</p>
               <p>You say that Davis, about three weeks, or a month before Christmas, brought some things to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - It was wrapped up in a basket, I never opened the basket, I was in the tap-room when he brought them in;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250078"></xptr>he did not open the basket, nor I did not open the basket.</p>
               <p>What became of the basket? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How do you know what was in it? - Because he said they were tools, and to take care of them; I did not see the basket open, I do not know what was in it, only he said they were his tools; the basket was left at my master's.</p>
               <p>Is the basket there now? - It was a basket like this, I cannot say what became of the basket, I cannot say what became of the tools, only they were put by; there were people in company with Davis at other times; and the next week after that somebody else brought tools, they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>In another basket? - Yes, and bags too, and the people came in to drink with Davis.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay? - Till six in the afternoon, I cannot say what time they came in, it was about twelve I believe.</p>
               <p>Did they come any more? - No, I never saw them afterwards, I did not hear their names, I was busy about the house.</p>
               <p>How came they to leave their tools? - They said they would call for them again, I staid with my master after that two months.</p>
               <p>Did you stay with your master till he was taken up? - No, I was away, I have left my master three weeks to-day; they never called for their things afterwards; they owed my master for some beer, I cannot tell how much; the man brought them into the tap-room, and I brought them into the kitchen; my master desired me to take and put them backwards into the kitchen, till he had time to put them by; he put them by when he had time, some of them the next day, I did not see him put them by; they were put by at different times; I cannot tell how my master put them by, I did not see my master take them out, I never took them out, he put them in a great chest as he said; I did not see him, I saw them there; he said if any body called for them they were there; he put them altogether in a great chest, that great chest stood in a drinking-room; he told me if he was out of the way they were there.</p>
               <p>How came he to take different people's property out of their bags and boxes, and put them altogether in one chest? - I did not see him doing it.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that you saw them in the chest? - Yes, I went there for some other things, there were some other things with them in the chest.</p>
               <p>What other things? - I do not know; jackets and coats, and things, the chest never was locked, they were all together; the workmen appeared like carpenters, Davis called himself a carpenter shipwright; I cannot tell where he lived.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me whether any of these people called for their tools since? - Not that I know of, I have seen none of them since.</p>
               <p>You staid staid two months afterwards? - Yes; Davis kept them above three weeks, a month before Christmas, the day of the month I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to any one of the prosecutors. Is not it a common thing for carpenters to leave their tools at a public house? - It is a common thing.</p>
               <p>The publicans have no difficulty in taking them until called for? - Not in the least; I have done it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a common thing to leave such a number of tools as these for drink, from six to twelve, and not call for them for two months? - No, not such a quantity.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who all gave him a very good character, one of whom is a publican, and deposes that he had frequently had tools left with him for a month, sometimes for a fortnight or three weeks, and that he has had eighteen planes at a time left with him.</p>

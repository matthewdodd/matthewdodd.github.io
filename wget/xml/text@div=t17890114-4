               <p>On Monday the 29th of December, between six and seven in the evening, I went out: I left my wife and children in the back room. I returned in about three or four minutes, and saw two men at the door, one with his back towards me, and one with his face towards me. I found the one with his back towards me had a new kettle; I collared him, and the other ran away; I took him into custody, and sent for a constable, and took him before Mr. Justice Parker. The kettle had stood on a shelf, in the shop-window; I am positive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140026"></xptr>it was mine. I left nobody in the shop when I went out; the shop-door was not fastened, I only pulled it to after me; it had a spring-latch, which opens both inside and out: I can't positively say whether I latched it or not when I went out.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prosecutor's son-in-law, and manage the business of his cellar. On Sunday, 5th March, I went into the cellar, and missed five gallons of brandy from a cask, which was full on the Saturday—I also missed about two gallons of rum, and about twenty gallons of wine—I called the prisoner into the kitchen, and told him I thought he had been rob<lb></lb>bung us—he said if I would walk out of the kitchen he would tell my mother—he said he had given a man they call <hi rend="italic">The Lawyer</hi> (his name is Curran) a bottle of brandy, and they drunk the rest on the premises; they had been drinking for about six weeks, and were tipsy every day for six weeks—the other man was taken, and remanded for a week, and then dismissed—the prisoner said he had got into the cellar by pushing away a cask.</p>

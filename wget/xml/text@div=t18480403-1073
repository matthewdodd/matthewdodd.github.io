                  </hi> I am the wife of Charles Hancock, of 28, Essex-street, Commercial-road. On 17th Feb., about twelve o'clock at night, I was with Mary Ann Ward, going through King's Arms-court, Whitechapel—it is a vary narrow court, and we were obliged to walk separately—I went first—when I got about the middle of the court I saw the prisoner standing on the right—I never saw her before—she looked under my bonnet and said, "Is that you?" or, "That is you"—she gave me a severe blow in the right eye, which made me nearly senseless—I have deprive of my sight ever since—I do not think it bled—I did not see anything in her hand.</p>

                  </hi> I am single, and live at 1, King's Arms-yard.

I saw the prisoner and Hancock—Han<lb></lb>cock's eye was swollen, and in a most dreadful state—there was a little blood—I took her to the hospital—Ward was bleeding profusely from a cut on the forehead—the prisoner was quite sober—I do not think she wore a ring.</p>

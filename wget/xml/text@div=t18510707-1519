                  </hi>. My father keeps the Adam and Eve, at Peckham. On 8th July I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Vesper</hi> steam—boat; it arrived at Blackwall at 5 minutes before 10 o'clock in the evening—I was in a small paddle—box cabin—I came out of it, and crossed the deck to get on shore—there were some coals lying about the centre of the deck—as I passed along I felt a slight twitch on my left side, between my arm and my body, and I missed my watch from my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I knew it was safe within two minutes—I was wearing it with this chain—I found this hanging down—I turned round and accused the prisoner of it directly—he was close to my elbow—I told him I did not like to accuse any person wrongfully, but I felt convinced he was the man that had my watch—he said he had not—I told him I was certain be had—he moved towards the cabin I had come from, and he beckoned me—I followed him, and a man and a woman came up—the man wanted to interfere to say something, and the woman put her hand up to pre<lb></lb>vent it—while this was doing a little boy came up who had my watch—the prisoner was by, but he said nothing that I am aware of—I took him off the steam-boat, and gave him in charge on the pier—he said he thought I might have dropped the watch, and he asked me if I had—I said, no, I was certain I had not—the watch could not have dropped—I had several friends with me—one of them, Mr. Tanner, was behind me; the others were before me—my chain was not broken; the swivel attached to the watch was—this ring was; on the watch—it was not broken when I last saw the watch safe—it is now broken. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

            . I live at Bow-common, Bromley. On the 20th of August I lost my watch, chain, and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose them - A. I don't know; I came from the East India tap; I got intoxicated; I went home; and between that and home I lost the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether before you left the East India tap you had them - A. I know I had them before I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any public house before you arrived at Bromley - A. I went into the Mulberry-tree; there I fell asleep; and when I awoke I was perfectly sober. I did not miss my watch then.</p>
               <p>MR. LETTER. I am a pawnbroker; I live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On the 22d of August, the prosecutor's wife informed me that her husband had been robbed; and, before that, the woman prisoner had pawned a silver-watch with me, in the name of

            ; and on the 22d, in the evening, the man prisoner came to redeem some goods. I asked him if he had not heard of a man being robbed at Bromley. I told him that his wife had pledged a watch, and it was the watch that was lost. I sent for an officer; the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160051"></xptr> ran away. I called, stop thief; he ran about two hundred yards before he was taken. I have kept the watch from that time till now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the watch I lost; it is mine. I am not sure where I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the watch in the open road, Bromley. I took it home, saying, I had been fortunate by finding a watch. Being a poor man, my wife pledged it for one pound. I am innocent of any felony. The prosecutor knows me; I had not seen him for more than a week before he lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the prisoner; he bears a very honest character.</p>

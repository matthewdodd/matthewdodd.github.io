                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a miller at 65; Grande Rue Boulogne, Paris—I arrived in London on 30th December—I met a soldier soon after, and remained with him till about 5.30, when I left him, and walked about for two hours—I then went to a public-house—I saw the soldier there again, and the prisoner—they spoke together, but I did not understand them—I left the public-house by myself, and ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards the prisoner and the soldier rushed upon me—the prisoner took hold of me by the throat—they put their hands into my pockets and took my money—my knee was scratched and my trousers torn—they took 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, two franc pieces, and some papers, and ran away—I went to the police-station—the prisoner was brought in, and I recognised him at once—I had only drunk about two glasses the whole day—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Victoria Yard, Chelsea, and am a furniture salesman—on the evening of 30th January, about 9 o'clock, I was in the Coach and Horses—Halle was there talking to two soldiers, and the prisoner was sitting on the bench—he got up to speak to Hallo several times—the tall soldier left first, and then Halle left, and the prisoner followed—the prisoner had been annoying Halle—he came back to the public-house about a quarter of an hour after, and said to a woman sitting there with a white apron on "What do you think of that French<lb></lb>man? he went and bought sixpenny worth of cigarettes, and would not give me one; but I got the b——'s money"—I went outside, and saw Halle with the two policemen, and I said "There's the man inside," and I told them the very words—Halle was excited; he could not speak English.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not say at the police-court that two soldiers went out together, and you followed after—there were two soldiers in company—the tall soldier went out, Halle followed, and you followed him—you were the third to go out—the other soldier did not go till some time afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, at Wanstead. I knew William Reed when he was alive—he was a labourer at Wanstead—I know the prisoner—one day last month, he and Reed and I, my father, and a man named Connor were engaged in pulling down a shed belonging to Mr. Kennerton—we were removing the remaining part of the shed in a cart—I and Connor were on the shafts, and Reed and Jolly were <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> behind—when we got between Mr. Finnis's gate, and Mr. Brown's lodge, Reed said that Jolly did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> enough, and struck him somewhere about the body—it was no particular blow—they might have four or five rounds—it might last ten minutes, tumbling and falling about—the falling was the worst—there was no particular blow, but Reed was striking Jolly a round or two afterwards, and Reed overreached himself and fell, the road being a bit <hi rend="italic">slippy,</hi> and he cut a bit of skin out of his forehead and down his nose—I persuaded them to leave off, and I thought Reed would have struck me—I and my father parted them—Reed did not like being parted at all—Jolly was agreeable to leave off—Reed seemed to walk very well after that—we then came on for 100 or 120 rods, and I then left them—he walked that distance—he seemed to be a little bit <hi rend="italic">freshy like,</hi> from a drop of beer—neither of them were quite sober—we had been allowed two pints a piece, and they had had an extra seven pots unknown to us—they both seemed a little excited by drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was no regular fight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were tum<lb></lb>bling and falling about—I will not be sure whether Jolly had his coat off, but Reed had not his waistcoat off—Jolly would have left off before, Reed would not, his spirit was regular savage like.</p>

                  </hi>. I bought this shed that was pulled down—I employed the prisoner and the deceased to move the materials—I heard Reed say to Jolly, "<hi rend="italic">Shove</hi> up," and he turned round and gave Jolly three or four good <hi rend="italic">clips</hi> on the back—Jolly said to him, "Do you mean that, Sir"—he said, "Yes:" and he turned round and gave him another one or two—they then put the cart down by the side of the road, and went just on the green—I believe Jolly took off his coat—Reed was in his waistcoat—he had no coat on—they set to to fight—they had about four or five rounds—several blows passed on each side—they were struck in different parts—one severe blow that Reed had was when he fell off the grass on to the gravel which broke the skin of his forehead—that was about the third round—both of them had several falls—Reed's forehead bled—when they had had that round they came along—Jolly did not want to fight at all—Reed seemed to want to fight more than Jolly—they came on with us</p>

               <p>towards home—I then left them—I saw Reed again next morning, about eight or half-past—he came to my shed—he said he felt rather queer—he had a black eye, and a bruise on the forehead.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The fall was not occasioned by anything Jolly did, but from Reed overreaching himself in the act of striking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the grass was slippery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who picked him up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Jolly picked him up once, and Snazell picked him up once—they seemed very friendly after<lb></lb>wards—I saw no seconds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Wanstead. I was called in to see the deceased, on the evening of 11th Dec, I found him suffering under fearful erysipelas of the head and face—he appeared in a dying state—he died on 17th—he never rallied—the disease was so violent that I could merely discern a scratch on the face, one on the left temple, and one on the forehead, as though from a finger-nail or gravel—if he had fallen forward on the gravel that might have produced the appearances—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found the membranes of the brain adherent—that was caused by inflammation—the vessels of the brain were con<lb></lb>gested—the brain itself was healthy—I could not at all judge what had produced the inflammation, but inflammation readily takes place when the scalp is injured by the merest scratch—the scratch would account for the erysipelas, and the inflammation would follow the erysipelas—he died in an exhausted state from erysipelas—I should say he was of a bad con<lb></lb>stitution, not one to stand up against such a disease—I found no symp<lb></lb>toms of violence in other parts of the body, no laceration or any broken bones—the skin was a little discoloured on the shoulders—I am of opinion on the whole that the erysipelas originated in consequence of the bruise on the forehead, and that death was the consequence of exhaustion fol<lb></lb>lowing the erysipelas—I saw no other mode of accounting for the death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand, in your judgment the patient died of erysipelas in the head, which his constitution had not strength enough to subdue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, an irregular life might induce such a disease—if it was induced by external injury I should attribute it to the scratch on the forehead.</p>

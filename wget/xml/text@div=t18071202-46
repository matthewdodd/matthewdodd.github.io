Between twelve and one o'clock I saw this man coming up from the building; I asked him what carried him down to the buildings, he made no answer, he was about two foot from the building; I told him he should go no further; I put my hand to his waistcoat, he had three chisels in his waistcoat pocket, his hand was over them, keeping them together; I put my hand to his breast, I felt this saw inside of his waistcoat, and down his small clothes; he and I fell in the scuffle. There was another at the back of his waistcoat, down his waistcoat, and down his breeches he had three saws and three chisels; I thought he would overpower me, he made a pass at me with a chisel; he and I fell, I called for assistance, I desired

               <p>Q. We understand that he is deaf and dumb. - A. Yes; when he was between six and seven years, he was taken with a putrid fever; when he got better he was deprived of his speech, a piece of the jaw bone came off and two teeth, he cannot speak, he cannot hear a gun go off; sometimes his head swells and the swelling breaks; that makes him as if he was deranged in in his mind.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a great deal of cunning about him; where a man is deprived of one sense they often have it another way. - A. He is not very clever; sometimes he can work, and sometimes he cannot without his master shewing him a pattern, then he works it off; sometimes he is quite silly; I have never heard him speak since he had the fever. (The prisoner had the evidence produced to him in writing, and denied having the property.)</p>

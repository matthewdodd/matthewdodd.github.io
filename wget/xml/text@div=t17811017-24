               <p>Last Thursday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170025"></xptr> along, with a bundle under his arm, in Westminster. I pursued him, and cried out, Stop thief! I saw him drop the bundle. A man took the bundle up, and another man stopped him. I saw him take the bundle up, and give it to the constable. It was the same I saw the boy drop. I had it from the constable the next day. The constable is not here. I saw the bundle opened before it was given to the constable. The things are the same as they are mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Some of the things mentioned in the indictment are the property of my maid. She is not here. There are two partners in the house. Some things were stolen belonging to each of us. To prevent us both appearing, he gave them to me, after they were lost.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and the prosecutor deposed to two pair of stockings being his separate property.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East-lane, Greenwich. On Monday evening, 11th Dec., I was with Hewitt at a public-house in Woolwich—we left there, and she went to get me a lodging—we were not to lodge together—we went to a private house—I had been drinking—I undressed, and went to bed while both prisoners were in the room—neither of them came to bed—after I was in bed, M'Namara took a ring off my finger—it broke, and made my finger bleed—they both went away—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out I was robbed, got out of bed, and missed my waistcoat, which was on the bed, with a silver watch, guard and seal in the pocket—I afterwards saw it in the policeman's possession—I did not dress myself—I have seen the ring in the policeman's hands.</p>

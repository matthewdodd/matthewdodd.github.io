In September last I was working at the Victualling-office, at Deptford; on the 3d of September, and for three weeks after, I was backwards and forwards there, and could not so well attend to my property at home - when I came home to remain, I missed property to a considerable amount - I called my servants together, and questioned them. William Dixon was one of them - he was my stable-boy - he afterward told me he had taken some things away - in consequence of information I went with Westcoatt to the prisoner's shop; he deals in marine-stores, in Gee's-court, Oxford-street; it is a paved court, with flat stones - I saw the prisoner, and said we had come to look for pipe-moulds and other brass which I had lost, to a considerable amount; he said he had no such things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060075"></xptr>in his possession; I said, "If you have not, you had them, for the boy has acknowledged it;" he said, "I don't object to your searching; I know nothing of it;" we searched, and found nothing of mine - I said, "Mr. Barker, you you must know something of these moulds, for my boy states he sold them to you and your man, Jackson, and as you deny it, I will send for the boy;" he said I might send for who I pleased - Dixon was fetched - I said to him, in the prisoner's presence, "Do you know this gentleman?" he said, "Yes;" I said, "What did you sell him?" he said he sold him three pairs of brass moulds, and he got 8s. for the first, and 6s. a pair for the others, at the rate of 4d. a lb; we are allowed 2s. 4d. or 2s. 8d. a lb. for them as old brass, in exchange - old broken brass is worth 7 1/2d. a lb. - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, he never saw him before - I told the boy to look about and see if there was any thing of mine; he went out and looked in at the window, and pointed out these five bells; I directly claimed them - I knew them, by having mounted them for my little boys; they were marked with ink - I had twenty-four, twelve in each parcel - here is the writing on some of them, it is my hand-writing - but it is very faint and nearly rubbed off, but they are a particular sort of bells - I can swear to this, No. 4, being my own writing - I said I could swear to them - the prisoner said, "When am I to go to the office?" the officer said, "Directly;" I saw several other things there, which I think were mine, but would not swear to them - we took him to the watch-house; Dixon said it was false for the prisoner to say he did not know him, for he had seen him many a time - the prisoner still said he had never seen him: Dixon said,"Did not I sell you one pair of moulds at 4d. a lb.?" he said, "Never - how could you sell them? I never saw you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long has Dixon lived with you? A. Nearly eighteen months - the bells are not worth more than 1s. 6d. as old metal; I searched the prisoner's premises the day after I discovered my loss; I never suspected Dixon before - he denied the robbery, but confessed it in about three hours, voluntarily - I had said I would send for an officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you missed these bells? A. No; I had seen them about two months before - there are twenty-four gone.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Stevens to the prisoner's shop, and said I had a warrant to search for brass - he said we were welcome to search where we liked - Clements was with me - he staid up stairs - I went below - I could find but one piece of brass - I came up, and Dixon was sent for, and said, "This brass is part of the property I sold that man," pointing to the prisoner, who said he knew nothing whatever of him - Dixon looked into the window and pointed out these bells, and said, "This is some of the property I sold you;" the prisoner said, "I know nothing about it, or you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The boy went outside the window to point out the bells? A. Yes; any one passing could see them - the prisoner afforded us every facility to search - I had been about an bour in the shop before Dixon came.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the things you looked for bulky? A. I believe the moulds were, but we did not find them.</p>

            . In September I was Mr. Stevens's stable-boy, and took property from my master, which I sold to the prisoner; I did not know him before - it was while master was at Deptford - he paid me 4d. a lb. for brass - when I first went he asked if that was all I could get; I said I would see; and about three days after I took a pair of brass moulds - he bought them of me - they were quite whole - he paid me 8s. for them. at 4d. a lb. - they weighed 48lbs. - I saw him weigh them - I received 8s. - it was 48lbs. - he asked if I could get any more; I said I would see; the pavement was up at that time - they were repairing the sewers - I took another pair the latter end of the week, and got 6s. for them - he told me not to bring them at that time of day, as the officers were there, watching the sewers while the men went to dinner, but to bring them at eight o'clock in the morning, when they were gone to breakfast - I afterwards sold him another pair for 6s., and some bells and broken metal afterwards - I sold him one dozen bells, tied on a string, and some broken candlestick branches - when master came to town I told him of it - I was fetched to the shop afterward, and master asked if that was the gentleman I sold it to - I said it was, and pointed out these bells and this piece of brass - I cannot swear they are part of what I sold him - I got 6d. for the bells.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How old are you? A. Eighteen; I lived a year and a half with master - I was about two months robbing him - I did not confess before all the other men.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in liquor. - A. I had some liquor, but not to say intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to that public-house. - A. About twenty minutes after one, I had been to the Marquis of Granby in Drury Lane, before that, between nine and ten, I drank some beer and some gin there. I had been to the Angel in Broad Street about seven o'clock, I drank beer only there.</p>
               <p>Q. About two o'clock in the morning you were at the end of Monmouth Street. - A. Yes, the prisoner and two more met me, I was shoved into the kennel, I made a stumble, I did not go quite down, I asked what it was for, and then I was knocked down, I tried to get up, I could not, the prisoner held me down while my coat was taken off my back, my coat and money were taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your coat off. - A. The party, they all assisted together, they took my coat off and took my hat, my money was in my coat pocket, two five shilling papers of halfpence, two dollars, and six shillings, the dollars and the six shillings were wrapped up in paper, I received that money a little before seven o'clock on the Saturday night, I felt it in my pocket after I came out of the watering house. When they got my coat and watch, I hollowed out watch and robbery, they ran away as soon as they saw the watchman's light. I saw the prisoner, when he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of remarking the prisoner's person so as to know him again when he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200034"></xptr>brought back. - A. No further than he was not out of my sight until he ran into Nailes Yard, St. Andrew's Street, and when he was brought back he had my hat in his hand, and his hat on his head, my coat was not found.</p>

            . I am a baker, I live in Carnaby Street, I was turning up Broad Street, the prisoner and another man was standing on the pavement, the prosecutor could not pass without touching them, whether he touched them or no I cannot say, he pushed the prisoner off the curb, and directly he pushed him again there were blows passed from each man, one man hit him with the right hand and left, I said it was a shame to use the prisoner so, the man along with the prosecutor said he would serve me so, the prosecutor stripped his coat off, and came forward and struck at me, I went of one side and shunned the blow, he fell on his face, I then said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"come along, have nothing to do with them." The prosecutor came up to me and wanted to fight with me, I said I would not fight with him, I went on, he came after me, took hold of my arm, and wanted me to stop, I would not, I kept walking on to St. Andrew's Street, he followed me and called for the other two men to come up, and when I came to the end of St. Andrew's Street, he gave his coat to one of the other two men to hold, he knocked me down in the mud, I got up and knocked him down much in the same place, then he called out, watch, robbery, then I went away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon your oath, did the prisoner ever attempt to take the great coat, or the contents of the great coat, or the hat from him. - A. He did not.</p>

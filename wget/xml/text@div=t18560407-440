Thompson, No. 9, Bunhill<lb></lb>row"—I find that endorsement on this note—I gave the note to James Phillips, a messenger in our employ, and gave him certain directions, without saying anything to the prisoner about it—Phillips returned in about an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half with the note stamped "forged," as it is now—I produced it to the prisoner, and told him it was a forged Bank of England note—he said, "It is a bed job, I know where I got it from; I got it in change"—a policeman was outside the shop, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I did not see</p>

               <p>him during the hour and a half that Phillips was gone with the note, not till I took the note to him on Phillips's return—I left him in charge of a young man named Prax, that attended to him—he is not here—I went to the police court next day.</p>

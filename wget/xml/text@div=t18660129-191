                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Morrison, a rope-maker, of Norton Folgate—on 13th June the prisoner came, and presenting this order, said, "I have come for a bolt of canvas" or some canvas—it was in an envelope—I do not know whether it was fastened, it was addressed to Mr. Morrison—I opened it and looked at it—I know Mr. Pike by name, he has dealt at the shop—I delivered a bolt of canvas to the prisoner and made an invoice out—we afterwards sent the bill in to Mr. Pike, applying for the money, and found that the canvas had been improperly obtained—I then gave information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have not you seen me before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain—this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner and receipted August</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1865), is in my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that satisfy you that you wrote that receipt on 30th August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know to whom this bill belongs—it is not made out to anybody—it is for thirty yards of canvas and some twine—I suppose it was a ready-money transaction in the ordinary way of business, either with the prisoner or some other person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you cannot remember whether this is a bill for what you sold him in August, how is it you can remember he was there on 13th June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I remember it, and I made a memorandum in our book at the time he had the goods, and here is. a. copy of the entry in the day book—I knew him again; I had known him a long time—I always knew him by the name of Crick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have I not dealt at the house thirteen or fourteen years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you have had goods for various people at various times and have"</p>

               <p>paid a great deal of money; I should not otherwise have parted with the goods—MR. Pike has been a customer, but he never had any account—it was my knowledge of you which induced me to let you have the goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you trust the prisoner personally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had not done so before; he brought orders from different farmers in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood for whom he worked, who, when they wanted this sort of material sent him for it, and up to this time they have always been correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer of Enfield—this order is not my writing or written by my authority—I never saw it till the prosecutor showed it to me—I know the prisoner—I gave him over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get some canvas to do some work for me, and after about a week he brought the work and did it in my place, and I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. over the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had advanced to him—I did not say anything about where he was to get the canvas—I know Morrison's—I have been in the habit of buying rope there, but not canvas—the prisoner is a sail-maker—I believe this was for a rick cloth—he had done the same for me two previous years.</p>

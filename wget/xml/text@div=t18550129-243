                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of Trigg's Wharf, Upper Thames-street, and have also a stand at each Corn Exchange; lam a corn merchant and wharfinger. Liddiard and Mark Ing were in my employment up to their apprehension, which was on a Saturday, the third week in Nov., I think—I know Jesse Ing; he is, I believe, a brother of Mark Ing, and is a corn dealer, he has been so rather less than two years—a man named Hayward was in my employ, and was apprehended on the same day as Mark Ing and Liddiard; he was afterwards examined as a witness against the others—Hayward was the first taken into custody; that was in consequence of something which Mr. Wall, one of my clerks, told me—Hayward made a statement to me, in consequence of which I ordered Mark Ing and Liddi<lb></lb>ard, who were on the premises, to be taken—when Liddiard was brought down, I told him I was informed that he had been robbing me—he said, "I have not; I have merely sold a few sweepings" (I never allow sweepings of flour to be sold)—I said, "It is useless for you to deny it, Hayward is in the next room) and has confessed to the system of robbery that has been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290010"></xptr>
               <p>going on"—he then said, "I am sorry, it is true"—(I had made him no pro<lb></lb>mise, nor had I told him that it would be better for him to confess)—he said, "I am sorry, it is true; I was instigated to do it by Mark Ing, who told me that it had been going on before, and had not been found out, and would not be found out now"—I then gave him into custody, and sent for Mark Ing—I told him I found that he had been robbing me, that he was the worst of the lot, and that I should prosecute him—he said, two or three times over, "I know nothing at all about it"—I gave him into custody—. my practice with reference to the delivery of goods is to send from Mark-lane one of these printed orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to the super<lb></lb>intendent of the wharf, Mr. Cook—my servants have no authority, in the first instance, to deliver goods upon a delivery order, but if an order is lodged for a large parcel, the person in whose favour the order is made may afterwards draw any portion which is still undelivered, upon his own order alone—that order would be a warrant to my servant to deliver the rest, according to the wish of the purchaser; but each time when they fetched it, the buyer's servant, or carman, would sign one of these notes, and take away the duplicate—the receipt notes are kept in a book; my servants would fill in the name of the house, and the carman would sign the name underneath, and copy the duplicate—it was Liddiard's duty to fill up the ticket, and it would then be given to the buyer's servant, showing what goods are taken and what left—the counterfoil is not signed, the name is merely filled in, and it is retained in the book—the ticket merely shows the quantity delivered; it is Mr. Cook's duty to post it through the stock book from the counterfoil into the ledger every night, or the next morning, and to endorse the buyer's order with the quantity which appears in the book—the purchaser's order remains on a file in the counting house until the delivery is completed, and then it is placed on another file with the completed orders—though the order is addressed to the superintendent, Liddiard would have authority to deliver to that order—he knew that per<lb></lb>fectly well; he was the working foreman—Mark Ing was also perfectly aware of that practice—he had been six years in my employment—he was recommended to me by his brother, the prisoner Jesse, who, at that time, was a weekly servant to me, a carman, and he had been in the habit of coming to my wharf, as carman, for the last fifteen years—Jesse Ing was never a customer of mine—I did not sell two barrels of flour to him about 11th Aug., nor did I authorise anybody else to do so, or give any delivery order to anybody for the delivery of two barrels of flour to Jesse Ing, or authorise anybody to do so—the right time for my men to come to the warehouse is 6 o'clock, but I think they come from half-past 6 to a quarter to 7 o'clock—the watchman leaves at 7 o'clock—the clerks come at half past 9 or 10 o'clock—I know Liddiard's writing—I have searched the file of delivery orders with reference to goods supplied to Jesse Ing, and find none—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came by post on a Monday evening, either the last day of the old year or the first of the new—it is in Liddiard's writing—I had another party, named Whitwell, in my employ in Aug., who was authorised to give delivery orders, as well as the two clerks and myself—it was the prisoner's duty, on the receipt of a delivery order, to give the quantity mentioned in the order, or a smaller quantity—the book is not here (<hi rend="italic">it was ordered to be sent for</hi>).—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>—"Newgate, Saturday. Dear Sir,—It is with sorrow that I am addressing you now. I should have spoken to you on Tuesday last, but my spirits would not allow me to do so.

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Benjamin Smith, a corn dealer—Jesse Ing was a customer of his, and has, I believe, kept a horse and cart—I have seen him go with a horse and cart to Mr. Rathbone's several times since Aug. last, but not previously that I am aware of—he used to go there with his cart empty, and return with it loaded—it was generally before 8 o'clock in the morning, before the clerks came—Jesse Ing has been with that horse and cart on all occasions—on 11th Aug. I saw Greenleaf there about half-past 8 o'clock in the morning with an empty cart—I saw Mark Ing carry two barrels, and place them in the cart, and Greenleaf drove away with them—I put down on this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the dates on which I saw Jesse Ing go there with his horse and cart; they are Sept. 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, when he took away three sacks; Sept. 9th, three sacks; Sept. 20th, three sacks; Oct. 13th, two sacks; and Nov. 3rd, some sacks, but the quantity I do not know—the sacks were full—I have been in Mr. Smith's employ, I think, eleven years next month—I never to my knowledge sold or delivered to Jesse Ing, from my master's place, or from Mr. Rathbone's place, any flour—I did not deliver any flour to him, or to Greenleaf on his account on 11th Aug.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). In Dec. last I was in the employ of Mr. Rathbone—I know the prisoners—it was my duty to be on the premises at 6 o'clock in the morning—I remember Jesse Ing coming one morning about 22nd November last, with his cart to Mr. Rathbone's; he has been at other times—it was his habit to come between 7 and 8 o'clock—he has been there frequently, and about that time in the morning; before the clerks were there—he has at times taken corn away with him, and at times sweepings—he never took away more than two quarters of corn at a time; that would be four sacks—he paid for them—he used to pay 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter for oats—the price of oats at that time was about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I at times received the money, sometimes Liddiard, and sometimes Mark Ing—after it was received by either of us it was equally divided—on the morning of 11th Aug. I was not present; I was ill at that time—I cannot say to a certainty how many times I have been paid in that way, and the money divided between us; it might have been a dozen times.</p>

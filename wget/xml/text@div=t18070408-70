I saw nothing else till we came to Uxbridge; we stopped there and gave our horses some corn. We went into the Sawn and Bottle public house and had some beer. Hallett was was sitting at the other side of the house; Palmer went to him and talked with him a good while; we stopped there two hours, and then we started again. Hallett followed us, he came on board the Rose in June, a good bit below Cowley-lock, and then Lindon unlocked his cupboard and took the things out; he asked Hallett if he would buy them, he said yes, he did not care if he did; Hallett asked what was the price, Lindon said fifteen shillings; Lindon packed all up in a handkerchief, all but the four tea pots. The prisoner Hallett said they must go home with him; Ratcliffe had taken them out of the boat, they all three went together, I kept on, they came back again; Ratcliffe said he had got a spade-ace, that means a guinea. I afterwards told Mr. Lee.</p>

On the 11th of September I was at the counting-house door, and saw the prisoner come to my shop, take up a parcel of 2lbs. of starch, and walk out; I called to her - she made no answer, but went into a baker's shop, about twenty yards off; I went in, and charged her with it - she denied it, and said I might search her; I searched her, but found nothing - I then took her to the constable.</p>

            . This is the paper - here is my writing on it; it was weighed for an order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You found nothing on the prisoner? A. No - I believe she told me who she was, and where she came from; I have not inquired whether her address was correct - I let her go, and then took her again: I said she must have given it to some person, or thrown it over the garden wall; I did not say I let her go because I thought two other women had taken it, nor that I was going after two other persons - the prisoner was ordered to appear at Worship-street, and she was there about five hours before I was; I do not know exactly the time I got there - I let her go at first because I found nothing on her, though I had seen her take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the box? - In the front garret, and I slept in the back garret.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the prisoner took it? - My master heard that she took it.</p>

               <p>Q. What servant was she? - A servant of all work. My master had a suspicion of her, and watched her out, and lee her pawn my table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this diaper table cloth afterwards? - Yes, my master told me of it afterwards, and I went down to the pawnbroker afterwards and see it; it was marked with my name, W, M and K.</p>

               <p>I am a soap boiler and tallow-chandler. The prisoner and prosecutor lived with me. I had some suspicion of her dishonesty, and I followed her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you his master? - I was not at that time, but my father is since dead, and I have the business. I followed her round to the pawnbroker's; there is a glass door through which I see what she pawned. I could not positively say at that time what it was, it appeared to me to be a sheet or table cloth. I went the next morning to the pawnbroker and see the table cloth there.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you could not see whether it was a sheet or a table cloth, and whether it was the thing that she carried there that you saw afterwards; you don't know, but by what the pawnbroker told you? - No, I do not.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. I produce a table cloth, a diaper one, which I took in of the prisoner at the bar in the name of Jane Wheeler, on the 18th of February, at eight in the evening. Mr. King saw it the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Smith has seen it also? - Yes, he came the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You have kept it till now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar. - I have known her for some years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. She came in her own name? - Yes; she had pawned some things before that, and redeemed them when she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what character doos she bear? - She is a widow woman. She pawned things with me and she always redeemed them. I know nothing against her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my table cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe, if the prisoner would have carried the conversation a little further, you would not have done this. She has got two children you know? - And I have two myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there would have been two and two together.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

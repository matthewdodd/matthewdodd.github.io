                  </hi>. I am a tailor at 46, New Bond Street—the prisoner was till recently my clerk and kept my cash book and ledger—I produce them—when he received money it was his duty to enter it imme<lb></lb>diately in the cash book and then post it into the ledger, and hand the money over to me at once—I have a customer named Penton, of Faversham—I cannot remember sending that particular account, but it was an account of 10 guineas and would go out with the midsummer accounts—this is the original account—the receipt is in the prisoners' writing—I was at Scar<lb></lb>borough at the end of August and in Lincolnshire for two or three days afterwards—I was not in London on the 29th or 30th—Mr. Wood opened business letters in my absence—I have never received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is drawn in my favour by Mr. Penton, and endorsed in my name by the prisoner—I recognise his writing; it was not done with my authority—the prisoner had no general or special authority to sign cheques for me—I have never received the amount of the cheque—the total of my cash book for June is 5,039<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., when I balanced the book on the 29th of June—that covered the 6 months—I make it come to 10 guineas more now—the pencil figures are by the accountant—the two items of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10*. and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to to the credit of Mr. Penton were not there when I cast it up on 29th June—I recognise those figures as the prisoner's—I find in my ledger an entry on 29th June 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Penton's credit—the reference is 29th June opposite the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I find entered in the ledger "By Cash 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and a reference "folio 12 cash book"—in another ledger 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10*. is entered, with a similar reference to the cash book—the cheque is receivable, "29th August, 1878,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am in a large way of business—I have no clerk but the prisoner, who assists me—no one else has anything to do with the books but the prisoner and myself—Wood is trimmer and general salesman—he makes entries in the books and has received cash—this cheque was from a customer in the country—I was out of town when it was received—I am aware of the circumstances of its receipt, and that Wightwick, a linen<lb></lb>draper, a neighbour of mine, received it from the prisoner—he cashed it over his counter—he is frequently in my shop—I know him well—the endorse<lb></lb>ment is "J. C. Wells" and "G. J. B." the prisoner's initials—it was cashed by Mr. Wightwick, and handed by him into the bank with the prisoner's initials upon it—the forgery I complain of is that my name is signed by the prisoner with his initials upon it—customers pay small accounts over the counter, and we often find it necessary to give them cash in change for cheques—if a cheque is payable to bearer and he was short of cash, the assis<lb></lb>tant would go across to my neighbour and ask him for change—that is the usual practice if payable to bearer, but not ii payable to order—in that case Mr. Wood would go across and borrow money and give an I O U—the prisoner was to receive moneys if I was not there; if he was out Mr. Wood would do so—the prisoner had no authority to get the cheques cashed ft short of money, except when payable to bearer—if short of cash Mr. Wight<lb></lb>wick would oblige us, and he cashed this cheque—an accountant has been through the cash book this Christmas—I balance the cash book every day—I go through it every night—I made the total come to 5,039<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 29th June—I was in London then—the cheque is 29th August, two months later—it comes in that half year, because it has been put in since—it should not have been entered in that half year, it should have been entered on 29th August—I have had several other dealings with Mr. Penton, and he has paid me several pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Jury.</hi> The endorsement at the back of the cheque is nothing like my writing—I could tell at once it was the prisoner's writing, and the initials are his—Mr. Wightwick knows my signature well—that receipt was signed by the prisoner with his initials the same as the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If I was not in nor the prisoner either, it was Wood's duty to enter the cash and hand me the money or the cheque when I came in—Mr. Wood opened the letters in my absence—cheques payable to order were all paid into the bank—if we had no cash Wood would go to Mr. Wightwick and give him his I O U—a cheque payable to order would not be taken to Mr. Wightwick—the prisoner had no authority to sign cheques payable to my order—Wood had authority to do so when I was in the country—cheques to order would be kept till I came back—we were never away both together—the prisoner was not allowed to open letters—he was not prohibited from doing so—he has taken cheques over to Mr. Wight<lb></lb>wick payable to order, when I have put my name on the back—if a customer comes in with a cheque and wants the difference out of it, my bank is some distance, and I sign my name on the back and send over to Mr. Wightwick for the cash.</p>

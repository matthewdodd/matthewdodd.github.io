            . The prisoner was past to our parish St. Clements from, I think, Shropshire, by the name of Varthe, last year; I was then overseer, she was deliver'd to us by a vagrant pass. She told my partner and I she belong'd to a very great family, that she had a brother that had an estate of five hundred Pounds a year, a counseller, and that she had a great many very good<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176007090008"></xptr> things in pawn, but for want of a little money she could not redeem them; and if we would write to her brother, he would send her money up to pay for the things; upon this we went and redeem'd them, among which were those three gowns; we kept them some months expecting the money from her brother, and allow'd her 2 s. a week; at last she sent us word she was taken up in the city, and desired we would some of us appear for her, we had a messenger come, and told us she had stolen many things: and after that the prosecutor's wife came, and said she had lost several things, and perticularly these 3 gowns. She describ'd one a white gown, with a string sowed to the back of it, and brought a piece of the pattern of another gown, it match'd it; and the other was describ'd. We had no doubt of the three gowns belonging to the prosecutor, and we delivered them to them in the vestry room.</p>

               <p>My husband was taken up about some goods said to be stolen, and he show'd the pieces belonging to my gown to prove them mine, and the prosecutor kept them, so she went to the parish officers, and described them, they are my own gowns.</p>

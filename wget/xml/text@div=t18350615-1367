                  </hi>. I live at No. 258, Whitechapel, in the pariah of St. Mary, Whitechapel. On the 29th of May, I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock—I was the last person up—my lad fastened my doors and windows, and I examined them after him—I was alarmed, about one o'clock at night, by persons being in my back yard—I got up, and went to my bed-room window, pushed it up, and saw two per<lb></lb>sons standing in my back yard by the side of the parlour window—I asked who was there twice—no answer was given—I then called for my blunderbuss to shoot them—I called out loudly—they immediately started off to get over the wall—I then ran to my front parlour window, and there my wife was giving an alarm to the police, who were close by—there is a court runs by the side of my house, and there the policeman took the prisoners directly—I went up stairs, and got a light; came down, and examined the lower part of my house—I found my back parlour window open, and the shutter-fastening undone—I had left it fastened with the hasp and bolt, and the window down—I went into the back yard, and found a pair of shoes and a pair of boots lying close by the water-butt—the blucher shoes had been hanging on a nail by the parlour window, and the boots on a shelf by the parlour window, the night before—I had seen them there myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the night of the 29th of May in the Whitechapel-road, next door to Mr. Wilson's house—I was alarmed by Mrs. Wilson calling "Police!" out of the win<lb></lb>dow about one o'clock—Brown the constable was with me—she told me to run round the court, for there were thieves in the back yard—I did so, and just as I got to the comer of the alley, I found Corston trying to make his escape into the road—I took him into custody, and held him against the wall, and in the mean time I saw another man jump from the wall—he tried to pass me—I put up my hand, and called Brown—he did not get by me, for Brown came and took him into custody—it was the prisoner Rome—Corston resisted, and tried to get from me by slipping his jacket over his head—in the mean time I heard something drop on the pavement, which sounded like a crow-bar—I found these matches in his jacket pocket, and a phosphorus bottle without a cork—this was as he was going to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—I returned to the street, to look for what I thought was the crow-bar, and found one at the place where I heard it drop—I went into the prosecutor's premises, and found the cork of the phosphorus bottle on the sill of the back parlour window which was broken open—I searched Rome, and found a bit of rope on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Corston's Defence</hi>, I was right opposite the prosecutor's house, along with my brother-in-law and sister—I went up the court to ease myself—two or three young men came down the court and almost knocked me down—I went up the court, and picked up the bottle and put it in my pocket—the prosecutor sung out, "Stop thief"—I came out and was taken into custody.</p>

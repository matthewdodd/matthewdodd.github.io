            . I am clerk to the Pay-office, and have been almost 33 years. I can't say I know the prisoner. It is always my business to witness receipts: here is my name to this as a witness: it is always my business to ask executors or administrators where they live, in case any future demand should be made for wages. The person that was executor to this, gave me this direction, that he lived at the Feathers, on Portsmouth common.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burgess. If money should be paid by you to a false person, who does the loss fall upon?</p>
               <p>Burgess. I never did pay any money upon a false demand yet, but this, as I know of. The company issue the money, and the owners of ships deliver that money to me; so that if I was to commit an error, the company are responsible to the owners of the ships, and I am accountable to the owner for the money I receive of them; but the company, I apprehend, would indemnify me, had I paid the money under a legal authority, (that is, a probate from Doctor's Commons.) I account with the ships husbands, and look upon myself the officer of the company.</p>

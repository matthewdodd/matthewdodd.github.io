Farden looked out two pieces of serge—the prisoner only asked for one—they were entered, and as I was packing them up, I engaged the prisoner in conversation about his firm—I asked him if they closed on boxing-day—he said, "No"—I had a good opportunity of seeing him—the two pieces were made into a parcel and given to him—one measured ninety-five yards and three<lb></lb>quarters, and the other ninety-five yards and a quarter—they were worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he signed for them in this book, "S" or "F.

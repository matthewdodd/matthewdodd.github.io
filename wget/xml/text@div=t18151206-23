Then we found the pannel of the back door going into the yard broken.There was a hole large enough for a man's head to go in and undo the bolt. When we came to the bar, there was a pane of glass broken, in a side window adjoining the door; that window looks from the bar into the tap room, and side passage. I was generally up last myself; and every night we observed the doors and windows fastened before we went to bed; I saw the door safe and fastened, and this pane of glass whole the night before. The houses is my dwelling house,I rent it. I knew the prisoner about a fortnight, from his coming backwards and forwards to my house; but I had not seen him the day before; he did not lodge in my house.

I went then for the officer, and when he came, we unlocked the bar, and went into it, and I found all the papers scattered about, and the till lying on the door; my coat was missed from the bar, I had left it the night before in the bar; I found it aftrewards on the landing place of the stairs, alongside the prisoner at the bar; that was not the place were he was standing without his jacket and trowsers, it was up stairs; I ordered him up stairs, and he had my coat under his arm. I then went with the officer, and found where he broke in, which was at the door; I saw that the door was firm and fast the night before. At the time I got up it was dark, it was about five o'clock but I can't say exactly. I had known the prisoner a fortnight; in the course of the day preceeding he was in our house, but he did not lodge in it. He was not in the house when I locked it up at night; there was not a soul in the house then, but the lodgers and our family.

The bar window looking into the passage, was broken, one pane. When that was broken, I think a man could very easily get through. I observed the back door and one of the pannels was broken; it was broken so that anybody could put their hand in, and draw the bolt. I examined the pannel, but can't tell whether it was broken from the inside, or from the outside. I saw another place where an attempt had been made with a sharp instrument, to cut the glass of the window out, which looks into the yard. I got this coat, (producing a coat,) on the stairs, lying underneath the prisoner's feet; they told me he dropped it, but that I did not see.</p>

I really believe it was the man from his running, I had not sufficient opportunity of knowing him; the trunk lay in the middle of the court, it was open, and some of the things were out, I put the things in and brought it to the watch-house; the prisoner said he was not the man, but said he was running because I called out stop thief!</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. It was half past ten? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And you stopt him, there were other men running at the same time? - Yes.</p>

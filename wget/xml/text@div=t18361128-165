                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Edwin Storer, who is in partnership with his brother—he keeps a shoe-shop on Islington Green. On the 3rd of December I was in the shop between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—the prisoner came with another woman, who asked to see some laced boots, which I showed her—the prisoner was in the same room—I saw her move her chair towards the wall, she was looking towards the boots, and turned the chair towards the boots—I was fitting the other woman—she was disputing the price after choosing a pair—the prisoner hastened the other woman, and went out before her—I left the other woman in the shop, and followed the prisoner, I asked her to walk back with me—and when she got to the door she threw her cloak down, and threw down five pairs of boots which were concealed under it—she ran away, and I ran after her—I took her back.</p>

               <p>The prisoner walked with me to the shop door, and threw her cloak off, and threw the boots down—I did not see the other woman when I came back; I had left her in the shop—the prisoner threw her cloak first, and then the boots down—there was no interval between her throwing her cloak down and the boots—there was no other person near—when I took her, she fought desperately, and took off her pattens and beat me about my head; and when I got her into the shop, she said, "b----you, I have got a knife in my pocket—I will stab you with it."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, James-street, Ball's-pond. On the 3rd of December I saw the prisoner at Mr. Storer's shop, and saw her throw five pairs of boots down—I am sure it was her—I picked them up and took them into the shop, and she ran into the road, and left these boots and her cloak against the door—I saw the other woman run away as soon as she saw the prisoner brought back by Maidens.</p>

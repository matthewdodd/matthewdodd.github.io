            . I live in the Minories, I am a grocer. On the 27th of June I was at my next door neighbour's house, which is opposite of Mr. Levy's; I think it was about eleven o'clock, I was talking to the lady of the shop. I saw the prisoner at Mr. Levy's shop, by the edge of the curb, he was looking up and down the street as if he was looking for somebody; I turned my head to speak to the lady, and when I looked at the door again I saw the prisoner with a bundle of ginghams under his arm; I thought he was going to carry them somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of the robbery soon after - A. I went to Chester key, and when I returned my brother informed me Mr. Levi had been robbed. I immediately went over to Mr. Levy's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any particular observation of the person you saw with the ginghams - A. Yes, he had on a waistcoat the same as he has now, and a painted hat; I believe it was the prisoner, but I cannot swear to his person.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Ship alley, Wellclose square, I am a silversmith. On the 27th of June I saw the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, he was opposite of my door with these ginghams on his shoulder; he appeared very much intoxicated; he threw them off his shoulder near my door, and he laid his head upon them: Mr. Wild, whom I knew, said he had brought them from the Minories, he was going to take them to Ratcliffe Highway, but had lost the directions; a minute or two after Mr. Wild brought him to my door, and asked me to let him leave the parcel; I consented, and he throwed them into the shop; the prisoner came to the door with him; Mr. Wild gave me the goods; the prisoner and Mr. Wild went away. In about half an hour Mr. Levi enquired for the goods. I have kept the goods ever since.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I live in Angel court, Whitechapel; I have known the prisoner seven years, he is a barber. On the 27th of last month, between twelve and one, the prisoner came to my shop where I work, he asked me to let him leave them in my shop till he called for them again; I refused; they were loosely tied up in a white apron; he threw them down by my door, there were fourteen pieces, I tied them up tighter and told him to go; then he said would I lend him eighteen pence to pay his reckoning where he had been drinking; I refused that; he had been drinking at the Four Awls in Lemon street; I enquired there and found he had been there with the bundle; I asked him where he brought the bundle from and where he was going; he said he brought it from the Minories and was going to take it to Ratcliffe Highway, facing Old Gravel lane; he was very much intoxicated, he said he came from the Four Awls; I told him I would go along with him and see that they were taken care of till he came to the shop. When he came to Mr. Renshaw's door he throwed them off his shoulder and laid his head upon them. I knew Mr. Renshaw, I asked him if he would be kind enough to take care of them till he brought a proper order where to take them to.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I must declare the truth before Almighty God and this honourable court. I have a wife and four children to support; I am a barber and take in porter's work; I have been seven years in his Majesty's service, I have a fracture in my head, and go by the name of the mad barber; at the time I was called to carry this parcel by a man, I had been drinking the whole of the day, I did not know the man that called me; I was near the prosecutor's house waiting for a man that was gone in the Tower; I took the goods to carry for the man, he said he would follow me, I did not know but he was behind me; I turned round and missed the man; I went with it to the Four Awls, I saw an acquaintance, and after we had the beer we called for I asked the man to carry the parcel, for I could not carry it any further; I fell down and went to sleep, I was awoke by the passengers, who told me I should lose the parcel; I then took it to an acquaintance of mine in Lemon street, I asked him to let me leave it at his stall, he refused, he said he did not think all was right, he would go to the office and acquaint them with it; I said go, and I will wait for you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> I was present when Potts had the conversation with Howe—I was assisting Howe to examine the book—I could not find the name of Rodgers or Holmes—the name of Howes was mentioned, and to assist him I went up to the counting-house for a list of cash sales, and looked for any name that might be similar—I found the name of Howes, and said, "Is that it? "—he at once said, "Oh! yes, that is it"—I found out the entry to Howes in it referred to quite another matter—it was a Mr. Howes in the Curtain Road, and referred to Brussels carpet—the only entry to Driver was the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I examined the Cork carpeting at Holmes's—it was one of our patterns from our own engaged blocks—the blocks from which it was printed are our own property—we have patterns similar to those found at Mr. Driver's—I found no entry in the name of Crampin in the book.</p>

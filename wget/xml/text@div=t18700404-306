                  </hi>. I live at 31, Hertford Street—in the year 1869 I had seen the prisoner Godfrey, he had some conversation with me on the subject of regattas, and I subscribed a guinea and gave it to him—I subscribed to more than one regatta in 1869—this is my genuine signature to this subscription list marked "A" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is headed now "The Tottenham Annual Rowing Match, 1869"—I did not in 1869 sub<lb></lb>scribe to the Tottenham Annual Rowing Match—on 8th March last Ashton came to me, he sent in these lists by my servant—I sent them back to him—he ultimately came in and brought in the lists with him—I asked him if this was an annual regatta—he said yes, one had taken place last year—I asked if he was authorized to collect subscriptions for this regatta—he said he knew one of the committee, and that he was authorized—I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187004040004"></xptr>
               <p>when this regatta would take place—he said when sufficient money had been collected—I further asked him if he lived at Tottenham—he said he did not—I asked why he was collecting subscriptions—he said because he had plenty of time, and he knew the parties—I then gave him a guinea—I gave, certain directions to my servant, and he was taken in custody—I had never seen Ashton before to my knowledge—I had seen Godfrey, he stutters very much—I think I saw him more than once in 1869, but I could not be cer<lb></lb>tain as to the exact number of times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Athton.</hi> I did not take the papers in myself, I sent them in by the ser<lb></lb>vant, and said I would call in half-an-hour. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The papers were given to me first by my servant, as having been brought by the man that was waiting—I returned them, and said I would see the man, and they were then brought in by him—I did not receive any receipt for the guinea, I thought my signature sufficient; but I have kept a list of the regattas to which I have subscribed—I subscribed to fifteen or sixteen this year—I may or may not have given the paper upon which my genuine signature appears, to Godfrey—I can't say I paid him the guinea to which that refers.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C R</hi> 37). On 8th March I was called to Lord George Hamilton's house, and took Ashton into custody—Lord George Hamilton said in his presence that he should give him into custody for obtaining a guinea by false pretences—after we got out of the house Ashton said, "There is a man down here who gave me this parchment"—I let him walk on, and I walked by his side—he walked up to Godfrey, and said, "This is a pretty mess, Bill"—Godfrey said, "It's all right"—I told Godfrey I should take him into custody for being concerned—at the station Ashton said that Godfrey gave him the parchments, and Godfrey said another man gave them to him, but that he did not know the man—I have been to Tottenham and made inquiries, both at the boat-house and the public-houses—no such thing was ever known as an annual regatta or rowing match—I searched Godfrey at the station, and found on him a farthing and an ink-bottle—on Ashton I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—I asked Godfrey for his address—he said he had got no fixed residence, be lodged anywhere where he got the money to pay his lodging at night—Ashton gave his address as 5, Elliot Court, Old Bailey—that was correct.</p>

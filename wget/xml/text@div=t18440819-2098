I am the son of Isaac Fordham-Conyer was in his warehouse for eight years—it was his duty to sell things during my absence, and to put them down on the slate, but he had particular orders not to serve Hatwell at dinner-time, when I was not there—Hatwell is a hawker, and frequently came to buy goods—on the 23rd of July, Hatwell came a few minutes before one o'clock, and bought goods which came to 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw him and Conyer motion to each other while I was turning to reach the goods—when I hud served Hatwell he went</p>

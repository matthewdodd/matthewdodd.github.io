            . I live in Chapel-street, Pentonville, and am a Police-constable. I was on duty in the Lower-road, Islington, on the 27th of May, about a quarter before three o'clock in the morning - I saw three men cross the road in a direction from Tuffnelplace towards Green Man's-lane; I followed them, suspecting them - they saw me, and ran away; I sprung my rattle, and called Stop thief! in my pursuit I picked up a hat, with a piece of flannel in it - I lost sight of them for about a minute at the bottom of the lane, and then saw some constables in pursuit of them; I did not see them taken, for I went in another direction, thinking to meet them - they were taken before I came up; I found the prisoners in custody of Canty and Meadows - when I came up Vincent said, "That is my hat, but you have put something into it;" we took them to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300015"></xptr>then went to Tuffnel-place, and found Mr. Pugh's garden-gate ajar - I went in, and found some things scattered about on the lawn; the kitchen window was up, and the shutter was bored with a centre-bit - the bar was bent; the shutter was lined with iron, but the centre-bit was used as far as it could be - I went into the dining-room, found the drawers open, the things in confusion, and thrown about; I have brought what I found on the lawn here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You lost sight of the persons for three or four minutes? A. No - I lost sight of one of them; I never said I could not swear to them, I said I had not the least doubt of them - they were out of my sight for a minute; I do not swear to them certainly.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 27th of May I heard a rattle spring in the Lower-road - I stood where I was in Tibberton-square; I heard a foot advancing to me, and three men ran right abreast of me - I sprang my rattle, crying Stop thief! I was immediately assisted by other officers, and stopped them; they took two roads - I stopped Richmond, and Meadows stopped Vincent, who had no hat on - Richmond did not get out of my sight; I found on him three table and three desert spoons, one tea and one caddy spoon, one pair of sugar-tongs, and one shift; they were in his body coat - also a pair of woman's lace boots, a pair of child's shoes, and he had an umbrella in his hand; he said I had a prize, nothing more - I gave the things up to the inspector of our division, and got them from him this morning; I know they are the same as I gave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that? A. I marked them all, except the umbrella, and that mark is worn off by the heat of my hand to-day - I marked the shoes J. C. on the soles.</p>

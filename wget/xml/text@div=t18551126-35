                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Long-lane, Bermondsey. On Saturday evening, 27th Oct., I was on Southwark-bridge, about 10 minutes before 8 o'clock—I sat down on a bench seat, very near the right hand toll gate, on the City side; a soldier came and sat down near me—it was the prisoner—I looked towards him, and observed his person was as naked as he was born—perfectly so—he was some feet behind me—his face was rather towards me—I saw his private parts—I did not notice his shirt nor his trowsers—I saw his person completely—I got up instantly, and called him a nasty dirty fellow—I got up and he came after me—his small clothes were undone, he was just in the same position—I went to the toll gate, and he made his way to the first archway on the left—I did not follow him—there was another woman there who is in the habit of being about the bridge—he went towards her several times—I went and spoke to Mr. Ashley, and I saw a policeman come through the gate—it appears he had been spoken to by Mr. Ashley—the policeman went after the prisoner—I did not go after the policeman, but I saw the prisoner struggling with the policeman—I had given information to Mr. Ashley of what had taken place on the bridge—I went to the Mansion House on the Monday morning following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the toll keepers on the Southwark-bridge. On Saturday evening, 27th Oct., I was at the right hand toll gate, on the City side—the last witness came to me at nearly 8 o'clock—she made a complaint to me—I communicated to the policeman what she had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260045"></xptr>
               <p>said to me—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody of that policeman, Gaul—he was taking him off the bridge—he went quietly just through the gate, but very soon afterwards I heard a scuffling noise—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he wanted to run through the gate on to the bridge, but I stopped him—he said, "You know me, let me go"—I had seen him before—I detained him—Mr. Homes came and assisted me to detain him till Gaul came up again, and took the prisoner—Gaul's left eye was bleeding—the blood was running down his cheek—the prisoner appeared to me as if he had been drinking, but I think he was capable of knowing what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 487). On the evening of 27th Oct., I was on duty, and Mr. Ashley told me that a female had complained to him of a soldier on the bridge in a very indecent state—I went along the left hand side the bridge, and saw the prisoner standing on the middle of the pavement—his trowsers were undone, and his person quite exposed—he was not doing anything, but standing with his hand down against his person—he was three or four feet from the wall standing on the middle of the pave<lb></lb>ment, his face was towards the gate—there was a gas light just by—I saw him plainly—I made him do up his trowsers, and took him—I asked him what he meant by such beastly conduct—he said he should continue doing so as long as he thought proper—I took him into custody—he walked quietly with me through the gate to the City side, and just as he got on this side he said, "Let me go; if you don't let me go, I will kick you in the private parts, and injure you for life"—I said, "I will take good care you don't do that"—he walked about four or five yards further, and then com<lb></lb>menced kicking—he threw himself on his back, and still continued kicking upwards, trying to kick me in any part he could—I attempted to lay hold of him by the collar, and in stooping to lay hold of his collar, I caught his foot in my left eye—it was a very violent kick indeed—a great deal of blood ran out of the eye, and out of the nostrils—the moment he kicked me, it threw me back, and he got up and ran away—I immediately called out, "Stop him!" and Mr. Ashley stopped him—Mr. Homes assisted in taking him—I have been attended by Mr. Childs, the surgeon, ever since—I have been unable to do duty, and am so still.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the City Police Force. I saw Gaul on 28th Oct, he applied to be put on the sick list, in consequence of a severe contusion of the left eye—he was quite blind with that eye, and the vision of it at the present moment is very defective—a violent kick would have produced that injury—I was for some time apprehensive that he would lose the sight of that eye—I now hope he will recover it, but I fear it will be some time before they will have his services in the police—the kick to produce that injury must have been very violent.</p>

I said, I had only two pence half-penny, and was a poor working man. I do not know the prisoner. The other was an Irishman, named Maden; he is an evidence. He rifled my pockets, and took my two pence halfpenny. The other person desired him not to take it. Maden said, D - n the bougre, it will serve me to buy a pint of purl. He had a stick in his hand. Then he looked at my legs, and saw I had an old pair of boots on. He bid me pull them off, and said, if I would not, he would. He pulled them off; I believe the other person at that time laid his hand on my shoulder; then Maden took my coat off, and said, D - n your eyes, you bougre, let us have the handkerchief from your neck.</p>

               <p>Summer. I did not see any thing in his hand; all the words I heard him say, was when Maden was pulling my boats off; then he said, Pull them off; make no words about it. The same night I met Maden in East Smithfield, with my boots on: I collar'd him; he struck me, and I struck him; we were up and down several times. At last he stripped himself out of his jacket, which I had hold of, and ran away. He was taken the next day by one of Justice Fielding's men.</p>

The evidence came up to me. It was a very moon-light night; he had a stick in his hand; he clapped it across my breast, and bid me stop, and said, Give me your money. I said, I have none. He said, Give it me, and don't look about you. I gave him a six-pence. He searched my right hand pocket, and took out a green silk purse, with a silver two-penny piece, two silver pennies, and a pair of Bristol-stone studs. He said, I had more, and made use of many bitter words, and said, You bougre, you have more money yet. He took out some, (I heard it chink) he said, Here is some cash here. He called Nicholls, and bid him search me. Nicholls took one buckle out of my shoe, and the evidence the other; they were plated buckles. Then he bid Nicholls take my hat and look at it. Nicholls took my hat and looked at it, and gave me his, and put mine on. Then the evidence said, You have a good coat on, we must have it. Then Nicholls pulled one sleeve off, and he the other. Nicholls doubled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210006"></xptr> it up, and took it upon his arm. Then the evidence said, You have a good pair of buck-skin breeches on, we must have them. No, said Nicholls, don't take them, let him go about his business. Then Maden said to Nicholls, Deliver me my pistol. Whether they had one or not, I don't know; I saw none. Then they bid me go along, and make no noise, and left me. They did not use me ill. I never found any of my things again. They both of them had blue jackets on, and the evidence had a pair of boots on.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the men?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am. I saw them, I believe, fifty yards before they came up to me, as they came over a bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I did not. I saw them the Tuesday after at Justice Camper's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you?</p>

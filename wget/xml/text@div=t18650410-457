He pretended to buy four tubs, charging thirty-five shillings for them, when their real market value was five shillings, and promised me ten shillings. He also bought some iron weights and a measure, and defrauded Mr. Davis more or less, and promised to pay me for shutting my mouth. I wrote three or four thousand addresses for him at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per thousand, but he never paid me a halfpenny. I quarrelled with him about money, and he told me if I came to a certain trial where he was charged with defrauding the London Parcels Delivery Company, he would pay all outstanding debts; but as soon as he got my services he broke faith with me, and did not pay me a halfpenny. He gave me the cheque to get changed, and I said, "I have got half what I ought to have, and I will keep it." He took me to Guildhall before Alderman Phillips, who told him he ought to pay me.

The prisoner was employed by us to make stocks - we supplied him with the materials. On the 17th of May, about two o'clock, he came for a piece of black holland - we had got none, and on his entering the shop I ordered him out - he insisted on coming in, and sat down for a few minutes; I insisted on his leaving, and he did so; he had sat close against the counter, on which the gloves were - he came again in half an hour to apologize for abusive language to me; I told him to leave the shop - he did so directly; we did not miss the gloves till the officer produced them - he was then in custody; he had not dealt with us for gloves; there are seven pair of kid gloves - they are damaged; I had seen them in our stock on the 16th; they are in our shop paper now - it has our shop mark on it, in the hand-writing of our shopman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. How many shopmen have you? A. Two apprentices - Mrs. Kipling very seldom serves: we frequently sell a dozen pair of gloves, but usually fold them in common paper; we have sent them out in the shop-paper. These gloves are spotted and damaged, and have been in the shop ever since I have been there; I should have known if they had been sold - I am in the shop all day.</p>

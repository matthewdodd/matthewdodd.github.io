            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes. On Saturday the 3d of June, I was at the Royal-oak, in Whitechapel-road; my husband and I had been out to spend the evening, it was about half-past twelve o'clock when we entered the house; we enquired at the bar for a person we wanted, and he was not there; my husband said, we will go backwards into the parlour, and see if he is there; we went in, and there sat the prisoner at the bar, and the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be sitting on good terms or bad? - A. I cannot say, she came out, and I came out with her; we went about thirty yards down Whithechapel-road, and she cried to me upon the ill usage he gave her; I said, I would not stay with him; she then said, she would not stay with him, that on Friday evening, he came and used her very ill, broke and destroyed all she had in her place; she shewed me her left hand, it was very much swelled, and she said, that was through the ill usage she had had on Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her arms black? - A. I do not know, she did not shew me her arms; we then returned to the house, and the prisoner and I had a glass of brandy each, at the bar, and a piece of bread, and then my husband and the deceased came out together with a pot of beer; my husband, and I, and the deceased, and the prisoner, all sat down together in a box, the deceased and the prisoner began to quarrel immediately after they sat down.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they man and wife, or did they only live together? - A. I did not know but what they were man and wife, till after the examination before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long they had lived together? - A. I look upon it, about two years; my husband said, what you have got to say, say at home, do not say it in a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to her? - A. He d-d her eyes and called her a b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he charge her with any thing? - A. Not that I heard at that time; then he struck her in the face with his hands clenched; I made answer, and said, do not use the woman ill, for I know to my certain knowledge that she has been a wife to you, and a mother to your child, and then he struck her again; I called him a blackguard, upon that he struck me, and sent me almost the length of the settle, and then I threw the pot at him; and my husband said, do not strike her, I have had her ten years, and never struck her in my life, and you have no business to strike her; then he called me a w-e, and I said, I was none; he said, he was not the first Jew I had had.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the deceased? - A. A painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a Jew too? - A. Yes; and then he called me w-e again, and we made a laugh at it, and we all sat down again; then they got to words again, and he said to her, I will make a small one of you; upon that, he took her by the left hand, and twisted her arm round, and fell a beating of her, then she took her arm from her right side, and made a blow at him, I thought with that it was with her hand, but presently after, he says, you have got a knife, he opened his breast, and the blood issued out; my husband said, let us be out of this, and then we went away.</p>

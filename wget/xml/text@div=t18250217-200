I did not know of his going; there were some wages due to him, but he did not apply for them; he was brought back on the Sunday following. I have an iron safe where I keep books, papers, and a cash box: it is on the right-hand side of my desk in the front parlour. Young was to bring me the key of that iron safe to my room on the first floor, when the office was closed. I was at home on the 37th of January, till five o'clock; then went to the theatre: I returned, and found the key in the back room first floor, on the table, which was its proper place. Next morning, about nine o'clock, I gave it to my female servant, to take it down to my clerk; - soon after this, my cash-box was brought up to me by Anely, my clerk; it was broken open, and all the coin taken out of it. I can swear there were five sovereigns in it, which I put in immediately before I went out on the previous evening. The box was then perfect; I locked it, and kept the key of it: there was a piece of gold coin in it the evening before, called a Louis d'or; it was gone in the morning; the prisoner was brought to me on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not seen the prisoner's father before this - he was brought to you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not promised, that if the Louis d'or were brought back, you would not prosecute him? A. No; his father brought him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no one in the boy's presence promise him that if the Louis d'or were brought back, he should not be prosecuted - or was any thing said, that if there was a confession made, he should not be prosecuted? A. No; I had not called on his father, nor did I send my brother to his father's house: I sent him with the officer to make a general search for the boy, and very likely he went to the father.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. I went to look after the prisoner. I did not promise to the father, that if the Louis d'or were produced. I would not prosecute him: I said I would use my influence with my brother not to prosecute to death. I will be on my oath that I never said, if a confession was made he should not be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILLEY re-examined. Q. What did you first say to him? - A. I asked him what could induce him to break open my cash-box? He said he was led on to it by another boy, and if I would go with him, he would point him out; and that he had not only some of the money upon him, but he had the Louis d'or. I desired him to wait till I sent for an officer; he did so, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any other person in the house to entrust with the locking up of your safe? A. Only during office hours. My clerk is a person of much more experience than the prisoner. My brother does not live with me; - the prisoner had lived two months and a day with me; - I told his father it was a very sad thing that his boy should be guilty of such a thing: he said he hoped I should be merciful; - I said, I would consider of it.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLEY re-examined. I live at Canonbury; - I assist my brother in his business, but at night I leave. On Thursday, the 27th of January, about a quarter past 7 o'clock I put one sovereign, nine half-crowns, twenty-seven shillings, and nine-pence in half-pence, in a bag in the desk. I had an office there, at the back, in which there was a comb and a knife. There are three rooms at my brother's house, and the middle room is my office. The knife was on the desk, and the comb in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a lady named Capel? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to the father at any time before the boy was taken up, that if the Louis d'or was returned you would not prosecute? A. No, I did not promise that if the father found the property, he should not be prosecuted.</p>

We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170090"></xptr>had heard the door shut between seven and half-past seven. I looked into his room about half-past eight, and his things were taken away; they used to lie on a chair in his bed-room.

I left the house about a quarter past eight o'clock - the bag was on the desk when I left - I returned in the morning at nine; the last witness brought me the key of the safe, but it was not locked.

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 30th of January I went to Mr. Willey's, to take charge of the prisoner Young; and from the desk or table in the office, I took some silver, which amounted to 21 s. 6 d., and a comb. The prisoner Young had put it on the table before I got there; Mr. Willey said so in his presence. I took the knife from Mrs. Willey. In consequence of information, I went to take up the prisoner Hoyle - I found him in a street near Newport-market; I think Porter-street - I found on him a sovereign and a louis-d'or - he did not say how he came by them - he said he had given a boy, named Hobbs, three sovereigns to take back to the gentleman - he perfectly understood what I took him for - he had been talking about it before. When I first went, he said, "I did not persuade Young to do it. I gave that boy the money to take back to the gentleman." I took the money from the boy (Hobbs), who was standing by at the time.</p>

            . I am fifteen years of age and live in Two Star-court, Broad-street, St. Giles. My father is a bricklayer - I know the two prisoners - on the last Sunday in January, I saw Young between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; he was with Hoyle in Lacell's-place, as I had heard of Young being in trouble, and he was taken into my house - his father was sent for, and he told his father not to be afraid, as he would go down to his master with him, and that James Hoyle had 6 l. of the money. Hoyle had been sent away - he went when my mother went out, and brought Young in. My father, Mr. Young, the boy, and Mrs. Young, I believe, went to the master's. I then took a walk down Drury-lane, and saw Hoyle standing against a door. I said, if he had any money, it would be better for him to go and give it up. He then gave me two sovereigns, and a Napoleon, as he called it. I told him Young had gone with his father and my father to his master. I did not tell him what Young had said - I told him, if he had any money, to go and deliver it up, and then he gave me those three pieces of gold. I kept them in my hand, thinking to go to his master; but when the officer came, I gave it to him - we were then talking at the corner of Porter-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Are you certain the boy gave you the Napoleon? A. I gave it to Lead bitter. Hoyle said, next morning he would go and get the rest.</p>
               <p>HOYLE'S Defence. I did not persuade James Young to commit the robbery. I did not know that he had done it. Four witnesses gave the prisoner Young an excellent character.</p>

On the 14th of September, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was getting up to go to work; there were other persons in the house; the first thing that attracted my attention was the screaming of women, upon which I opened the parlour door where I slept; I looked up the stairs and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, coming down; I looked at him with astonishment, and held up my hand to strike at him; I was not near enough to hit him, and he darted on me - I caught him by the collar; he was quite a stranger, and had no business in my house; I had fastened my house up, and I do not know at all how he got in; I found no part of it broken; he was not there when I went to bed; he tried to get away, but I held him fast - John Walker's property had been removed.</p>
               <p>JOHN WALKER. I have lodged in Mr. Brick's house five months. On the night of the 13th of September I fastened up the house and went to bed about ten o'clock: on the 14th I got up and went to work, about twenty-five minutes past six o'clock - I am sure I locked my room door; (it is the back-room on the second floor,) and hung the key up above John Brick's room-door where he sleeps; I had left my box in my room - I was fetched from work by Bricks; and when I got home my key was gone from the place where I had left it, and was in my room-door, and my box moved to the middle of the room - I had left the box securely locked, and in it a watch worth 2l. 10s.; a seal, and two coats not finished, worth 3l. 10s.; and a pair of of trousers, worth 1l.; they were my property - when I went out, I fastened the street-door with the latch - I put my shoulder to see if it was fast; I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in this house, and have the front room, second floor - Mr. Walker lives in the back-room. On the morning of the 14th of September I heard the bolt of his door slip back very softly; I was in bed at the time, but I got up immediately just as I was, and threw open my door - I saw the prisoner with the chest on his back, ready to carry it away - I said nothing but Oh; and then I shut my door - I heard him throw down the box and go down stairs - I opened my door again, and screamed out Thieves! my landlord caught him at the bottom of the stairs; I know it was Mr. Walker's box.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These are two persons who, I believe, are tailors, whom I have not been long acquainted with; one is a cutter-out, and lives in this house up stairs; he came to me on the 13th, and asked if I could carry a box for him? I said, I did not mind, and he sent for some liquor to my house - I did not go with him for five or six hours; when we got to the door of that house, he said,"Oh! I forgot myself, it does not matter to-night; if you come to-morrow morning it will do" - his brother-in-law Andrew, came the next morning; I went with him to the house, and he was standing at the door in his stockings; I went up stairs with him to bring the box away; he lifted up the box and put it on the bed, and said to me,"Do you think you can carry it?" I found it was too heavy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140162"></xptr>and said, "I don't think I can;" he went down stairs, and I missed him all at once; and the lady put her head out of the next room, and said, Thieves! I said directly,"I see how it is; I am trepauned;" when I got to the bottom of the stairs, this man put himself in a position to knock me down - I said, "I have done nothing wrong, the man has gone out at the door."</p>
               <p>JOHN BRICKS re-examined. Q. Was he running down stairs? A. Yes; as fast as he could, ready to make his escape.</p>
               <p>ANN SULLIVAN. The moment I heard the bolt of the door turn I got up; so that there was no time for another person to go down; there was another person up stairs in the house in bed; we called him, and he came and assisted in taking the prisoner; his name is James Gainer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That person has run away since. Witness, No; he has left to go into a good situation; he did all he could to apprehend the prisoner; it was my screams that brought him out of bed; there was no conversation between them whatever.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You have produced these three pieces of parchment as the writs you purchased of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On what day did you purchase them? - On the Easter Monday or Tuesday, he came again on the Saturday week after that.</p>
               <p>Where did you put them? - I put them in separate places, that we have for different kinds of writs.</p>
               <p>In an open drawer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people are employed in your shop? - Two or three.</p>

               <p>Then occasionally you have a great resort to your shop, for the purpose of buying writs, bringing writing to be copied, and persons bringing it home when it is done? Yes, but this was holiday time, and we had very little business to do.</p>

               <p>I am messenger to the Stamp-office, Mr. Fryer brought the prisoner to the office, on the 1st of April, I took him to Bow-street, and the Justice desired one of the constables to go with me to the prisoner's lodgings, and in searching his lodgings we found these writs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110086"></xptr>Are there any stamps on them? - Only one, they are in the same situation as I found them in.</p>
               <p>Court. What stamps do you say have been taken off that writ? - Two of half a crown value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit that is not the charge in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The charge in the indictment is, that this man has taken off a stamp, which bore the impression of four sixpences, having been paid to Government; I produce a writ in which it appears, that not only these four have been taken off, but likewise a fifth stamp, I do not charge him with the last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My learned friend has stated half the charge, and suppressed the other half, and it is this, that this man having in his possession a certain process which had issued out out of the King's Court, and on which four sixpenny stamps were paid, and denoted to be paid; he unlawfully got off the said stamp from the said process, with intent to use the said stamp upon a certain other process: is that the case here? this witness tells your Lordship, that there is now due and payable five and not four sixpenny duties on this, and that upon this, which the witness has said to be duly executed, there were originally five, and that those five were taken off; surely this is not the offence stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this objection is taken up a little hastily, without considering fully either the act of parliament or the evidence. What is the evidence? the charge is, that he took off a stamp denoting four sixpenny duties from a certain writ, with intent to place the said stamp on another writ: the evidence is, that there appeared to be taken off from a writ, a stamp denoting that four sixpenny duties had been paid, and also another stamp denoting that another sixpenny duty had been paid; there is produced a writ on which there is a stamp denoting that four sixpenny duties have been paid, and another stamp denoting that one sixpenny duty had been paid, they may prove that he took off four; there are two stamps distinct and separate, why may they not prove that he took off one, without taking off the other; to this I agree, that under this indictment which states that he took off four sixpences, they could not prove five sixpences, but they have proved a stamp, denoting five sixpences had been made and taken off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, my objection is this, that the charge in the indictment is not only the getting off the stamps, but there is an intent which the act of parliament makes the capital part of the charge, that is the intent to put it on to another process.</p>
               <p>Court. At present there is no variance between the evidence and the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Seabrook. Does that appear to have been used?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to that question.</p>

               <p>I am his Majesty's engraver, and chief engraver to the Stamp-Office; these stamps have been taken from other parchments and put on these: in the process of stamping these, the parchment has a hole cut thro' it, and they put this red on the parchment, with a particular paste that is made on purpose for the office, and there is a particular soil put through, and then it is stamped so that the lead takes the part of the impression; after that it is impossible to take that off, and put it on so strong again.</p>
               <p>Does the mark of the lead correspond with the rest? - No, it does not; this writ was stamped at the office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are the stamps used on the bills of Middlesex? - We have two dies, one with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110087"></xptr> four six-pences, and the other with one sixpence, which was laid on in 1783; we stamp none under five now, and that is done by two separate stamps, the four sixpences is in one, and the other has one sixpence; if the impression is made upon the writ it will appear on the parchment.</p>
               <p>Look at that writ and copy? - We make a hole, then we put on the scutcheon, then it is punched, then leaded, then stamped, and then cyphered on the other side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Harris. Have you looked at that parchment which is said to be a bill of Middlesex, issued against Higgins? - I did.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear that that piece of parchment has been legally and properly stamped at his Majesty's stamp-office? - No; I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>How many years have you been in the Stamp-office? - Pretty near forty; I am supervisor, I superintend everything of that sort; I am conversant with the business, I have gone through all the duties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Major. It may have been legally stamped, and I rather think it has, but it is so tumbled and creased.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seabrook. It was very plain when I first took it before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. These three writs were sold by the prisoner to Mr. Fryer, now it is proved these were taken off some writs, but he had in his custody a writ, a copy of which he served on a defendant, and there is found in his custody three writs, with stamps appearing to be taken off from other writs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before the prisoner is called upon for his defence, I take the liberty of submitting to the Court several objections which occur to my mind, to shew that the prisoner cannot possibly be convicted; first it is stated that the prisoner had in his possession a process of our Lord the King, &amp;c. which appeared to have been before then duly issued against - Higgins and

            ; I submit there is no evidence to call on the prisoner for his defence, to shew that he had in his possession such a writ; such a writ is indeed produced to the Jury, but in a state in which it is impossible it could have issued out of the court of our Lord the King, it is not proved to be duly stamped, so as to be signed; another objection is this, that it is stated to be a thing not described in the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. There is no averment in the indictment, that such a writ had been duly issued, but that he had in his custody a certain piece of parchment which purported to have then been duly issued against them; it is not averred that it did duly issue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is proved that a piece of parchment was in his custody, on which was written that, which if it had been duly issued, would have been a bill of Middlesex; it is averred, that it did duly issue; my objection is that it does not purport so to have issued; my learned friend attempted to call a witness to prove that it had duly issued, but it must have been duly signed, it is proved by those who have been forty years in the business, that this never had been legally stamped, consequently it never had been legally issued; I say, this thing, as described by the indictment, has a description not named in the act of parliament, for it is called a process; I am aware there is a sweeping clause,</p>
               <p>"all other processes issuing out of the court of our Lord the King." I have another objection which I think will be perfectly sufficient for this purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no such word as process in the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have another objection: by this act of parliament there are two or three offences created, and the offence in this indictment is not one of them; it says first, if any person shall write or ingross, &amp;c. upon any thing which has already been used, it is not that; or shall fraudulently erase or scrape out any name or names of any person or persons, or any sum, date, or other thing written in such writ, &amp;c. it is not that; or if any person shall fraudulently cut, tear, or get off, any mark or stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110088"></xptr> from any piece of vellum or parchment, paper, playing cards, &amp;c. with intent to use such stamp or mark, in respect of which any such duty is payable; (which is, they say, the duty last enumerated) now the Court will look to the several things that the legislature meant to provide for; the Court will not take any collateral part of the act of parliament, and apply it to a new case, then comes the clause to prevent the transferring of stamps from one to the other, you will not extend the act of parliament, being a very penal one.</p>
               <p>Court. I certainly will not extend it; the act of parliament certainly refers to all the things beforementioned.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. I wish you would consider how far the intent that is specified by the act can be extended; the act had in contemplation mischiefs which had happened in practice before that time, and one was, that old deeds had been erased; another mischief was with respect to processes, here they would erase the names of one person, or put in new names, or take off the stamp, and put it on another piece of parchment, and then serve that writ; that was using it for the same purpose; it does not say as in the case of the receipt-tax, whosoever shall utter or expose to sale, or take off the stamp, to defraud his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He sells it as a writ, he therefore does use a false stamp; and he was paid for them as good stamps.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg leave to suppose it was taken off for the purpose of a museum; suppose an antiquarian was to wish to have a collection of stamps, and takes one off from an old process; and afterwards sells his collection, is that a using?</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge summed up the evidence, and left it to the Jury, whether they were satisfied, that the bill of Middlesex against Higgins was ever stamped; and if it was, that the prisoner ever took off that stamp; and, if he did, whether he did it with intention to use it on a bill of Middlesex or Latitat; and, if they found the prisoner guilty, he desired them to state whether they were satisfied that the prisoner took the stamp off, and sold it with intention that it should be used, whether by himself or others, for one of those purposes described in the indictment, and if they were of that opinion, he desired they would say so, besides finding the prisoner guilty.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew some time, and returned with a verdict</p>
               <p>GUILTY Of taking a stamp from a certain instrument, and of affixing it to another, with an intent that it should be used by others.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Do you find that he had an intent on of using them himself? - No, my Lord, we conceive he could not possibly have that intention, because he sold them to the stationer.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I will read the verdict to you. The Jury find that the prisoner took off the stamp from the bill of Middlesex, mentioned in the indictment, and affixed it on a piece of parchment, purporting to be the form of another process of the same kind, which he sold with others to Fryer, with intent that the same should be used by such persons as should purchase the same; but not with intent of using it himself.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, that is clearly our idea.</p>

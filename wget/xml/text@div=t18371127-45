                  </hi>, Jun. I am a carpenter, and live at Penshurst, in Kent, with my father. Our shop was broken open once in April, and on the 22nd of May the prisoner went away—there were a variety of car<lb></lb>penter's tools taken—the prisoner is my cousin—I did not know where he was living at the time the tools were stolen—I came to Mr. Burridge, the officer, and gave information—last month I heard the prisoner was working for a master carpenter at Sutton—this plane is mine—it is marked with my name—I have the iron it was marked with, and these planes, I believe, belong to my father—this one I know does—it has his name on it—his name is Thomas Wickham—they were lost in May from Mr. Well's shop—my father lost a great many—I did not lose so many.</p>

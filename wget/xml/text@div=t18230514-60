            . I sell fruit and live in Catherine-Wheel-alley. On the evening of the 2d of May, I was at the Paul Pindar, public-house, Bishopsgate-street, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the prisoner bought 4 d. worth of raddishes of me and gave me a shilling; I gave her eight-pence change. I had no other shilling. I kept it in my hand some time, and when she was gone I examined it and found it very bad. I put it in paper, and kept it separate, and gave it to the officer - next night I saw her at the same place; she wanted two pennyworth of raddishes, but said she had only three half-pence, and would I trust her. I did not recollect her, till we got to the light, and would not trust her - she asked me to give her change for a shilling, which she gave me. I found it was a bad one. The officer came in and took her. I had no other silver about me.</p>

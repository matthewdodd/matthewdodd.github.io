             sworn. - I live with Messrs. Mann and Harrison in Parliament-street. On Friday, the 30th of August, the prisoner came into our shop, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; she said she was much fatigued, and wished to sit down; she said she had been bled the day before, and was afraid the doctor had taken too much blood from her; she sat down; I was dressing myself, and rang the bell for the other witness, Bryce; I continued dressing, while he was waiting upon her; Mr. Bryce went into the warehouse for some article, and she told me she had been among some paint, which had had a great affect upon her, and begged me to get her a little water; I did not like to leave her in the shop alone, and, instead of going for the water, I stood behind the place where she was, and I saw her draw a piece of printed calico from the place where we kept them; I told Bryce as he passed me, that I suspected her of having a piece of print; I then went for the water, and Bryce called to me to make haste; I can say no more till after Bryce has been examined; I was present when the print was found.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Messrs. Mann and Harrison. On the 30th of August, I saw the prisoner in our shop; I had never seen her before; I was called by the last witness to serve the prisoner; she desired to look at some Irish cloth, and likewise some sheeting; she said the Irish was for herself; she desired ten yards to be cut off; I then shewed her the sheeting; she said that was for a Mrs. Miller; we having a customer, a Lady Miller, I asked her if it was for her, and she said, yes; she desired that eighteen yards might be cut off, and sent to Lady Miller with the Irish; when I asked her the direction, I found it was a Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110113"></xptr>Miller, who lived over Westminster-bridge; I took the direction, and, as she was going out, I went up to her, and said she had some of our property about her; she said she had not, but I perceived, under her cloaths, something that looked very large; she let it drop down, and said, it was a print that she had bought with us yesterday; she afterwards said she bought it in Leicester-fields of a man of the name of Miller; I picked up the print, but cannot swear it was our print. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Mann. I cannot swear that it is mine: I had the same pattern; there is no private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Philpot. I saw the prisoner take a piece of printed calico from the pile, but I cannot swear that this is the same; when I picked it up, and she said she had bought it, I asked her how many yards there were of it, and she said six yards and a quarter; I gave it to another young man to measure, and it measured ten yards, and there is a ticket upon it of ten yards.</p>

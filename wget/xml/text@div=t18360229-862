                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Drew, who sells ladies shoes in Newington-cause way.

The prisoner was in my service some years—I had reason to com<lb></lb>plain of him, and discharged him—I afterwards found there was something wrong about satin and kid shoes—I went to Mrs. Drew, and made inquiry of her, and she gave me an account about her satin and kid shoes—I had been in the habit of sending the prisoner to Drew's and other persons, to purchase kid and satin shoes, and when he returned he told me the price—on the 6th of January I sent him for satin shoes, and on his return he said he gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them and bought them at Mrs. Drew's—that was what I paid him—I always gave him the money before he went.</p>

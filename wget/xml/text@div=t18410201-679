                  </hi>. I am the father of John Parker Snowdon, a leather-seller, in Chapel-street. I was in his shop on the 25th of Janu<lb></lb>ary—theprisoner came in—he went to an open bin, and looked out what he wanted, and, I suppose, put them into his pocket—he then went to another bin, and brought one piece of leather from there, and put it on the counter—my son came in, and I told him I thought the prisoner had got some leather in his pocket—he went and took these four pieces of leather from the prisoner's pocket—the marks are on this leather—it is not tomary for persons to put any thing in their pockets till it is paid for.</p>

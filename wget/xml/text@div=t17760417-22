               <p>I live with Mrs. Watts; she keeps a school: upon the 27th of February a servant came in for three children and left the door ajar; I was sitting within a room in the shop; I saw the prisoner Stephens take a bundle off a shelf by the counter and give them to another boy, I did not see him come in; I cried out, stop thief, as loud as I could; the little boy ran towards Kingsland road with the stockings, Stephens ran the other way; I pursued the little boy with the stockings, but lost him; a girl who was gathering in pots hearing me cry stop thief, secured Ferrell who was standing on the other side of the way; I asked him if he was in company with the boys that took the stockings, he said he knew nothing of the affair; then a gentleman brought in Stephens, I knew him again directly; an officer who lives next door searched him, but found nothing but a knife upon him.</p>
               <p>Was there any candle in the shop? - No, it was not dark; it was about half after four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen Stephens before? - I don't know that I ever saw any of them before.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of him while he was taking the bundle to know him again? - Yes, while he was taking the bundle down I looked at him, and called stop thief; he ran out of the shop, I am sure he is the person; we got the stockings again; we never took the boy that ran away with them.</p>
               <p>STEPHENS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the shop to buy a pair of garters; I heard a cry of stop thief, and ran out again, and they ran after me and took me.</p>

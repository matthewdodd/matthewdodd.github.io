                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, and live in Piccadilly. The pri<lb></lb>soner had been my errand-boy about two months—I had occasion to send advertisements to the newspapers, in my business, and employed the pri<lb></lb>soner to take them—I sent him, on the 26th of December, to get an adver<lb></lb>tisement put into the Post, Herald, Times, and Chronicle—I gave him gold sufficient to pay for the advertisement, and bring back a balance—I can<lb></lb>not say what amount I gave him—I did not know what they would amount to, only by the ticket which was returned to me—he brought me back some change—I do not remember what amount he brought me—I cannot tell what money I gave him, nor what he returned to me.</p>

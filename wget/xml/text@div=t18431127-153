                  </hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Ebury-street, Pimlico.</hi> On the 28th of August I left my shop, between ten and half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I was gone two or three minutes, and on my return I saw the prisoner leaning over the counter, in the act of pushing in the till—he appeared rather confused, and asked me if I knew of an errand-boy's situation—while he was speaking I looked into the till, and missed some money—I said, "I don't know of an errand-boy's situation, but I know you have robbed me"—I missed some silver, and particularly a half-crown, as there was but one in the till at the time—he at first denied it—I said, "J am postive you have robbed me; so you had better give up what you have taken"—he then put into my hand a half-crown and three shillings—I took him to the station—he begged me to forgive him, and said if I did not, he should be sure to be transported—I was not quite certain what was in the till, but I think about 1 ls.—I know there was a half-crown.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop - A. Yes; the shop is the lower part of the house; I live in the house myself and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110035"></xptr>family.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner in your shop - A. Yes, on Monday evening the 5th of last month, about half after five in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come in alone - A. There was another person with him; he asked for half a pound of candles, two pennyworth of wafers, and two pennyworth of wax taper. I served him with these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the shop, or had you occasion to go out of the shop - A I had occasion to go out of the shop into the back room for a pair of scissars to cut the wax taper for the prisoner; when I came back he paid me and he went away; he went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the shop - A. No; there were other other people in the shop; I was engaged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing soon after they were out of the shop - A. Yes; in a minute I missed a box of soap, three quarters of a hundred weight; it was standing within the shop, about a yard and a half from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that box before - A. About a minute before; when I missed the box of soap I immediately run out of the door and pursued him; I overtook the prisoner about twelve or fifteen yards from my door, in the street; he had the box of soap on his shoulder; I did not see the other with him; I laid hold of him by the collar, I told him he had robbed me; he swore at me a good deal, he would not lower the soap off his shoulder; I immediately called out stop thief; he smacked it off his shoulder as fast as he could, and began to run away off the pavement; I had hold of the tail of his coat at the same time; I had help; we brought him back. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he is the man that you served with the articles in your shop - A. I am quite sure of that; one of the articles, the candles, I served him the other man took; he was searched in the watchhouse. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took up the box did you examine it - A. Yes, after I had brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark by which you know it to be yours - A. Only by the mark on the box.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of the soap - A. It cost me eighty eight seillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. Did you see them go out of the shop together - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out of the shop at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell us you saw them go out together - A. They left me when I had done serving them. I was engaged.</p>
               <p>COURT. He said they went out together, but he did not see them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body with a box - A. I saw a man come by and throw a box off his shoulder; then he ran away. Mr. Tompson ran after him and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards did he run - A. It might be an hundred yards, pretty nigh, as near as I can guess. - Mr. Thompson was close to him when he threw the box down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep close to him when he ran away - A. I cannot say; I staid where the box was, I sat on the box on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Thompson bring him back - A. Yes, he and some other gentlemen together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the man, so as to to know it is the same man that throwed the box down that he brought back - A. I think it is, I saw him at Bow street.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know him before - A. No; me and some others took up the box and carried it to Mr. Thompson's shop; we let it fall out of our hands; it broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it - A. Soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. How long did all this take up - A. Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and say whether that is the man that you saw with the box on his shoulder - A. Yes, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you thought it was another man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever it was that had the box on his shoulder, he went out of your sight - A. Yes, when he turned the corner.</p>

            . I am an officer; I had this man delivered into my custody; I searched him. I found a piece of wax taper in his coat pocket. I shewed it to Mr. Thompson at Bow street office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It looks like the same, it is the same quantity that he bought, and the same colour; the paper is the same that I wrapt it up in. This is the box that had the soap in; there was eighty three pound and a half in it; it cost me eighty eight shillings. I weighed the soap three hours previous to his taking it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been as far as Leicester fields; on my return home I come into Holley street, and as soon as I came into Clement's passage I heard the cry of stop thief; a man dropped a bit of paper containing this wax taper; I picked up and I looked to see which way he was gone; the gentleman came up to me and said you are the man that came into the shop door and took the box of soap; he took the box of soap, he took me back to his shop, and when I got into the shop, he said do you think you are innocent, or that you are not; I said I am as innocent as you are, take me before a magistrate. I was taken to the watch-house; this man came in and said I will take you out of here; he took me to the office.</p>

            . I live in Plummer's-court, Holborn. I saw the two prisoners and two others going towards the prosecutor, who was sitting on a step in Holborn; they appeared all in company; I had seen him before they came up to him: he had his hat on, and was asleep, and seemed intoxicated; there was no one with him; I saw Lesley take the hat off his head, and walk away with it; the other three walked away with him. I followed them to see if I could find a constable to take them up. I do not know what became of the hat, for they were not taken till half-past nine o'clock at night; when Lesley was taken he said voluntarily that Hobbs had get the hat, and he lived in a house in Ormond-yard; it was found there: we went and found Hobbs in bed - the hat was at Hobbs's sister's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do when you first saw Lesley at his house - A. I laid hold of him, and told him what I took him for; he denied it, but afterwards at the watch-house told where it was; he said it publicly and voluntarily; I say that upon my oath. The prisoners were not walking arm-in-arm. I was on the same side of the way, and about sixty or seventy yards from the place; it was very wet, and but few persons passing. I followed them up Kingsgate-street; they walked quietly away. The hat was not found in the house where Hobbs was.</p>

            . I am a friend of Hobbs's sister, and am a servant out of place. I was just gone up to the room with his sister; Hobbs came up, and put the hat down, and went out - I did not notice whether he had a hat on or not. I lodge in Ormond-yard, but not in that house. The witness and the constable both said Hobbs should be liberated the next morning. I saw it found in that room, but Hobbs was not there then. I cannot be sure that it was this hat, or whether it was his sister's room; she was there; it was a sitting room.</p>

            . I am houseman at the watch-house. Lesley was brought there on a charge of stealing a hat from a man in liquor in Holborn. About an hour after Hobbs came in with the hat, which was claimed by White - there was no declaration made in my hearing by Lesley - if it had been said publicly I should have heard it.</p>

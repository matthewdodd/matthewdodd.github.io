I am the wife of Thomas Stevenson, who keeps the Crown Coffee-house, in Drury-lane—the prisoner came there on Friday, 31st Dec., at a little after 11 o'clock at night; he called for a cup of coffee, an egg, and a slice of bread and butter—they came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was at that time rather the worse for drink—he gave me in payment a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—in consequence of something that was said, I looked at it—it was bad—while the prisoner was taking his refreshment I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to the constable at the same time—the constable asked the prisoner where he got it; he said he had been working at the Crystal Palace, and had taken it in payment for his wages—he said the next morning that he had taken a half sovereign, and got it changed at a public house, and had taken the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in change; and he said he did not know where the public house was—I had not parted with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece before I gave it to the constable—I made a mark on it afterwards at the station.</p>

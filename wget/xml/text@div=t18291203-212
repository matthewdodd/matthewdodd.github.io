On the 30th of October, I saw the prisoner take it off the pile, and go out with it; I could not leave my shop - I saw him take it, and throw it down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was waiting for a coal-heaver who I had been at work for; the prosecutor came to the door, and told me to be off - I saw no cheese. Witness. I saw him take the cheese, and go out of the shop - I do not know that I told him to go off that night; I have done so before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you tell him to be off on the night he stole the cheese? A. I do not think I did, but I have before - I have sent my son to tell him to leave his wicked ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it likely, having lost the cheese, that you would have told him so? A. I declare to God I did not; I am certain I did not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cheese from the shop when you took it up? A. I suppose a yard and a half.</p>

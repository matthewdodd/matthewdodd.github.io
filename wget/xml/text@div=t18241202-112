On the 28th of November, I went to bed with my fellow-servant at a few minutes before eleven o'clock - we went up from the kitchen to our bedroom, which is in the passage; adjoining the front parlour; master and mistress went to bed just before us. I fastened all the doors and windows myself. I left a shawl in the kitchen, and a silver table spoon in a basin on the tray, on the dresser, on the left hand side of the kitchen. I was awoke by the dog barking very violently - it was in the passage by our room door, or the street door. I could not tell the time. I quieted him twice, and he laid down on the mat near the stairs - it was a little terrier - there is a long partition of glass, which parts the stairs from our bedroom; and in about two minutes after he had made the noise. I saw a strong light go up stairs, and somebody appeared to snatch the dog off the stairs - it made a noise as if it was snatched up violently - the light then left the passage, and went down to the kitchen. I heard no noise then. I sat up in bed, and at first thought it might be master come down to quiet the dog; but in a minute or two I got out of bed, opened the door, and went down the passage a little way, and saw a full light in the kitchen through some windows on the staircase, and heard some one in the kitchen say "Hush." I went back to my bed-room door, and screamed out "Murder! murder!" I then closed the door, held it firm, and told my fellow-servant to get out of bed and call Watch - she got out, opened the shutter and the window, and called Watch - we both kept screaming all the time - two gentlemen came by, and said they would send the watchman. I could not see them because I was holding the door - the watchman came to the door. I turned my head round as I held the door, and saw a man standing in the areas with his back towards our window - he was taken by the watchman, but not in my presence. I do not know whether the prisoner is the man or not - one gentleman assisted another to get in at the window, and he opened the street door. I followed the watchman and them down into the kitchen - the watchman brought my shawl, and the spoon from the area - the dog laid in the kitchen with its head nearly cut off - a gentleman took a knife from the dresser, and shewed it to me - it was bloody - it was after two o'clock when all this was over - a little boy slept in the kitchen. I went up, and awoke master and mistress.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fraser. I was awoke by the dog barking; we quieted him, and laid awake. I saw a light in the passage, and the dog made a shocking noise; after the light left the passage, I heard no noise - it was not there above a minute; my fellow-servant went into the passage, and hallooed "Who is there?" and called Murder! I opened the window, and called Watch! - two young men came, and asked what was the matter - they went away before the watchman came, and I saw a man getting up out of the area - there is a gas-light near the house. I saw him taken; it was the prisoner. I first saw him climbing up from the area with his hands on the rails - there are no steps - the watchman took him as he stood on a stone inside the rails - he said, there was a man down there, for he had been down to see. I am sure the prisoner is the man who I saw down in the area. I saw him taken, saw his face, and swear that he is the man; some gentlemen came up, and told me to open the door. I said, I could not - one of them got in through the window, and opened the street door. I accompanied them down to the kitchen - the two dresser drawers were open; the kitchen door, and the window were both open; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020055"></xptr>were both shut when I went to bed; the shawl and table spoon were gone from the kitchen. I had seen the spoon on the dresser the night before, and thought of washing it to take it up stairs: but did not - the dog lay in the kitchen, with his head nearly cut off, and the carving-knife was bloody.</p>

            . I am a watchman; early on the morning of the 29th of November, I was at the bottom of Norfolk-street, heard a shrieking, and on coming up to this house, I saw the prisoner inside the area, on the stone which separates the two houses. I ordered him to come over the rails, and immediately collared him, and told him if he made any resistance, I would knock him down - the parlour window was open, and the last witness stood there. I sprang my rattle - two gentlemen came to my assistance - one of them got in at the parlour window, got a light, and let another in; and in a few minutes two watchmen came. I gave him in charge of one of them, while I went down to search. I went down first with a candle, and found the dog lying bleeding, with his head nearly off; and on the dresser was this dark lantern (producing it;) the kitchen door stood open. I went into the area, examined the coal-cellar - nobody was there; and in the area, nearly under the spot where I first found the prisoner, was this shawl and table spoon. I returned, and took him to the watch-house - the constable searched him in my presence; and on his waistcoat pocket was a small piece of wax candle, a comb, some silver, and a blue striped handkerchief, which appeared to have spots of blood on it, and there were marks of blood on the back of his right hand. I produce the shawl and spoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there a mark of blood on the back of my hand? A. There were marks of blood; I think there were two marks.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to this house, and found the prisoner in Newman's custody; he had then got over the rails; two gentlemen stood by the rails - one got over, and let me in. I went down stairs with Newman, leaving the prisoner in charge of another watchman - I was the second or third who entered the kitchen; the door stood open, and one of the windows. I produce the carving knife, which was wet with blood; it laid on the dresser. I found a crow-bar in the area, and on the right-hand dresser I found the door of a dark lantern. I afterwards returned to the house, and found two center bits. The window shutters were broken open, and the crow-bar exactly fitted the marks on them. I have no doubt but that the window was forced open by that crowbar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a rattle spring about one o'clock; a person came up, and I went to this house - Newman was holding the prisoner, and gave him in my charge; two watchmen and some gentlemen went into the house. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house. A candle and 6 s. was found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM FRASER. I live at No. 37, Norfolk-street, in the parish of St. Clement, Danes. I was disturbed by the cook coming into our room, after it was all over. The table spoon is my property - it has my initials on it, and had been used by my brother-in-law, who slept in the house that night. I found the house full of watchmen and people. I found the prisoner at the watch-house, and saw blood on the back of his right-hand, and said in his presence, that he was the murderer of my faithful dog.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN EASTON. I know the shawl to be mine - I have had it two months; and know the spoon to be any master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentleman; if I was to say I was not an accomplice, I should only be adding falsehood to crime. I came to London four weeks ago, and was looking for work; I went into a house, and met a person, whom I thought was a gentleman, and he led me away. I went with him to this house, and I am afraid that if I enter fully into a statement now, it may be prejudicial to the ends of justice hereafter. I was led away by men who are old in crime. I was in the area, but not in the house, and never saw the dog; I heard the noise, but never touched him. I have been affected with a bleeding at the noise, for eighteen months, and that is what caused the blood. I put my hand to my nose, and there was a bit of a mark on my hand. There has always been blood issuing from my nose; the surgeon can satisfy you of that being the case since I have been committed. I throw myself on the Mercy of the Court. My parents live at Manchester, and I have not the means of bringing friends here.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. FRASER. Q. How deep is the area? A. It must be about twelve feet from the curb of the pavement, and there are rails at the top, which makes an addition to it.</p>

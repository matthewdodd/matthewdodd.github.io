               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did she not suggest your sending for an officer? A. Yes; I had not liked her conduct and she was impertinent - she had no money when she came to me, for I wanted a penny the next day - I keep a lodging-house.</p>

I was sent for - the prosecutrix said she was about to discharge the prisoner, and had missed her bag - the prisoner then went to the water-closet - I did not go there with her, but I got a light and went afterwards - I got the tongs, and found this purse - it had no money in it - I found 16s. on her.</p>

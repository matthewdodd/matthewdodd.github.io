            . I am a Police-officer. On the 23rd of October I was at the station-house, and was locking up a woman who was drunk; one Meadows was given in charge by Mr. Burke, on suspicion of felony - the prisoner seemed to know him, and had been lodging with him; I locked them both up - the prisoner said to me, "Take this (holding out this spoon), and it will make it all right;" I made no reply, but when I came from below I saw the prisoner come from the passage, and this spoon laid on the place he came from; it was a broken spoon he offered me, and this is broken - and to the best of my belief it is the same he offered; the inspector asked him where he got it - he said from John's, he had broken it in playing improperly with it, and he put it into his pocket for fear of having a row.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did you do with it? A. I put it back from me into your possession again - I saw you coming from the shelf, and this spoon laid there; the inspector the eatened to report me, but it was because he thought I was taking this to compromise a matter - I had put a small paper on that shelf before, and there was nothing there then.</p>

I was sent for, and saw this spoon, which certainly is mine - I do not know when it was taken; we always use silver spoons in the parlour, and clean them perhaps once a fortnight, or once a week - the prisoner was a Policeman; I saw a lad with him at the office - I cannot say whether Meadows was with him or not; I saw the spoon in the next glass to that which the prisoner and the other man had - I did not see the prisoner come in or go out; I did not miss the spoon till I was sent for to the station-house - it was not in the glass then.</p>

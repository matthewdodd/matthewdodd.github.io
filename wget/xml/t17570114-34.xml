            . Last Christmas week I went out to scowering. The prisoner was my bedfellow. I left her at home, and lay all night where I went to work. When I came home, I ask'd where my shift, &amp;c. was; she said, they are not out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your things, when you went out?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. I left them all in the house. I said I wanted to put my shift on; she said, don't be in a hurry, you shall have your things; on the Sunday she went out and did not come home. I found her in Holbourn on the Saturday morning after, and charged her with taking my things, which are mention'd in the indictment. She said I should have them again; but when I took her before the justice, she denied knowing any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she took the things?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. She own'd to taking nothing but my shift, and said she had pawned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where?</p>
               <p>E. Terry. No, she did not.</p>

            . I heard the prisoner deny stealing the prosecutor's shift, but she own'd she knew the shift was pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she own this?</p>
               <p>Anderson. This she own'd in the constable's house.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of her smock. She came home and made a great noise and a great to do about her smock. I told her I knew nothing of her smock, not I. I know no more of it, than anybody here.</p>

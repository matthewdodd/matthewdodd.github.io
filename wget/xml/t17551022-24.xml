               <p>Thomas Beach. On the seventh of October, I desired the prisoner to carry a bundle to my washer-woman, containing the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Beach. Yes; he is <rs id="t17551022-24-deflabel125" type="occupation">a helper in the stables</rs>

I went and took him before Sir Samuel Gore; there he own'd he sold three of the shirts and three neckcloths for six shillings, at a little peny house in the Minories; he had a pair of black stockings on his legs, which he own'd to be mine. Sir Samuel could not commit him, because the fact was committed in the city, so we took him before Mr. alderman Gascoyne, and he committed him to Newgate. He confessed the same before the alderman, as he did before Sir Samuel.</p>

            . I met the prisoner last Tuesday fortnight going towards Westminster, as fast as he could, with a bundle of linen in a handkerchief. I ask'd him where he was going with it; he made me no answer, and would not stay; I never saw any thing farther of him.</p>

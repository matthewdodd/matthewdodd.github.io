             had stole some of my property; Symonds was a <rs id="t18040912-33-deflabel197" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. What became of the contents of the trunk? - A. The constable has got the contents of the trunk, the trunk is at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this property last? - A. The trunk I had not seen for a long time, it was put up in a lumber garret; the linen and the waistcoat were kept in a drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120038"></xptr>Q. You had not particularly counted over your things before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no reason to know that they all went at once? - A. No other than the duplicates mention, when they were pawned; one was within eighteen days before I took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- DURATT sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A. At the Castle, in Shepherd's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. No more than his being sent for beer; he took a lodging of me on the 4th of September, he brought a leather trunk on the 5th; I took down a key when he came, from where they generally hang for the lodgers' convenience; I opened the door, and he took the trunk in, he locked the door, and hung up the key; Mr. Hollings, and the officer, came in the same day the prisoner brought the trunk, betwixt eleven and twelve o'clock; Mr. Hollings and the officer came betwixt seven and eight o'clock, to the best of my recollection; I went along with Mr. Hollings and the officer to where he had left the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same trunk which the prisoner had brought with him? - A. Yes; I was present when Mr. Hollings opened it, he had the key; the officer took the things and the trunk away. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court, I have no one here to speak for me; when I lived with Mr. Hollings, there was one Sarah M'Crow lived there a short time as cook, she told me she had been a married woman, and had some shirts and some other articles to sell: she brought forwards four shirts; I went to Mr. Hollings, and borrowed a one pound note; in a short time I bought a pair of silver buckles of her, and a topaz broach, at the same time she gave me the duplicates, as they were in pledge; I was distressed for money, and as I had borrowed a pound note of Mr. 
               <persName id="t18040912-33-person409">Hollings</persName>
             I did not like to ask for more; I took two shirts and a waistcoat, and pledged them in Brewer-street, in my own name; in a short time afterwards, I took the broach and buckles, into Swallow-street, and pledged them; the leather trunk was given to me by a gentleman that lived with Mr. Hollings, as he said he would give it me I took it; when I went into the country I took it with me, and when I came back I brought it back with me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Hollings.) Are you sure that is your trunk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase it yourself? - A. No; it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that the things were given, or sold to him, by Sarah M'Crow? - A. Mrs. Hollings gave Sarah M'Crow a good character; when she went away she shewed her box, and there was none of my property in it; she lives at Bow, I did not proceed against her; many of the things are pawned since she left me, some so lately as the 18th of August.</p>

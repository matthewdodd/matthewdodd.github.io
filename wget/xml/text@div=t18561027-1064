                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, in Bennett-street, Green-wich. On Saturday, 20th Sept, about half past 9 o'clock, in consequence of what my little girl said, I went across the road to the prisoner's house—I went into the front parlour; there were three or four persons there—I said, "There is a fire here, let us have a light"—they had no candle, but they had a fire—by that time constable 74 came in—I said, "Get me a candle, and we will see where this fire is"—I got a candle and went up stairs into the front room—there was nothing at all in that room, with the exception of a few rags lying on the further side of the room, towards the front of the house—I said to the constable, "Here is no fire here"—I went across the room, and opened a cupboard door—I found two bricks had been removed from the bottom part of the cupboard, and I was the flames raging behind the wall that parts the bedroom from the loft—the removal of those bricks would enable a person to put rags, or anything, into the loft—I found some rags there—I had to cut the partition down and throw some pails of water through to stay the fire, and then I went into the loft where the fire was—I found something like half a bushel of rags and paper, and a butter firkin all burning together; that part which was towards the passage was not burned, but all round towards the hole was burned—part of the joists of the kitchen ceiling were burned—the flame was raging about two or three feet high when I first saw it; the joists were burning—a surveyor who has seen the house has given me orders to put in two new joists, on account of those being so burnt—if the fire had not been put out then, in my opinion it would have spread in less than ten minutes, and the whole row of houses would have been burnt down—amongst the rags there was some whitey brown paper, and some pieces of blue cotton shirting—I believe they cor<lb></lb>responded with some of the rags found in the room—I know the situation of this loft; the only mode of reaching it from the prisoner's premises was by the hole that was cut through the brick wall of the cupboard—I saw the prisoner after the fire had been put out; I met her about twenty yards from the house—she said, "Mr. Moore, they tell me my house is on fire"—I said, "No, don't frighten yourself, it is not on fire, it is put out;" and she turned on her heel, and said, "Well, I will go and let them see if anybody is there;" and she went to the door—whether she attempted to knock at the door, or whether she forced it open, I cannot say, but she was falling to the ground, and policeman, No. 74, caught hold of her arm, and picked her up—I think she had been drinking a little.</p>

Before doing so, I examined the hole in the wall—it was on a level with the floor of the cupboard—the first brick was placed on the floor, and the other over it—they were both above the level of the floor—in my judgment, the hole was made from the cupboard into the loft, by the way in which the bricks fitted the hole—there is a notch on the brick, showing that it was punched out from the cupboard side (<hi rend="italic">producing the bricks</hi>)—I fitted the bricks so as to tell in what way they were placed—I took possession of some of the rags that were left unburnt, and produce them—among them is a piece of blue shirting—I also produce some rags which I found in the room—there is some blue shirting amongst that, which corresponds with that found in the loft—it was about 11 o'clock when I saw the prisoner—she was intoxicated.</p>

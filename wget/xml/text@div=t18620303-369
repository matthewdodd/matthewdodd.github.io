               <p>goods they say what amount they require, and I make out the invoice—if the goods are in stock I make out a ticket, as we deliver all stock from the mill; I then take or send a ticket into the mill, to the foreman, Whitting<lb></lb>ton, and it is his duty to shoot the goods from our sacks into the buyer's sacks—the linseed is kept at the top of the mill; not on the same floor as the barley meal—on 21st February, Smith came to me and said that he wanted these goods—I made out an invoice, and this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he wanted a quarter of oats, and found, after I had made out the invoice, that he had not sufficient money to pay for them; and I at once altered the invoice to half a quarter, as it now is—I put that in both the invoice and the order—Smith told me that he came from Mr. Smith, of Clapham, a commercial traveller—he paid me about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods put into the cart were worth about three guineas, in addition to what he paid for.</p>

Q.</hi> I understand that some document is lost; what is that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The piece of paper handed to me by Smith—he did not speak to me to tell me what he wanted, but handed me a paper—when I was saying what he asked for, I was giving the effect of that document—he handed me the paper, and I understood by that that he wanted the goods—I asked him if he wanted them, and he said, "Yes "—I have no independent recollection of what was upon the order except what I see by the delivery order—we had a thorough search for the paper after the second examination at the police-court—we usually file the documents, but I have no recollection of filing this—I cannot tell you two or three other orders on that day, though I had orders in writing from other customers—I recollect this, because I suspected Smith when he went round, and that fixed it in my memory—I had not seen him before, but I believe he had been there—the customer's sacks are not of an invariable size—according to the size of the sacks would be the number to contain the articles—this is the original, which I passed on to the back of the shop—they have pulled down the houses at the back of our shop for a railway, but there were no men at work there at that time—there were no works going on near Church-street to my knowledge—after I had made out this ticket I prefixed these small figures, 1 and 2; that is how I turned it into a half—I do not think it possible for a person to read it I and a 1/2—there would be another I wanted for that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector, M</hi> 252). I am a detective officer—on Friday, 21st February, I was watching the prosecutor's premises, and saw a cart, driven by Smith, draw up to the front—I saw Smith go in, and after<lb></lb>wards come out, and take the cart round to the side entrance in Church-street—I then noticed that the cart was empty—it remained at the side entrance in Church-street from half an hour to an hour, during which time I passed several times, and saw Smith and Whittington loading it—I was in plain clothes—I saw the cart move out, and counted either eight or nine sacks in it—Smith was driving it at a rapid speed, and I followed in a cab, through the back turnings, and never lost sight of it till it reached the prisoner Edwards' premises, in the New Kent-road—Edwards came out and spoke to Smith for a minute or so—Smith then commenced unloading as fast as he could—I saw Edwards assist him with three sacks on to a shelf at the side of his shop—he dropped two of them on the floor, and when Smith was taking the sixth sack from the cart, I went to him and told him I was a police-constable, and that I should take him in custody for being concerned with his master in stealing a quantity of corn from Messrs. Edwards, in the Blackfriar's road—I asked him how many sacks he brought from there—he said he did not know exactly, seven or nine—I took him into the shop, and saw that one of the sacks, which was put on the shelf, had straw sticking in a hole in it, and there was linseed escaping from it—I sent Smith by a con<lb></lb>stable of the P division to the station, and I took Edwards to the station, when he said, "I know the order I gave to my carman"—I said, "What was it?"—(I am looking at a memorandum I made at the time)—he said, "a quarter of oats, a quarter of bran, half a quarter of beans, and a sack of meal"—I said that I would write it down, and I did so; this is it—that is all that passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) the delivery notes from the docks for your goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they form a great portion of what I have at home—James Edwards did not officiate as driver for me; but he was in business with Joseph as carman—the name of Edwards was dis<lb></lb>tinctly painted on the carts that came to my place—I have heard of James taking the name of Smith in this affair—I do not know whether that was because he was in a menial position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. Did you see the cart that went to Mr. Edwards, at the corner of the Old Kent-road? No; I know nothing of that transaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMPSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that Smith was not charged with stealing, and that there was no evidence against him of receiving; that if he was guilty of anything, it was stealing, as he was in the warehouse with Whittington assist<lb></lb>ing in taking the goods.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that it had been decided that if it was proved that a man did not receive, but only stole, he might likewise be convicted of receiving.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">would not stop the case, but would reserre the point if upon reflection it became necessary.</hi>

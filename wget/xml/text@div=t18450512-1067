                  </hi>. I live at 51, Cambridge-street, Edgeware-road, and let lodgings. On the 14th of April, Archibald Graham lodged with me—he has since gone abroad—the prisoner came to me that day about lodgings, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening—I have not a doubt about him—he partly engaged the lodgings, and gave me this address in writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"George Daniel Gresback, 11, Bryanston-street, Bryanston-square")—I know Mr. Graham had a box containing a pin at my house—I have seen the box, but never saw the pin—he left about six dayt after the robbery—he missed the pin the same night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. I produce a pin pawned at Mr. Walter's, my master, in this box, by the prisoner, with the other articles, in the last case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Not succeeding in the line of defence I took be<lb></lb>fore, I feel compelled to take the benefit of the law. I think if it is impos<lb></lb>sible to bring forward the person belonging to the pin, the person who sold it should appear, as his address is on the box, he could identify the thing he made I should think; but a man comes and says he saw it in the gen<lb></lb>tleman's shirt twice. Is it likely he can recognize a pin from seeing it twice? he says he saw it in the box. Mr. Graham, at the office said, he had two boxes of the very same description, but only one was missing, and at the time the young gentleman saw the box it was not the one the pin was in, but the other. I see by the duplicate the three articles are pawned for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is stated the seals are worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., how can the pin be worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only were lent on the whole?</p>

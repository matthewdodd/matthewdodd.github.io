I was on duty in Southwark Street on the 4th July last; Alfred Chase was also on duty about, the same place—I heard Chase cry out and saw Brown near Union Street—I ran after, him and ran against him in Suffolk Street—he was pretty nearly exhausted—I said "You have run the wrong road this time," and he said "Yes, there is only the, right and the wrong, and I have taken the wrong"—I found on him a box of matches and a knife—I did not see a <hi rend="italic">jemmy.</hi>

I am a telegraph messenger in the, employ of the Post Office—a little before 2 o'clock on the morning of the 4th July, I saw a policeman running after Richards, and I heard something fall which sounded like iron—I did not pick it up, but a policeman did, not in my presence—he came to the station afterwards and showed it.</p>

I am a chemist, at 86, Newington Causeway—between 8 and 9 o'clock on the morning of the 5th July, my boy drew my attention to the grating in front of my house—I saw it had been removed, and: the lead work let in to keep it in place was forced up, but they could not get any further—I saw this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> compared with the marks in the lead by the Inspector, and it fitted the marks exactly.</p>

               <p>two men standing on the left-hand side of the road—I watched them, and saw them go up by Clayton Buildings—there is no thoroughfare there, and they crossed the road and went up Union Street—they stopped under a lamp, conversing, and I went on my knees and watched them, and saw them walk away towards the Borough, and get into a door-way—the prisoner Richards passed close by and had a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in his side pocket, and I grabbed at it—he threw it down and cried out "Pick that up and go home"—I held him till a cabman came up, and I told him to hold the prisoner, and gave him my truncheon—the other prisoner was standing about fifty yards away in Union Street, and I ran after him—as soon as he saw me give the cabman the other prisoner, he took, off and he was stopped by another constable, and we took them both to the station—Richards threw the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> some distance up Union Street—they were about half a mile from Mr. Bellamy's house.</p>

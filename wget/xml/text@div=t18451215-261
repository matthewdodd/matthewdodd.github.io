                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Edmond Wbitelock, a hosier, at No. 166, Strand—the prisoner came to his shop on the 18th Nov., she looked out a quantity of goods, and ordered them to be sent to Mrs. Harker, 22, Long-acre—I went there, and it proved to be a false address—our goods were examined, and some satin handkerchiefs were missed which I had been showing the prisoner—they were not included in the bill of those things she bought—they were satin handkerchiefs, and the value of them was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no other customer in the shop at the time I showed the prisoner the handkerchiefs—I saw nothing of the prisoner till the 29th Nov., when she was detained at a neighbouring shop.</p>

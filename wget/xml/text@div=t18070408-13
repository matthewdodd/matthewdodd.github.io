            . I live in Church-street, Edmonton, I have been in the building line, I have not long retired. On the 14th of March I ordered a load of hay to be cut; the man cut a load and three trusses; half a load was to be taken to my son and Mr. Arnold, they are partners together, and the remainder was to be brought to my house at Edmonton.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he your servant. - A. No, he is Mr. Arnold's servant; he was to bring me twelve trusses at noon. I met him in the road between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I asked him how many trusses of hay he had got, he said there is twelve trusses; I said I do not think there is twelve, there seems a small quantity of it; I turned back with him, I intended to have seen him turned it out of the cart, but somebody came and prevented me; afterwards I counted them twice over in the loft, I counted only eighteen instead of twenty-one; I went to the field, and they were loading the hay to take to town; the haybinder said there was twenty-one on the cart. Ward was by at the time; Ward asked me if he should leave the three trusses at my house. I told him to take the twenty-one trusses to London; he set off about half after four in the afternoon.</p>

On the 13th of March I sent him down to do some work for Mr. Gosling. On his return home he was to bring hay; he returned on the 14th about half past nine; he said he had been at work in the field for Mr. Gosling till past six, and that made him so late home; I asked him how many trusses he had brought; he told me eighteen trusses, and he had left it in the cart; he was to come at eight o'clock in the morning to put it in the loft; at eight o'clock the next morning I found the cart there and the hay, but there was not the quantity that I expected; when he came I told him there was but thirteen trusses; he told me there was eighteen, he said the horses had eat some in the night; I said they could not eat five trusses; there might be with what the horses had eat, and what was loose, another truss; reckoning that there might be fourteen trusses in all. I asked him what he had done with the other, he said he had not done nothing with it. I sent for an officer; during the time the officer came, the foreman told him he had better tell me what he had done with the hay, and I might be a friend to him. I told him if he would tell me who he had sold the hay to, I would be a friend to him. In consequence he was put in the custody of an officer; and we went and found the hay at the Leg of Mutton and Trimmings public house, Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you find there. - A. Six trusses altogether and four of them were like mine; the other two might be outside trusses.</p>
               <p>Q. Four is what you missed. - A. We missed seven.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know of the twenty-one at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed four, that made up eighteen. - A. Yes. I saw the ostler; the other prisoner there (Latter) told the officer that Ward had left some hay with him, but he had paid him no money.</p>

On Sunday the 15th of March, Ward was brought to my house about this hay; I sent for Mr. Mason, another officer, and left Ward at my house; I went and took Latter, and brought him to my house; he there said in the presence of Ward that Ward had left some hay for some money that he owed him; I think he mentioned six or seven shillings.

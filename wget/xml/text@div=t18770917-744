That silk is stolen from a warehouse in Southwark Street; I want you to account for the possession of it"—he said "I bought it of a man for samples"—I said "When and where?—he said "I bought it of a man in a public-house in the City Road"—I said 'What is the man's name, and the sign of the house?"—he said he did not know, I then asked him for a description of the man—he said "I cannot give you one"—I held the receipt up and said "Here is a receipt for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Johnson paid you"—he said "Well, I did not write that receipt, that is not my writing"—Johnson said "You were present when it was written"—Allen said "Yes, but it is 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then said "Did you receive that 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Yes, I received it and paid it to the man who brought the silk, and he gave me a half sovereign for my trouble"—I asked him if he had got any receipt or invoice; he said "No"—I said "I will search your house"—in the kitchen drawer I found this piece of black ribbon—I asked him how he accounted for it"—he said "I bought it some five or six days ago"—I said "When and where?—he said "I bought it in the street of an old clothes woman, off a barrow"—I said "What street? how much did you give for it"—he said "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I took Allen and Johnson to the station, and they were charged with stealing the goods—I went to Harris, the father's house, in the evening, and he gave me this receipt "Bought of F.

                  </hi>. I am a draper in White Alie Street—I buy job lots of silk sometimes—I have been in business twelve years—Mr. Harris shewed me some samples of silk in the early part of June—I do not remember the date—I looked at them—he said he had been asking 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard for them—I said they were worth that—I would not give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for them—Mr. Harris made no concealment about it—I have been in my present, residence ten years—I have known Harris since he was a boy—he is a respectable tradesman—I have brought job lots of silk of Pawsons, of Lewis, and Cooks, and form my opinion from my general experience.</p>

Mine is a large business—this silk is not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, but I am used to buying in job lots and damaged goods, so I should not like to say—I should not call this perfect, because of the way it is rolled up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Mansell Street, and am a job draper—my parents have been in business fifty years, and I have been in business six years—I was at Mr. Harris' premises on 5th June—he asked me what I thought some samples of silk were worth—I replied that it was difficult to give a precise judgment about that class of goods, because the qualities are so various, and I did not want to buy them, but I believed they were worth about lid a yard—I have been in the habit of attending large sales, and I. have seen goods of a similar quality fetch 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard—I have known Harris all my life—I was in a situation with him many years—he has borne a high character amongst his neighbours for honesty and integrity.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the last witness call, went up, and heard the prisoners say money. I found the witness and the prisoner collaring each other. Fogg said he had attempted to rob him, and gave him in charge - I took him to the watch-house. He said, "Don't keep me too long here-let me go and try my luck again."</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. He said he he meant to rob the prosecutor, and if we let him go he would have satisfaction before night. He made a great resistance on being taken to the Compter. It was as much as three men could do to handcuff him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived as a porter in some respectable houses, since which I have experienced great distress, and got so ragged I was ashamed to be seen. On this night I determined to drown myself, but afterwards thought it was very wrong, and determined to get into a watch-house that I might not be seen in such a deplorable situation in the streets. I got put into two watchhouses before this, but upon my telling them what I did it for they descharged me I attacked the prosecutor, but did not mean to do him any harm. I would not tell them at the watch-house why I did it, fearing they would turn me out.</p>

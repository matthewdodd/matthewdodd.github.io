                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wright, cheesemonger, of chard-street, Westminster. On Sunday evening, 22nd Oct., a little before nine, I was in the parlour—I could see the shop, but not the shop-door—I heard somebody come into the shop, jumped up, and saw the prisoner going out with a side of bacon—I did not see his face, but am certain of his figure—he lived with us two years ago as servant—I ran out and saw him under a lamp—he ran into Pye-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to Mr. Wright—I was standing about two doors off, and I saw some people about the door—the prisoner was one—presently I saw Mrs. Wright running after him—he had a large piece of bacon—he went down a court—I knew him well, and am sure he is the man.</p>

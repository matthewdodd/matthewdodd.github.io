                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 370). On 17th March, about twelve minutes past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Hackney Road, and I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, in a very excited state—Iran across the road and stopped him—I asked him what he had been doing, he said "Nothing, I can run if I like"—I told him I thought he had been striking somebody; he said, "No, I have not;"—I took him to Cambridge Place, and met Mr. James Williams, who said "That is one of them who his had a horse and cart taking away goods from somebody here," and that he had seen two or three of them loitering about, and the others had gone on with a horse and cart—he pointed to Mr. Matthews' door, and said, "They have been robbing or breaking into Mr. Matthews', and there is the door open"—I had the prisoner against Mr. Matthews' door at that time, and on entering the passage, I found four bags of tea ready for removal—I told Mr. Matthews, and he gave the prisoner into custody—I took him to the station, and then returned and examined the premises—an entrance to the shop had been made through a sky-light in the roof, which was either broken or taken out—on the roof of the adjoining shops, I found marks of a man's boot in the drift sand in the gutters, which I afterwards compared with another mark made by the end of it, with one of the prisoner's boots, and the impressions corresponded exactly.</p>

               <p>the prisoner making motions to another man walking on the same side as I live; he threw his head and hand back at the same time, in a suspicious way—they passed my premises, and went a considerable distance up the road, still on different sides—they passed my premises three or four different times—Iwent in for a few minutes, and when I returned I saw four men crossing the road in a direction from Mr. Matthews' shop; the prisoner was one of them—three of them were carrying bags on their backs; I will not be positive whether the prisoner had one—they went down Thomas Street opposite—I saw a cart there, in Thomas Street, into which they threw the bags, and two of them jumped into the cart and galloped away as fast aa they cottld; the third offered to get in but could not, and the prisoner, who was the fourth, walked up the Hackney Road when he found he could not get in—I called out" Step," and "Follow him," for a short distance; I found I could not run, so I called "stop thief"—before I called, he was walking quite leisurely, but after I called, he ran very fast—I saw him stopped by Policeman 370—I found Mr. Matthews' door open, and called a policeman.</p>

On the night of 16th March, when I went to bed, I left my shop safe—itis only connected with my dwelling by a covered passage—I was awakened suddenly by the violent ringing of my door-bell about half-past 6 o'clock; I went down to the front door, and found four, bags containing tea packed up ready for taking away, and the door was open, and the prisoner was there in charge of a policeman—I examined the shop, and found that several packages of tea had been opened and the contents taken; some coffee bags had been emptied on the floor to make room for the tea—I went over my stock, and missed about 160lbs. weight of tea, value 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

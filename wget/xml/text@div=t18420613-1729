                  </hi>. I am a dealer in game, and live in Sun-street, Bi<lb></lb>shopsgate; the prisoner was in my service as a game-washer, and worked on the premises at the back of the shop. In consequence of losing mo<lb></lb>ney from my till, on the night of the 7th of June I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of silver, placed it in the till, and locked it—the prisoner came to work a little before seven o'clock next morning—between eight and nine I went to the till—it was still locked—I opened it, counted the money, and five half-crowns and two shillings were gone—I called in Horsnell, who was waiting outside, sent for all my men, and had them searched—they all agreed to be searched—nothing was found on the two first—the prisoner was then searched, and in his pockets were found the identical five half-crowns and two shillings which I had marked the night before, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides—I told the prisoner that I little suspected it was him, but it appeared he was found out at last—he made me no answer—he was taken into custody—I suspect he opened the tif with a false key, as there was no appearance of force—I have lost between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the till—and if it had not been for the constable, I might have lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi> or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received information from him that I was being robbed.</p>

In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I received, I called on the prosecutor, who, at my recommend<lb></lb>ation, marked some silver, and put it into the till—I waited outside the shop next morning till I was called in—I searched the prisoner, and found in his right trowsers'-pocket five half-crowns and two shillings marked, and in his other pocket one sovereign and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "All the money is mine"—he took me to his lodging, and in his presence I found some duplicates, and these two papers, by which it appears he had been paying off for some clothes, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each time, on the 26th and 30th of May—I also found a quantity of horse-hair, which he could give no account of—one of the duplicates is for a coat belonging to a mate of his—the others are for women's things—he is living with a prostitute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soldier in the Royal Artillery. About a fortnight ago I was in the Crooked Billet public house, Tower-hill—I went into the tap room between 2 and 3 o'clock—I took my coat off and laid it on a form—I was talking to some soldiers of the Guards—I got up to go away, and missed my coat—I have never seen it since—I saw the prisoner in the tap room—she had not been in company with me—I had not seen her before—it was a blue cape coat, like this one.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the Crooked Billet, on 11th May—I went in about 7 o'clock in the evening, and stayed till about 9—I saw Smith talking to some foot guards—the prisoner was on the opposite side of the form—I am sure it was her—I saw Smith with a blue coat like this one—he put it across a form—I saw the prisoner put it under her arm» and take it out—I am quite sure she is the person—I went with the soldiers to look alter her, but could not see her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 36). On the evening of 12th May I took the prisoner at the Crooked Billet—as we were going to the station she said she was going to take it to a <hi rend="italic">leaving shop</hi> in Castle-street, to get some money on it—she said she had taken it to a pawnbroker's in the Mi nodes, and they, were shut up, and, as she was going down Rosemary-lane, a woman stole it from her arm, and she had not seen it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to get half a pint of beer, and a young woman said she was to take this young man's coat, and get some money; she asked me to go with her; when we got out she asked me if I would pawn it; I said I did not know where it was; she asked me again, and I took it, and as I was going along a woman ran against me, and took the coat; I went after her, but could not find her; I went and inquired; I went the next day to the Crooked Billet, and was taken.</p>

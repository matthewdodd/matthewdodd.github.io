On 29th April, about half-past five in the evening, I and my wife left our room—I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—no one had access to the room in our absence—I returned about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve, and found the door tied with a piece of rope—it had been broken open—the bolt was shot—a caddy on the table had been opened, and the contents disturbed, but nothing taken—a small box of children's clothes had been turned over, but nothing taken—a rug, a quilt, and two sheets, which had been on the bed, which was turned</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 94, Saffron-hill; Lewis is my sister's hus<lb></lb>band. On 29th April I was passing their house, with another sister, about half-past eight or twenty minutes to nine—I saw a glimmering light in their room, as if from a fire—I watched it a few minutes—the prisoner came close to the window with a light, like a match in his hand; it reflected on his face, and I saw it quite plain—he was opening the cupboard and looking in—my sister called out, "There is a strange man in the room, run!"—the window was wide open, and the prisoner appeared to hear it—he looked out—it is rather low, but a man standing on the ground could not reach it without breaking the window of the shop below—I ran up-stairs, and found the prisoner on the second step from the room coming down—I said, "How wrong it is for you to be in that room; what are you doing?"—I caught hold of him—he said he had been up to the second-floor to inqure for a person—I called the lodgers down, and they said, in his presence, he had not been up there, and was quite a stranger—a policeman came and took him, and I tied the door with a rope—the bolt was shot, and it seemed as if the staple had been forced back.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint, and have been so a great number of years. I have had experience in matters of this sort - this half-crown produced by Goose is counterfeit - it is the one which fell from the mould - here are also eight other counterfeit half-crown- the first five produced are impressions from the same mould, the other four are not impressed from that mould - here is a good half-crown, which Goose produced, which appears to have been the half-crown that made the- all the thirteen half-crowns produced have been made from moulds made from the same good half-crown, and only nine of them from the mould produced - the good half-crown has made more than one mould - Banister his produced some broken pieces of a plaster of Paris mould which has been used for casting half-crowns - here are five pieces of a mould, having parts of the impressions of the obverse side of a half-crown - here are parts of the letters and date, and here are three other pieces, having parts of impressions of the reverse side - I believe nine half-crowns have been made in this mould when perfect - the four finished are not from the same mould - this pipkin has white metal in it of a description like the counterfeit even - this spoon is of the same white metal as the counterfeit coin, and such as is usually used to melt for casting coin - this tobacco-pipe has white metal in it of a similar description, and may have been used to lade metal out of the pipkin - this get fits the channel of the mould, through which the metal flows down into the impression.</p>
               <p>Page. Q. I wish to know whether you say that is a mould? A. These are parts of what I believe has been a mould.</p>
               <p>Page's Defence (written)."You have heard the evidence adduced in support of this charge, and I leave it with you to determine as to my guilt or innocence; but, at the same time, I confidently rely on your verdict. The only circumstance at all implicating me in that offence, is the finding of some whitening in the room from which I was taken, and which I am in the habit of using, or causing to be used, for the purpose of cleaning the hearth - which the police preternd was used by me for the purpose of forming moulds - a corresponding circumstance, and which, in a great measure, leads to my being thus charged, was the circumstance of the melted metal being on the fire; this I was about to form into a weight for a pully to the spring of a pigeontrap - the circumstance of having counterfeit coin found in the room, I cannot attempt to deny, but many other persons had access to the same room, and I do most solemnly deny that any thing was found in my possession to justify this prosecution - when the police arrived, there was no person on the premises but myself: the female was only an occasional visitor at my lodgings, and was gone out, at the time the officers came to search my room, for some milk for my tea - whatever verdict you may see proper to return, as it regards me, I do most solemnly protest the female prisoner is innocent of having done any offence in conjunction with me."</p>

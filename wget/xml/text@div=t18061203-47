            . I am a police officer of Queen square. On the 13th of November last between two and three o'clock, I happened to be passing through <placeName id="t18061203-47-crimeloc273">Holborn</placeName>

I walked across the road; she returned to the spencer, and took it completely off. When she had got fifteen or sixteen yards off I stopped her, and took the spencer from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Brown, is that your spencer. - A. It is, it hung outside of the door I am a <rs id="t18061203-47-viclabel274" type="occupation">silk mercer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it is your spencer. - A. Both by the lining and by the outside.</p>
               <p>A. In your profound judgment may not other persons have the same lining and the same outside. - A. They may.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was looking at this spencer it came off in my hand; it was very loosely pinned. I should have taken it into the shop if the officer had not taken hold of me; he abused he, and had me stripped in the shop, then he took me to the office and had me stripped again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

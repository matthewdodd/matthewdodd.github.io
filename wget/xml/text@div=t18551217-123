I took Sweetman into custody in Arthur-street, St. Luke's, and told him he was charged with breaking and entering the Fountain public house on 16th Sept.—he said that he knew nothing about it, and was not there—on the way to the station he said, "I can prove where I was on that morning."</p>

It seems very strange that the boy did not know me if he has seen so much of me, and he was close to me; I am now in different clothes, and he says that he knows me; that shows that he has been tutored by somebody to bring me into this robbery; I did not know anything about it till last night, or I would have, got witnesses to character.</p>

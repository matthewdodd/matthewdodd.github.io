                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Henry Adams, of 19, Hanover<lb></lb>terrace, Notting-hill. On Saturday, 4th Jan., about seven o'clock, I missed some beef, veal, and apples, from the safe, in the front area, where I had seen them a quarter of an hour before—I informed the constable.</p>

In consequence of information from Wren, I searched round the premises, but found nothing—as I came out I saw Lilley go by in a direction from a field adjoining the premises—I knew him before—I went into the field, and there found some veal secreted in a hole in the grass—I then directed the constable on the beat to watch, and left—I returned about nine o'clock, and he had just appre<lb></lb>hended Stewart and Lilley; Stewart ran away—I afterwards apprehended him—I took the veal the next day to Mr. White's, the butcher.</p>

I was called by Hitchcock to watch the veal—in about half an hour Lilley and Stewart came into the field, went up to the veal, looked at it, and said it was all right—there was a gas lamp close by—after staying there a few minutes they went away—I remained there watching till a few minutes before nine, when Stewart and Head, and a fourth lad came—they said to each other that they should pick up a b good stone or two, as there might be somebody watching them—I think it was Lilley said that, I am not certain; but when they started to run away, Lilley threw some stones down—Stewart went up to the veal, and as he was in the act of picking it up he caught sight of me—they said something, and all ran off—I pursued them, and overtook Head and Lilley—they said they had not come there to steal it—I took the veal to the station.</p>

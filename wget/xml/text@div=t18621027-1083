I am a detective officer of the City—on the afternoon of 4th September, Mr. Haas spoke to me, and I went with him and a brother officer, named Packman, to some dining-rooms in Nicholas-lane—I there found the prisoner—I told him we were officers, and that one of the notes he had changed at Mr. Haas' was a stolen note—that he had better accom<lb></lb>pany us to the Bank of England and explain the matter—we then went to the Bank—I showed him the ten-pound note, and asked him if that was the note he changed at Mr. Haas'—he said at first he did not think it was, but he afterwards said, "Yes; I believe it is the note"—I told him it was a stolen note, and asked him to tell us who he was and what he was, and give us his address—he said his name was John Fenne, that he was a professed gambler, and that he lived in 1, Russell-place, Old Kent-road—</p>

               <p>Mr. Haas was standing by at the time, and I asked him if that was the address the prisoner had given at his shop, and which had been written on the note—Mr. Haas said it was not; the address he had given there was 14, Peacock-terrace, Victoria-park—I then asked the prisoner how he recon<lb></lb>ciled the different addresses that he had given—he said he formerly used to live at 14, Peacock-terrace, that he had just returned to England, and he had given the address of the place he lived at before he left—I asked him where Peacock-terrace, Victoria-park, was, and he said, "Down the road on the left hand side," or, at least, "Down the left hand side”—I then asked him how he became possessed of the note—he said he had taken it at the gambling tables at Baden about fourteen days ago, but he could not tell from whom he received it—I then asked him if he could give us any refer<lb></lb>ence in London, to any person who knew him, or who he knew—he said he could not, as he had been in England such a short time—I then told him that his account was so unsatisfactory I should, take him into custody—on the way to the police-station, he said, "This is a very hard ease”—I said, "If it is, you have brought it all on yourself; a short time ago a person went into Mr. Nathan's shop, in Cornhill, and changed 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., worth of stolen notes, and gave the some address that you have given, 14, Peacock-terrace, Victoria-park, and there is no such place"—he did not make any answer to that—I looked him up at the police-station—after that I went with Packman to the address he at first gave, 1, Russell-place, Old Kent-road—I made a search and found this brass-plate in a box there, (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Mons. Murray, Professeur Gymnastiques Medicale," which I afterwards took possession of—the prisoner afterwards said that he gave the address, Peacock-terrace, as it was the first thing that came in his head—he thought it was a mere formal thing giving an address at all—I told him I had found the plate, and ascertained that his name was Murray—he said, "My name is Fenne."</p>

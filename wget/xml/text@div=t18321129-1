            . I belong to the Foreign Post-office, and lodge at Mr. Duncan's, who lives in the house himself; we both enter at one door; I have a key of the street door, as I am often out late. On Friday, the 20th of October, I went out about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, and came home between one and a quarter-past, having been absent about an hour; when I went out Mr. Duncan and his family were all at home; I had the key of the street door, and am sure the lock sprung when I went out - on returning I opened the door with my key; I had no light - I was bolting the top bolt of the door, and the passage being newly painted, I was obliged to turn my face from the door - I perceived on the newly painted wainscot a shade, and it turned out to be the shade of the prisoner; I said "What the devil do you do here?" then another man ran down the passage, and put his hand over my mouth - I stood with my back to the door; the other afterwards made his escape - I held the prisoner tight, and got him outside the door; I put my leg out to throw the other man down, which I did nearly, and the prisoner got out of my hand - I pursued him closely; he was never out of my sight - the watchman seized him: I am certain he is the same man, for I never lost sight of him for a moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How did you leave the door when you went out? A. On the spring lock, and I locked it fast - nobody could open it without a key; I found it shut, on the spring, when I returned, but not locked - several persons live in the house; I am the only one who has a key - the party must have got in by a false-key.</p>

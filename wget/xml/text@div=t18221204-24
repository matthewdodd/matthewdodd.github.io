            . I am a carpenter. On Monday morning, the 4th of November, about seven o'clock, I met the prisoner in Jeremy-street, with the copper in a bag, on his back; Foxhall and I went up and questioned him, he said he brought it from Duke-street, and was taking it to his master. in Fleet-Market. We followed him, and saw him near an old iron shop in Blue Cross-street, and then stopped him; he resisted a good deal, but Foxhall took him, and I took the copper; he slipped off his coat and ran off - we followed and overtook him - we found a crow-bar and basket in the bag, he was stopped in Regent-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040011"></xptr>without my losing sight of him. As he was brought back to the top of White Horse-street, I saw a quantity of lead and a knot, wrapped up in a black cloth - it was in the direction he went. I compared the crow-bar with the marks on the house in Duke-street, where the lead was wrenched, it fitted, and the pipe matched with the rest - the edges were quite fresh cut.</p>

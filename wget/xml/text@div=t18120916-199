            . I live at No. 23, Devereaux-court, in the strand. Mr. Stancliff came to Mr. Mackenzie's chambers, in the Temple, he was not at home. I am a servant to Mr. Mackenzie, No. 2, Brick-court. The prisoner asked, if Mr. Mackenzie was at home; I told him, no, he was out of town. He asked me, whether he could write a note, I told him, yes; I showed him into Mr. Mackenzie's sitting room to do that. I left him by himself; he sat about two or three minutes. While he was writing, he asked me if I could get him a glass of water; I went and got the water, and gave it to him. He was sitting in the chamber, he drank the water, and when he was going out of door, I asked him whether he had left the letter on the table; he was going away with the note in his hand. I asked him to leave it; he gave me the letter then. When he had got down I opened the letter, if was not sealed; I found there was nothing in the letter. I ran after him, and detected him in New-court, in the Temple. I told him there was nothing in the letter, and he said there was, it was done in pencil. I told him, I should be glad if he would come back and see; and going up stairs one of the books fell from him. I knew the book; I said it belonged to my master, he said it did. He was going down stairs again; I told him I must have him searched before he went any farther. He then walked down with me into Devereaux-court, from the Temple. I got Smith to get a constable. There were found nine books, a pocket-book, and a number of other things on him.</p>

            . I am one of the Temple porters.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see this boy and Stancliff - A. Near about the middle of Essex-street; he was following of him. The lad gave me charge of him; he said he had been robbing his master's chambers. He took all this property out of his small-clothes and hat, and gave it to me and the boy, without a constable; there are nine books, and a pocket-book, and other things.</p>
               <p>Struchan. These books are my master's books; they were in the chamber before he came, his name is written on them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

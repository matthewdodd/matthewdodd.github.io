                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Stepney. I was put into a cottage by Harrison, a policeman, to take care of it—on the 16th of March, the prisoner came there and presented a paper, which he said was a memorandum of an agreement between his father and the late landlord, Mr. Greenside—that his father had received a note from Mr. Gordon, the solicitor, instructing him to repair the roof of the house, and he came for the purpose of examining, and to go to Mr. Dempsey, the builder, for him to send a man to examine the tiles, and for Mr. Bampton to inspect the lend—he went on the roof, and after he had been there some time, he called for a hammer and nails, which I handed to him—after being there some time, I got up to see what he was doing—I found some loose pieces of lead in the gutter—I asked how they came there—(I had never been on the roof before)—he said he did not know, but he found them there—I said, "It is evident to me, they have been recently taken from their places"—I could see that, by the places over the sky-light and under the sky-light, it had been evidently removed recently—I told him so—he said he did know—I re<lb></lb>placed the lead on the places—it all corresponded and fitted—after that, we both came down together—he left, and about three o'clock he came to show the same paper to Harrison, the policeman—I called him to Harrison, as he had stated that he wished to see Harrison, who lives a few doors off—he told him the same story as he told me—he went away—at six o'clock the same day, he knocked at the door, and said, "I desired you to keep that window shut," pointing to a window which was open—he bid me good night, and said he would be with me in the morning with Mr. Demp<lb></lb>sey's man, about the repairs—about half-past seven o'clock, I heard a noise on the roof of the house like footsteps—I did not go up—it was quite dark—nearly an hour afterwards, I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Stepney, on the 16th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner in Bedford-square, standing by the side of a bag—I turned round, and said, "What is in this bag"—he said, "Lead"—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he said, "To sell it"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "At Mr. Phillips's, in Whitechapel," and he had got it from his father's cottage, in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and agent to this estate for Alexander Crawford Bromekear—it is in Cottage-lane, Commercial-road. I never sent a letter to the prisoner or his father to repair the house—his father never bad a lease of the premises to my knowledge, and I believe he new had—there was never any agreement entered into on the part of him<lb></lb>self and Mr. Bromekear—he has been distrained upon for rent on two dif<lb></lb>ferent occasions; and after the last occasion, I believe, he absented himself from the premises—he applied to me for permission to quit the premises at the half quarter, he being a yearly tenant—this was about Christmas—there were two small buildings erected on the premises, which they called the; ginger-beer and soda-water manufactory—those buildings were pulled down on the 2nd of March almost entirely, and finished completely on the 3rd—they were affixed to the freehold—the lead and other things belonging to the building, were taken away a fortnight before the 16th—the prisoner's father built the soda-water place himself, and occupied it—he was not allowed to take it away—he threatened to remove it, but I told him it belonged to the freehold, and had become the property of the land<lb></lb>lord—he had become a tenant of the premises from Michaelmas, 1832—he was to have had a lease for seven years, but no agreement was entered into, and when I asked him to take a lease he refused—he said his agreement was not signed, and he was not obliged to do it—there never was an agree-ment.</p>

You say my father bad no agreement for the house, (he had lived fourteen years in the place) how long have you been solicitor to, the freeholder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three years—I believe the first attorney lived in Red-cross-street—there is no action going forward as to the prosecutor being the right freeholder—Mr. Bromekear is not receiving rents for the whole of the estate—he recovered the property by a process of ejectment—Mr. Clark is a tenant of Mr. Bromekear, and the personal representative of the late owner—there is not a word of truth in Mr. Bromekear not being the free-holder—your father never gave up the key to me, he was not in possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I put Palmer into possession of the house to take care of it, as it was deserted; on the 16th of March I saw the prisoner, he produced a paper to me, and stated that his father had received a letter from the solictor of the estate, to authorise him to go to Dempsey's to do the necessary repairs.</p>

I understand the prisoner's father has been in possession four or five years, but would never pay any rent—I have no meant of knowing how long he was in possession—the great uncle of the prosecutor had let the whole of the estate on a lease, for sixty-one years, which lease expired at Michaelmas last; but in consequence of an arrange<lb></lb>ment at the trial of the ejectment, the prosecutor was to receive the reads of the whole estate, two yean previously to the expiration of the original lease; and it was in consequence of this, that he claimed rent of the pri<lb></lb>soner's father, before Michaelmas, 1832, but how long he had been in posession previous to 1832, I cannot state—I believe he had possession before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No. 36, Worship Street. On the afternoon of Nov. 9, about 1 o'clock, I was at the corner of New Bridge Street, Ludgate Hill, a few minutes before the Lord Mayor's procession came—a rush was made towards me by several parties—the prisoner was one of them—there were three or four gentlemen at the corner of New Bridge Street, and the prisoner and two or three more made a rush at him</p>

               <p>as he stood next to me—his coat was buttoned up, but be got it thrown right open, and I saw the prisoner draw his watch from his waistcoat pocket—I saw it distinctly in his hand, and saw the chain hanging round the gen<lb></lb>tleman's neck, in front of the waistcoat, without the watch—the prisoner passed it to one of his accomplices, and it was dropped accidentally, and picked up again—they then ran off—the prisoner ran to the opposite side of the street—I followed him, and gave him in charge, and returned with him and the constable to the gentleman, who remained in the same place—I said, "This is the party who stole your watch"—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "No; I do not know you; I have never seen you before"—he opened his hand, and said, "Oh, dear, no; I have not got your watch;" and he looked up in his face as innocent as could be—I heard him give a signal to his companions; he called out, "<hi rend="italic">Whoop</hi>, all right!"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of High Street, Stratford. On 9th Nov., about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of New Bridge Street—there was a rush towards me, occasioned by two porters bringing a large packing case, which they stood on the path, and just at that time it was announced that the procession was coming—my attention was awakened immediately, and I felt a jerk round my neck—I looked down, and saw my watch chain suspended from my waistcoat, and my watch was gone—the prisoner was immediately in front of me, breast to breast—I accused him of it—he opened his hands, felt down here, and said, "You are quite mistaken; I have not got your watch;" and I let him go—I did not observe which way he went—he was brought back shortly afterwards by Ogilvie and a policeman—it was a silver watch, and was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Puckeridge, in Hertfordshire. On the 25th of October I was going from the Bell and Crown public-house, Holborn, to Puckeridge, between three and four o'clock—I had a bag con<lb></lb>taining the articles stated—I left it inside the booking-office, and walked to and fro in front of the office door a little way, waiting for the coach—I returned in five or ten minutes, and found the bag gone—I saw it again about two minutes afterwards—I cannot exactly say who had got it—a number of people came round the door, and the two prisoners were in cus<lb></lb>tody—I distinctly saw James in custody, but not the other, at the moment—I was rather confused at the time—the bag and the articles in it are my property.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at the Bell and Crown public-house on the 25th of October, to look after the coaches—I am in the same em<lb></lb>ploy now. About twenty minutes before four o'clock I saw the prisoner Miller go into the coach-office, take the bag out, and give it to James, who was standing at the corner of Leather-lane, about twenty yards from the coach-office, I think—Miller said, "Here, Jack," and James came to him—they walked as far as Leather-lane, and then Miller gave him the bag—I asked Aldridge, my fellow-servant, who was standing there, if the bag did not belong to one of his passengers—he said it did—I said, "There are two young men just gone up Leather-lane with it"—we followed them up</p>

               <p>the lane, and saw them running up the lane with another, who if not here—that one struck Aldridge over the head with an umbrella—he got away—I followed the prisoners up the lane, and did not lose tight of them—when the other man struck Aldridge I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out "Stop thief"—I called a policeman, who was handy, and gave them into custody.</p>

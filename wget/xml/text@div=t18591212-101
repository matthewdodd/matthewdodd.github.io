I am a tea dealer at Philpot-lane—the prisoner was a carman and porter in my employ up to the 28th November last, and had been so for several years—on 28th November, I gave him twelve sovereigns, a 5<hi rend="italic">i.</hi> note, this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a Post-office order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the last two were, crossed—they amounted altogether to Upwards of 26-<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Wicks, take these to Hankey's—he was to pay them in and bring me the book back—he had been in the habit of taking money there—he took a pass book with him for that purpose—the money was in the pocket of the book—I gave it to him and he went away for that purpose—that was about 20 minutes before 4 in the afternoon—he did not return at all—in consequence of that I went in search of the police—I have the cheque and Post office order here—they are the same which I gave to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 293). From some information, I went in search of the prisoner on 2d December—I found him at 7 o'clock in the evening in Orange-street—I told him I was a detective officer and that he must come with me to Mr. Forster's—I told him that he knew very well what it was for, and he said, "For robbing of him"—he used the word "Mr. Forster"—he said, "I have robbed Mr. Forster, and the reason why I did it, was, I was mad drunk; I did not know what I was about;" I had the cheque and Post-office order—I asked him whether he sent them to his wife, and he said "Yes"—he said that if Mr. Forster would take him into his employ again, he would pay him so much a week back—I asked him what he had done with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the gold in the parcel—he said that he got drunk on the Monday evening, and was robbed of them; that they must have drugged him, and that the pass book and all were stolen from him—I took him to the station—I searched him and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, a tobacco box, three receipt stamps, and two knives—I got the cheque and Post-office order from the prisoner's wife—that was not in consequence of anything he said—I had them previous to taking him into custody—I had been watching the house.</p>

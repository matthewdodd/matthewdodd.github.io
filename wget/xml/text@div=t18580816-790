                  </hi>. I am a butcher—I manage the business of Henry and George Lee, in Leadenhall-market—in consequence of information, I went outside the shop on Thursday, 5th August, about half-past 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner Richards, and another man whom I did not notice distinctly; they were standing a few yards from the shop—Richards had got a bag—I went one or two yards, and, as soon as I got round the corner, I came back and saw Richards coming out of the shop, and putting the beef in the bag, and the leg of the bullock would not go in, it was sticking out of the bag—Blakeby ran up, and I ran, and Richards was secured; the other party ran away, and a few yards off he ran into the arms of a policeman—the other party was about the height of Williams—I opened the bag, and found 51lbs. of beef in it—it was my master's, and was safe just before; I had cut the other part from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shopman in Leadenhall-market—I saw both the prisoners on that afternoon, about half-past 5 o'clock; they were standing leaning against my master's shop, which is six or eight yards from the prosecutor's—they were in company, and were talking—my master's shop was shut up—I rang the bell and went inside, and looked through the ventilator—I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's, and Richards went in and took a piece, and enveloped it in a bag; he put the bag over it—Williams stood on the threshold of the door—the beef was not above two paces inside the shop—I ran out while Richards was in the shop, and watched on the threshold—I passed Williams, who had just moved from the door and was five or six paces on the pavement, going in a contrary direction—Richards was going out; the beef was on the ground at his feet, and Richards was endeavouring to cover the leg over with the sack—as I ran out I saw two policemen—I shouted to them to come on, and one of them ran up and took Richards—I assisted him to take him to the station—Williams was taken—I had shouted out, "Stop him; stop him!" and he nearly fell into another policeman's arms—while at the station, Richards made use of very violent threats, and said he would be transported for me—the two prisoners were desperate towards the policemen when at the station.</p>

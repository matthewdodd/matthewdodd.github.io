                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I was in Mrs. Barker's shop with a man named Fluister, and saw this watch pledged by the prisoner—from what Mr. Smith said we followed him—I told him I should apprehend him on suspicion of stealing a gold watch at Wimbledon, on Saturday, the 23rd, the same watch that he had pawned on the Monday—he said "I pawned a watch on Monday, and you saw roe pawn it"—I asked him where be got it—he said "A man named Allen gave it to me, a betting man"—I asked him where he could be found—he said he did not know, unless it was at some of the places that betting men frequented—all that he knew was that he came from Birmingham—he gave a correct address.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You knew the prisoner, did not you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as a betting man, and he knew me—it was on the 25th I saw him pawning the watch—I will not say that I did not see him on the 26th, I might, and I might not—he spoke to me when I went into the shop, and when I took him on this charge he reminded me that I had seen him pawn it—he offered to go to Fleet Street with me to find Allen—he said that Allen wanted him to pawn the watch because he wanted to make a bet.</p>

Barker &amp; Sons, vine distillers, of Bishopsgate Street—I have known the prisoner going into different public-houses—I have a slight recollection of a person named Allen—I don't know him particularly—on Saturday, 25th July, I was going through Primrose Street to a customer—I met the prisoner—he had promised me previously to take me to a customer over the water—he disappointed me several times—I upbraided him for not taking me there—he said he would take me on Monday—we went into the Grapes and had a glass of ale together, and he promised to meet me on the Monday morning at 11 o'clock—I met a man on the Monday, and we went to the Crown in Liverpool Street—the prisoner came in there—there was a conversation between the prisoner and the other man—I did not see a watch pass—the prisoner left the public-house and came back again, and they had some more conversation together—I told the prisoner I could not wait any longer, and I left—that is all I know about this.</p>

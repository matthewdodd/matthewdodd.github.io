               <p>Feb. the prisoner came into my shop, about nine o' clock in the evening—he asked for some calico—I cut him off three yards and a half—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he put down a shilling and three penny pieces—I saw the shilling was bad—he then asked the price of some handkerchief, and said he should want some in a day or two, and he would come in again—I said, "You know this is a bad shilling which you gave me"—he said, "God bless me, is it?"—he took out three good shilling, and gave me one—I broke the bad one in two—one piece dropped on the counter, and he took it up—I kept the other piece—he went out, and I followed him—he joined another man on the opposite side of the way, and they went down Jamaica-street—I followed, and passed them—I crossed the street again, and they went along on the other side—the prisoner went into the Rose and Crown, and I went in after him—he threw down a shilling on the bar, and said something, but I could not hear what—the land<lb></lb>lady was there, who is exceedingly deaf—she was reaching down a bottle—I picked up the shilling—I put it between my teeth, and found it was bad—I said, "Halloo, my lad, this is another one—you are my prisoner"—I laid hold of him, and a scuffle ensued—I collared him—he struck me several blows on the head and face—I still held him—we got into the street—he slipped out of his coat, his hat fell off, and he ran up Charles-street, and left his coat with me—several person followed him, and he was brought back—I am sure he is the man—I marked the shilling, and gave that, and the half of the other shilling to the policeman.</p>

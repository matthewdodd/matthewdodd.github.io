            . I live in Bethnal-green-road. I lost my canvas between the 17th and 18th of May; I found it on the 31st. I lost it from off a stage that I had to cover some choice flowers. From information I got a search warrant and two officers, and went to the prisoner's house; one of the officers stopped below, the officer went up stairs and opened a cupboard; I there saw my canvas. I knew it; I sewed the seams myself. This is the canvas; there is five yards; it is not so much as I lost. I lost sixty yards.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I am an officer. On the 31st of May, I went to the prisoner's house with a search warrant. I told the prisoner what I wanted; he said he had nothing of the kind in the house, I was welcome to search. I found the canvas in a cupboard in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the canvas in my life. I was not at home when it was brought in. I have a witness to prove it.</p>

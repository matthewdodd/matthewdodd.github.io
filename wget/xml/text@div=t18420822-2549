                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Wells, who keeps the Red Cow, in Old King-street, Deptford—I had some trowsers and other things in my care, about six months ago, left by Charles Price, who was mate of a vessel—I put them into a carpet bag, and kept them into a bed-chamber in my house—I missed them on the 29th of July—I know they were safe on</p>

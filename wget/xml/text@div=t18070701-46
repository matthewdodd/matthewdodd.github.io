I searched his clothes and found nothing; I made a further search in his lodgings; I found the banker's book, containing the banker's check of one hundred and eleven pounds, and the bill of exchange for twelve pounds seventeen shillings; he then says I will tell you all about it. He said that he had the two fifty pounds bank notes in his fob pocket, and that he suspected Dalton had picked his pocket of them; he said the other two prisoners were to meet him at the Crooked Billet. I afterwards found the other prisoners at the Crooked Billet. Papps told me that he was at Merlin's Cave playing at skittles, they were almost drunk, he had lost them there, Dalton had picked his pocket; Dalton seemed offended at Papps accusing him of picking his pocket.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Loyal Volunteer. On the 25th of May the prisoners were playing at skittles in our ground; they came between four and five in the afternoon; Cooper went away between six and seven, and the other two staid till between ten and eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I produce one of the fifty pound notes; I got it at Bow-street office, I saw them delivered up by the landlord of the Merlin's Cave; the other was given up to Mr. Nelson, he has made use of it. The number of this note is 2152, 30th April 1807.</p>
               <p>Papps' Defence. When I found this book I did not mean to keep it, but to restore it to the owner; we waited till the next morning to see if we could see the reward. That is the reason that we met at the Crooked Billet.</p>
               <p>Cooper and Dalton left their defence to their counsel.</p>
               <p>Dalton called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

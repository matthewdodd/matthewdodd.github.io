            . I am fifteen years old. In July 1821, I was errand-boy to Mr. Willis; the prisoner was journeyman. In that month, I saw him go into Mr. Chaffers's shop, in Watling-street, and stopped till he came out. I asked what he had been doing; he said nothing at first, but told me he would give me 2 s. if I would not say what he went for; and said he took a pair of shoes out of Mr. Willis's shop, and had pawned them. I took the 2 s., and did not tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stay with your master after this - A. About seven months. I was discharged when I went away. My mother said my master had found a pair of shoes at our house; the prisoner had stolen them. My mother gave me 10 s., and I went to my uncle in Ireland, and returned two or three months ago.</p>

               <p>"The prisoner says he is totally innocent of every thing charged against him, and denies ever going in his life to the pawnbroker's." A statement had been made, that he had been to Chaffers's.</p>

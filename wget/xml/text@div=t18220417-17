On Sunday morning, the 24th of February, between nine and ten o'clock, I missed thirty-two sovereigns and thirty-three silver spoons, from a strong closet - I think there were forty-five or fifty sovereigns; but I had not counted them for some days. I found the closet open; I do not know whether I had locked it at night, but I generally do. I thought the key was in my pocket, but I have sometimes left it in the door by chance. My wife discovered it before me; I saw the gold there about seven o'clock at night, but did not see the plate that night; it consisted of eleven table, eleven tea, nine desert, and two gravy spoons. There was 45 l. by the side of the gold, which was not taken.</p>

I do not wish to prosecute—I am the prisoner's wife—he came home in the evening of 20th May, and told me to go and get some rum—there was one person there, but he went out—several others came in, as we had lost a child—I got from six-pennyworth to half a pint of rum, which was drank among the persons there, and my husband and me, some drank and some did not—when I came back I found nine or ten women in the place—they afterwards left, and me and my husband remained there alone—I had been drinking, and was in a very aggravating temper—he shut the door and called me a bad name—I took up the child—he gave me a slap on the face—I do not know whether that was before or after I took up the child—after that he gave me a kick on the instep, and I fell down—he did not kick me anywhere else that I know of—I was insensible, and do not know—next morning I found myself on a bed on the floor down-stairs—I did not suffer anywhere besides my instep—this is my signature to the depo<lb></lb>sition—I was sworn before, and signed it—I did not say he kicked me in the private parts, I was never asked such a question—(<hi rend="italic">the depositions being ready stated</hi>—"He kicked me on the private parts of my body")—he gave me a kick, and I fell, and the fender was broken where I fell—if I bad been</p>

On Tuesday evening, 20th May, I was in my room, and heard a scream or halloo—I went out, found the prisoner's door wide open, and saw him standing about two yards and a half from his wife, who was lying in a corner of the room near the fire-place—I went up to her; she was quite insensible—I asked the prisoner what was the matter, and he told me to mind my own business—he appeared rather cross—I heard a sort of a drunken groan from the woman three times—she had a little child in her lap—I took it, and then tried to lift her up, but she was too heavy—I asked the prisoner what was the matter, he said she was drunk—the woman's mother came; we raised her up, and found a pool of blood under her on the floor—I got a policeman—the prisoner and his wife had both been drinking that day—I had not been to the <hi rend="italic">wake</hi>—I saw him on the Sunday, in liquor—this was Tuesday evening—they are both Irish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Red Cross-street I was sent for, and found the woman on the floor in a pool of blood, and pulseless—there was an amazing quantity of blood on the floor—four or five pints—her dress was completely saturated—I examined her private parts, and found a small contused and lacerated wound just within the orifice of the vagina, from which blood was issuing—I should say it was occasioned by a kick—I formed that opinion before I asked the facts—the hemorrhage was decidedly dangerous to life—the wound itself would not have been, if there had been means at hand to stop the bleeding—it would have been fatal to a great many persons—she was a strong woman—I stopped the hemorrhage, had a bed brought down-stairs, and laid her upon it—she might have died had she been carried up-stairs—she came to her senses in a few minutes, and I said in the prisoner's presence, "How did you come by this injury?"—she said, "My husband kicked me"—I asked her a second time to make quite sure of it, and she said her husband kicked her—he said she had fallen down-stain on a chair, which he showed me at the bottom of the staircase—I examined it very carefully, and do not think that wound could have been occasioned by it—he said the seat was the part which did it—I attended her about a week—I could tell from her breath that she had been drinking spirits—she was not intoxicated—the prisoner was excited and elevated, but quite conscious.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 1st of November last I was wagoner of the Gloucester wagon as far as Loud water, and had been so about four months—I succeeded Steptoe, but not for a month or six weeks after—about three weeks before the 1st of November, Steptoe and I were in the Rose yard—he said he could put me in a way of getting out of my trouble, and putting a bit of money in my pocket—I was in trouble at that time—I had not long lost my wife—he did not then say how it was to be done—I understood what be meant—I knew what he intended to do by what he said—he said he could put me in a way of helping me out of my trouble, and putting a little money in my pocket by taking something out of the wagon—I refused it then—he repeated that to me on three different occasions, and I refused—before the 1st of November I saw all the prisoners on the same subject—there was no appointment to meet anywhere on Monday the 1st of November—we did all meet at Mr. Rudd's public-house, in Newgate-street, adjoining the market, near to where we unload the wagon—nothing passed about the wagon or goods at Rudd's—we separated there—I went to the Rose inn with the wagon—I had been to Newgate street with it—we always draw it there to be unloaded of the meat which comes up from the country—after I had taken the wagon home I went to a public-house in Warwick-lane—Sharmancame to me there and said, "We have got a bale <hi rend="italic">as</hi> will just suit us"—I said, "Very well"—I agreed to it—I had been acquainted with Sharman, and knew he was a porter at the King's Arms' public-house—I then went to the Rose—I saw nothing more of Sharman till the wagon was loaded and started—when I got to the Rose I saw Griffin, and after the wagon was loaded he told me that he had loaded the bale of silk and the box in the wagon just right behind—the box had not been mentioned in the morning—Griffin first mentioned the box to me in the Rose-yard—he said he had put them right, behind, and they would be handy to take out when we got to the Gloucester—some straw was put in the tail of the wagon for the guard—I did not myself see the box and bale put in—we started about half-past five, and went to the Green Man and Still, in Oxford-street—I then sent the guard on to the Gloucester ware-house—it was not usual to send him there from the Green Man—I sent him because we were going to take these things out of the wagon—I thought it would be convenient to get rid of him—he was to go from the Gloucester to Williams's, Andover-house, in the Bayswater-road—he went on before, and I followed with the wagon—after he was gone I saw Shar-man</p>

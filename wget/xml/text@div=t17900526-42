               <p>I am cellar-man to Mr. Hodgson.

Nichols said, you are older than I, do you ride; he drove the cart away gently; Nichols says to me, the man has charged me too much; he has charged me a shilling for shewing me the way from the Vine Inn, besides some beer; that was all that passed; he shook hands with me; the horse and cart was not above fifty yards off, I believe; I understood he was driving the cart for Nichols; Nichols went away, and followed the cart; the cart was just out of sight; about three hours after, Nichols came back with another man; he said he had been at Islington; and he came back with this man, who shewed him the way, to know if we knew any thing of the cart? my master asked him if he had been at the Vine Inn to look for him? he said he had not been there; and I went there, and the ostler said he had not seen any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Nichols sober? - Yes; when he came back, he was more sober than when he went away.</p>

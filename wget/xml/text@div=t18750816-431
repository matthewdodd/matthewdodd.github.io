                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live at 2, Brunswick Street, St. George's—I spent a night with the prisoner, and he did not pay me—I met him on 1st June and asked him if he was going to give me some money—he called to Stokes and said." If she does not leave me alone Harry, I shall stick her"—Stokes said to me" Why don't you leave the man alone, and go away"—I said that I would not go till I got some money; the prisoner then drew a knife from his pocket and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> took it from his hand—<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> is the name that Stokes goes by; I did not Bee that knife, hut he then took out another which he thrust into my left shoulder—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These are sailors knives—the prisoner was lodging at our house—the woman was holding his coat—I said "Why don't you let go," and she let go the moment I asked her—there was nobody but me and the woman in the street—the prisoner was going to sea next morning, and he had both the knives in a handkerchief to save them from cutting him—they generally wear them behind them in a sheath.</p>

I said "I do" he said "You are going to put me in <hi rend="italic">chokey</hi>"—that is a new name sailors have for a prison—I told him I was going to take him for stabbing a woman—he said "I know I have done it, she accused me wrongfully—I received the knife from Stokes, and the other was brought to the station by a constable.</p>

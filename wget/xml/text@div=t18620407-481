                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of Plumstead, Kent—about 12 o'clock, on Thursday, 20th March, I went to bed—I had previously fastened my doors and windows—I left some boots in the shop window—I got up</p>

               <p>about 6 on Friday morning, and on opening my shop, I found that a pane of glass had been taken out of the window, and the boots were all gone—I saw marks of a knife where the putty was taken out from the glass—there had been no shutters up—these are a portion of what was in the window—I lost altogether between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, in High-street, Woolwich—I have known the prisoner about three months—he was a waiter at a public-house at Woolwich, and I occasionally repaired boots for him—on 26th February last I met him in High-street, Woolwich, and he asked if I knew where he could sell a lot of boots, for he knew where he oould get some—I told him I did not—on 21st March, about half-past 7 in the morning, he came to me and brought two pairs of uppers, and asked if I would buy them—I said I did not know, he could leave them and I would see—I left him in the room, and went to the station and gave information—I gave the same uppers to the policeman.</p>

On the morning of 21st March I went to Shepherd's house, and he gave me these 2 pairs of uppers—I after<lb></lb>wards went to 8, Ropeyard-walk, Woolwich, and looked over the house for the prisoner—it is a lodging-house—he was not there then—I stood in the back yard for some minutes, and the prisoner and another man, named Brown, came over the wall at the back—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody for breaking into a house at Plumstead, and stealing a quantity of boots—he said, "Very well"—on searching him at the station I found on his feet a pair of the stolen shoes, and in his coat-pocket he had a smaller pair—in his pocket I found a knife with some putty on it—I compared it with the marks on the window of the prosecutor; such marks have been made with this knife.</p>

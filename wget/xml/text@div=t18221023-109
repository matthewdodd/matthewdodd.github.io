On Sunday morning, the 29th of September, about church-time, I saw Dowling in Shadwell. I had known her seven years before.

I had come ashore the day before, and received 10 l. 18 s. 4 d. for wages, it was in five sovereigns, and a 5 l. note. I changed the note; I had five sovereigns, and some silver in my waistcoat pocket. I sat on the foot of the bed, while she lit the fire; we were on the ground-floor. I had been up all night and fell asleep; only herself and I were in the room. Smith awoke me just about dusk. I did not know him before; it was dark - and I do not know whether Dowling was there. Then Smith asked what business I had there? and who brought me there? I felt in my waistcoat pocket, when he awoke me - and I told him a girl brought me there, and that I should not go till an officer came, for I had been robbed. Another man came in with a light, and gave me some beer. I drank with them, because I was very thirsty. Then the prisoner and the man took me by the arm, and turned me out of the room. I stood outside the door, till the watch was set. I told him, and he told me to fetch an officer. I got Spooner, who went in, and found the prisoners in bed together.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Fox-lane, Shadwell. Dowling came to me between one and two o'clock, on the 29th of September, for a pot of beer, and asked me to change a sovereign - which I did. She lived at No. 38, Spring-street; she took the beer away. I had seen Boyer following her, about half past twelve o'clock, that morning - he was very drunk then. When she came to me, she said a friend who had come from sea, and whom she had known seven or eight years, had given her some money to buy a bonnet and some other things. She left four sovereigns with me, besides the one she changed. She wished me to keep it for her, as she thought she might lose it. She afterwards came for silver for one of the sovereigns, saying, she wanted to pay her landlord, and that she had been paying other debts about the neighbourhood. I sent for Spooner at night, and gave him the money. Smith lives at the house; he is a hard-working man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 106). On the afternoon of 6th October, I was called in to the Brown Bear public-house, in Broad-street, St. Giles, and found a great disturbance in the house—the prisoner was there, and two other men, named Brown and Wallis—as soon as I and another constable got inside the house, they said, "You are two of Garibaldi's men, ain't you?"—I said, "I don't know about that"—Brown and Wallis then both struck me—I then said to the landlord, "Let nobody go out, or come in; these persons have struck me; I will keep them in custody till I get more assistance"—I laid hold of Brown, and struggled with him—Wallis then struck me—Brown was on my right, Wallis in front of me, and the prisoner on my left—I felt something run into my eye like a lance—it was not like a blow—if it had been a blow, it would have knocked me backwards—I did not see who gave me that—the landlord closed the door—the prisoner ran into the bar—the other two men got against the doorway after they saw I was stabbed, and tried to go out—further assistance came, and the prisoner was secured.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, F</hi> 29). I was called in on the afternoon of 6th October to the Brown Bear—I saw the prisoner there, and the last witness was struggling with two men—I assisted him, and pulled one back—I then saw the prisoner's right hand come from his right pocket, and strike last witness—I saw the blade of a knife protrude through the prisoner's hand—I saw the blood run down last witness's face immediately—the prisoner ran behind the bar—I followed him—he attempted to get over the counter, and I got hold of him, and brought him back—I went back to search for the knife, but could not find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Brydges-street, Covent-garden—I was called to attend the constable—I found a wound on the left eye<lb></lb>brow, an inch and a quarter long, presenting the appearance of an incised wound—it had penetrated to the bone—that would not be any depth there, merely through the skin—it might have been produced by a sharp instru<lb></lb>ment, but I have seen wounds just over the sharp ridge of the eyebrow, which have been produced by a blow, presenting the appearance of an incised wound—in those cases the cutting was from the inside, from the ridge of the bone—I cannot swear that this was an incised wound, or that it was done with any instrument—a knife would have produced it—the edges were quite clear cut.</p>

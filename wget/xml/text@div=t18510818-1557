                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we lived at West Drayton, and have been married twenty-one years last Oct. About three months ago, I took the prisoner before a Magistrate—he was bound over, and was impri<lb></lb>soned eight weeks all but three days, and was let out at my request—when he came out I was still living in the house—I lived with him for a fortnight afterwards—he was always threatening my life, and took a room not far off—he asked me to wash his shirt, and said he would pay, me for it the same as he would any one else—he came for it on Sunday morning, 3rd Aug., about 6 o'clock—I opened the window, and he stood in the road, and asked me for it—I said, "If you wait a minute I will bring it you down-stair"—he said, "I do not want it now, by-and-by will do"—I said I would send it—he said if I did not bring it myself he would not pay me for it—I took it to him about 10—his mother was there—the prisoner said, "Bring it in"—I took it in, and placed it on a box which was standing there—I stood talking to his mother I think twenty minutes—he asked me to make a fire and cook him and his mother some dinner, that she might get back by the 2 o'clock train—I did so—I went into the back-room for some potatoes, and the prisoner followed me—his mother had just gone out at the door—he asked me if I was going to stop at home—I said, "I am not"—he said, "I will cut your b——y head off, you b——r"—there was a bill-hook lying on the floor, and he took it up and struck at me with it—I put my hands up to save my bead, and he cut my fingers all across—here are the three scars now—he struck me a second blow on the head with the bill-hook, and my head bled a great deal—he tried to prevent me, but I got out of the house, met the police, and gave him in</p>

Mrs. Bray came to me with her hands and head bleeding very much—I went with her to the prisoner—his mother was there—I asked him how he came to use his wife in that way—he said, "I did do it, and I would again, turn her out"—I took him into custody, searched the house, and found this bill-hook in the back house—I saw some reaping-hooks near a shelf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police force, of Uxbridge. On 3rd Aug., Mrs. Bray was brought to me with a wound on her head about an inch long, dividing the scalp down <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the bone—it was bleeding—it might have been inflicted with the point of this bill, or with any other sharp instru<lb></lb>ment—the other part of the bill could not have done it, it would have made a larger wound—she had three slight wounds on her left hand, and two on her right inflicted by a cutting instrument—the wounds were not dangerous, but erysipelas might have ensued.</p>

I came down, and she followed me, and when I came into the street' I missed my watch. I turned back to look for the prisoner, there was nobody to be perceived in the passage. I took the patrole with me up stairs to the room where I had been. The door was fast; I knocked at the door, and a dog barked. Afterwards he dog growled, as if somebody was holding its mouth. I asked for the door to be opened; nobody answered. I went with the patrol to the watchhouse to ask if we might break the door open. The constable would not give leave: we went back and knocked at the next room door; there was a man and a woman there; we stood a considerable time on the landing of the stairs; the patrol hid his light, thinking somebody might come up the stairs. In about a quarter of an hour, the prisoner Neal came up the stairs; the prisoner Neal came up the stairs, the patrol seized him by the collar, and while the patrol had hold of his collar, Neal dropped the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Neal been in the room - A. Not as I know of; there was no light in the room, and the watch was without a case. We took him to the watchhouse; it had a case when I lost it. I found it on the stairs without a case. I am sure I had the watch; I felt the watch as I went up stairs; I am certain I had the watch with me. I lost the watch after I got into that house. I am sure of it; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man dropped the watch - A. Yes, it fell at the time that the patrol had hold of him.</p>
               <p>JOHN WHITECLOTH. I a constable. I produce the watch. I know no more than holding the property. I produce the watch.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Between twelve and one, on the 23d of October, in Charles-street I met the prosecutor. He said he had been robbed of his watch; he took me to the house; I went up stairs with him, and knocked at the door; I went down to the watchhouse to know whether I might break open the door, The constable would not give me any order. I went back and waited a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner Neal came up stairs. I then took the lantern from under my coat; Neal then jumped down two or three stairs, I followed him, and perceived the watch go against my thigh, and it fell down on the stairs. I called for Baker the watchman to take hold of him, while I picked up the watch. I picked up the watch without the case. I took Neal to the watchhouse. I went back and found the case on the stairs where I found the watch.</p>
               <p>Davenport's Defence. I put the watch on the bannister of the stairs; I certainly took the watch, and laid it on the bannister of the stairs. Neal knows nothing about it, no more of it then a child unborn.</p>

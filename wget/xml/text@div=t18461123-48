                  </hi>. I am one of the City police—the prisoner is my wife. On Wednesday the 14th of Oct. I and she were at home about one o'clock, or a little after—there were other persons in the house, but not in the room we were living in—it is in Talbot-court, Gracechurch-street, in the parish of St. Bennet, Gracechurch—about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock the prisoner came home—I complained about dinner not being ready, as I had to muster at the station-house at a quarter before two—I cannot recollect the</p>

               <p>words that passed, but we bad a quarrel for about two minutes—I put on my hat, and said I should go out—the cloth was laid, and she had sat down—I was going to leave the room, and I heard her scream out "Murder!" and felt something slightly at my throat—I did not think what was the matter—I turned, and the knife fell from my neck on the floor, and I saw the blood streaming on the floor—I was taken to a surgeon, and then sent to St. Thomas's Hospital, and was attended by Dr. Clark—I am an inmate there still—I do not think my wife did it intentionally—I think she threw the knife in the heat of passion at the moment—I do not think she knew what she was doing—she screamed "Murder!" as soon as she saw the blood—when I turned round she was in the act of rising from the chair—the moment I saw the blood I went down stairs as quickly as I possibly could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, and lecturer on anatomy—on the 14th of Oct. I was informed a man had been brought in with a severe wound in his neck—I went across to the surgery and saw the prosecutor, and one of my colleagues was on the spot endeavouring to staunch the blood from the wound—he had succeeded temporarily in doing so, by putting his fingers in the wound—we conferred together, and thought the only means of saving his life would be to perform an operation, which consisted in making a wound lower down in the neck, and passing a ligature round the trunk of the carotid artery—as his fingers were bloody it was agreed I should perform the operation, which I did—there was not more than a spoonful of blood lost in the operation, and that caused the cessation of the blood—in my opinion, if he had been left to himself, he would unquestionably have been dead in two or three minutes—a cutting instrument, more or less pointed, would have inflicted the wound—a table-knife would very probably have done it—there is no question but such a knife as this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—would have inflicted the wound,</p>

I heard of this affair on the 14th of Oct. about half-past one o'clock—in consequence of hearing of it I went to the prosecutor's room and found the prisoner there—I enquired whether it was true that one of our officers had been taken to the hospital dangerously wounded—the prisoner said if I came up she would tell me all about it—she stated that they had a quarrel at dinner, and she threw a knife at him—she did not know she had cut him till she saw him stooping down, and she saw the blood running from his neck—while I was there an order came from Mr. Smith, the doctor, that she should be taken, and I took her into custody—there were two knives on the table—I enquired which was the knife she did it with—she said this one—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)</p>

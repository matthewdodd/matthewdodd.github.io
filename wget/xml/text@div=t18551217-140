                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">by an interpreter</hi>). I live in Paul-street, Finsbury-square—I have known the prisoner for fifteen or eighteen months—I have had dealings with him—he has several times bought watches of me—in the course of our dealings I have seen him write—on the 23rd Feb. I received this letter from him, requesting me to discount this bill of exchange, which was contained in the letter—(<hi rend="italic">this was a bill of exchange for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th Jan</hi>., 1855<hi rend="italic">, by Ferdinand Bernhard Braun, at three months, and accepted by Herman Hirshfield</hi>)—when I received this bill, I gave the bearer 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Braun—I knew the bearer before, by having seen him very often with the prisoner—his name was Trane—I knew he was messenger to the prisoner—in the evening the prisoner came to me—I told him I had sent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he had received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him who Mr. Hirsh<lb></lb>field was—he said he was a man I had seen at his house, and he wore spectacles—with respect to the remainder of the money due on the bill, I said I was short of money, but if he wanted to pay a bill, I would give him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which I had, and which was then due, he said the acceptor of the bill lived at No. 10, Duncan-street, Leman-street, Goodman's-fields—he said he received the bill from Hirshfield, who had bought some watches of him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you asked the prisoner who this Mr. Hirshfield was, whether he was the little man with spectacles, did not he say, "No, a fine tall man"?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when I came before Mr. Hirshfield, I said, "You are not the man"—before I made this charge, I threatened that if the prisoner did not pay the bill, I would charge him with forgery—this letter is not my writing (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I have seen Mrs. Collins before—it may be that the prisoner said in her presence that Mr. Hirshfield was a tall, fine man, but that was after the bill was due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not asked to go in partnership, and made offers within the last two or three months, of going into partnership with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Braun made the offer to me and I consented to it—that was in April—I have sent watches to him within the last two or three months to be repaired or sold—I did not give them to the prisoner, but to a man for him—I took the security of Mr. Smith to be paid this bill and other monies that were owing—about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to take payment at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week of the prisoner for what he owed me—that included this bill—I have been in this country eighteen months—I was at Breslan, in Germany—I was obliged to leave for political motives—I was never in prison in my country—I have been in civil matters but not criminal matters—I have had a civil process against me—I have been summoned before a Magistrate in this country—it was for detaining goods for money I had advanced—I was obliged to give them up.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Herman Hirshfield is a very common name in Germany? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a great many gentlemen in Germany bear that name—I saw a gentleman of that name at Mr. Braun's—I do not know tha the is the acceptor of this bill—from what I have heard he has left the country—he asked permission to have letters addressed to him at my address, and to use my address—the house in Duncan-street is not a house where Germans lodge—they only keep one gentleman at a time—they let their apartments downstairs—the prisoner said at once that I was not the person who accepted this bill, it was another Mr. Hirshfield—I know Mr. Rochefort—he speaks English very well—I heard him examined at the police court—he gave his evidence in English—I have known the prisoner—I can say nothing but that he bears a good character—he is quite a gentleman, and a very industrious, hard working man.</p>

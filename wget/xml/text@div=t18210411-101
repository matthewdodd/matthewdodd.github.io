            . I am Mr. Campbell's brother-in-law. Mr. Hussey gave me information, and I informed my brother. A search warrant was taken out. On Monday, the 19th of February, I went to Davidge's premises, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110065"></xptr>Hampstead-hill. He was not at home. I found some slates there - I knew them to be my brother-in-law's. I had loaded them into a cart, to be sent to Jay's - they were the very same sort. When I found them at Davidge's, they were covered over with a kind of shutter - it did not conceal them - he was taken to Bow-street the same day. They might be worth 4 s. or 5 s. - but I have sold them out at my brother's, at 12 s. per 100. There were about one hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why are they worth only 5 s. - A. They are old. I never heard that they were given to him - it is usual for slaters to use what scaffolding is at the building. I never heard of their making a compensation for it. We do not allow the men to give them away.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old, and am apprentice to Mr. Campbell. I was employed in carrying up the slates, in October. The prisoner Holman sat me to work at one end of the roof, and went down the ladder to the other end, and put a tier and a half of slates into Davidge's cart - he lived at Hampstead. I told my master of it in February, when he asked me about it. I had no quarrel with Holman. I went to work with him at Camden-town, and he said if it came to his master's ears he would turn him away, and give him a bad character - and when I came into the shop afterwards, the men would be always drilling me, and I should never learn my trade. He told me not to tell of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Who drove the cart - A. Randall. We had no quarrel at all, he might have been swearing at me, and wanting me to do more work than I ought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Holman put the slates in - A. Both of them. Davidge's ladders had been used while we were there. I told two men of it when it happened. They are not here.</p>

            . I was in Davidge's employ, and worked with him at the building. I took the slates away in his cart, to his yard. I think he, Holman, and myself put them in. I was to be apprenticed to him if I liked the business - but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave him out of ill will - A. He told the men he would not pay me. I said I would leave - and he said I might. I knew nothing about this till I was fetched to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were they old slates - A. Yes. A good many of them were broken. Davidge's ladders and scaffolding were used at the back of the building. I heard my master say he wanted some old pieces of slate. Holman managed the business, and had both mortar and ladders from my master. These slates were picked up as pieces - all the men were at work when they were put in the cart.</p>

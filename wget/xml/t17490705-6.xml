               <p>Robert Lane. On the 14th of June, betwixt seven and eight in the evening, I was going through <placeName id="t17490705-6-crimeloc37">Russel-street</placeName>

I laid hold of her to secure her; one of the men that was with her put my hand from her, and gave her a slight blow on the shoulders says he, let the bitch alone, she is only drunk; she immediately turned up a court, and the men stood before me, to prevent my following her; I went immediately over the way into a public house, the master of the house, and several more, came out. We went cross the way, and secured the woman directly, and had her before the Justice, and she was committed.</p>

The prosecutor had not been gone out of my house above a minute, or thereabouts, before he returned with his watch in his hand; he told me the case, so I, and some others, run over the way; I knew the court was no thorough-fare; there we took the prisoner at the corner of the court; I took her to my own house, where I sent for an officer.</p>

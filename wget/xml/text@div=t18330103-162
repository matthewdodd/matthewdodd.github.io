I have known the prisoner eighteen months; he owed me some money - he came on the 31st of December; he said he had just got his wages, and had come to pay me the 10s. which he owed me; he put down a 5l. note, and told me to take the 10s. out of it, which I did - when I gave it him, he showed me another 5l. note; I told him to leave it with me, which he did, and 2l. 10s. in cash; this was between five and six o'clock in the evening - I had one other 5l. note in the house, and I cannot tell which I received of the prisoner, but two of them are dated the 16th of November, 1832, and are Nos. 31,617, and 31,624 - I know I received one of these from the prisoner, and I believe both of them.</p>

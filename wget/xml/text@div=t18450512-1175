                  </hi>. I am a seaman and lodge in Marmaduke-street—on the 29th of April, between three and four o'clock, I went lo the Albion public-house at Shadwell—I was the worse for drink, but I knew what I was about—I sat down and fell asleep—the prisoner was not there when I went in, but she was sitting alongside of me when I awoke, and there were two other women there—I had about three shillings or half a crown, and a handkerchief round my neck—I was perfectly sober when I awoke—I missed my watch, and spoke to the prisoner about it—she said if I would go home with her she would let me know about it—she took me to No. 66, Gravel-lane, and then she wanted me to leave my jacket and stay with her all night—I said no, I would not—she then took my handkerchief off my neck and threw it on the bed—I said I would get a policeman—she told me to get one—I went, and when I got back she was gone and the handkerchief too.</p>

               <p>MORGAN MORGANS. On good Friday, about a quarter after twelve in the day time, I was in a public house in <placeName id="t18100606-71-crimeloc394">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

After we had drank the beer we went out; the prisoner stood opposite of the house, she said, you have plenty of time, will you take a walk to see my room; we went, both of us, and sat down for nine or ten minutes, then I told my shopmate it was time to go to work; he got up and went out, I was following of him, she took bold of my wrist and begged me to lend her sixpence till the next day, she would call the next morning at the public house and would pay me; I put my hand in my pocket, took out a dollar, and two shillings and sixpence I had in my hand; she slipped the money immediately out of my hand, I took hold of her arm and asked her whether she meaned to rob me; she then slipped my watch out of my pocket; I took her towards the door, I thought to give charge of her to somebody; there were then three men at the door, I told them she had robbed me of my watch and property; one of the men knocked me down, she escaped immediately. She was taken on the Sunday following at an iron shop over the way.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the Sunday, about ten o'clock, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, I found a padlock on the door. I apprehended her at a house opposite, I found nothing upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman came to my window, seeing a child with me he asked me if it was mine, I said it was; he gave the child a penny for a bun; he went over to the public house, he asked me to come over; I went and had some of the gin, and another young woman. It about two hours he came to my room with a recruiting serjeant and went away; he broke open two peoples doors, said they were the people that robbed him, and being fearful of his making a disturbance, went out and locked my door; my landlady hearing of it, and I owing her a little money, she padlocked me out; that is the reason I was found at another lodging.</p>

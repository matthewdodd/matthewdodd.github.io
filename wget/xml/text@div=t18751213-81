                  </hi>. I am the wife of Baron Churchill, and was staying in May at 32, Albermarle Street—on 10th May a large quantity of jewellery was stolen from me, and among other articles a valuable brooch; there was a coronet in diamonds at the top, and double C C underneath in gold—the coronet part of it was shown to me in November by Sergeant Butcher, and I can speak positively to it—a long pin had been added to it, and two gold scrolls—I made this sketch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it accurately represents my—brooch as it originally was—the bottom sketch is the back part of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hiscock, of 4, Gloucester Road, Kew—I have known the prisoner about four years—I saw him wearing a pin like this between two and three years ago—at that time my husband kept a wine-house at the corner of Rose Street, Long Acre—I remember his bringing it into the kitchen in his hand; he used to come there to have his dinner—we left there two years ago next January, and then went to live at Kew—I have seen him wearing it on several occasions since that—it had a small ticket on it when he brought it into the kitchen, and to the best of my belief this is the same; it had a stem like this, and these scrolls under it as it is now.</p>

               <p>pin was repaired for him on my premises—the stem was broken off the back part of the pin and we had to solder it on again—this open gold work beneath the diamonds was there then, and it is in the same state now except that three or four little diamonds are out of it—I repaired it a second time about six months after that, as near as I can guess; the stem was then very much bent and partly torn away from the back—we then saw that three or four of the very smallest of diamonds were out and I dare say I could see that now—they were not replaced—they must be still out. (<hi rend="italic">Examining it with a glass.</hi>) Two are out on one side of the <hi rend="italic">fleur delys</hi> and three out on the other—these very small diamonds are only worth about a shilling a piece—I scarcely ever saw the prisoner without this pin in his scarf for from seven to nine months, or something like that—I first repaired it for him ten months before I saw it at the police-court, and I had seen him wearing it before I repaired it.</p>

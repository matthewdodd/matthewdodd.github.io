                  </hi>. I am nurse at 44, Stock Orchard-crescent, Caledonian-road, Islington—on the evening of 24th November, about half-past 9 o'clock, I had been out for some biscuits for my mistress—I had them in my hand in a paper parcel—when I came near the Camden-road Railway I met the two prisoners—they first asked me what the time was, and then if I was cold—I don't know which it was spoke—I went on as quick as I could, as I did not like the look of them—as I turned round the corner they came and knocked my arm, and knocked the biscuits out of my hand—I stooped to pick them up, and they pulled me by the cloak and pulled me down in the road—I can't say which of them did that—they came behind me—they tore my cloak in doing it—they did not do anything to me when I was on the ground—one tore my veil off, and the other had got her hand in my pocket—I had fivepence in copper in my pocket before I saw them, the change out of the money for the biscuits—they used very bad language indeed; one called me a b—old b—h, and the other used language I should not like to repeat—I called "Police," and they ran away as fast as they could—I found that the fivepence was gone out of my pocket, and when I got to the station I found that part of my fall was gone—I was too frightened to notice it before—this is the piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was found in the pocket of one of them.</p>

On the evening of 24th November, about half-past 9, I was in the Park-road, near Camden-road, and heard an outcry like "Police"—I hastened to the spot, and found the prosecutrix there, with several other persons—in consequence of something she told me, I went in search of the prisoners, and found them in the Holloway-road, about a hundred yards from the spot where the prosecutrix was—they im<lb></lb>mediately ran away, and I saw them throw a number of biscuits away from them—these are some (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't say which threw them—they appeared to come from both of them—I took them in custody, and, on arriving at the station, I made them turn their pockets out—I found this</p>

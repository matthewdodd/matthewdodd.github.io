I first became acquainted with the prisoner at the New Prison in Whitecross-street; I was sent there by my employers to see him execute a power of attorney (looks at it)-that is it. On my going there, I asked the turnkey for an officer of the name of T.M. Oliver, who was in confinement there; the prisoner was introduced to me in consequence of this application. I told him that I had a letter from Messrs. Walker, Doyle and Company, for him to execute this power of attorney, holding it in my hands to have it executed; he read it over, and signed it "T.M. Oliver, lieutenant of the 93d regiment." I witnessed it, took it, and went away. The seal was on it at the time. I took it there with the seal on it. I saw him several times after this, out of prison. He was at our office the day after he had executed the power of attorney, he told me he had come to get some more money and a settlement. I saw him several times afterwards - He said he wanted to know how he stood with Messrs. Walker and Company, calling them his agents; that the money he had was not sufficient, and he wanted some more-this was the very day after he had executed the deed - I do not recollect his words exactly - He went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160026"></xptr>stairs to them. I afterwards saw him at a house in St. Martin's-lane, about a fortnight after. He then said, that when his quarter became due he should expect some more money. I gave him a letter from Messrs. Walker and Co., which required an answer - He said he would call in a few days. Before this day, I had been to his lodgings to tell him that Messrs. Walker and Doyle wanted him to call at the office to arrange matters; he said he would call. He said, when his quarter became due, he expected they would give him some more money.</p>

             - A. I do not know. I asked for an officer who was confined in the prison, of the name of Oliver, and he wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the difference between a deed and a common agreement - A. No; he only wrote his name.</p>
               <p>MR.BOLLAND. Q. What did he do when he had wrote his name - A. He handed it to me.</p>
               <p>CHARLES DOWNES. I am clerk to Messrs. Greenwood and Cox, army agents - They were agents for the 38th regiment; the prisoner formerly held the rank of ensign in that regiment - He called once, and asked me questions respecting his own accounts as an ensign of the 38th regiment - He then passed by the name of Andrew Oliver; this was at the beginning of the year 1816. He has ceased to be in that regiment since. I had received letters from him before that time - He was a stranger to me, when he called, as a matter of course, I must have asked him his name; he said he was Ensign Oliver, of the 38th regiment-there was no other Ensign Oliver of the 38th regiment at that time. The prisoner never belonged to the 93d regiment, to my knowledge - He has not been in the 93d regiment since he left the 38th. There are books kept by the War-Office, by which it will appear whether he is, or is not, an ensign of the 93d regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was ensign of the 38th regiment, was there a Lieutenant Oliver of the same regiment. - A. There was, his name was Thomas Millward Oliver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether T.M. Oliver, formerly lieutenant of the 38th, now belongs to the 93d - A. He exchanged to the half-pay of the 93d from the 38th. I saw the prisoner in February or March, when he was before the Lord Mayor, charged with this transaction, but I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have letters which purport to come from Andrew Oliver, ensign of the regiment. I never saw him write. I cannot say they came from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say he is not an officer of any other regiment - A.Certainly not. The prisoner has not been in the 93d regiment, since he left the 38th. I only know it by the Gazette.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLWARD OLIVER. On the 25th of December, I received the money that was due to me as lieutenant of the 93d regiment. My Christian name is Thomas Millward, I was formerly lieutenant of the 38th regiment. The prisoner's name is 
               <persName id="t18170416-74-person578">

            , he held the rank of ensign in the same regiment, I never knew him by any other name; he left the 38th regiment in 1816 - He was suspended; the time that he quitted it will appear by the War-Office books. I left the 38th regiment in September, 1816, the prisoner did not then belong to it (looking at the power of attorney), this is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Would T.M. Oliver be the way you would sign your name - A. I always sign so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never joined the 93d regiment, I am an ensign on half-pay. I do not know whether the prisoner is or is not in the regiment.</p>
               <p>The power of attorney was put in and read, purporting to empower Messrs. Walker, Doyle and Co. to receive all monies due to

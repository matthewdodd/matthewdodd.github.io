            . I am a police officer. On the morning of the 27th, I hid myself in these gentlemen's warehouse, from some reasons, so as to command a view of the door, and see who came in. Before I went into the warehouse, I saw the prisoner and another looking in at the warehouse window; that was about half past seven, or twenty minutes to eight; they saw me also. I went down Watling-street, and they went down the Old Change. I went into the warehouse, and sent for Mr. Evans; he went away again; and then I fastened the warehouse door; then I stationed myself over a fan-light over the door, and I could then command a view of both the outside doors, and the warehouse door to. Williams, and Morgan, the other, came into the passage; they turned the latch of the warehouse door, which I had fastened, and after they got the latch loose from the hasp, the door would open about three quarters of an inch; at the top of the door there is a catch of a bell, which if the door was opened any further, would ring; and with this stick, which was longer than it is now, (but I will tell you how I broke it,) they shoved the bell back; it hangs on an elastic iron, and this took about ten minutes, with a portion of care and nicety. I am sure the door had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290046"></xptr>fast; I had stationed a young man under the dresser in the warehouse close by the door, to see I had fastened it; I told him you see I have fastened the door; and he said, yes, you have; and I said, if it was a jar they would suspect. I made him particularly observe it. When they got it open, the prisoner at the bar went into the warehouse; the other man stood at the warehouse door with this bag, and just before he opened the bag, he looked out at the street door to see if any one was coming. The prisoner at the bar reached some printed cotton, and Morgan held the bag open so, and he chucked it in. Morgan was inside the street door; the prisoner at the bar then went back, as I thought to get some more; but I rushed upon him out of the private door, and Morgan made his escape. The prisoner at the bar was took into the warehouse. The prisoner and I had a little bit of a tustle, and he said, Matthews, don't hurt me, you have got me, and that is all you want.</p>

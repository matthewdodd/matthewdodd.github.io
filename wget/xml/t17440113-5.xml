            . December 22, the Prisoner came to my shop and asked me whether I would buy the lid of a tankard, I told him I could not tell, till I had seen it; he showed it me and said, it was his aunt's. I bid him fetch her, he said he would go and fetch her, he came back in about 5 minutes, and said his aunt would not come back with him; I told him I would not buy it without his aunt was present and bid him fetch her, he was gone the second time about six or seven minutes; when he returned, he said his aunt would not come back, but said there was a friend of his that would give him a character. I said I would send for his aunt, I called a porter and sent him to the Bear and Ragged-staff in St. Martin's lane, but she would not come; he sent me to one Mr. Gardner who lives in our neighbourhood, he said his aunt kept a publick house, and he said, that he believed him to be a very honest lad; when he came back again I belive he thought I was going to buy it of him, for he said it was very good of you to enquire into people's characters before you buy things; but said I, this does not satisfy me, I must go to your aunt and know from her own mouth whether it is her's or no. I enquired where his aunt lived, and he said she lived at the White Swan in Long-Acre, but she did not live there, so I secured him, but he would not tell me where he lived till he was in custody, and then he said he lived with Mrs. Stanhope ; I sent to her, she came and brought the other part of the tankard with her and owned it - it weighs 7 ounces and an half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was that lid of the tankard ever out of your liberty since you had it?</p>

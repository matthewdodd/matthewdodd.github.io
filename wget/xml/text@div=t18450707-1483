                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Black Horse public-home, in Petticoat-lane, Aldgate—the prisoner, Twohy, was in the habit of coming to my house almost every day from the 17th of March up to the 31st of May—he never lodged in my house—he offered me marriage, and said he would not go out without I gave him an answer—I said, "You go away to-night, and I will inquire after your character," and next day I told him I refused his offer—he said he would have my life if I would not marry him—he frequently said that I had robbed him of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I had slept with him, and kept him in my arms day and night for six weeks—that was not true—the last time I gave him his answer he said he would give me a worse death than Jane Shore's—in consequence of those threats I went before the Lord Mayor on the 30th of May, and bound him to keep the peace towards me—he got bail on that day—I heard that O'Brien was one of his bail, but I was not there—on Saturday, the 31st of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, Leonard and O'Brien came into my house accompa<lb></lb>nied by a tall female—Leonard and O'Brien went into the parlour, and the female went iuto the yard—the parlour is to the right, the tap-room to the left, and the bar in the centre—from the bar I can command a view of both the rooms by leaving the doors open—O'Brien came out of the parlour again before he could hardly have sat down, and asked me to light the gas—I said, "Mr. O'Brien, I do not allow females in the parlour"—the female</p>

               <p>whatever with the gas—I have had little escapes, which I have sent to the gas-fitter about—I cannot exactly recollect when he saw it last-there has been nothing serious—I was never in the habit of stopping up the gas-pipe with a bit of cork—there was never any hole stopped up with a bit of cork—I went on this occasion to the bar, and took a cork out of a ginger-beer bottle, the nearest I could get—I got it to prevent the further escape—it was not a cork with which I was in the habit of stopping up the pipe—I could feel the gas pouring from the ceiling down towards my hand—the first time I ever saw Twohy was on the 17th of March, licensing day—I did not speak to him that day, but I particularly remarked him in my up-stairs room—I never had a strong regard for him, only the same as another customer—I am civil to any person that pays me—I was not in the habit of going out with him—I had not agreed to marry him—he constantly annoyed me for about six weeks, till I could not stand in my bar for him—I did not go with him to a Roman Catholic priest to get a license—he went, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed him, and told the clergyman what he had said, that be would murder me if I did not marry him, and he advised me to bind him to the peace, and send a policeman to see that he committed no violence—I never agreed to marry him so long ago as April—I did not go with him to the brewery where I deal, nor was he ever there with me while ordering my beer—I did not go with him to Mr. Duffy's public-house in Golden-lane—I went on my own business, and he was in the room, but I did not go with him—I went with a friend of mine named Donelly to support a charitable meeting—I have frequently called in the police to take Twohy out of my house, and have said if he annoyed me again I would give him into custody—I did not myself give him into custody on this charge—I instructed the police to take him on the Monday morning as I left the hospital on Saturday—I have heard that he is since married—I heard it the day I left the hospital, from a policeman at the Mansion-house—I have lived in my house three years—my back way leads into Alderman Johnson's yard—there was no explosion in my bouse a short time since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, lodging at the Black Horse. On the evening of the 31st of May I remember Mrs. Reeng complaining of a smell of gas—I went towards the parlour to assist her to stop it—when I got to the parlour door it exploded, threw me down, and scorched me—I saw Mrs. Reeng standing at the table putting a cork in the broken part of the pipe—I could not see any fire—it came so suddenly—I had seen O'Brien and Leonard in the house that evening standing by the parloar ddor—I did not see them go into the parlour.</p>

On the evening of the 31st of May, about ten minutes before ten o'clock, I saw Twohy at the corner of Petticoat-lane, sixty or seventy yards from the Black Horse—he said there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> up at the Black Horse, but he would take care not to go himself; they should not have to say he had anything to do with it—I afterwards went to the Black Horse and found there had been</p>

               <p>an explosion of gas—I then returned to the corner of Petticoat-lane—Twohy was still there—he left shortly after, and I saw no more of him—I had observed him standing there at nine o'clock when I went on duty.</p>

I went to the Black Horse on the evening of the 31st of May, about a quarter to ten o'clock—I found Mrs. Reeng very much injured and took her to the hospital—on my return I inquired for the pipe—it was given me by Mary Murphy—I fitted it to the other part of the pipe—it screws on to the top in the centre of the room.</p>

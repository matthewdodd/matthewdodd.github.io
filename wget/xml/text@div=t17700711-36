               <p>Burn. Yes, but they have not cohabited together a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; I never saw them speak together till that night. I have a back and a front house; she laid in a back room in the front house. When this woman came home it was between nine and ten; she was much in liquor, and quarrelled with her child; she threatened to stab it, and the like. In half an hour she went out again. Our shop was very full of people; we heard a great noise over head about half after eleven. My husband bid Hatton go and see what was the matter; he brought word, she was breaking her door, and there was nobody but her child with her. At this time Armstrong came in; he hearing a noise, went up with Hatton, and they came down in four or five minutes. The deceased brought a pannel of the door down, which she had broke out. The deceased said, we need not mind it, for a pennyworth of nails would mend it. I went in to turn down the bed, and heard her swear she would stab the child. I came out again, and desired the deceased to go and shut a house up for me up the lane; I desired them before not to go near her, because she was bent upon mischief. When we came back, she was calling Armstrong pickpocket and gallows thief. He went away to his bed: he stood in the shop, and drank a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hear what she said?</p>
               <p>Burn. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she abuse Hatton as well as Armstrong?</p>
               <p>Burn. I did not hear her mention the other's name; it was after this, when I went to bed, that she threatened him. Armstrong went to bed with a lamp; I fastened my doors, and went to bed. Just as I got into bed she threw open her sash; she lays over me: she called out,

He ran up part of the stairs; he cried out, She has stabbed me, I am a dead man; come and help me, Mr. Burn. I called to my husband, and bid him get up, for God's sake. He went up, and I followed him. The deceased was leaning all of a heap at the foot of the stairs. My husband bid us get some cloths, for he was stabbed. The blood was flying all about the room: my husband sent for a surgeon; I called out for people to come and assist me: we could not get a surgeon, so we took him to the Middlesex hospital. He told my husband that Mrs. Burke had stabbed him, and that he was very bad. He put his hand upon the place, and my husband thought his hand was cut. He was wrapped up in the bed-clothes, and carried to the hospital; the blood boiled up against the place to a great degree; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? Did you hear her say any thing?</p>
               <p>Burn. I did not hear her say a word: I kept at a distance from her; I called to some people to take care she did not get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear her say something afterwards about it?</p>
               <p>Burn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the knife?</p>
               <p>Burn. I and another woman went up stairs after the constable had taken her away, to take care of the child, and we found this clasp knife shut, and all over blood; (producing a large clasp knife) it was close by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs down was it you first saw the blood?</p>
               <p>Burn. Three stairs and a broad step.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no blood upon two or three of the top stairs?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; she met him about the middle of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a woman was she?</p>
               <p>Burn. She was always in liquor every night. I could not get her out, she paid her rent so punctually.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I came home about half after nine from Islington. I heard great kicking against a door, this was about eleven o'clock; that was the first thing I took notice of. I heard her say, It is my own room, I can do what I think proper with it. I desired Mr. Hatton to go up: he did, and returned again, and said, D - n the bitch, she has broke the pannel of the door. Armstrong came in and went up stairs with Hatton, and Armstrong brought down the pannel of the door, and said, what mischief this brimstone has done! He did not stay up above two or three minutes, but he said, that with a halfpenny or pennyworth of nails, he could fasten it in to-morrow. My wife took Armstrong with her to fasten up the windows; when he returned, she sent Armstrong for a pint of beer; I did not stay for it, but went to bed. While I was undressing myself, I heard her say, Armstrong, you are a thief from your cradle, and a pick-pocket, and I can prove you one. My wife brought in the beer, and she shoved against my shoulder, and asked me to drink some beer, and said, Armstrong was gone to bed. I fell asleep, and in about half an hour my wife said, For God's sake, get up, for this Mrs. Burke has certainly done Armstrong some mischief. I got up, and found Armstrong upon the stairs, supported by one Mr. Ellis. He said, Mr. Burn, Mrs. Burke has stabbed me; and I believe I am a dead man. He lifted up his hand, and the blood ran very fast; I thought his hand was cut. I was going to put a cloth to it; he said, No, Mr. Burn, it is here, pointing to his left breast, and the blood was boiling out of the wound. I begged Mr. Ellis to take the lamp while I could get a surgeon. I went, and the first surgeon I went to, would not come. Then I went to an apothecary, he said, it was not his business; so I got a chair, and we wrapped him up, and sent him to the hospital. The chairman took him upon one of the shutters; I was taken very sick, so I saw no more of it; we were obliged to have three men to secure her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any acquaintance between the deceased and prisoner?</p>
               <p>J. Burn. No.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Burn's. I came home about half after nine; I went out for a pint of beer; when I returned in about half an hour, and had sat down in the shop, I heard a noise. Mr. Burn desired me to go and see what it was; I went, and found the prisoner had broke a pannel out of the door: I asked her the reason of it? she said, they had no right to keep her in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she locked in?</p>
               <p>Hatton. She was so drunk she could not find the key. When I came down stairs, the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110049"></xptr> came in; I told him what she had done: he said, D - n her for a brimstone, I will go up and see what she is about. I went with him, and he brought the pannel of the door down. He asked her, what was the reason of her breaking the door? she called him gallows thief and pick-pocket, and said she would prove him one. Then he came down: he said when he came down stairs, that with a pennyworth of nails he could make it good again. I went up to bed, and in about an hour was awaked by a woman in the adjacent room: I came down stairs, and saw the deceased bleeding. They desired me to break the prisoner's door open and take her. I got two watchmen to assist, and we broke the door open. I got a light, and we found the prisoner dressed, with the child in her arms, sitting upon the bed. We asked her how she came to stab the man? she said, she knew nothing about it. When we attempted to seize her, she gave the watchman a fall: they desired me to fetch a cord to tye her, which I did, and we secured her. Then we laid the deceased upon one of the shutters, and took him to the hospital; I thought him very light when we put him upon the shutter.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour one o'clock: Mr. Burn desired me to fetch a chair; they would not take him in the chair, so they got a horse. I asked him how he came by his wound; he said, Mrs. Burke had stabbed him, and she was up one pair of stairs; we burst the door open, and she was sitting upon the bed, with the child in her arms. I said, You have been guilty of a very bad action, and must go along with me. She said, I durst not take her out of her own room. I said, if she would not come by fair means, I would take her by soul. We took the child out of her arms, and she flew at me like a dragon; she threw me down; when I got up again, I tyed her hands with a handkerchief; she gnawed it in two with her teeth. Then we got a cord and tyed her hands; she swore then, we should not take her to the watch-house. I got more assistance, and we got her away. I then followed the deceased to the hospital, and he died. He spoke very faint to me when I helped him up.</p>

            . The deceased was brought to the hospital a little after two in the morning; he was dying when I saw him. There was a wound just below the left collar bone. I put in my finger to feel if there was any pulsation in the artery, but I found none, I kept the body in the hospital till that afternoon; he died soon after I saw him; I never heard him speak. I received an order from the coroner to deliver the body up, and attend before the jury. I opened the body, and found that the subclavian artery, the artery that runs under the collar bone, was quite cut through; there was a great quantity of coagulated blood in the cavity of the chest. I believe that wound to be the immediate cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of instrument did it appear to be made with?</p>
               <p>Lewington. A sharp pointed instrument, I should suppose.</p>

               <p>This man broke three times in upon me; they fastened the door some how, that I could not get in, though I had the key. This man came in and forced my pocket off, and took my money. He wanted to lay with me; and because I would not let him, he threatened to murder me. The third time he broke in upon me, I stabbed him in my own defence. He wanted to rob me of five pence I had in money, and my life; besides, he knocked me down, I believe, twenty times by my own bed side. I told him the third time he came, I would stab him if he did not keep off; I had many blows upon my head.</p>

            . I lodged over the prisoner; I was a-bed, the noise awaked me. About ten o'clock I heard the deceased come up stairs twice, and the second time he came up, the prisoner cried out murder twice. I called and said, You, Will Armstrong, what do you make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110050"></xptr> such a noise for? I bid him let the woman alone, and mind his business He said, he was about his business. I said, if he did not get along, I would break his neck. He ran up to me, and asked me if I would fight him, and pulled his coat off. A woman came up with a candle, I can't tell who she was, and persuaded him to go down. I shut my door and went to bed, and in half an hour he came up again. The prisoner was calling him pick-pocket and thief, and all the names she could; and said, if he came up again to strike her in her own room, she would stick him. He did come up again, and was stabbed; how he was stabbed, I can't say; I was in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was in the room, or upon the stairs?</p>
               <p>Davis. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court. Why, it was the room under you?</p>
               <p>Davis. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when he came up stairs the first time?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was awaked out of my sleep; I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing that passed between them?</p>
               <p>Davis. Not till the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in her room the second time?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes he was.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was out of bed, and looked down two or three steps. He stood on the inside of her door, which was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door whole?</p>
               <p>Davis. I did not take any notice of that.</p>

            . I rented a room adjoining to the prisoner's; there was nothing more than a slight partition between her room and mine; the partition is so thin that we are forced to hang a curtain, to prevent seeing out of one room into the other. I went to bed at nine o'clock that night; about half after ten, or eleven, I heard a great noise at the prisoner's door; some people came up, and called out loud at her door, and went down again; after that the prisoner lay raving and swearing to herself, she being very fuddled. Armstrong came up, and swore he would silence her. He went into her room and gave her many blows, which I perfectly heard. He was at the head of the stairs when he said he would silence her; and then he went directly into her room. The prisoner was quiet for some little time after that; I laughed at it. and was glad she was silenced, because she disturbed me. He went down stairs; she abused him again, and he ran up stairs and beat her in an intolerable manner, so that she cried out, murder! murder! The man that lodged up two pair of stairs, called to know the reason why he made such a noise: the deceased damned him, and ran up stairs directly, and abused him. He was drunk, I believe, as well as the woman. In the mean time, a woman came up with a candle, and prevailed upon Armstrong to go to bed; after some time she got him down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the woman was?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Mrs. Burn?</p>
               <p>Thacker. It was not her. He went down stairs. At the bottom of the stairs he swore how he would use the man that was up stairs, next morning; he swore vengeance against him. The prisoner said, You Armstrong, if you beat me any more, I will stab you. Armstrong ran up again in a great hurry, and said, D - n you, you bitch, I'll make you remember threatning to stab me. He ran to the door; there was a scuffle at the door; I can't be certain whether he went in or not; I believe he opened the door. He cried out to Mrs. Burn, I am stabbed: he ran down about three or four steps; there he stopt, I believe, for three or four minutes, and then he ran down to the bottom of the stairs. I let them alone, as I knew them to be very abusive persons; I should have been abused if I had spoke to them. When I came out of my room, he was just carried away to the hospital, so I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Sometimes I sell pocket-books, and sometimes ginger-bread-nuts, as I am almost blind: I can't see your lordship now: I was a peruke-maker by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people any quarrels before?</p>

               <p>Thacker. I can't say they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of Armstrong's ever coming into her room before this?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No; I have lodged there six or seven weeks; Armstrong lodged there all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her breaking the pannel of the door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. That awaked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110051"></xptr>Q. Did you hear Hatton's voice?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I could not distinguish his voice well then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was in the room?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He came in twice, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come in?</p>
               <p>Thacker. The door was open; I heard him go in without opening it. I believe the door was open when he came up the third time, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who broke the door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she had a right to break her own door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I heard her say she had a right to do with her own room as she pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any connexions with this woman?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No concern in petitions with her?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say, they should not keep her out of her room while she paid her rent?</p>
               <p>Thacker No, I did not. Two people were talking with her about her breaking the door; she said, She had a right to do as she pleased with her own room; for into her own room she would go. This was before Armstrong came up to beat her. They found means to open her door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, when you did not get up?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I heard the door open and shut: I believe she had mislaid her key, and afterwards found it.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me by two watchmen: I asked her how she came to wound the man; she said, she knew nothing of any man's being wounded. I looked at her clothes, and her apron was all sprinkled with blood. I asked her how that came; she said, the deceased had struck her on the face, and set her nose a bleeding. I looked at her face, and saw no marks of blows; I looked up her nostrils, and there was not the least signs of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any appearance of her having been beat?</p>
               <p>Boclare. No; there was not the least signs of blows; I saw blood upon her left hand. I saw the deceased in the hospital; he desired to be put to bed; and said, he was a dead man. I heard the prisoner say, she did it in her own defence. I examined the place where the blood was upon the stair-case, three steps before you go into her room, but there was no blood above that; the blood was three or four yards from the outside of her door. There is a large broad step; I apprehend the blood poured down him as he stood upon that broad step.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thacker. Where was the blood?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Down four steps; there he rested: it was his right side as he came down.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burn again.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself, and be sure to answer my question truly and with precision. I understood you in the course of the evidence to say, that after you had returned from shutting up the windows, that the deceased remained in the shop, and drank some beer?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Yes, a very short time, and then he went with me, and shut the shop up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know what might have passed between the time of hearing the outcry of murder, and the time you saw him?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. It could not be above a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. In the first place, tell me, as near as possible, how long it was after he took the lamp and went away from you, before you heard the cry that he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing you did after he took the lamp, and went to bed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. The first thing was to shut two doors; then I went into my own room and latched the door, and began undressing myself; I was undressed in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dropt asleep?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. No; I was but just laid upon my pillow; it could not be but about a quarter of an hour; it was rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the stair-case that goes up to her room?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. About two yards; the stair-case goes up by the side of my room; there is only a wainscot between the stair-case and my room.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time he went up stairs and brought down the pannel of the door, till he went up to bed, had he been out of your sight?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Never, but for the pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had taken the lamp to go to bed, could any body have gone up that stair-case to her room, without your hearing them?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. No, they could not, unless they went without their shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account given by these people: is it true?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110052"></xptr>E. Burn. The account they have given is wrong; her husband gives them half a crown a day to come here: they never came out to assist me when I cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true the deceased did go up two different times before this blow was given?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He did not go up stairs; he went through the entry beyond the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what was it that induced her to swear she would stab him?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. She had been swearing in the morning that she would stab this old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how high he had got upon the stairs when he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He was a little man, and very nimble. I heard him say, You brimstone, will you? and the thing was done immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say; the Black * and the other man are hired by the husband to come here?</p>
               <p>* Davis is a Black.</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Because I asked them how they came here, when they would not assist me before. Davis said, he had half a crown; and Thacker said, he was paid for it.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Davis. Have you half a crown for coming here?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have not had half a crown yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to have half a crown?</p>
               <p>Davis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her husband come to you to come here?</p>
               <p>Davis. I don't know whether it was her husband or not; he came to know if I knew any thing about the murder.</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He shewed me two shillings and six pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Davis. They are the halfpence I brought from home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you these two shillings from?</p>
               <p>Davis. From Mr. Burke.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thacker. You said, you had nothing from Burke?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He gave us two shillings apiece to buy victuals.</p>
               <p>Court. Thacker, if you have been betrayed into any thing more than truth, it will be better for you now to correct your evidence in time.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I have not said any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. You just now said, you had not any money.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I said, I had not half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he apply to you to come here?</p>
               <p>Thacker. On Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you here any other day?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Yes, upon Saturday and yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you have had from this supposed husband?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He gave us eighteen pence apiece yesterday; we had neither of us any money, and he gave us eighteen pence apiece to buy something.</p>
               <p>Hatton again. The Black said, that the deceased went into his room, whereas he did not; he stood upon the stair-case. I desired him to go down stairs, and then the candle went out: this was before the affair happened; about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me all you know of the quarrel between him and the Black.</p>
               <p>Hatton. The Black threatened to kick him down stairs when he heard the noise; the Black got out of his own apartment.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell me the plain truth, I shall catch you if you don't: What made the Black come out of his own room?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Hatton. At the bottom of the stairs; I was up in the garret. I heard the Black come out of his room: he said, D - n you, if you will not be quiet, I will make you quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he speaking to?</p>
               <p>Hatton. To Armstrong. Armstrong said, Do you think I am afraid of such a black negroe son of a bitch as you, that have travelled through Europe, Asia, Africa, and America? I am a bit of man's flesh, and am not afraid of you. I came down in order to appease them; my candle went out, and I went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you when the Black came out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. Just at the Black's door, upon the stairs, with my candle, going to bed. Armstrong was below stairs, and had a dispute with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the prisoner's door?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't swear whether it was at the prisoner's door, or within the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they disputing about?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me truly.</p>
               <p>Hatton. She was calling him pick-pocket son of a bitch, and other names.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110053"></xptr>Q. What was he doing to her that made the Black come out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do know. What did he say to her?</p>
               <p>Hatton. He said, he never was a pick-pocket or a thief in his life; nor never brought a blush upon the face of any of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not threaten to beat her if she was not quiet?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No; I did not hear any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you went up to bed afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hatton. Yes, and I laid there till they called me up, and told me Armstrong was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Hatton. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you and he had been up and brought down the pannel of the door, before the Black came out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. About an hour; it was about twelve: He was stabbed about a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Burn. You told me that this man was never up stairs afterwards, and never out of your sight till he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to this?</p>
               <p>Hatton. They were all together at the time the pannel was brought down.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Where did the deceased dispose of himself after the lamp was given him to go to bed?</p>
               <p>Court. She said he was going to his own room, partly undressed. It is plain from Hatton's account, that he was up again after he had brought the pannel down.</p>
               <p>E. Burn I will tell you the real truth. Armstrong did not come home till after eleven o'clock. Hatton was the first that went up, then Hatton and Armstrong together, and brought the pannel of the door down.</p>

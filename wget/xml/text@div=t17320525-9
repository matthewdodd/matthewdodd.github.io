             (whom I had some Knowledge of) came and told me, that a Friend of his who was going to Dun'irk, wanted a parcel of Goods in my Way. I asked him how his Friend propos'd to pay for'em. Here's a promissary Note (says he) of Mr. Brumton's, payable to Mr. Olivant at six Months, and Mr. Olivant has indors'd it; they are both good Men, they belong'd to the Exchequer. I told him I would take the Note in Payment, if I could be satisfy'd that it was good. He said he'd leave it with me, and I might make Enquiry; and so he did. I went to the Exchequet, and enquired of one of the Clerks there if he knew Mr. Brunton and Mr. Olivant. He said, Yes. I told him I had a Note of theirs for 50 l. If it was for 500 l says he, your Money would be safe, for they are both very good men. I asked him if I could see either of em? He said No they were both out of Town. I asked him, if he knew their Hand Writing? He said, No. And so I return'd home. Warren came again, and the Prisoner with him. I asked Warren [aside] how the Prisoner came to have this Note of Mr. Olivant? Why, says he, When Mr. Cheesborough was in his Prosperty he lent Mr. Olivant a considerable Sum of Money; and now in Gratitude. Mr. Olivant has lent him this Note. As Mr. Cheesborough is going to Sea, he's very much straiten'd for Time; and a short Delay now will be a great Hindrance to him: And therefore I must desire you to come to a resolution as soon as possible. Upon this I let the Prisoner have the Goods, and he indors'd the Note with his own Name. Two Days afterwards, having some Business at Whiteball I called at the Exchequer and met with a Friend of mine, whom I could not find when I was there before. He brought me to a Gentleman there, who (when I shew'd him the Note) told me, that I was impos'd on, that the Note was neither writ nor indors'd by either Mr. Brumton or Mr. Olivant, and the Writing was quite different from theirs. And then he shew'd me their Writing in some Books. Upon this I procur'd a Warrant from Sir

            , and went in search after Warren and the Prisoner. Warren was sled, but I met with the Prisoner at the seven Stars in Rosebary Lane, on the 26th or 27th of November. As I came back with him in a Coach, I said to him. You could not well do this alone, you must have some Accomplices. And, says he, I know I shall be hang'd, I must own that the Note is counterfeit.

I told him no it was neither his Hand nor like it. I do Business for Mr. Olivant, and am well acquainted with his Writing. Several other Gentlemen swore that the Writing was nothing like Mr. Olivant's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Warren came to me, and desired me to indorse the Note. I refused several times; but at last I consented; he said he wanted some Goods of the Prosecutor, who would not take it with his Indorsement. Mr. Pru. said, he would enquire about the Note and after he had made enquiry, he accepted the Note on my Indorsement. But I never had the Goods, for Warren went off with them all, and I lost Money by him besides.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. You say, that Warren apply'd to you first. Did he apply for Goods on his own Account, or on the Prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Mr. Prue. He said the Goods were for the Prisoner; I delivered none for Warren's Use. but all for the Prisoner's. The Prisoner gave me the Note, and indors'd it with his own Name, and told me, that he was going Abroad. He indeed desir'd Warren to look out the Goods; for he said, that he himself did not understand 'em. As to the Prisoner's not having the Goods, I have heard indeed that Warren was too cunning for him, and got the Goods from on Board the Ship, with other Goods of the Prisoner's, to the Value of 7 or 8 l. The Prisoner was to have been try'd last Sessions, but he broke out of Newgate, and went to Carlisle, from whence he was brought back by a Habeas Corpus.

            . I live at Edmonton-marsh. I keep bees. I missed two hives on Sunday night, the 11th of June; I took Camp, the officer, the next evening, to Thomas Blythe's house, which is a about a mile off: I found him and his son at home; I asked the father to let me look at his bees; he said I might look and welcome; I found two of my hives on his premises; I knew them by the sticks I had put for them to swarm on. I told Blythe he had got two more hives than his own; he said No; I said there were two of mine, and I would stand to it. The Magistrate ordered me to take them away, and I took them the night following. I have seen Wilson about my premises.</p>

            . I live next door to Skinner. In consequence of information we got from Leonard Bailey, we went to Blythe's; Skinner went in, and, as soon as he had sorted the hives, he said he had two more than his own; Blythes both said they had not; Thomas Blythe said they would swarm in their own hives, and he had swarmed them himself, and he knew of none coming on his premises but what he hived himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. When you first arrived who did you see? A. Both the Blythes - they were within hearing; the hives were found in the bee-house, ten or twelve yards from the house; I do not know whether they belonged to the father or son. There were two bee-houses on the side of the house - they were concealed from the road.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Skinner to Blythe's, and asked if he had any hives belonging to Mr. Skinner - he said No; I said "Mr. Skinner says there are two here, which he can swear to;" Blythe said"You may look and welcome?" Skinner then pointed out two - I took them into custody; as we were going to the cage John Blythe said he had bought them of two lads, named Taylor and Wilson; I do not think Thomas Blythe heard that; I went next morning and took Wilson - I asked if he knew any thing about it - he denied it, but in the afternoon he said "I shall tell all about this after I get to the Magistrate's;" he then said he was bathing in the river, with young Blythe, that they saw and took them.</p>

            . I live at Edmonton, and work on the barges. I was at play near the Angel one Wednesday, with Wilson and Taylor; John Blythe came up and Wilson said to him "Will you get us that?" John Blythe said Yes; and Taylor said "Where shall we go?" Wilson answered "There is some at Tottenham;" Blythe then said there were some at Hornsey, at Bury-street, some at Mr. Sand's, and some at Mr. Skinner's; Wilson said they would go to Hornsey after some - Taylor said very well; Taylor then said he was going up Tottenham - Wilson asked when he would be back - he said about eleven o'clock, and Wilson said that would be time enough - Taylor said they would be out all night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who were present? A. Taylor, Wilson, and John Blythe: I know where Blythe lives, and know his father. I never got into trouble about them.</p>

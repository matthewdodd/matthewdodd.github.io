                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on 5th April, I was living apart from him at Mrs. Clement's, 5, Park-lane, Clapham—I did live at 4, Mill-row, Clapham, and I went from there to Mrs. Clements—I went to try to get a lodging—no one would take me in on account of my husband—on 5th April, I saw my husband—I had been washing and I saw him against the door of the lodging—he asked me to give him a little hat brush, and I said yes, and he followed me into the passage and asked if I would have a little beer—I said, "No"—I went up stairs and got the hat brush and gave it him—I went out and left him there—I met Mrs. Clements, and I told her he was in the house—I returned with Mrs. Clements—I went in doors and sat down, and he sat down by the side of me—he went and got some beer and asked me to drink with him, and I did so—Mrs. Clements asked him to go, and I asked him myself to go—he said he had very comfortable lodgings—I said I was very glad of it, and I told him not to trouble me and I would not trouble him—he was going, and he came to the foot of the stairs and asked me to shake hands with him, and I did so—he then asked me to stop the night with him—I said,"No, you said you had a comfortable lodging, go to your lodging"—he then said he would stop—Mrs. Clements</p>

               <p>said she hoped he would not come there, it was a quiet place and we did not want to have a noise—he again asked me to stop—I said, "No," and he left—on the following morning about 6 o'clock, I was getting my break<lb></lb>fast, Mrs. Clements was gone to work, and Mr. Clements was out; there were two children in the house—while getting my breakfast a knock came at the door; I went to the door and it was my husband—he asked me for a bag which he had left the night before—I said he had not left a bag there, I supposed he had left it in his room at night and had forgotten it—I looked round for the bag and I said there was no one there—he then asked me for some water—I said, "Why do you not go to your lodging"—he then said with an oath that he would cut my throat, and before the words were out of his mouth I felt the cut at my throat—I struggled with him very much and defended the cut off with my hand, and he cut the leaders of my left hand—I fell and he fell on me—he rose, and he was endeavouring to cut my throat—I fell down and was on my knees—I struggled and got the razor from him, and he put his fingers in my throat to tear the wound open—the wound bled very much indeed; it bled much more after that—my husband got up and ran away—I was very much exhausted—I hallooed murder as long as I could, and some gentleman came and said I had cut my throat as I had the razor in my hand—I said no, my husband had done it—I saw Mrs. Clements and asked her to run for a doctor, and I was taken to the hospital—I don't know of any cause for this—my husband has not been happy with me for the last three years—I believe it was jealousy, but I believe the jealousy has been on the wrong side—I have had two warrants and a summons for him for his ill usage, and the last time he said if I had him brought up again, he would give me something for it—that is about a month ago.</p>

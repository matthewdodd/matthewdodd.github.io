               <p>CLEMENT DEWSBURY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a waiter: On the 11th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was crossing Swallow-street, and I heard a window break, and saw a man pull something out at the window; I could not see what it was till I came to it, he dropped it immediately as he pulled it from the window, and I picked it up, and pursued him as close as I could; he turned the corner of Little Argyle-street, and I lost sight of him in turning the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons running at the same time? - A. Not one; there was not a person to be seen on that side of the way; I am quite certain he is the same man; he was stopped by two brewers; I did not see them stop him, but I heard them say, here he is; when they said, here he is, I said, that is the young gentleman I want, bring him back; when I came to the door of Mr. Dean, I knocked, and Mr. Dean came to the door, and called for a candle; I asked him if that was his property? he looked at it, and said, it was his; I told him that was the young gentleman that I had seen take it from his window; the prisoner, in the room, did not positively deny it; he said, he would take off his coat, or any part of his cloaths, to make Mr. Dean amends for the damage he had done; he said, he was a servant out of place; in giving that account of himself, I was very anxious to set him at liberty; and Mr. Dean said, he would go and speak to his neighbours that were in the shop waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. The fact was, that he was taken, and afterwards committed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was it dark? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the back of the persons and did not see his face till he was apprehended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed him at turning the corner; that you neither saw his back nor face then? - A. Not for the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a reward of 40l.? - A. Not till the prisoner told me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that there is now? - A. I never was in a Court of Justice before in my life; and never heard it till I heard it from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cooper; I was standing behind Mr. Sharpe's dray, in King-street, and I heard the cry of "stop-thief!" several times; I did not see the prisoner till he came round the corner of the place close up to me, and myself and one of my fellow-servants caught hold of him, and asked him if he was the thief? he said he did not know what we meant by asking that question; I told him I would secure him till it was proved whether he was the person or not, and instantly Mr. Dewsbury came up, with a kerseymere waistcoat in his hand; he said that he was the man that stole the waistcoat, and desired us to take him to Mr. Dean's house with him, which we did instantly.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long had you the prisoner in hold before Dewsbury came up? - A. Instantly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDWARDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a brewer; I heard the cry of "stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running on the other side of the way; I desired my fellow-servant to cross over the way, and then the prisoner crossed over to my side of the way, and I laid hold of him, and my fellow-servant and I carried him back with Dewsbury.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; I was sent for to Mr. Dean's house to take the prisoner in custody; I found nothing upon him but a tobacco-stopper and some half-pence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know of a 40l. reward? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110096"></xptr>Prisoner's defence. I had been to Mary-le-bonne; I heard a cry of stop thief in Swallow-street; I saw half a dozen people standing by a dray; I walked over to them, and they asked me if I was the thief; I told them I was not, and this man came up and said I had stole a waistcoat, and they took me to this gentleman's shop; I told them I knew nothing at all about it; Dewsbury said, if I would own to it they would not hurt me; I said it was a very hard thing to acknowledge what I knew nothing about; they asked me several times; I said, in regard to the window, I had no money, and I would give him any thing I had to make him a recompence; he went out to one of his neighbours, and while he was gone, Dewsbury went out, and then the other man came in and said to his wife, my dear, how could you let the man go, I can do nothing with the prisoner, I should have got 40l. and they took me before a Magistrate, and they thought proper to commit me for want of sureties; I offered to serve his Majesty, and Mr. Deane was very willing that I should go.</p>

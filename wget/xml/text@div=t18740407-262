                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 62, Cumberland Street, Mile End—on 20th March a broker called on me and told me something, and then he went out and brought in the prisoner, whom he introduced as Mr. Berry, a buyer of my business—the prisoner said that he was in search of a business, and thought it would just suit him—he went all over the premises, and asked for the agreement I had with the landlord—I brought it, and the broker read it, and told the prisoner that he was to give 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business—the prisoner said he thought that was rather too much, and then he said 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said that I thought it a very low sum, and agreed to sell it for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to pay 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—I had agreed with the broker to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., and the prisoner took this paper out of his pocket and wrote this hill of exchange, (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to J.

               <p>me—the broker then asked for his fee—I said that I had not got it in the place, but I had a friend who would cash the bill or pay roe something on it—I felt very doubtful, and tried to see a constable, but was not successful—no money was paid, and when the prisoner found that he wanted the bill hack, and said he would give me forty golden sovereigns instead of it.</p>

My husband is a grocer, of 1, Richmond Ter<lb></lb>race, Wandsworth—we were anxious to sell the business, and on 28th January someone called at the shop, who afterwards came back with the prisoner, who said he had arranged with my husband to sell the business for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had sent him to me to pay a deposit—he took this paper out, and wrote this bill in my presence.

I live at Crescent Terrace, High Street, Lower Nor<lb></lb>wood—I had a baker's business to dispose of—a man called on me on 16th January, and in consequence of what passed between us he went away and came back with the prisoner—they looked at the agreement—went over the house and agreed to buy the business for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—something was said about a deposit, and the prisoner wrote this Bill.

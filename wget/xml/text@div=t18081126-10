On Thursday evening the 20th of October, a little past nine o'clock in the evening, as the prisoner was about leaving the house, I called him back for the purpose of giving him some old clothes; he pulled off his great coat, and from the curious manner in which he pulled off his great coat, and laid it down in the dark, some suspicion arose in my mind that all was not right. After he had tried these clothes on, as he was putting on the great coat again. I took the liberty of feeling the pockets, in which I discovered two bottles of wine; I said, Richard, what have you got here; nothing, sir, he said; I said that must be a mistake, and if you please we will see what it is; I then took the two bottles out of his pocket; I held one in each hand, I said Richard, what is this; he said, sir, it is sherry wine that he had been bottling, and begged for mercy; I called up a person into the room where he was; I told him I found the prisoner robbing me, and desired him to remain in the room, to see that he did not make his escape; I locked them both in; I went and got an officer; I gave the prisoner in charge of the officer, and when he was taken to the watch-house they there found two more bottles in his breeches, which I had not discovered; I then proceeded with the officer to his lodgings; where after a little objection from his wife, he searched his house; he found three bottles of red port, part of a bottle of rum, and a bottle of brandy.</p>

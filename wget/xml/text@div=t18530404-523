                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 7, Fair-street, Borough—on Tuesday, 22nd March, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was in the King's Head public house, Tooley-street, with several of my shipmates—the prisoner was there—she drank out of a glass of brandy-and-water with me—I had eight sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, and a sixpence in a pouch in my right trowsers pocket—my shipmate asked me whether my money was all right, and I took it out—the prisoner was sitting there, and could see me do it—I left the public house about 12 o'clock—three men left with me—after I got out I turned aside to a corner for a particular purpose—the prisoner came,</p>

               <p>got hold of me, put her hand in my right trowsers pocket, and went away immediately—I missed my pouch and money—I am sure it was the prisoner—there was a gaslight there—I could see her face, and I knew her before—a policeman came up, and I told him—I afterwards went with him to a house in Snow's fields, which was rather more than a quarter of a mile off—I saw the prisoner there, and said she had taken my money—I think she said she did not know anything about it—I saw another woman there who had been at the public house with me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 22nd March I was on duty in Tooley-street, and saw the prosecutor and some other sailors come out of the King's Head—the prosecutor went against the wall, and while he was there the prisoner, who I knew, went up to him, put her arm round him, and left him immediately—he came and told me something, in consequence of which I went with him to a house in Snow's-fields, and found the prisoner and another female in the front room, ground floor—the prosecutor said, "That is the girl that robbed me," pointing to the prisoner, who denied all knowledge of the robbery—there was nobody else in the room—I took her and the woman to the station, then returned with another constable, searched the room, and found two sovereigns under the mattress, and my brother constable picked up seven sovereigns—I took them to the station, came back, and found half-a-sovereign on the floor, near the bed.</p>

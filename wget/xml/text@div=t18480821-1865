                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at 165, Old Gravel-lane, Wapping. On Sunday morning, 23rd July, I was disturbed between two and three o'clock by a cry of "Thieves! murder! "—I went down and found my lodger, Mr. Wall, down stairs—I saw a person get out of my back parlour-window, making his escape over the tiles—I found the drawers broken open, four dresses taken out and strewed about the floor, and on the table a crowbar, gimlet, and a hat; and outside the parlour I found a pair of lace-up boots—the back parlour-window, which I had fastened when I went to bed about half-past eleven, was broken between the upper and lower sashes—I had left my wife and son up—I did not lose anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the prosecutor's house. On Sunday morning, 23rd July, I was unwell, and had occasion to go down stairs; as I went through the passage towards the yard, I heard a rumbling noise, but did not take particular notice, thinking it might be the cats—when I opened the back-door, I saw a flash of light, and saw the prisoner get out of the parlour-window, which is about three feet high—he had no hat or cap on, so that I saw his face very plainly—I have no doubt that he is the person—I raised an alarm, and caught hold of him by his legs as he was ascending the washhouse tiles, but I could not detain him—I went the same night to the Bull's Head, Ratcliffe Highway, and there saw the prisoner, leaning on a cask, talking to a female—I at once identified him as the man—he had a pilot coat on, and a blue cap, the same as is generally worn by seamen—I went out and told a policeman, and he was taken—I waited at the station-house half an hour, and a policeman came and told me he had escaped.</p>

On Sunday night, 23rd July, in consequence of information, I went in company with Wall to the Bull's Head—I found the prisoner there—Wall pointed him out to me as the man whose legs he had hold of—he was dressed in a blue jacket, as he is now, and a blue cloth cap with a peak to it—that is not a pilot jacket—I took him into custody—I told him I wanted him, for a burglary in Old Gravel-lane last night—he said, "I know that, you catch me for everything"—I knew him before—I said, "I can't help it, the man has been to me"—on the way to the station he made his escape—I ran him up and down several streets, but I could not take him again—these boots, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) which I found at the prosecutor's, fitted the prisoner.</p>

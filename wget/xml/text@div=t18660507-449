On 4th April, about half past one in the morning, I was on duty in Dudley-street, Seven-dials, and saw the prisoner and another person folding something up on the doorstep of 42, Dudley-street, the prosecutor's—I went towards them, and they ran away—the prisoner had the bundle under his arm, and the other had something in his hand—I pursued them, and they dropped the bundle about 100 yards off, and got away—I picked it up—it contained six pairs of boots—some one picked up two other pairs of boots and brought them to me—I am cer<lb></lb>tain the prisoner is one of them—I picked him out at the station about a week afterwards from, I should think, thirty people.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Dudley-street, Seven-dials—when I opened my shop on 3d April I missed 8 pair of Wellington boots—these are them—they are all mine—I had closed my shop and parlour at half-past nine, and secured them—the boots were all on the racks then—I went to my sister-in-law's, next door, and remained till half-past twelve—the door was secure when I returned, but the parlour door was partly open—I saw everything secure in the parlour, but never gave the shop a thought—there is a door from the parlour to the shop, and a door from the parlour to the passage—when I came home, the common passage parlour door, which leads out of the yard, was wide open—it had been secure about half-past twelve—I do not know how it had been opened—I had locked it, and had the key in my pocket—I left no one there who had a right to go in—it communi<lb></lb>cates with the parlour, and there is a door from the parlour to the shop—I got up at eight and missed the boots—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I took the prisoner from a descrip<lb></lb>tion I received from Firth, at a public-house in Seven-dials, on 9th April, at 10 o'clock at night—I told him it was on suspicion of being concerned with a man not in custody, in breaking and entering a house, 42, Dudley-street—he said, "I will go quiet"—on the way to the Court next morning, he said, "You have got it up very well for me; why do not you get the other two as well, you know them very well?"—I have known the prisoner two or three years—the other constable took me to the station to identify the prisoner—there were thirty persons in the yard, and the prisoner had his choice to place himself where he liked—the constable came in, went straight to him, and identified him directly.</p>

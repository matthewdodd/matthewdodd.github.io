                  </hi>. I am an articled clerk. On 16th June, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was opposite the end of Clifford's Inn Passage, or a little nearer St. Paul's than that—Fleet Street at that time was very clear—I heard the rattling of a cart, and some shouting—my attention was called to the prisoner, who was in a cart, driving a horse, which appeared to be gallop<lb></lb>ing at about nine or ten miles an hour, going towards St. Paul's—I saw the deceased in front of the horse—he was a gentleman more than sixty years of age I should think—he appeared to have stepped off the flags, and either the horse's shoulder or a portion of the shaft struck him, I should say, in the chest; he was thrown down with considerable violence on his back—I do not think the wheel of the cart went over him—he was picked up by some policemen—immediately the horse struck the deceased, it plunged; the pri<lb></lb>soner appeared to get it under his command again, and drove on a short distance further, and was then stopped by the police, or else he pulled up on their calling to him—several people shouted out directly the accident occurred, and shortly before as well—I should say that the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whereabouts were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the opposite side to where the prisoner was—he was driving towards St. Paul's, and was close to the St. Dunstan's church side, and I was on the opposite side—his cart was about a yard, or a little more, from the kerb, on his pro<lb></lb>per side—of course the bystanders shouted when they saw the horse so near the deceased, and I believe the prisoner shouted as well, and called out to the gentleman before the horse struck him; he was evidently very old—it was between Clifford's Inn and Fetter Lane, between the church and Fetter Lane—I am pretty well sure there is no passage between Clifford's Inn and Fetter Lane—of course I did not see the actual contact between the cart and the old gentleman, because I was on the other side of the way, and the horse was between me and him—when I first saw him, he was stepping from the flags; being so close, of course he was in front of the cart directly—I have lived all my life in London—I have very seldom driven, but I should say the pace would be eight or nine miles an hour; the horse appeared to be galloping when I looked—I believe a horse lifts both his legs at once when he gallops.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 315). On 16th June, I was on duty in Fleet Street, and at a little before 6 o'clock saw the prisoner in a cart driving—when I first saw him he was by the side of Praed's, the bankers, which is between Chancery Lane and St. Dunstau's, and was galloping at the rate of nine or ten miles an hour, towards St. Paul's—I saw the deceased attempting to cross Fleet Street, at the end of Clifford's Inn Passage, and saw the cart knock him down; at least, the horse or the shaft, I imagine—I was on the other side of the way, near Hoare's door—directly I saw the deceased knocked down I stepped across the street, and held up my hand for the prisoner to stop; he did so—the gentleman was afterwards taken to St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>

Q.</hi> Was your attention first attracted by a blow being struck by the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw the cart coming; the street was perfectly clear; it was five minutes to 6 o'clock in the evening—when I first saw the cart it was by Praed's, the bankers; that was the first time I saw the cart or the prisoner—the street was perfectly clear—the prisoner was sitting on the off side, in the usual place where the driver sits, with the reins in his hand—it was a two-wheeled cart, used for newspapers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to Bartholomew's Hospital. On 16th June, at a little after 6 o'clock, the deceased was brought there—I examined him; he had a compound fracture of the left leg, close to the ankle—he died on the 28th June, of the shock to the constitution; he was over seventy years of age; his left leg was cut close to the ankle—what I have heard of in the evidence would produce what I saw.</p>

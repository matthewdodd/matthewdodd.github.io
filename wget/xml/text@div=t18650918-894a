               <p>captain in the Royal Engineers, and brevet-major in the army—on Friday, 11th August last, I was standing on parade in the barrack-square, Chatham, about one o'clock P. M.—Major de Vere was there also, about three or four yards from me; Captain Hinds, a brother officer, was standing between me and Major de Vere—it was the ordinary every day parade for work—I should say about three hundred men were present, not under arms—both Major de Vere and I were on duty—the report of a gun attracted my at<lb></lb>tention, and I saw Major de Vere in Captain Hind's arms—I went to his assistance—I heard him say twice, "Oh, my God"—I saw blood running from under his coat—I carried him partly off the parade—I then gave orders that men should be posted at the back doors of K and L houses; those were the only two houses on that side in which the single men are quartered; there are two other houses, occupied by married men—I went with other men to post at the front doors—on arriving at the front door I met a man named Mason—in consequence of something that Mason said to me, I went up to room No. 4, that is a room on the first floor, which faces the parade ground—when I got into that room I found the prisoner there; he was alone, he had on the same dress he has now, with a cap—there was a smell of burnt powder in the room—I said to him, "Did you do this?"—his answer was, "Yes, sir"—his manner was very respectful and calm—I asked him for his rifle and his pouch—he pointed out his rifle to me, it was in the arm band at the head of a bed in the same room; the pouch was hanging on the accoutrement pegs, at the head of the same bed—I took the rifle and examined it; it had evidently just been discharged—there was an exploded cap on the nipple—I examined the pouch—I found one round of ball cartridge and two caps deficient—the prisoner was then removed to the guard room.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of December, I lost between three and four dozen of Morocco skins; they were kept in a drawer in the parlour, at the back of my warehouse; I missed them on the 20th: a neighbour of mine; a brother trade; sent his boy with a piece of leather, desiring I would match him three or four skins of that pattern; I went to the drawer where we keep those skins, and they were gone; my man said, he had put them in the drawer the night before: I never saw the prisoner, till I saw him before the justice. On the 27th of the same month, my neighbour, Mr. Bayley, came to me, and said, have not you lost some Morocco skins, I said yes; he said, here has been a man with a skin, offering me to sell, and I saw it had your mark, in your own hand writing: I then went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150056"></xptr> Bow-street, and related the story to Mr. Bond, who advised me to take a friend, and if I found the skins were mine, to seize them and the parties: we went to where the direction led us, to a man that had offered some to sale; that was not the prisoner, he was a shoe-maker; he is not here; we went to a pawnbroker, his name is Creswell; at the pawnbroker's, we found thirty seven of my skins.</p>
               <p>(The skins produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>- BULLER sworn.</p>
               <p>They have remained in my custody ever since, except last night, when I left them with the sheriffs porter; there was no seal on them, but I shall know them again. (looks at them.) They are the same skins; but there are some of them which I cannot identify, because they are pared round; these are the same skins that were at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Court to Adey. How many of those skins can you positively swear to? - Twenty-nine, all in my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>(One of them shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Are you a <rs id="t17830115-35-viclabel215" type="occupation">wholesale dealer</rs>

               <p>Is that the common mark you use on your skins? - It has been altered since, but that is the mark I will swear to.</p>
               <p>You sold a great many similar skins before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who do you deal with for your leather? A great many people.</p>
               <p>Who is your dyer? - They are finished at the dresser's; they live in the Borough; I buy them of the Spanish leather dresser's.</p>
               <p>Are not the skins dyed in the Borough? I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. In the indictment they are called Morocco leather skins; it is incumbent on them to prove that they are so.</p>
               <p>Court. That must be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>To Adey. What would you, or any man, in the trade call them? - Morocco skins: I know these skins were in my shop at that period, if there was no mark on them.</p>

            , a shoe-maker, brought a Morocco skin, he shewed it me as a sample, and asked me if I wanted a quantity; he said, he had twenty-seven, and that they were the property of a friend of his, but he was employed to sell them; I told him, if he would leave me his address, and where I should see the skins, I would call that evening; he left his address, and I informed the prosecutor; I asked the prosecutor what quantity of skins he had lost; he said, they were green and blue Morocco: we went to Raine's house; I asked him if he would give me a sight of the skins, he said, yes; he went with us to the house of one Creswell, a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you in the trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you call these skins? - Green and blue Morocco; this is the common expression of the trade, let them be manufactured where they will, they are known by that name: we found them at Creswell's; Raine told him, I was come to look at the skins; he rather hesitated; the skins were in the one pair of stairs; Creswell asked me, two or three times, what trade I was, if I was a shoe-maker: I told him I was in the sale way; he said, what, I suppose in the shoe selling way; I said, no, I am a leather seller sometimes; if you will shew them to me, I will buy them of you if they are worth my money; and he shewed me the skins; the prosecutor was not in the house; they waited to take the shoe-maker and Creswell; there were twenty-seven skins; I looked at them, these are the same; I asked the shoe-maker the price of them, he said, directly upon account of Creswell's being present, that he had absolutely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150057"></xptr> bought the skins of the pawnbroker, since he saw me last: I looked round, and I saw some other skins of a thinner sort; he said, they were not fit for my purpose, they were fit for book-binders; there was ten of them: I said, if they are leather, I can sell them, for I serve book-binders, as well as shoe-makers: Raine seemed not to wish that Creswell should be privy to our bargain: he said, I have bought them; and I said to the shoe-maker, we will withdraw, and have a pot of beer, and I will agree with you; accordingly we withdrew; when we got into the street, I took hold of the shoe-maker by the arm, and said, I am very sorry for you, but I am obliged to take you into custody; these skins are stolen goods; he seemed very much frightened, and desired I would take the other by all means; we took him also: I then demanded the key, to fetch the skins from the first floor; he gave me the key without any hesitation, and I went up and brought the 37 skins; I brought them down, and delivered them to Mr. Fuller, Mr. Adey's servant; then we all went to Bow-street: Raine appearing as an innocent man, only employed by the pawnbroker, he was dismissed directly: Creswell was in custody; he found bail for that night; he said he had them of them prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was merely on the information of Creswell, that the prisoner was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on the prisoner when he was taken up? - Nothing of this property.</p>
               <p>Do you know how these things came into Creswell's hands, any further than that he said the prisoner delivered them to him? - No, he said, he took them for a pledge of three guineas.</p>
               <p>Does Creswell keep an open shop as a pawnbroker? - It does not appear like a pawnbroker's to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This being the case at present, there is no evidence against the prisoner; as the only witness that remains on the bill, is Creswell, and he making such a great deal of mystery about this business, and being so very shy of shewing the skins; I do think, that he manifestly appears in the light of an accomplice; and, either that he took them himself, or else received them, knowing them to be stolen; for if he had not, when one man comes in a common course of trade to buy, and another wants to sell, the man does not look in his face ten times, and ask so many questions; therefore, there is not at present one grain of evidence to affect the prisoner; the whole depending on the testimony of Creswell, who appears so strongly in the light of an accomplice; and there being no other evidence but his, consequently there is no evidence at all affecting the prisoner.</p>

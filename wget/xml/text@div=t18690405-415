I live at 9, Brewer's Buildings, Fetter Lane, and am a light porter—on Saturday, 6th March, about 12.30 in the morning, I was with two friends, named Alfred Davis and John Marshall, at Pentonville Road, in an ice-cream shop—the prisoner came in with a female—he began quarrelling with the shopman and wanted some brandy and water—he was walking backwards out and he stumbled against me—I put my hand up, and he turned round and put his two fists in my face, and said, "Me fight, me fight"—I merely kept him from tumbling against me—I did not do anything more to him—I said I did not wish to fight, and be again put his fist in my face, and said, "Me fight"—he went outside, and I followed him—I did not do anything—I was going home with my two friends, and he took and struck me in the head, and I became in<lb></lb>sensible—a mob collected round directly after—there was nobody there when I was struck—I was put in a cab and taken to the hospital, and attended by Dr. Forder.</p>

I live at 22, Wellington Street, Whitechapel, and am a basket-maker—on the morning in question, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was with the last witness in the ice-cream shop when the prisoner and a female came in—he had some words with the shopman—I did not understand what it was about—he walked backwards out of the shop, and walked up against Watson—Watson put up his hands to shove him away, and the prisoner turned round and wanted to fight—Watson said he did not want to fight—the prisoner went out and Watson followed—no sooner did he get to the door than the prisoner stabbed him with a knife—he then ran up North Street; I ran after him—he turned and run back again—he run up against a cab and was knocked down—I kicked him so that he should not get up—he had the knife in his hands when he fell—a man came up and caught hold of me for kicking him, and when he saw the man was stabbed he let go of me and caught hold of the prisoner—I put Watson into a cab and took him to the hospital—he did not take off his coat and muffler out<lb></lb>side</p>

At the time this happened I lived at 6, Canterbury Road, Notting Hill—I am an undertaker—I was in the ice-cream shop, and saw the prisoner come in with a female—he asked for some refreshment; I could not say what—he then had some words with the man at the bar, in his own language—he tried to walk backwards out of the shop, and stumbled against the prosecutor's foot—he pushed the prisoner away—the prisoner said, "Me fight"—Watson said he did not wish to fight, and as he was going out, the prisoner plunged a knife into the top of his head—he ran away—I pursued him up North Street—he made a blow at me—he tried to run back, and came in contact with the horse of a cab, and was knocked down—I kicked him under the ribs—a constable came up and collared me—I said, "He has stabbed a man"—and he went to the prisoner, and found the knife under him—the constable also took a pair of scissors away from him—I helped to take him to the station—I never had the scissors in my possession—Watson did not take off his coat and muffler, he had them on when he was stabbed—the blood on the muffler came from the wound.</p>

               <p>put it on him—I said, "Where are you stabbed?"—he said, "In the head, just now"—I turned the prisoner over, and found this knife, lying under his right breast—I secured him, and told Watson to go to the station—he said be should do no such thing, he should take a cab and go to the hospital, as he did not know the amount of injury that had been done to him—I called a constable, and sent him in the cab to the hospital—I took the scissors out of Marshall's hands—he said, "He has stabbed my pal, and I am looking for the dagger," and he handed me the scissors, they came from the prisoner's pocket.</p>

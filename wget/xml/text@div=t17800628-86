               <p>I live in Hosier-lane, No. 29, in the same house with the prisoner. Upon the 7th of June, the day on which Mr. Langdale's house was beset, a great deal of liquor was brought by some persons, I did not know who they were; I told the landlady it was wrong to let it come in. She said she did not like to let it come in, but had not seen Cubbage, and he was so desperate a fellow she was afraid to speak to him. On the 7th in the evening, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner on the stairs with a copper funnel and some kind of spiritual liquor in it; I let him pass on, and I went out. I hope if any body comes to swear for him you will please to observe them for they must be forsworn.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has lodged three months in the house where I lodge; concerning Mr. Langdale's affair I saw all the liquor brought in; none was brought in by the prisoner that I saw, and I believe I saw it all brought in.</p>
               <p>Who was it brought in by? - By a strange young man I never saw before nor since to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came he to bring it to your house? - I am only a lodger in the house; I sat at the door from seven till eleven o'clock, and saw it brought in at different times.</p>
               <p>Whom was it brought to in the house? - I do not know; it was found in the prisoner's apartment, I believe he was not at home at that time; I did not see him; he was out all the time the liquor was brought in I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You was not in his room? - No.</p>
               <p>How can you swear he was not at home then? - I sat at the door from before seven till near eleven o'clock, in the course of which time the prisoner neither went in nor out; I saw a strange young man, who I had never seen before nor since, bring in a great cask of liquor; I believe that is the cask which is produced; he went a second time and brought some in a pail; he came a third time with some in the copper funnel; he put it to my face two or three times and wanted me to drink. I refused; I said I thought it a strange thing to bring liquor home in an open funnel. I asked him which way he stopped the funnel? He said he put a bung at the bottom of the funnel; I believe it is the same funnel; it was of the same colour; it was bent like this funnel; a few minutes after the last of the liquor was brought in the prisoner came in all in a sweat and said, He had been helping Mr. Langdale remove some of his things for fear the fire should reach his place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Woollaston I said.</p>
               <p>Witness. Mr. Woollaston's. He said for fear the fire from Mr. Langdale's should reach Mr. Woollaston's place he was removing some of his effects.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home? - Between seven and eleven; he followed the last liquor in. I was then sitting at the door in my own chair; the alarm was so great I could not stay in my apartment.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Woollaston here? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner go to after he came home? - I do not know; he went up stairs.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280201"></xptr>Did he go out again? - I do not know that, he went into his room.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - I did not see any thing more of him till the next day. The strange man who brought in the liquor the last time asked me to drink, for he said he had run great hazards to get it, for the cask was on fire as he

               <p>I live at No. 29, Hosier-lane. The prisoner lodged with me seven weeks. I saw the cask of liquor brought in; not by the prisoner, but by the person who had been with him all day and was with him all night and all the next day.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come in with the person? - The prisoner came in about five minutes after I saw him.</p>
               <p>What time of night was that? - I cannot say; soon after Mr. Langdale's house was set on fire; it was the beginning of the evening, about seven o'clock, but the hour I cannot say exactly. I said to Cubbage, this acquaintance of yours has brought in some liquor, I suppose from the fire; and I desired there might be none of that gentleman's property brought into the house, for we should come into trouble; he smiled and went up to his own appartment. There was the man who brought in the liquor, the woman who lives with him, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What was the woman's name? - Cubbage.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay above with his comrades? - He was in and out all night. My husband went to the door, and broke the dining-room windows. The prisoner, d - d his eyes, and said he would fetch the mob, and he swore we were all Romans, and he would have us all down. He went on cursing and swearing in that way all the next day.</p>
               <p>You say he came in five minutes after the man brought the liquor into the house? - Yes. I told him it was brought in and carried up into his room. The man was a countryman and sells eggs. The prisoner, the man, and the woman he lives with, were making a racket in the house all night.</p>
               <p>Did you see the funnel brought in? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says I came in five minutes after the man.</p>
               <p>Sinco. The man sleeps in the garret. The neighbours came backwards and forwards into the house and desired we would let him say what he would, for they were afraid he would have the place burnt down.</p>

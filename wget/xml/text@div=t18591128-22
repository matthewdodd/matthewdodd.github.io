I keep the Shakespeare public-house in Percival-street, Clerkenwell—on Wednesday, 26th October, the prisoner came to my bar about half-past 4 o'clock, with another female—the prisoner asked for a half-quartern of gin—she offered me a counterfeit shilling—I tried it and found that it bent—I told her it was bad; she said she did not know it—she said she had been to Mr. Pierpoint's, and he told her it was bad, and she did not think it was bad, and she came to try it.</p>

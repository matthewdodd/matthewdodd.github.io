               <p>of July I was talking to the prisoner's master—the prisoner was at his stand, opposite the shop—he was chopping a crab, with a knife in his hand—I told him he had taken as false oath before the Magistrate, and he immediately cat me across the arm—I walked down a little way, and saw the blood trickle down my arm—I then went back, struck him in the face, and said, "Take that, I don't want any law of you"—he immediately struck at me with the knife—he did not cut me then.</p>

I believe—the other man was not fined—the prisoner swore before the Magistrate that I was one of the parties—the prisoner only cut me once—here is the scar—(showing hie army—he made an attempt to cut me the second time—my arm was bare—I had no coat on—the prisoner did not bleed when I struck him, that I am aware of—I cannot swear to that—when he struck me again the knife was in his hand—we have hacf scuffles before now—I had not been in the habit of vexing and tormenting him, no more than he has me—we have bad a few words in business, but nothing out of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Jermyn-street. On the 8th of July I was passing through the market, and saw two men quarrelling—they had many words, and the prisoner made a hit at the prosecutor with the knife, and cut him in the arm—he walked away, and seeing the blood ran, came back and struck the prisoner in the mouth—his mouth bled, and in the. irritation of the moment he caught up the knife, and struck at him again, bat somebody interfered, and no harm was done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear any very abusive language from Mr. Bailey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot swear I heard him call the prisoner a perjured old b----r—I heard some very bad language—it was not in the calm manner that he represents, that he said, you have taken a false oath"—the prisoner is a tee-totaller, which causes him to be annoyed in the market—he took out a warrant, and the prosecutor considered himself injured—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ three years, and is a very inoffensive, quiet man, attentive to his business early and late—I had no fault to find with him—he was never disposed to offend any<lb></lb>body—I have known him in the market nine years—I know the prosecutor—? lie came to insult me at first about false swearing—I had not taken an oath at all, but I would not notice him, and he went from me to the prisoner, who was opposite my shop, dressing a crab—the prosecutorwas very much in liquor—I had desired my man to take a warrant out against three of them, for insulting him</p>

               <p>and destroying my goods—it seems the summonses ought to have been sepa<lb></lb>rate ones, but the three were included together, and the Magistrate could only fine one of them—I did not notice what he said to the prisoner—he had his sleeve tucked up, and the prisoner struck his arm—it was a mere scratch—it was not a serious wound—he went away, and in about five minutes came back and struck the prisoner a violent blow on his mouth—the prisoner staggered, and then ran after him with the knife, but I stopped him from doing anything.</p>

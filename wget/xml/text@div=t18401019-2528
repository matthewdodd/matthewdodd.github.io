                  </hi>. I am a clock-maker, and live at No. 2, Goswell-place, Goswell-road, in the parish of St. James's, Clerkenwell—it is my dwelling-house. I employed the prisoner to assist me in moving from No. 17, Wynyatt-street to that house, on Michaelmas-day—in the afternoon I was lying down in the front room second floor, being rather tired, and noticed him come into the room rather gently—I was not asleep, and asked what he wanted—he made no answer—I asked him again—he made no answer—I considered my wife had sent him for something, supposing he was putting the things to rights below—I happened to close my eye——I opened them again in about a minute, and saw him going out of the room—when I laid down between two and three o'clock, I had in my pockets seven sovereigns and four half-crowns—I had left my trowsers on the side of the bed—when I got up between half-past four and five o'clock, I im<lb></lb>mediately saw that my trowsers were not where I had left them, and found my money was gone—nobody had been into the room but the prisoner and my wife—she came about four o'clock, and asked me to come down to tea, and it was before her I examined my pocket—the prisoner was gone when I came down—I afterwards found him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to call my husband to tea about half-past four o'clock—he was lying down, and missed his money from his trowsers which were on the floor—I asked him where the money was—he said in his pocket, but there was none—next morning I found half-a-crown on the floor—there was no carpet down—I had paid the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that morning before his work was over, as he said he had no money, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more for his dinner—he ought to have left the house at two o'clock, as I told him we did not want him any longer, but he lingered about—I saw him pass the window about three o'clock—he said he would call next morning to put the place to rights, as he was tired, but he did not come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed vitualler at 208, Upper Thames-street—on 25th August, the prisoner Logan came to my house; he showed me a card, and asked me if it was mine; I said it was; he then said he had been recommended to me by a friend; I said, "What upon;" he said he had been out of a berth a long time, and he was going to advertise for a situation, and asked me if I would take some of the answers to the advertisements for him; I said I would take a few in for him; he then went away—on the following Tuesday he came again, and brought Gardner with him; he then said he had advertised, and I should have a few letters by the morning—on the following morning I received nearly eighty letters, addressed, 0. P., 208, Upper Thames-street; most of them came by post—I had other people also applying—in consequence of this, I communicated with the police—soon after that the two prisoners came in, and I gave Logan the letters—a great many persons called while they were there; a stranger came in after a berth, and showed me an advertisement and a newspaper; this is the identical one—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards showed it to Logan, and said, "This is not the kind of advertisement that you told me of;" he said, "It is all right, Mr. Groves, this gentleman (meaning the prisoner Gardner) will engage all the persons that come here"—he said that in Gardner's presence, and Gardner said nothing—Logan then left—Gardner remained—while there several per<lb></lb>sons called, and I referred them to him, and he spoke to them; he afterwards went away, and I got all the abuse—the letters kept continually coming in; one came in last Saturday—I have given 70 or 80 letters to the officer; they contained either one, two, three, or four, postage stamps—I received a letter from a person named Emma Schofield; it did not come by post—I also received one from Osborne (<hi rend="italic">the policeman here produced the letter</hi>)—the one that Schofield delivered to me I gave to the prisoner Logan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 411). I received a communication from Mr. Groves on 31st August—on 7th September, about a quarter to 10, I went to the prisoner Logan's lodgings; saw him, and asked him if his name was Logan; he said "Yes"—I asked him if he was the person who repre<lb></lb>sented himself to be O. P. in the advertisement, certifying that he wanted 400 hands; he said, no; it was that man I saw him with the other day—that man was Gardner—I took him into custody—he then said "The fact of it is, that that man has an invention in his head by which the Illustrated London News might be printed at one-third less cost price"—I have a packet of letters here; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Gardner the same afternoon; he had a piece of white paper on his breast, so as to look like the front of a shirt—the whole of these letters contained one or more post<lb></lb>age stamps, some three or four; they are all directed to 0. P., 208, Upper Thames-street—on Logan I found this strip of paper, it is a receipt signed by Logan, "Received from Mr. Groves some letters;" and a corresponding one on Gardner—I also found on Gardner the letter which has been identified by Osborne; I had previously opened it at Groves's, and found stamps, and had marked them; they were not in when I found it on Gardner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Logan—Q.</hi> When you took me in charge, did I not say it was a cruel thing that I should be taken in charge for a thing I was not concerned in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gardner. Q.</hi> When you asked me if my name was Gardner you said you had apprehended Logan; did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and you said words to the effect that if Logan was locked up he was innocent, and he did it to oblige you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Logan's Defence,</hi> I met the prisoner Gardner about the middle of August last, and in the course of conversation I told him I was out of a situation, and had been out some time; he then told me he had an invention of his own,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190050"></xptr>
               <p>and said he was going to advertise for hands, and said he would give me a situation, for which I was very thankful. He asked me, before we parted, if I could get any respectable place where answers could be taken to the advertisement; he said he could not have them received at his lodgings—I said I would try to get a place. I went to a public-house, and asked the landlord, but he said he could not be bothered. While I was speaking to him, a person named Shoot came up to me, and said, "If you go down to Mr. Groves, he would take them," and gave me a card. I went to Mr. Groves, and asked him if he would oblige me; I told him all about the invention, and he agreed to take the answers; I then left. It was somewhere about a week after that, I met with Gardner; it was the day previous to the adver<lb></lb>tisement. I said to Mr. Groves, "This is the person I represented; you will be kind enough to give him the letters." I then went away with Gardner. The following morning I went with him again; ten letters were given to me, and two to Gardner. I then went away, and Gardner came and threatened to summons me for these letters—I said "I went and engaged the man, and I was to be the responsible party." He said he had been to Bow-lane station-house, and I was to go with him to receive the letters, and then I was told that I was to come next day. The next morning I was taken to Guildhall, was sent to trial, and here I am now, committed for putting con<lb></lb>fidence in a man whom I had no reason to doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gardner's Defence.</hi> It is a considerable time ago, since I made a discovery of this invention. I have been assisted by a gentleman with money and other means; he promised further to assist me; he promised me some premises; and up to the Saturday after the advertisement appeared, I expected his assistance, when I received a letter from him, which threw me altogether on my own resources. I determined then, that all the letters I received I would answer, making it compulsory for the persons to find their own references. With that idea I determined to act. The man mentioned in this list offered me security from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if fraud had been my object I could easily have obtained that I might have been rather sanguine, but my object was not fraud. Logan knew nothing at all about what the object was; and probably, having known me long, he might often have heard me talking about it, and consequently he (immediately I told him it was my determination to go on with the discovery) gladly took the situation I offered him. I care little for myself; but I say that Logan had not the least idea that any thing was wrong.</p>

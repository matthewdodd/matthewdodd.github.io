            . I collect advertisements for newspapers. I was taking a pint of beer with a friend, in a public-house, kept by Cuthbert, at the corner of Wych-street, about half-past six o'clock in the evening; four women and two men came in, and used some bad language about some money; the landlord turned them out - the prisoners were some of that party - I never saw the prosecutor till he was at Bow-street; there are two doors to the house - I had not seen them come in.</p>

            . I have been a corn-chandler, but occasionally work as a porter. I was in the Punch Bowl I public-house, Temple-bar; the prosecutor came in and called for a pipe of tobacco, and as the landlord did not hear him, he left his seat; I thought he was gone to the bar; a person in the bar said he was an officer, and asked if he could point out the persons who had robbed him; he said he could; several people went to the back part of the house; there was a noise, and after that I saw the three female prisoners come out through the room I sat in - they had not gone in through that room - there were six or seven others - some came one way, and some another; there are two ways into the room; they appeared to be women of the town; the three women and one man ran out of the room I sat in; I did not see either of them near the prosecutor - there was a partition between us, and I did not see him robbed.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. In consequence of information, about eight o'clock on the night of the robbery, I apprehended Beckworth and Palmer in the Strand, and about nine I took Serino about ten, and Vason the next morning; I found a half sovereign tied in the corner of a handkerchief, which Palmer had on her neck - the others had nothing.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY WRIGHT re-examined. I went to a public-house with the woman I met in the Strand, and had half a pint of porter - it was not either of the prisoners; I waited to pay the waiter for half a pint of beer, and a bottle of ginger beer; the waiter was out; I was sitting on the bench - the woman sat in a box; I had sixteen sovereigns, and was robbed of eight of them in that house; Palmer was one of the persons, who robbed me there - she was tried and acquitted last Session. I went down the Strand in search of the street-keeper, and when I got by the Punch Bowl, a man asked if I had been robbed; he said he was an officer, and if I would walk in there the business should be settled, as he had the party in custody; this was about a quarter to four o'clock; I went in at a door which he introduced me to, and which I opened myself - it drew towards me, with a spring behind it; I opened it; the prisoner Vason was sitting on a bench - he came towards me, and stood at the door while I opened it; I found it was a dark passage, and was about retreating, when I was thrust into the passage by a blow on my back from this supposed officer; I turned to the left; the door was closed on me; my mouth was stopped, and the parties were immediately round me, and took the money out of my pocket; they dropped two sovereigns in the passage - they ran out; I picked up the two sovereigns, and one was left in my pocket; I went to the bar and told the landlady I had been robbed, but no notice was taken of it; I immediately went into the street, and told the street-keeper; he pointed out two officers in the Strand, whom I went to - one looked into the house, and said there were a set of thieves in the parlour then, I had better go in and see if I knew them; he went in with me; the prisoners were not there then - the prisoners who were discharged last Session were taken, and I pointed out Vason in the house as one who had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen any of them before? A. Never; the woman I met in the street was genteelly dressed; she asked me for half a pint of porter; she did not pick me up as a girl of the town - I am a married man; I never saw her before - I had not the slightest notion of her being an improper character; I prosecuted three women last Session for the first robbery, and swore that Palmer held me down while I was robbed; she was acquitted on that charge - I do not swear to her being concerned in this robbery - I knew none of the prisoners before that day.</p>

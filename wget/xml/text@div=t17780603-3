Upon the 8th of March I was in London, and in going to my quarters at night I missed my way; after travelling about an hour or two I met a watchman, and asked him to show me the way; we went into a public house, and had a pennyworth of gin apiece; I pulled out a sixpence to pay for it; the sixpence being a new one; I said I would not change that, but carry it home to my children; I then put my hand into my coat pocket, and pulled out a glove, in which I had seven guineas and an half, and offered half a guinea to change; the publican could not change it; I had a penny; I gave that, and the watchman paid the other penny, and I put my money into my glove, and put it in my coat pocket again. The watchman and I came out, and the prisoner followed us; the watchman took hold of my right arm, and the prisoner took hold of my left, and asked me what countryman I was. I said a Herefordshire man; he said, he came from the same country, and talked very freely to me; just before we got to the watch-house I felt his hand in my pocket, and I felt the glove in his hand as he pulled it out, and he went off immediately; I did not pursue him, because as the other people were all strangers, I did not know, but they might all be concerned. I immediately lost sight of him, and did not know how to pursue him.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. Williams came to me on the 8th of March, between one and two in the morning, and asked me where he could get a lodging. I said, as it was that time of night, I could not tell; he said he had a sum of money about him, and should be glad of a lodging; I told him I would take him to the watch-house, to the constable of the night, where he would be safe; we went into the Horse-shoe, a public house, in <placeName id="t17780603-3-crimeloc10">Benjamin-street</placeName>

               <p>Was Williams drunk or sober? - He was not drunk; he had been drinking but was properly in his senses; I saw him put the money into his pocket again; I don't know what it was.</p>
               <p>Did Williams say any thing to you before he came to the watch-house that he had lost his money? - When we got into the watch-house, I asked him if he had got his money? He said, no; he had lost it in coming-to the watch-house.</p>

Edwards called to him, and asked him if he would come in? He said, no; it was late, he would get home. When they came into the watch-house, they bid him show his money; he felt in his pocket, and said his money was gone; he did not say how he lost it; he only said it was gone; I believe he did not know how he lost it. I don't believe the prosecutor knew who had hold of him by the left arm, till the Monday morning. The prisoner was not mentioned till Monday morning by the prosecutor, not by the watchman. The prisoner asked me as he went out of the public house, which pocket he put his money into. I told him his right hand pocket.</p>

I went with a candle and lanthorn to the Horse-shoe to see if I could find any part of the money, and found a black glove torn to pieces, but the watchman of the night thought it was not the same, because the glove he put his money into was a good one.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Bawsey, in Suffolk. On the 26th of April, I came to town to receive money on my father's account—I received a check for 197<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable at Messrs. Prescott's—this is the check—I had about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket besides—I went on that day, about twelve or one o'clock, to the Yorkshire Stingo beer-house in the Blackfriar's-road—I saw the prisoner in front of the bar—he was attending apparently as master—I had a pint of beer—while I was drinking it, a party challenged the prisoner to play at skittles for a sovereign—they went out to play—after they were gone a little while, the prisoner came and invited me to go down in the yard at the back of the house, to see them play—I went and saw them—the land<lb></lb>lord won the game—I heard him ask the man for the sovereign—the man said he had left it with his wife in the bar—after that the prisoner asked me to play a game or two of skittles for a pint of porter—I played a game or two—I lost every game—I then played with another man and lost—Leary (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 414) was there, but I never saw him play—I played for half-an-hour or three-quarters—before we had finished, several of the men went away—I staid in the skittle-ground—one of them came down and invited me to go up to hear a song—I went up, and after the song, they began to toss for stout and for money—I tossed for stout first, but ultimately for money, with three other men, not the prisoner—when there was a small game I generally won, but when there was a large sum I generally lost—that soon disposed of my 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was then going—the prisoner came in and said, "Do not go, you will win your money back"—I said I had got nothing but a check—he</p>

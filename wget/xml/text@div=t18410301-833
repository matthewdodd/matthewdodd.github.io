                  </hi>. I am the constable on duty in the Post-office. I took the prisoner into custody on the 28th of January at North, Park-lane, at the branch post—office—I told him what I took him for—Mr. Peacock first cautioned him not to say any thing unless he thought proper, and what he said would be used in evidence against him, or in his behalf—he was then asked if Cambridge-terrace was In his delivery—he said, "Yes"—then he was asked whether Bond-street was—he said, "Yet"—and whether he had delivered a letter directed to Gatty and Pearse—he said he had no recollection of one—he was then told that fragments of a letter directed to Gatty and Pearse had been found at his lodgings—he said it was impossible, but if it was, there was some plot against him—I searched him and found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and in the pocket of his great-coat in the office I found 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I then conveyed him to Charles-street, Hampstead, for the purpose of searching his lodgings—on our road Were I asked him whether any letter-carrier had been to his lodgings the day previous—he said "No"—he afterwards said, "Oh yes, there was"—I had some conversation with him on the following day, before he was committed—I went to fetch him out of the lock-up cell at Bow-street—(I had heard he had made some communication)—I went to him, and told him if he said any thing it would be taken down in evidence against him, but if he said any thing I was ready to hear it—after that caution he said the letter directed to Gatty and Pearse contained money—that he put it into his pocket for safety, where he had another letter of his own, and had forgotten to turn his let<lb></lb>ters to remind him that one was taken out, and on going home he bad oc<lb></lb>casion to go into the yard, and took this letter containing the money, di<lb></lb>rected to Gatty and Pearse, and tore it in half, and out fell a half-sove<lb></lb>reign, that he looked after it and could not and it, and he was frightened, and thought of going to Gatty and Peane to explain that he tore it, think<lb></lb>ing it was his own letter, but he was afraid, knowing the rules of the office, and did not do so—I had locked him up about eight or nine o'clock the night before, and this was between eleven and twelve on the following morning—I searched his apartments, and found the fragments of another letter containing four small silver pills with the Dover post-mark, and the ad<lb></lb>dress to some square—I have since ascertained it is Holland-street, St. James's-square—I found it in a small work-box like a female's box—the prisoner has a wife.</p>

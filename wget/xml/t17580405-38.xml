            . I was along with the two prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When ?</p>
               <p>Butcher. I can't say how long it is ago, it may be three quarters of a year ago; we have been in confinement, on the other side the water, between six and seven months, and it was some time before we were in confinement. There were four of us, the two prisoners and Mrs. Ingram, and myself. We went into a shop in the Cloysters; we asked to look at a gown, but did not intend to buy any.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your intention in going in?</p>
               <p>Butcher. We went in in order, if we could have an opportunity to take any thing out of the shop, to take it. This we had agreed upon before, Mrs. Ingram took a scarlet duffil cardinal, and she carried it home into St. Thomas's, on the other side the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners see it taken?</p>
               <p>Butcher. Miller knew it was taken, when we came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Butcher. I pawn'd it for 8 s. in Joyner's-street, in a court. I can't tell the pawnbroker's name; the constable went and got it by my describing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you taken up for this fact?</p>
               <p>Butcher. No, I was taken up on another fact, on the other side the water, and on my confession, the justice sent to the prosecutor, and let him know of it. (The cardinal produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this cardinal, (she looks at it.)</p>
               <p>Butcher. I can't swear to it, it was like this.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicklen. Do you know this cardinal?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. I know it is like our make, but one may be like another. This Butcher said before the justice, she pawn'd it the very day they stole it.</p>

            , this petticoat was lost the 3d of January was twelve-months, and pawned the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be your property?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. It was cut out in a particular manner, we never sell them till they are quilted up. When I was before justice Clark on the 17th of September last, I saw the two prisoners at the bar, and the evidence; she there gave an account of a great many things which she said they had stole, which I believe to be ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the petticoat there?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the goods she said they had stole?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. It was, ( produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say this is your property?</p>
               <p>Nicklen. There may be another like it, we never sell them thus, it must be stole if it went out of our shop in this condition, being unfinished, I will not swear to it.</p>

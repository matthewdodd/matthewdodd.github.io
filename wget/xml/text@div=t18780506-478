                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective H</hi>). On 5th April I went with Thick to 9, Henry Street, Stepney, about 9.30, and found the street door open—I knocked, Read opened it; I asked her if she lived there, she said "Yes"—I asked her if any one else lived there, she said "Yes, two others lives here"—I said "What have you got in the room?"—she said "I don't know, you had better look"—I did look, and in a small cupboard, unlocked, I found this ladle with white metal in it, two files with metal on them, a spoon, a small portion of a mould, which afterwards broke away in my hand, and some plaster-of-paris and sand—all those things are used in making counterfeit coin—I waited till 3 o'clock next morning—Stone came home about 1 o'clock; I knew him by the name of Morris—I was watching outside and followed him in—I asked him if he lived in that room, he said "Yes"—I showed him the things I found in the cupboard, and asked him who they belonged to—he said they did not belong to him—I asked what he had about him—he said "I suppose this is what you want", put his hand in his pocket, and took out seven shillings separately folded in thin paper—I asked him if he had any more about him—he said "No"—I put my hand into his trousers pocket, and among other money found this bad shilling—I said that I believed the shillings were made of the same metal that was in the ladle—I think he said mat he did not know—Read was in the room all the time—I took Stone to the station, leaving Thick in charge of the room and of Read—I afterwards went back to the house, and about 2.30 King knocked at the outside shutters and came in—I said "Good morning, King"—he said "Good morning"—I said "You know me?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Who rents this room?"—he said "I do, I pay the rent," and that he had been there since November—I asked him who those things in the cupboard belonged to—he said "They belong to me"—I said "I have just taken Stone to the station, I found eight bad shillings on him, I believe you have been making them here"—he said "Yes, it is no use telling you, for you know all about it"—I searched him, but found nothing—Read was there all the time, but I don't think she took any part in the conversation—when I knocked at the door I asked her if Mr. Hartley was there, alluding to the prisoner King—I said, "He is a one-armed man;" she said, "Yes"—I asked her if any<lb></lb>body else lived there; she said, "Yes, my husband"—I asked her what her husband's name was; she said, "Morris;" and when Stone came home she said, "That is my husband," and that they had lived there a week—I took King and Read to the station—I locked up the room, and gave the landlady the key, taking the counterfeit coin with me—I went back on Sunday evening about 8.30, got the key from the landlady, and searched the room—we found a crack in the boards six or eight inches wide; I took up some more boards, and found some plaster-of-</p>

               <p>paris, and then the landlady put her hand under the flooring and found this double mould to make two shillings at once—the flooring had been broken previously, but it did not appear recent—there was a piece of cloth over the opening in the floor—I have seen King and Stone together once—Read told me that she was not married to Morris, but only lived with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Henry Street, Stepney—I let my ground-floor front room to Mr. Hartley, the prisoner King—he came in on 7th November—he said that he was a ticket-writer—I did not see Stone till a month or six weeks after that, and I did not see Read till a week before her arrest—I have seen them all three coming backwards and forwards; they had a street-door key and a room-door key, and let themselves in and out—I was not aware of what they were doing, or they should not have stayed there—they always paid me with good money—when they left, the detec<lb></lb>tive locked the door and gave me the key—I gave it to him again on Sunday, and he opened the door—nobody had been in the room in the mean time—I had kept the key in my pocket, and I had bolted the shutters inside while the detectives were in the room—I went into the room with them on Sunday when they found the mould under the floor—there was a small hole in the floor when the room was taken, and I nailed a piece of cloth over it—in the evening I found that the nails had been taken out and the cloth shoved on one side—Hartley sometimes paid the rent, and sometimes Stone—Read never paid me—there was a blind to the window, which was generally down even in the day-time—when the street door was shut they used to knock at the shutter if one of them was inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Dawes, a porter, of 15, Northampton-street—we keep the house—I recollect Mrs. Palethorpe coming there on 1st March—at first she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week rent, and we reduced it to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Tuesday, 25th June, I saw the prisoner in the morning—I saw her every day almost—she was engaged in slop making for a Mr. Lawrence—she had three children—they were always clean and well-fed, and always went to school regularly—on the Tuesday morning I saw her, as near as I can judge, about 9 o'clock, or a little alter—I let her in and spoke to her—she had gone out before that, but I did not see her then—when she returned I said, "Good morning; it is a wet morning"—she answered, and went up stairs, she afterwards went out again, but I did not see her after I let her in—that was a little after 9—somewhere about 5 o'clock, Mrs. Faulkner, a lodger in the front room, came to me—(the prisoner occupied the back room on the same floor as Mrs. Faulkner)—I had some conversation with her and went up stairs—the door was locked inside—I looked through the key-hole and saw the prisoner's gown, that she had on in the morning, hanging over the bedstead, and I could see the handle of the key—I heard Mrs. Faulkner call to the little boy and say, "Is not your mother well?" and the biggest boy came and opened the door—I think he is six years old—I was not able to see whether he came from the bed or not—Mrs. Faulkner went in first</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Northampton-street, King's-cross, in the same house where Mrs. Palethorpe lived—I raw the deceased child last, on the Monday before 25th June—it seemed to be in good health then, running about as usual—I did not see Mrs. Palethorpe on the early part of Tuesday—in consequence of her not making her appearance I suspected something, made a communication to the landlady, and eventually went up stairs to the door of her room—I made some communication to the child inside, in consequence of which the door was opened—I called out to have the door opened, and the child came and opened it—I went to the bed-side and spoke twice, but got no answer—Mrs. Palethorpe was lying with her face in the pillow—I could not see her face—the youngest child was lying next to her, and the little boy, that is now dead, was lying next to the youngest child; his face was deadly pale, with a little piece of red, about the size of a half-penny, on each cheek, and was catching his breath very <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi>—I don't know where the other boy was—he opened the door for me—my husband was in the front room having his tea, and he came in directly—I spoke to the prisoner twice, and asked her if she was not well, but I received no answer—she seemed to me as though she was asleep—a policeman was sent for, and Mr. Sutherin the doctor—the prisoner was recovered to her senses about half-an hour after I saw her, I think—I did not hear her say anything then, I never went into the room again—on the Monday evening before, she came in and spoke to me; I asked her what was the matter with her, as I saw that her eyes looked very red and very swollen from crying—she appeared to me as if she had been crying—she said her troubles were more than she could bear, and she thought she must take the life of herself and her children some time or other—she had frequently said something of that sort before, not in the same words—she was saying she was quite tired of her life, and she thought, take the life of herself and her children, she must—I do not know her handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeon, and reside at Aldenham-terrace, St. Pancras-road—I had seen the prisoner about a fortnight prior to this transaction—I went to her house because her child was ill—I believe that was the child who is the subject of the present inquiry—I prescribed for it then—the prisoner was under the impression that it had the measles, but there was no rash whatever—I saw the child twice on the following day, but there was nothing much the matter with it—I was sent for to see the child on Tuesday evening, 25th June, a little after half-past 6—I found it lying on the bed insensible—there were three others on the bed, the prisoner and two other children—the two other children were sitting up—the younger child was quite drowsy, and nodding its head apparently in a sleepy state, and more or less suffering from some</p>

               <p>narcotic poison; at least, I was under that impression—the three children presented appearances which led me to believe they had had something administered to them—the prisoner was insensible at that time—I had the deceased child taken out of bed and placed on the lap of Mrs. Dawes, or Mrs. Faulkner, I cannot say which—I endeavoured to restore it by stimu<lb></lb>lants, and by slapping it, and the application of cold water, and other means, the usual remedies—the pupils were contracted to a point at the time, and its breathing scarcely perceptible, and the pulse could scarcely be detected at the wrist—I infer from those symptoms that the child was labouring under some narcotic poison—it died on the same evening, about half an hour afterwards—I subsequently made a post mortem examination, and from its appearance then I was confirmed in my opinion—the stomach was secured and sent to Dr. Letheby—in the mean time it was in the custody of another medical man who assisted me at the post mortem, and also at 15, Northampton-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say you had attended this child before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; about a fortnight before the 25th June, the mother came to me for medicine for the child, and seemed exceedingly anxious about it—she seemed to be a very solicitous and affectionate mother—I cannot answer whether the poor people in that neighbourhood are in the habit of using laudanum when their children are affected—I don't know that from my own experience—I have seen children under the influence of laudanum—I know what Dalby's carminative and Godfrey's cordial is—that is used by mothers occasionally to soothe their children and prevent their crying—I do not think it is so much used as it was formerly—they know better—in in my own experience, I have found laudanum operate differently on different children of the same age—some children may take with impunity a very large dose, and another child would be killed with a quarter of it; but it is a dangerous thing—it would depend a great deal upon whether the stomach was empty or full, that would make a great deal of difference—I have known instances of persons using a preparation of laudanum to soothe their children, I mean Godfrey's Cordial—I keep a druggist's shop—I sell laudanum, but not to children for that purpose—grown-up people frequently come and purchase it—it is a popular medicine for coughs, mixed with vinegar—a good deal of laudanum is sold ordinarily to people—the little girl, two years of age, recovered; she vomited—the eldest boy was sitting on the bed when I went in—he was not long in coming to; he had vomited.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. On the 28th June, I received a parcel from Mr. Sutherin, in which was the stomach of a child—I also received the smaller intestines—I examined the contents and found that the stomach and intes<lb></lb>tines were both quite healthy, and in a sound condition as regards their structure; but on analysis they both yielded the constituents of opium, which are found in laudanum—I could not say anything about the quantity—there were no traces of any other poison—I am not able to say anything about the cause of death, without reference to the symptoms and the post mortem appearances; having heard those, I then can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose if a child took a sufficient quantity to kill it, it would probably die of that complaint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that is so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined. Q.</hi> You found no solid food in the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—laudanum varies in its effect on persons according to their constitu<lb></lb>tions and a variety of circumstances—some persons may take it with perfect impunity, and others would sink under it; it depends on various circum<lb></lb>stances—with regard to organic poisons, that which is found in the stomach is over and above the quantity that has killed, if death has arisen from it—therefore, that has no reference to the quantity taken, or that has caused death, because that which has causeddeath is absorbed into the system, and has got out of the stomach into the general circulation, and has passed beyond our reach—morphia is given by medical men in some cases to counteract disease—it requires extreme caution in administering to children anything that has morphia in it, or opiate of any kind—ten or fifteen drops of laudanum would perhaps be sufficient to kill a child of that age, with an empty stomach, prostrated or weakened by want of food—ten drops I should look upon as a fatal quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would it take to absorb that into the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half or three quarters of an hour, upon an empty stomach—if a person took a dose quite insufficient to kill, and died a violent death from some other cause in the course of twenty minutes or half an hour, I could not say positively whether or not you would find traces of it in the stomach or intestines; you might or might not—what I said, was that when you find poison in the stomach, that which you find there has perhaps had nothing to do with the death; but that which has killed has gone out of the stomach into the circulation, and is beyond our reach—that is always the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that the death was caused by laudanum, are in you, from the quantity you found in the stomach, able to form an opinion as to the quantity that was administered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the action of a poison is upon the brain, and it must reach the brain before it produces its effect, and when it gets into the brain we can no longer find it; that, therefore, which is in the stomach is not that which has killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether it kills or not, I suppose at some time or other it gets to the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it is absorbed—absorption may take place in half an hour; that would be the case if a dose were taken insufficient to kill, and a person died from some other cause—it may or may not be all absorbed—that which was aborbed certainly would not be in the stomach; if there was any not absorbed, that would be found in the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wallace, a hatter, and live in Chapel-street, Edgeware-road, Paddington. The prisoner was in my service a fortnight—she was destitute of a home, and asked me if I would take her—I said I did not want a servant at present, but I would give her a home till she got a place—she left me on Thursday, the 9th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, about five or six o'clock in the evening—I did not see any thing of her till the Tuesday following—three or four hours before she left I gave her a bundle of dirty linen to put in the clothes box—about eight or nine in the evening I missed the bundle from the clothes box—it contained a pair of white stockings, a white petticoat, a flannel petticoat, a lace collar, and a dirty apron—they were all in one bundle—I missed a pair of black kid gloves from my drawer—I had that day put them there—I found her on the Tuesday following at her lodgings in Marylebone-lane, and asked her if she had got any property belonging to me—she said, "No"—I gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a policeman, and am searcher at the station. On the 14th of December I searched the prisoner—I found a flannel petticoat, a white petticoat, a pair of stockings, and some bits of trimmings on her—she was wearing them all—she had two pairs of stockings on—one pair Mrs. Wallace identified—they were under her other stockings—the prisoner said she did not care what became of her, as she had a father and mother-in-law who would not do any thing for her—she had her own petticoat on and the other two, and her own petticoat was made of an old gown.</p>

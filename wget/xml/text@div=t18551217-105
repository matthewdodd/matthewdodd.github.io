                  </hi>. I am a laborer, and live at West Drayton. On Sa<lb></lb>turday evening, 1st Dec., I was with the prisoner, walking along the road from my lodging at Drayton—we met Patrick Welch—we are all Irishmen—Welch came across and asked Bennett what was he laying to his charge—Bennett said he was not saying anything at all to him, he was only excusing himself—Welch said that he had been saying that he had slept with a. girl, and he had no right to say such a thing—I knew what girl he meant—Welch said that Bennett was no <hi rend="italic">stake</hi> for him, or he would give him a good thrashing—I told Welch to leave him alone—they had a few words, and then Welch struck him, and <hi rend="italic">felled</hi> him—it was dark—they were going on for a little bit, and I put out my hand to separate them, and got my hand out—I did not see the knife—on being wounded, I ran home to my lodging—it was Welch that began the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laborer, at West Drayton. I met Mahoney and Bennett on this Saturday night—I said to Bennett, "What is it that you have been laying to my charge?"—be said, "Nothing"—I said "Yes, You have, you are only a boy or else I would have it out of you"—he said, "Perhaps it would not thrive with you"—meaning, perhaps, I should come off the worst, and I did—I Said, "You are the first that ever called me a blackguard"—he said, "Well, d—n it, did not you sleep with a girl then?"—I took up my hand and struck him, and then Mahoney made in to catch hold of Bennett, and directly he did so, away he ran as fast as he could—I did not know what was the matter with him—he was scarcely gone a minute when I found that I was bleeding in the belly, and the blood was running down my trousers and shirt—I said, "I think you have got a knife, because I am cut somewhere all through"—I caught hold of him firmly, and kept his arm from working as well as I could, and took him across the road, to Mahoney's lodging, and while I was kicking at the door for some one to come to my assistance, he kept working away again, and out me in two or three places in the head, the left arm, and the back—I did not see or feel the knife, but I found afterwards that I was cut—I took him into the house, and said to Kyle, the landlord. "Take this fellow"—I went up<lb></lb>stairs with a candle, and examined myself, and found I was wounded, and directly went to a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of West Dray ton. Welch was brought to my surgery on 1st Dec., and I found a scalp wound behind Ms left ear another on his back, on the left side of the spine, a deep wound, and one on the left side of the abdomen, producing the rupture of an artery, but which I believe had not entered the abdomen; they were all bleeding, the latter one excessively, which was the most dangerous, from external and internal hemorrhage—I attended him till the day before yesterday—I think a pen knife would produce the wounds—he was in danger from the hemorrhage.</p>

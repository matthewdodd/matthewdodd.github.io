On the 5th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, at the corner of Great Russell-street, Tottenham-court-road; I was sober; she asked if I would take a walk with her - I made no reply for some time, but I went with her to <placeName id="t18250113-67-crimeloc345">No. 10, Jones-court, Bainbridge-street, St. Giles</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you a wife? A. No. I have been in London three years; but I swear I did not know her to be a woman of the town - I had been taking a pot or two of porter, in the course of the day - I had dined at a friend's house in Bishopsgate-street, and drank about two pots of half-and-half - I had not more than three or four pots of beer and half-and-half - I had been a little in liquor, but was perfectly able to do any business - I met the prisoner, and another with her, in Tottenham-court-road; they both went to the house with me - there were no other women in the house; the prisoner got a light - I bolted the door, because I did not like the appearance of the place - the prisoner might have got out of bed, and gone away, and another person have come in and robbed me - I did not awake till five, or half-past - I saw the prisoner's sisters at Marlborough-street Office, and have seen her mother; I did not follow her sisters, and tell them, if they could not raise 8 l. I would prosecute the prisoner - I did not say to Mrs. Hart, that unless she could get money, I would come forward, nor to Mrs. Kirby, nor to any other person; that I swear positively - I went with her mother to have a pint of porter, while we were waiting till the trial came on; her mother and sisters seemed to feel much for me, and said, they would make every effort to find where the things were pawned; I called on her mother the Monday after, but I did not tell her 8 l. must be raised, and if I could get that, I would take care the girl should not be convicted.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Paddington-street, Lisson-green. I produce a silver watch, which I received on the 6th of December; I was present, but did not take it in; it was offered in pledge by two girls, and the prisoner was one; I do not know which of them offered it; my servant lent 1 l. 0 s. 2 d. on it, it was pawned in the name of Mary Peters, 32, Mitchell-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I should not have recollected the date, had it not been for the duplicate. I recollect seeing the girls come to the house on Monday the 6th, and pawning a watch, but I could not tell it was this watch, but for the duplicate. When I saw the prisoner at Marlborough-street she had the same bonnet and dress as when she came to my house. I could not swear to her being the person.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. I saw the prosecutor a fortnight ago yesterday; he came to my lodgings, and said if I would make it up he would not appear. I said what would it be? He said 8 l., and he would move his lodgings, as he was a single man, and it was immaterial where he lodged. I told him we had considered, and did not intend to give any money. He rose up and said he would prosecute the girl, and take up two more. I cannot tell how he came to find my lodgings. I had seen him on the day the prisoner was committed, before she was committed, and told him I should wish to make it up if I could, rather than have her prosecuted. He said he was agreeable to make it up, but would not give me any satisfaction, till she was committed to Newgate, and I thought then I had no right to interfere; but I had made the proposal, in the first instance - I did not tell him where I lived.</p>

            . I am landlady of No. 1, Mary-place, Duke-street, St. Pancras. Martha Pound lives with me. I remember Hussey coming to Mrs. Pound, a fortnight ago - I did not hear what he said to her.</p>
               <p>- HART. I am the prisoner's sister. The first time I saw Hussey was at Marlborough-street; and after that he ran after me and my sister in Piccadilly; he said if we would meet him on Tuesday, 8 l. would make it up. We were then sitting on the Brentford coach - we had not proposed to make it up. He said he could vary his story more here than at Marlborough-street. When we were at Marlborough-street, we went to a public-house, and the officer wished us not to speak to Hussey; it was at the public-house that he said he could not swear to the robbery; and if we would give him some money he would make it up - that was after the second examination. The officer came there, and Hussey said the officer was afraid he should not get a higher situation, and therefore he would not leave him with us. I did not hear my mother make a proposal to him to make it up. I had heard my sister say she lived in Crown-street; I live at Kew - my husband is one of the King's gardeners.</p>

            . I live at Kew. My husband is a painter. I was on the Brentford coach when Hussey came up and said, if 8 l. were produced he would make it up; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130026"></xptr>was after the prisoner was committed; I was at the police office with my mother and sister - Hussey then said he would make it up for money - that it was of no consequence to him; he was single, and it was no consequence to him where he worked - he could get a place in the country, and if I would make up 8 l. he would take it and say no more about it. He said,</p>
               <p>"When you come before the Grand Jury it is quite different to this place; I will vary it there." He said, over and over again, that he could not swear to the robbery - three times in two or three minutes - the first time we met at Marlborough-street - my mother made no offer to him till he proposed it to her - as far as I can recollect she was not the first person who proposed to make it up - I will not swear that she was not.</p>
               <p>HUSSEY re-examined. Q. Did you ever propose to either of these persons to make it up for 8 l.? A. No; I never said any thing of the kind.</p>

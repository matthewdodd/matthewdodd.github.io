I do: in the beginning of the summer I left town for Chester; I left the prisoner Brown in an anxious care of my house, and that upon a recommendation of her character for sobriety and honesty. On the 28th of October I returned from Chester, I searched my iron chest, where I had deposited bank notes; it also contained from twenty to thirty dollars and crown pieces, and three or four pieces of ancient gold coin. I found the pieces of gold coin taken out of the bag. I then soon after received from the police office this key, it unlocked the drawer. I have nothing to do but to identify the property.</p>

               <p>Court. Then I cannot receive it. - Gentlemen, if a person gives their evidence against themselves, with an impression that it will be of service to them, whether it is from hope of escaping of justice, or fear of punishment, it cannot be received in evidence, because it is impossible to say how far an innocent person may accuse himself; therefore whether a confession is obtained through hope of favour, that you shall not be prosecuted, this must operate on the mind, whether they shall or not be exposed; or if it is done under terror - I will take you up unless you confess this - this is exactly the same as hope; on the other hand, it is clear that this cannot be voluntary; the confession may be evidence against herself; I cannot admit that as evidence against any body else. - The counsel for the prosecution is against the other woman and the man; there is no evidence against the principal, but what was obtained through hope or fear; then if there is no evidence against the principal, there can be none against the accessories. - They might be indicted for a misdemeanoras aiding and assisting the person that committed the felony.</p>

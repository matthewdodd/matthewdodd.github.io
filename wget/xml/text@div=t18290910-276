            . On the 28th of July, I took hold of Wood, a little before three o'clock, having suspicion that he was picking pockets - I did not see him do any thing, but I had seen him for about an hour in company with the other two, passing up and down Ludgate-hill; I saw the prosecutor's handkerchief on the ground, just before he was aware he had lost it; I did not see it fall, but it was nearest to White - Wood was close to him, and Wells within one yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there many other persons there? A. Yes; I did not see Wells do any thing - they were altogether; I had before seen White attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket, and at that time Wells was about a yard and a half from him; I am a solicitor - I do not usually walk about the street; I had not seen Wells till within that hour, but I can swear he was one of them.</p>

            . I am a carrier. I saw the prisoners together by the Old Jewry - they walked towards the Mansion-house; I saw White take the handkerchief from this gentleman's pocket; I got out of my cart, and caught hold of him - he threw the handkerchief down; the other two were within a few yards of him - Wood was within a yard and a half of him, and Wells within four or five yards - Mr. Jeffries took hold of Wood - he then went into the Poultry, and took Wells.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were passing? A. Several; White was not twenty yards from the other two - there might be six or seven people between them when I saw White on one side of the road; Wells and Wood ran across to try to draw him away by whistling and beckoning, but he would not come - White was then following the prosecutor, but the robbery had not then been committed.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to MR. JEFFRIES. Q. What time did you see them on Ludgate-hill? A. About two o'clock - I looked at St. Paul's clock; I think it was not past two - it could not be more than half-past two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to you that they were within a yard and a half of White? A. It appeared so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner White. Q. Was there not a boy with me who told you where the handkerchief laid? A. No; I did not pick it up - there might be two persons between Wood and the boy.</p>

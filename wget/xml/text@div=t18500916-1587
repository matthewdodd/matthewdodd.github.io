                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On 31st Aug., I was at the George Inn, Uxbridge—the prisoners came in separately—I had not known them before—Britton came in with some cards—he put three cards down on the table, and said he would bet a penny-worth of nuts to a halfpenny-worth, that I did not find the card he named—I betted with him, and found the card he named—he put them down again, and I again found the card he named—that was for a halfpenny-worth of nuts against a penny-worth—I won that three times—he then put down the cards again, and betted me sixpence that I did not find the card he named—I betted, and lost the sixpence—he put them down again, and betted a shilling; I lost that—he then put them down again, and Thompson said he could find the card he named—I betted him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he did not—Thompson said it was the middle card—he then got up from the table, and Britton took the middle card out, and put it outside, and put the outside one in the middle—Thompson then took up the card, and said he had won it—Thompson took up the money which I had placed down, and then went away—Britton went out a little time afterwards—I went out in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, and informed the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> I made the bet, and won the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Britton. Q.</hi> Did you not say you would bet Thompson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the cards were changed after I put the money down, and after the card was named.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the tap-room that night—Thompson came in first, and then Britton—Britton put his basket of nuts down on the table, and said he would bet a penny-worth of nuts against a halfpenny-worth—Winch betted with him, and won three times—he then betted 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and lost that, and then 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lost that—Britton then betted Thompson a sovereign on the ace of hearts—Thompson said the middle card was it—Winch betted him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he did not find it, and Britton then shifted the cards, and put the middle one to the side—he gave the money to Thompson, who walked off—I said, "You two are mates"—Britton said, "If you find me and him together, you may cut my head off with that scythe"—the sovereign Thompson put down looked very dim—I went into another public-house about half an hour afterwards, and the prisoners were there together, playing the same game.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 11). On 31st Aug. I went to the Queen's Head, and saw the prisoners sitting at the table together, with three cards on the table—I took them—I found six sixpences and an iron ball on Thompson, and he threw a counterfeit coin under the grate—I found on Britton two dice and a tee-totum—in going to the station, Thompson asked me several times to allow him to give the money back, for if he went to the station he knew he should get three months—at the station, we, with great difficulty, took four shillings out of his mouth, which made 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what month it was in - A. No; it is more than four months ago since I was robbed of it; the pocket book was in my pocket, I had my pockets on. The prisoner came in my house about eleven o'clock that morning, he asked for

               <p>Q. Where were your pockets at this time - A. Tied about my person on my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your pocket book before he went away - A. No, nor for a long while after. I took my pocket book to get change; I am not certain whether I put it in my pocket, or left it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of your room while the prisoner was there - A. I went backwards; I was not more than ten minutes gone; the prisoner stopped in the room alone till I returned; then in about twenty minutes he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that a stranger of this sort should stay with you all that time - A. He talked about something, I did not think he came to do any harm; I often had seen him and sold him wood when I kept a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the prisoner was gone out was it that you missed the pocket book - A. About an hour after I missed it, and I went after him; I did not see him till about eight o'clock the next morning; I asked him whether he had my pocket book, as there was nobody else in the way; I told him I knew he took it; he called me a fool, and said he did not take it away. I have never seen my pocket book from that time to this, nor my money nor my earrings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the business that led you out of doors - A. I went backwards in the yard; I went and looked in the privy myself; I could see the soil, there was no such thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near enough to you when you were chatting together to take it out of your pocket - A. I do not think he was; he was of one side of the way and I of the other.</p>

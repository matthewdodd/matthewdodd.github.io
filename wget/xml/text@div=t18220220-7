On the 9th of February, this cheese was in front of the bar, the prisoner had called for a pint of beer - I saw him leave the house, my daughter called out that he had taken the cheese; we both pursued him, he went up a court, where my daughter took him with it. I went to her assistance, it was a whole cheese. He had paid for his beer - there was a man with him.</p>

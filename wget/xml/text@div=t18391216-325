At a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, on the 3rd of December, I was in Gray's Inn-lane, and saw the prisoner going along with a bundle under his arm, and a jacket thrown loosely over his shoulder—I went a hundred yards after him, and a piece of fat fell from the bundle under his arm—he went on, and some more fat fell from it—I let him go on to Frederick-street, and there I stopped him—I asked him what he had got—he said meat—I said it was a curious way to carry meat, and I would like to see it—I found it was</p>

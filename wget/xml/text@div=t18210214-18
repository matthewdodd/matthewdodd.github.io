On the 23d of January I was coming down from the dining-room to the pantry, on the area floor, between one and two o'clock in the day, and as I crossed the passage, I saw a man going out of the door into the area with a large bag on his back - when he saw me he dropped it on the threshold of the door, and ran up the area steps; I pursued him, and in running up the area steps I lost sight of him for a moment; I then saw him running towards Bedford-street, nobody else was within sight. I collared him and asked what he was going to do with the things? he said</p>
               <p>"What things? don't say I want to steal your things, I have not been down your area, go to No. 27, where I work and enquire my character." I said come with me and answer the charge; he resisted and struck me. I brought him back and took him into the house. I had a full view of his dress and person, and had he been longer out of sight I could have recognized him; I am perfectly certain of him. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment - they were in the bag before he took it - it was laying on a table in the passage, two yards from the door, ready to be taken in the country to wash; they are worth between 15 l. and 20 l. I am confident he is the man.</p>

I was going home, and on turning the square, I stopped to tie up my stocking; the gentleman caught hold of my shoulder, and said I had been in the house and removed the linen upwards of two yards. I said I had not; he took me back. I know nothing of it whatever.</p>

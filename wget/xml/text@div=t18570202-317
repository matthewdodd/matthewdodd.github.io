                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor, and am a sailmaker, of No. 11, Dudley Terrace, Limehouse. I was the defendant in the action of Ridaer v. Salisbury—I was served with a copy of a writ of summons on 6th Nov.; I believe I instructed my attorney to make an appearance for me—I appeared at the police court on 13th Nov., in reference to an assault which was said to have been committed on the 8th—I saw Mary Ann Ridaer there; the defendant was not there—a man named Hitching appeared, who had the summons out against me—I was arrested by Strong, a Sheriff's officer, and taken to Mr. Sloman's, another Sheriff's officer, and kept there about a week—I went eventually to Whitecross-street, and came out, I think, on 6th or 7th Dec.—there is a public house called the Blue Posts, next door to where I carry on business; I do not reside there, I usually get to business about 9 o'clock—I was not at the Blue Posts on 12th Nov., nor in the parlour of that house, nor did I there see John Salisbury, my father—I did not go in and begin to converse with him on the subject of an assault case which was to be heard at the Thames Police office next day—I did not say to him, "They will appear against me to-morrow, but never mind, if I only once get out; I will be off, I will not give them one rap, none of them"—I never made use of those, or of any other words, intimating my intention to leave the country—I never had such a conversation with my father—I was at Woodford on 12th Nov., with my wife; we started between 10 and 12 o'clock in my cart, and got there between 12 and 1 o'clock, I suppose—I saw Robert Francis there, we dined with his wife, and I believe he came in dur-ing dinner—we had tea there, and left about 7 o'clock, and got home about 9 o'clock—I paid Francis two half sovereigns for clipping a horse.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you there with your son on the 10th or 11th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of being there on the 10th or 11th, but on the 12th I was not there with my son—I may have been there on the 11th, but I believe I was not—I remember the assault case in which my son was summoned—I had no conversation with him at the Blue Posts in reference to the assault case; I will swear that—it may have come on the day before or the day after this arrest, I do not carry an almanack—I have not had some talk with my son about it anywhere; I left it entirely to himself, and I was there to pay the money, but I had no talk with him about it, because I knew very well he would be fined—I paid the money; it was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I really cannot tell you when it was, but if I had known you were going to ask me</p>

               <p>I would have brought my memorandum book—I mean to say that when I went up to the police court, knowing that my son would be fined, I had no conversation with him—I was present at the time of the assault—I do not believe my son, during the last four years, has sat with me in the Blue Posts two minutes—we have stood at the bar there with one of our customers, but nothing more—I was not with my son in the Blue Posts in Nov. last, to my knowledge; I may have been, but I cannot remember it—I have no recollection of being in the Blue Posts with my son relative to this question—I cannot tell you whether we were there a short time before the assault came on for hearing—I believe I never said a word to my son relative to the assault after it was committed, nor did he say anything to me about it—we did not go up to the police court together; of course, we met there—T cannot tell you how I knew at what time the assault case was to come on for hearing—I saw the assault committed—I first learned that my son was summoned to the police court when a summons was left at my office—I learned it from no one but the paper—I did not speak a word to my son about it—I said, "There is the summons; attend to it"—I did not tell him I would go and pay the money; he did not know I was going to pay it—he had not the money to pay it himself) and he did not know I was going there—I did not tell him that I knew he would be fined, but I told him afterwards that it was a shame he was fined—I never heard my son say that he would not pay Mrs. Ridaer's claim, or anything of the kind; I did not know she was making a claim against him—I knew all about her making a disturbance, because she is a common disturber—I never knew that she made any claim for payment from my son; I never heard from him that she did—I cannot tell you when the disturbance was; I do not keep such things in my memory—it was about a fortnight or three weeks before this matter of the assault that the disturbance was raised by Mrs. Ridaer—I never inquired what the disturbance was about; I never give myself trouble about business which does not concern me—I do not know at this moment what Mrs. Ridaer came about—I think she was present at the time of the assault—I was present too—not a word was said in my hearing about a claim of Mrs. Ridaer—I know that she has arrested him, and put him into prison for twenty-one days—I do not know that she has any claim against him, and he has never told me so, or anything at all about her, because I will not listen to him—he has not offered to tell me when I have refused—he has never expressed his intention of not paying her claim.</p>

SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about paying money for the assault; I believe it was not till three weeks after it first happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight or three weeks; it was after my son came out of prison—he was unable to appear to the assault, in consequence of being in prison, and it was adjourned for a week—I was at the first hearing of the assault; it was adjourned for a week—my son was in prison on the day of the adjournment, and it was adjourned till he came out—on his coming out, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; was paid—I had no conversation with my son about it during the three weeks he was in prison—I only flaw him on the 12th, early in the morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I did not see him again that day.</p>

I went to Woodford with him on 12th Nov.—we started between 10 and 12 o'clock, and returned about 9 o'clock in the evening—my husband was at Woodford with me during the whole of that time—it is true that he had agreed to take a new house in that neighbourhood at that time, and we are living in it now.</p>

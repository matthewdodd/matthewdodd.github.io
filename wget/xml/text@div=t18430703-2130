                  </hi>. I am mistress of the National School at Hillingdon—I live in a house near the school. I had these articles in my bed-room in a tin box on the dressing-table—my cuffs were in a work-box—I saw the cuffs safe on Saturday evening, the 24th, and the other things I had not noticed for a month before—on Tuesday morning, the 27th, I missed them all—I also missed a book-marker—I afterwards saw these things produced by the officer—they were what I had lost—these are them—the prisoner was a pupil in the school, and was at the school on the Sunday, the 25th of June, in the morning—any of the pupils could go into my room, but they should not—I mentioned in the school on the Wednesday that I had missed these things,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Jonathan Wild—he is a black, smith at Hillingdon—I go to the National school, and so does the prisoner—I remember the governess saying on the Wednesday morning that she had lost these things—on Monday night, the 26th, the prisoner called me into a field, when we left school—she showed me the ring and the cuffs, the box of beads and the necklace—she said her aunt had sent them to her—I am sure these are the same things, because I took notice of them—she told me not to tell anybody—she then put the things into her bag—she said she would bring a brooch the next morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant T</hi> 6.) I went to search the house of Thomas Jenkins, at Hillingdon, he is the prisoner's father. I saw the prisoner and her mother there—I said I had a warrant to search for a ring, some cuffs, and a brooch, supposed to be stolen by her daughter—her mother then went up stairs—I followed her—she took from a drawer these cuffs and some other things, and said they had been brought by her daughter, who said she had found them—I asked about some other things—she said she knew nothing of them, and the prisoner said the same—I asked the prisoner for her school-bag, which she gave me from a shelf—I found in it this necklace, book-marker, this other cuff, and this small box of beads—I searched and found the locket in a small box of her sister's rolled up in a shift—I took the prisoner to the station—she said on the way she hoped they would not send her to prison, as she had been to several schools before, and never took anything.</p>

In the month of September last, I made an observation, the prisoner's coat was hanging on a peg in the work-shop, and while he was receiving his earnings, I put my hand into his coat pocket; I saw two skins of leather; the prisoner came back into the room; I told the prisoner what I had observed; he went down stairs again; I followed him. The prisoner returned up again; he took down his coat, and he look confused; he afterwards took the coat upon his arm, went down stairs with it, and laid it on the counter, in the back warehouse, and went into the yard; in the mean time Mr. Ticknell, the other workman, came and asked whether that was his coat; the prisoner said, it was. Mr. Ticknell put his hand in the pocket, and took out the other skin.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first taken out - A. I followed him up stairs the first time; he went then to his coat, took out a skin, and throwed it down. I told the prisoner he need not have done that, I knew it was there. He said, that was more than I could prove. I told him I had been a long time suspicious of him; I had then detected him. The prisoner said, good God, it is the first time; he then said, blast me, and rubbed his hands; he said, he did not think I would have served him so. I told him I had only done my duty, and Mr. West was made acquainted of it by Mr. Ticknell. He then said, by God, I am ruined; he then took his coat, and went down stairs, and at that time Ticknell went to the prisoner, and asked if that coat was his; he said, yes, it was. Ticknell then took the other skin out of his pocket. Mr. West then said to the prisoner, this is the way you have been robbing me; he said, it was the first time. He dropped upon his knees, and asked Mr. West's pardon.</p>
               <p>MR. TICKNELL. I am in the service of Mr. West. Mr. Smith gave me some information respecting the prisoner, Garrard; I saw the prisoner's coat upon the counter; I asked the prisoner if it was his coat; he said, it was. I found one of these skins in his coat pocket; Mr. West was present; he said, this is the way you have been robbing me. Garrard fell on knees begged for mercy, and said it was the first time; he said, he had taken it to bind some books for himself. It was near eight o'clock at night, when I found the skin in his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

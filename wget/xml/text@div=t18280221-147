I went out between five and six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of January, and left my spoons safe on the sideboard in the front parlour; I returned at twenty minutes before six o'clock, and met the prisoner coming from the parlour; I heard some noise, went to the side-board, and missed the spoons; I went out, but could not see him- I went over to his mother.</p>

The prisoner came to our house that evening, took a chair, and sat down by the fire, in the room where the spoons were - I did not see him take anything, but I went to open the door for my mother; I saw them just before - he said he came to see if his mother had been there; he got up, and went away just as my mother came in.</p>

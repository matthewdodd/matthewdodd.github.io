I occupy a room there; the prisoner's father sleeps in the same room as I do. On the 8th of November I had eight sovereigns, a half sovereign, and two crown pieces, in a little leather bag, locked up in a trunk in my bed-room. I looked into my pocket for the key, about the beginning of November, but could not find it. I had seen my money safe on the Sunday before. I had the box broken open on the Wednesday following, when I found that eight sovereigns, a half sovereign, and two crowns were gone; a 5l. note, and some silver, were left. The officer afterwards shewed me the key of my box; the prisoner had an opportunity of going into the room when he liked; I have often seen him in the room; he sometimes made his father's bed - the door was never locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it in the morning that you missed your key? A. No, between two and three o'clock, when I put on a clean shirt and clean waistcoat, on a Sunday - I had seen the money safe on the Sunday before I missed the key - there had been 30s. in silver in it. The first key the officer shewed me was not mine, but it would open my box - the second he shewed me was mine; seven men worked at the stables, and any body who worked in the yard, could go into the room.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the 25th of November. I have a bent key which Mr. Ham gave me - I tried it to the prosecutor's box, and it opened it very easily. The prisoner lived at Mr. Hall's, in Gray's-inn-lane-road; I searched different things there, and found this other key in a case which the prisoner said was his; I tried it to the prosecutor's box, and it opened it more easily than the other - I showed both to the prosecutor, and he identified the key found in the case as his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first go to the prisoner's lodgings? A. On the 25th of November I told him I came to search, on a suspicion of felony - he said this was his case, and I went there again on the 28th; I saw the same key again; I saw two persons and a child there - I do not know whether there were any other lodgers - it was a common lock. I had taken away the prisoner on the 25th; he was not at liberty afterwards.</p>

            , who lives in Upper-north-place, Gray's-inn-lane-road - he is a pork butcher. I have a boy four years of age, and a girl of fourteen; the prisoner lodged in my kitchen and slept there; I have seen this case in his room - it is his; this bent key is the key of my kitchen cupboard door, in which I keep some dishes - no one goes into the kitchen but I, my husband, and the prisoner; I had missed this key twice before the 31st of October - it was taken away, and filed, and I had a difficulty in unlocking the door with it; I missed it again on the 1st of November, again on the 7th, and again on the 11th. On the 7th of November I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, and on the 11th he paid me two crown pieces, between ten and eleven o'clock at night - he appeared, about that time, to be flush of money, and had bought clothes and rings, and two very fine seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he pay you your rent regularly? A. Yes, about every three weeks or a month; I cannot tell when I missed the key first; I have a gentleman who sleeps in the top room - the prisoner's father frequently came to see him.</p>

            . I keep the livery stables; the prosecutor slept in a room in my yard - I have seen the prisoner in that room, and in my house, many times; I do not know whether he ever makes his father's bed - he goes there when he pleases - he slept there formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a fence round your yard? A. Yes, there are stables and coach houses, all round, and a gate which shuts up; you cannot go from the stable into the street without coming into the yard - it is some time since the prisoner was in service as a groom.</p>

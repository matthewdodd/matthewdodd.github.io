                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at Upper Holloway—on Tuesday, 4th November, I was near Manor-place—I saw a dog-cart coming from Highgate towards London—as it neared Manor-place I saw Mr. Hammond, the deceased, going to cross the road—there was a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> in the middle of the road, and the dog-cart was on his right side—he escaped the <hi rend="italic">bus;</hi> if he had stepped back, he must have been run over by the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, so he tried to get past both the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and the cart, and he could not—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was coming from Highgate, in the same direction as the cart—the deceased was on the right-hand side of the road as you go from Highgate to London, and he had to cross—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was nearest to him—the dog-cart and the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> were close together—he escaped the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and when he saw the dog-cart he tried to step back, and the shaft of the dog-cart knocked him down—I was on the left-hand side coming from Highgate to London; the side to which the deceased was coming—the cart was nearest to me—when the deceased was knocked down the wheels of the cart did not touch him at all; he went between the wheels—it was a two-wheeled cart—the horse went over him</p>

I am in the employment of Mrs. Raikes, a draper, at 2, Manor-place, Upper Holloway—on Tuesday evening 4th November, about a quarter-past 9, I was standing at the shop door—that is on the left-hand side as you come from Highgate—I saw a dog-cart pass—I saw the deceased attempt to cross the road; about twenty yards from our door towards Highgate—the dog-cart was then about thirty yards from him—it was being driven at the rate of about ten miles an hour, as near as I can say—the deceased had got nearly into the middle of the road when the dog-cart got up to him—some one from the cart called out, and the deceased was im<lb></lb>mediately knocked down by the horse—there were two persons in the dog-cart; I could not tell which of them called out—the cart stopped afterwards, and the deceased was taken to the doctor's—the prisoner was the driver of the cart—he was intoxicated.</p>

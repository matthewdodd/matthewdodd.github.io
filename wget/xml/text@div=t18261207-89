The prisoner was two years in my service - I suspected him, and in the week this happened, he had the whole charge of my business, as I was ill. On the 11th of November I found a box in my back premises, in a small room which was not occupied; and in the box I found four loaves and a half - I fetched Gibbs the officer, who took off the prisoner's hat, and found a 2lb. loaf in it; and in his pocket, half a loaf - he was not going out to sell bread.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you not allow him bread? A. He is allowed him to eat what he wants, and generally when he goes home I give him a loaf; two of the loaves in the box had been made the day before- I have other workmen; but the key of the box was in the prisoner's pocket; I had given him no bread the day before.</p>

            . I am an officer, I went to Westley's; the prisoner came in; I found this loaf in his hat, with a handkerchief over it, and half a loaf in his pocket - Westley fetched the box; the prisoner gave me the key, and I found four loaves and a half there - I went to his lodging and found 15lbs. of flour in a bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did he say? A. He said he would give up his week's wages to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no intention of defrauding my master; he allowed me a 2lb. loaf a day, which was not sufficient - the flour was not his - I had bought it, and paid for it.</p>

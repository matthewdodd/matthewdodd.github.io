            . I am a poulterer, and live in Shoreditch. On the 6th of February I bought the ducks of the prisoner, and put them out at my shop for sale. I gave him six shillings for them, about six o'clcok in the evening, he had asked me in the afternoon, if I would buy any ducks, and I told him I would look at them. I knew him before, he lived near Hackney. He told me he had bred them; the next day the prosecutor claimed them. Armstrong was passing at the time, and he went with me and apprehended the prisoner, at his lodgings, behind the prosecutor's house; he said he took them through distress.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Sunday, the 22nd of November, in Palace-street - I got these three pairs of stockings from a female, named Margaret Shields, at No. 4, Edward-court; she was bound over, but has not appeared - the prisoner at first denied it, but in going to the office he asked what I thought he had better do; I said it was not my duty to advise him - he then said he thought he had better tell me the truth, and took me to a place where he said he had sold the shoes, but the man had sold them again; he said he had sold the trousers in Fleet-market.</p>

            . I slept in the same room with the prisoner and the prosecutor - the landlady asked me to go and see if the prisoner had given a right reference; I went, and he was not known there - I went to another house the next morning; he came in, and was taken.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Lime street ward. On the 18th of January, about a quarter past six in the evening, I saw the prisoner pass me with a carcase of mutton on his shoulder; I turned round and asked him where he got that sheep from, I collared him, and stopped him two or three doors down St. Mary Axe; he told me he brought the carcase from Mr. King in Leadenhall market. Mr. King is a carcase butcher and salesman both, I believe; I took him back into Leadenhall market; Mr. King's shop was shut up, there was no sheep out nor nobody killing; I then took him to the watchhouse; I thought it was stolen, because he throwed it down coming down Lime street; I got a young man to take it up and to assist me; when he threw it down he begged I would not hurt him; I put him in the Compter; I kept the sheep at the watchhouse till the next day; I produced it before the lord mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose sheep was it - A. Mrs. Cork's; it was killed on the Tuesday and left on the Wednesday's market, not sold; I had seen it on the Wednesday many times; I last saw it about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the sheep that you saw before the alderman was the same sheep that you slaughtered - A. Yes; we put our mark on every sheep that we kill.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the carcase - A. About thirty shillings; I have seen the prisoner in the market, but not that day; I believe he was a drover.</p>

Yes, I am answerable for any damage, and every thing that is left out in that market at dusk; they look for me to be answerable for all till the morning they come again. This sheep hung under the market place; I came on at dusk on the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be before six o'clock - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been on that night before six o'clock - A. No; my wife was just coming out with the lamps to take charge of it; I am paid sixpence a score for watching; sometimes we set up for two pence halfpenny a night, and less than that when the weather is very cold; on that night I went in pursuit of a carcase of mutton they had been taken the preceding night.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150011"></xptr>There is eleven salesman that I have the watch over.</p>

Yes; I have had it from Mrs. Cork, and she has had it from the watchman; I saw the carcase of the sheep before the alderman, I knew it to be mine; my sheep were hanging up at Mrs. Cork's shambles to be sold by her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going round Leadenhall street, I saw a man, he had a sheep on a rail; he asked me where I was going; I said to Whitechapel; he said he would give me sixpence to carry it to the bottom of Houndsditch; I told him I would. This man stopped me at St. Mary Axe, he asked me where I was going: I said I did not know rightly; I told him there was the man that I had it of, and when I turned round I did not see the man; I suppose he had ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shuter. Was any person by him at the time - A. I saw a little man or a lad walking behind him, they were saying something as they passed me, but what I did not know; I did not see him afterwards; after I stopped this man he did not make his appearance.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a City constable. On the 25th of July, I was coming up Great Saffron-hill; I met the prisoner coming down Great Saffron-hill; I perceived he had something bulky in a blue apron, which he had before him. When the prisoner had passed me, I observed him turn his head, and look after me. I suspected that he had got something that did not belong to him: I watched him into Bleeding Hart yard. I ran after the prisoner, and collared him with my left hand. and the bundle with my right hand, and asked him what he had got there; he was so agitated, he could not speak; he only cried. I took him to the office; the magistrate not sitting then, I delivered him into the charge of Brown, the officer. I asked the prisoner when he was going with the things; he said, he was going to Mother Dench's; she is a noted receiver, particularly of boys. He said, he had them of a boy in a field, he gave them to him</p>

I went to No. 8, Islington, for the linen, and as I was going home with it to my mother, the prisoner came up to me, he asked me if I would go of an errand for him; I said, yes. He said, he would give me fourpence. I was to leave the linen with him; I left the linen with him; he said, I was to enquire for a man that owed him some money; I went, I could not find the man, and when I returned the prisoner was gone.</p>

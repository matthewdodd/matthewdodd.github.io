                  </hi>. I am watchman to Mr. Lucas, who has a coal wharf in Milbank-street. About six o'clock in the morning of the 15th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, I saw three men come from Lambeth in two boats, and go to Mr. Edmund Lucas's barge, called the <hi rend="italic">Augusta,</hi> and take, I suppose, half-a-ton of coals—it was about a hundred feet from the wharf—I could see well—I could not discern the men till I rowed after them—they picked the big coals out with their hands, and then shovelled them out into the boats—I pur<lb></lb>sued them to Lambeth—the prisoner was in one of the boats, by himself—he was brought to me by a Thames policeman—I gave a description of him—my boat was touching his boat, when he jumped out, and the water splashed up my side—I was near enough to see his face—I got the boats,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280063"></xptr>
               <p>and brought them both back to my master's—there was about 4 cwt. of coals in the prisoner's boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames Police inspector. I received in<lb></lb>formation, and apprehended the prisoner—Bedell gave me a description of him—I took him and his brother to Mr. Lucas's, and Bedell immediately pointed out the prisoner—I asked if he knew any thing respecting the coals in the boat—he said, "I don't know anything of it; I was at home, having my breakfast, at the time;" I had two boats given me, with about 6 cwt of coals in them.</p>

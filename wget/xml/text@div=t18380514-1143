                  </hi>. I live in Talbot-court, Gracechureh-street, and am in the employ of James Debenham. On the 26th of April, between three and four o'clock, I was in his warehouse, and saw the prisoners loitering about for some time—they were evidently in company and near to each other, but I cannot say I saw them speak to each other—in about a minute the prosecutor passed them—Gullen beckoned with his hand to Baker, and both followed him at a quicker pace—I then ran out of the warehouse, ran down the court, and saw them both close on Mr. Burnett—Gullen drew a handkerchief from Mr. Burnett's pocket and threw it behind him—Mr. Burnett immediately turned round and collared Gullen—Winter, the policeman, was standing at the bottom of the court, not three yards off at the time—Mr. Burnett spoke to him—he turned round, took up the handkerchief, and took Gullen into custody, and then secured Baker—they did not make any resistance.</p>

I am a policeman. I was at the bottom of the court standing with my back towards the prosecutor when he collared Gullen—I saw the handkerchief on the ground—I took it up, and Mr. Burnett claimed it—Allen came to my assistance and held Gullen, while I went and took Baker from his information—I searched Gullen, and found two handkerchiefs in the seat of his trowsers and one in his hat—all silk, and different patterns—I found nothing on Baker—I took him about twenty yards from Gullen.</p>

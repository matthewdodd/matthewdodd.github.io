               <p>crew, including myself—we arrived off Dover at 3.30 in the afternoon—I stopped there to discharge my pilot—after that my course was S W by S—I started at 3.55—I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> immediately after I started, that was about sixteen minutes before the collision—we had started full speed, but it had taken our ship a little time to get way on her—at the time of the collision we were going about 9 knots—when we started the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was on our port quarter—I judged her to be about 3 miles off, she was coming apparently from outside the Goodwin Sands, coming down channel—she appeared to be going very much faster than we were, she was overtaking us, she was to the east of us—I continued the course that I was steering, for about sixteen minutes; I did not alter my course until I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia very</hi> close to us, so that I could read her name on the bows and saw her over<lb></lb>lapping us, and then I altered our course from S W by S to S W half S, that would be half a point; the effect of that would be to bring our head nearer to the land and from the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I then went to look at the compass to see that this order was obeyed and I saw that it was obeyed, and on looking up from the compass I saw the bows of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> coming round towards our vessel—she had altered her course and was altering all the time under a port helm, that would bring her directly for us—I did not alter my course until I saw that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had overlapped us on our port side—I then saw that a collision was inevitable, and to avoid the direct blow I put our helm hard a port, so that it might be a sliding blow if possible—if I had kept our course the blow would have been direct stem on—my vessel answered her helm a little—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> struck us on the port side between the engine-room bulkhead and the after batch, about 60 feet from the stern—the length of my vessel was 300 feet—the stem of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> penetrated about 4 feet into the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, she rebounded and again struck us nearer towards the stern, making another hole; both blows were on the port side—she then dragged along the port side, carrying away one of the boats, until she cleared our stern—I did not observe any one on the look out on the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I could have seen perhaps had I looked particularly, but I noticed no one; I was in a position to see if they had been standing there; I could see some one on the bridge, it was flood tide, not high water, been half flood and high water—the tide was running about E S E—the wind was W S W, it was nothing to interfere with the conduct of steam vessels, there was a fresh breeze—I was not watching the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> immediately after the collision for some time—I saw her again just before our vessel sank, then I noticed her steaming towards Dover—as near as I could judge from ten to eleven minutes elapsed between the striking of the first blow and the sinking of our vessel—when I saw her steaming towards Dover she was, I think, about half a mile from us, or a little more; she appeared to me to have steamed away, going towards the land; she never came back to us—after the colli<lb></lb>sion I went aft to see what damage had been done; I saw the water rush<lb></lb>ing in with terrific force—I told the ladies to come up on the bridge with me, and the other passengers, as I saw the ship's stern sinking rapidly—pre<lb></lb>vious to leaving the bridge I had given orders to lower the lifeboats, not only one, but two, to clear them away—when I came back to the bridge with the lady passengers I found the port lifeboat ready for lowering—I placed the ladies in the boat in charge of the third officer and three of the crew—just at that moment the extreme end of our ship's stern went under water and a number of the gentlemen passengers and my own crew rushed into this boat—we were then unable with so many people in it to swing her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030023"></xptr>
               <p>out, and I appealed to my own crew and the gentlemen passengers to come out for God's sake and let the ladies have the first chance—some men got out, gentlemen passengers and some of my own crew, and two or three of the ladies <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out, saying "If it will help you, captain, we will get out"—they <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out and I directed them to go into the other lifeboat on the star-board side, which they did—we then swung the port lifeboat out and lowered her down into the water—I saw the boat unhooked from the tackles and told the crew to shove off—just at this moment a heavy sea, caused, I think, by the sinking of the vessel's stern, drove the boat forcibly against the ship's side and overturned her—I then immediately turned my attention to the starboard lifeboat, but seeing the ship had sunk so much then I saw we had no time to endeavour to lower her, and I gave orders to unhook the tackles and get her all cleared, so that she might float off the dock—there were a number of people in her; this had already been done; I could not be sure whether the whole of this order had been executed before I was washed off the bridge; the ship bad gone down so far that the bridge was submerged—I found myself on the fore part of the deck—I was washed over the fore part of the bridge on to the forepart of the deck—I scrambled up to the bows, the ship was then lying so that her deck was a good inclined plane—I looked round and saw that the starboard lifeboat was bottom upwards—I then looked around to see what assistance was near us, and I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steaming away—I saw the barque <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>—I did not know then that it was the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>, but I saw a barque, I saw a Deal lugger and a tug boat—at this moment the vessel seemed to me to be going down entirely and not being much of a swimmer I took a plank under my arm and jumped overboard—as I floated beyond the ship I saw two ladies in the water holding on to a rope that was attached to the ship; with a little as<lb></lb>sistance from me they left the rope and joined me holding the plank; one of the ladies seemed very much exhausted and held on only a few minutes, and then she dropped off and sank—the other lady remained on the plank for nearly half an hour with me, I was talking to her, I knew her by her face; I knew who she was, a lady named Tubbs, I think; I had been intro<lb></lb>duced to her the afternoon previous; I think I knew her very well by face, but I could not remember the name until I saw her likeness after coming on shore and then I recognised her, it was the same Mrs. Tubbs—I helped her and encouraged her and tried to keep her mouth shut, she was calling for help and praying, and calling on her children, and seemed to be swallow<lb></lb>ing a great deal of water, and at last she let go the plank; I got her by the shoulder and pulled her towards me again, I saw that her face was lying under water, I lifted it up and tried to hold her, and I did, I think, for a minute or two, but I was getting so exhausted myself and I thought she was dead that I had to let her go—I was. ultimately picked up by the Deal lugger <hi rend="italic">Early Morn</hi>—I had been in the water about forty minutes, as near as I can judge—we were about 2 miles from Dover Pier when my vessel was struck by the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and about 2 1/4 miles from the land—the tonnage of my vessel was 1,254 nett register and 1950 gross register.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. We were a little over half a mile, I think, from Dover Pier, when we stopped to land the pilot, he landed on our port side, we were off the pier a little more than ten minutes before we started again on our course, the head of the Admiralty Pier, is about S S E, I think—while we were waiting there we were pushed further towards the cast by the wind and tide—the tide was flowing about E S E—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030024"></xptr>
               <p>we were about a mile east of the pier when we started on our course for the Channel, perhaps rather more—the head of our vessel was then nearly south, a little to the east of south—I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, just previous to starting, but took no particular notice of her then—I first began to take particular notice of her as soon as I had given the order to full speed ahead; I judged her then to be about 3 miles off, or between 3 or 4; I really could not judge the distance correctly, but that was the idea I formed at the time, I think—she was then taking her course down Channel, I think that would be WSW, (I was steering S W by S,) that was her right course; she never altered her course at all that I noticed; she appeared to come on the same course until just previous to the collision—I had her in sight the whole of the time, now and again, I was watching her, coming along, of course I had to look out ahead of my ship, not astern—the only thing I did, was to port my helm, half a point before the collision—I say that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was a following vessel—I was not crossing her bows—had our courses been parallel we could not have crossed, but they were not parallel, and therefore at one time either one vessel or the other must have crossed; I don't say I would have gone across her bows, she might have gone across mine, she appeared to me to be going that way—the captain standing on the bridge of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, might have formed reasonably the judgment that we were coming across his bows—the lines were so nearly parallel, and the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> bows being on our stern, I naturally concluded seeing that she was coming after, that she was a following vessel, also a crossing vessel, in the sense that at some point our courses must have crossed—she might also naturally conclude that we were a crossing vessel—I judged she was about quarter of a mile distant when she put her helm to port—if she had put her helm hard to port half mile, she would have gone under our stern—she struck us about 60 feet from our stern, I am not sure—it was a question of 60 feet, I suppose whether she came into collision with us or not, when her helm was ported—had she been a little further off it would have been easier for her to have ported; she ought to have ported a little sooner than she did, perhaps she could have done it safely, 300 or 400 yards sooner—I did not see the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> wave us to port; I am not aware that any one on our vessel did see him; I have not heard of it from any of our own people; I have heard it said in the other Court, on the other side—we were 1 1/4 miles from the Admiralty Pier when the collision took place, nearly 2 1/2 miles, I am not sure of the distance, I don't think it would be 2 1/2 miles—I intended to have gone out about 5 miles in order to get an offing—in the state of the weather that day I considered it not my duty to go only half a mile from the Admiralty Pier, and then take the course for the Channel W S W—the weather was moderate, there was nothing in the way previous to the collision, it had been raining—it was perfectly clear at the time of the collison—we could have steered out half a mile, and then taken a course straight down channel, but that would have taken us very close to the land—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was going straight down channel—I say she was going more rapidly than we were, because I saw her approaching us so quickly—I did not get out of her way and turn down channel, because article 17 of the rules of the road at sea, says, that the vessel who is ahead or who is on the starboard side of another one must keep her course, and the other one must keep out of her way—I think articles 14 and 17 refer to that—I am not allowed to keep clear of her, I should have done</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030025"></xptr>
               <p>wrong had I gone away, moreover I believed that she was the vessel that had to keep out of the way, and I thought she would—our full speed is nine knots, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to be going at a greater rate, of course, I could not positively tell—it would take us some little time to obtain the speed of nine knots, although the engines started full speed, we were going nine knots for about sixteen minutes. (<hi rend="italic">Rule</hi> 17 <hi rend="italic">was read by Counsel:</hi> "A vessel overtaking any other vessel shall keep out of the way of the said last mentioned vessel.") The <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> could not in some sense he said to be an overtaking vessel—our stern was beyond her bow; we were ahead of her—it was a question of who was crossing the bows—we would have crossed, but whether she would have crossed us or we her was a question relating to speed; it was a question which would cross the bows of the other first—I am quite familiar with article 16, which says: "A steam ship when approaching another ship so as to. involve risk of collision, shall slacken her speed, or if necessary stop and reverse"—I did not slacken and reverse, because I was not the overtaking ship—that was my only reason, it was not my duty to do it I say, and at the same time had I done it the collision would have occurred—when I saw that the collision was inevitable, then the rules tell me to do something to prevent it; that is my judgment—when I saw that the collision was certain I did try to avoid it, not pre<lb></lb>vious—when I saw it was certain I attempted to avoid it—if other ships had been coming in the same course as the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I must have crossed them, either at the bow or the stern—I know that it is usual for vessels of our description to go out more than a mile—I mean a large ship with passengers on board—I am aware that the bearing of the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclythe</hi> is S S E of the Admiralty pier—I am aware of articles 19 and '20. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "In obeying and construing these rules, due regard must he had to all dangers of navigation, and due regard must also he had to any special circumstances which may exist in particular cases rendering a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger." "Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any ship or owner, or master or crew thereof from the consequences of any neglect to carry any lights or signals, or any precaution which may be requisite by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.") I consider those two rules in the light of controlling rules of the others—they give a large discretion to the captain of a ship in the management of his vessel when he sees danger; at the point of danger I did do something.</p>

Those articles are only provisoes in certain cases—Article 18 says "By the above rules one £two ships is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course, subject to the qualify<lb></lb>cation contained in the following articles"—my strict rule would have been to keep my course and not alter it at all till I saw danger, but when I saw danger of collision I did alter my course by half a point, so that I did as far as I could follow that exceptional rule (<hi rend="italic">Article</hi> 14 <hi rend="italic">again read</hi>)—I never had the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> on my starboard side—I had not the slightest reason to sup-pose that the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> would not act according to these rules, and if she had there would have been no collision—it was not a proper course to run it so fine as to port within 400 feet, not when there was plenty of room—as a matter of fact I was going down Channel—had we been going right across to Calais we should have been going almost at right angles to the course of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia:</hi> he would still, in my opinion, have been a following vessel, his bow was astern of us, on our quarter—when I first saw him he was between 3</p>

               <p>and 4 miles east of us; the course of both of us was west, with a modicum of south, towards the S W; we were both coming from the east—my reason for going out 5 miles was that it had been raining previously, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and the fog had hung about the high lands, and I thought it was going to be <hi rend="italic">foggy</hi> that night; the wind was westerly, and I knew that this west wind would be bringing a number of sailing ships up Channel towards Dungeness for pilots, where the pilots are put on board—1 should have to clear Dungeness—having landed my pilot I wanted no further com<lb></lb>munication with the shore, and therefore I thought it was best to go outside the track of the vessels coming up seeking pilots at Dungeness, and I would have passed Dungeness between 7 and 8 miles off—it did become foggy that night, before dark—I consider it was the proper course to take in coming out that way, and I think it was the prudent course, considering the number of lives I had under my charge, that I ought to have taken.</p>

There is a light on the S W of the Barne Sand—if I had kept on my course of 5 miles, allowing for the tide that was running against me, it would have left me 3 miles away from the Barne Sand, and I should not have come near the N E bay—by the course I was steering I was coming more out to the lightship, which is a considerable dis<lb></lb>tance further from the pier head than the bay—when I had got to the 5 miles I should have altered my course down channel, taking the Red sand light as my mark, which is about 11 1/2 miles from Dungeness—I was making a straight line for about 6 miles off Dungeness.</p>

               <p>Us; she turned sharp round to the right, bringing her bows in the direction of our vessel—I did not see anybody on the forepart of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at that moment; to the best of my belief there was not anybody—the collision occurred almost immediately afterwards, there was a terrible shock, I was thrown off my legs by it—I did not notice the hole that was made by the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> in the side of our vessel—I stood looking at the vessel for some moments, and then ran up the rigging; several persons crowded up the rigging—I slid down almost immediately, as the vessels were separating, and ran down the companion to my cabin and got my belt and put it on; I then came on deck and went on the bridge—I got into the lifeboat for a short time—I did not hear the captain, speak, a lady spoke, and then I came out and saw others come out also—I saw the port lifeboat lowered, I did not see it swamped—I walked across the deck and got into the starboard lifeboat—then I noticed that the stern of our vessel went down, and almost imme<lb></lb>diately afterwards there was a puff of steam went up close by me and there was a cry that the boilers would burst, and I then looked round and saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steaming away in the distance towards the land on our starboard quarter—shortly after that our vessel went down and the starboard lifeboat was capsized—the first thing I can remember after being capsized was being under the boat; I managed to get clear of it, and when I came to the sur<lb></lb>face I caught hold of a hencoop that was floating by and by means of that was picked up by a boat called the <hi rend="italic">Brave Nelson</hi> of Deal—I did not see a number of people in the water; just before I was capsized I noticed Captain Beckett pass by me, he was in the water—a few seconds elapsed between the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> turning sharp round and the collision; it is difficult to say, but not more than a few seconds.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I have been at sea fourteen years—I have been six years in the same employment—the <hi rend="italic">Strath<lb></lb>dyde</hi> was an iron vessel—on the afternoon, of 17th February, I was on the bridge with the captain—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> about two miles astern—my attention was drawn to her by my captain; I looked at her through a glass; she appeared to be going much faster than we were—she overtook us—we were steering S W by S—I did not see her name on the bows—she came up with us very close until within about a quarter of a mile of us, her bow overlapping over stern—my captain thought she was coming rather close and altered the course half a point; looking at her again she was coming stem into us hard round on her port helm; she struck us abaft the engine-room bulk head, about 60 or 70 feet from the stem—we had been going full speed, there was plenty of sea way when she struck us—before she struck us the order was given <hi rend="italic">by my</hi> captain to port and hard a port; that was obeyed, I went to the helm myself to assist in heaving over, there were two quartermasters at the wheel—our helm is on the bridge—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> struck us almost immediately after the order was given—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187604030028"></xptr>
               <p>considering that we were going 9 or 9 1/2 knots, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> must have been going at least 11—I did not see any change in her speed as she approached us—she struck us more than once; she first struck us and then rebounded; she must have done so—she was towering above us, very much higher, when she was in collision with us—I took a momentary glance at the damage done to our vessel, and saw a tremendous gash in our ship—I saw others rushing up the rigging, and I rushed up also and got on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, others did the same, the rigging was crowded—when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I rushed along the deck and shouted "boats" pointing to them to everybody I met—I did not see the defendant at that time. I did afterwards, while we were working at the starboard boat to try and get it out, other persons on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> worked at it afterwards, they were some of my own men—I heard an exclamation in English, "My God, my poor shipmates", I looked up and saw my ship sinking, and then I ran to the bridge—it was George Mclntyre, who made the exclamation—when I went on to the bridge I saw the defendant and another man who proved to be the English pilot—I stood between them and pointed to my ship and begged them to go back to her—I said "Go to my ship, go back to my ship," pointing to her—she must have been half a mile off then as near as I could judge—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had been going on towards Dover, while I was on board—the English pilot replied, "My dear man we are sinking too"—I could not say whether the defendant was there then, he was standing there, walking across the bridge, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to be going pretty fast in the water; I said various things to the defendant at different intervals, nothing further about our ship that I remember—I saw her sink, that could not be ten minutes after she was struck—none of the boats of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> were lowered into the water—she was sounded, after a suggestion made by myself to sound her; I suggested to the captain that soundings should be taken—I asked him if she was making water—he told me the fore compartment was full—some one came to the bridge and received orders from the captain to sound her and a report was brought back sometime after that she was making no water—that was about twenty minutes or half an hour after the collision; she did not at any time appear to be sinking—we went on to Dover Bay—a man came on board in a row boat from the shore—all the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> boats, but two or three were swung outside ready, level with the ship's rail—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> went to the Downs, before she stopped—there would be a difficulty in lowering boats with a vessel going through the water; if she had stopped there would have been no difficulty whatever in lowering boats.</p>

I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I was on deck before the collision and noticed the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> first on our port quarter about 2 or 3 ship's lengths <hi rend="italic">from</hi> us—I was standing <hi rend="italic">forwards</hi>, and all at once 1 saw her, as she must have done, port her helm, and stand on to it—she struck us somewhere near the main rigging—I then ran aft, the <hi rend="italic">rigging</hi> was crowded, and I saw that there was no chance—a line was hanging over, there was a crowd of people; a lady passenger called to me, she wished to be made fast to the line—I saw that my only chance was to jump overboard, and was pulled on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, and when I got on board I told them that Luke <hi rend="italic">Short</hi> was hanging there and they pulled him up'; I told them that no attempt had been made to lower any boats; we both went aft, and when we were near the bridge I heard the mate of our vessel call out "Is there any Englishman here who will assist me in getting the boats"—I assisted to get the boats out and cut the lashings, but no boat was lowered—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steamed away—I noticed no difference in her speed before she struck us—I cannot say whether she was sounded when I was on board of her, but I saw the carpenter with a sounding rod in his hand about a minute before I. got on board—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> continued to go on till we got to Dover Bay—I went with her to the Downs, but not to London.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I saw the hole in the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—my firm impression when I found myself hanging there was that she was in danger—it was a serious hole, as far as I could judge at the time—she went away at about half speed—I have been at sea sixteen or seventeen years—I did not hear an order given by the captain to sound the well—I heard no statement by the carpenter or any one that the forehold was full of water—I heard no order given to shore up the bulkhead—I was not very much alarmed—my attention was carefully directed to lowering the boats—the crew were not assisting us—the first boat was" a steam launch; that would not have been of much use—they did not assist us at the second boat, there was no reason for that that I know of—the second boat had a hole in her—the third boat they lowered themselves some time afterwards within 5 or 6 feet of the water—I did not see any ropes thrown over the side—a rope was hanging, and I got in by it—I did not hear the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> the moment after the collision give orders to lower the boats—I did not see the English pilot on board—I heard nothing he said—I did not hear him say to the captain "My God, get on shore as soon as you can, we are sinking"—in order to lower a boat thoroughly it is necessary to stop the engines—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> engines were not stopped after I was on board, they may have been eased off Dover—she was going at half speed—I saw a steamtug three-quarters of a mile or a mile away, and I should say that those on board of her must have seen the collision—the tug came near to the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, but that was half an hour afterwards; she went inside first—she did not bear down to help—she afterwards came alongside the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I did not see any other luggers or boats about that might have helped—the tug was not very large, she would only tow a small class of vessels—if she had come down alongside the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> she could have saved many lives; I think a great deal of help might have been given—I could not judge on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> whether there was a general fear and alarm that she would sink—I did not hear any explanation the pilot made, or anybody else</p>

               <p>—I did not know at the time that the bulkhead required shoring, and was shored as she went to Dover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After I went on board I went so far as to get the assistance of somebody to lower the boats—we may have been a quarter of a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, at that time—there was nothing so far as I know to prevent the boats being lowered at that time—between that time and the time we got to Dover, the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was not stopped at all—some of the crew came to get the third and fourth boats lowered—we were then from three-quarters of a mile to a mile from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, she was then sinking, she was stern down, her bows were up, and her stern under water—we had increased our distance half a mile at that time—the tug boat was then nearer to us than to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, and about the same distance from the land as we were, and about the same distance from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> as we were—she had a mud lighter in tow and was making out seawards with it—we left the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at the Downs, between 6 and 7 o'clock—from the time I got on board of her to the time I got off, I saw no reason to suppose that she was on the point of sinking—none of the boats were ever actually lowered to the water.</p>

               <p>the Calais Mail come up; we saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and she neared us, and immediately before the collision she overlapped us, and then turned round and ran into us—I was on deck when the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was struck, and for some time before—I was standing by the companion ladder just before she struck—I saw her distinctly when she altered her course; there was nothing to intercept my view between her and the collison—after she had struck us she backed out a little and then struck again, and the second time she ripped along the side and then forged past the stern, and after she got a little distance she turned her head and steamed away from us—I got on some floating substance and was picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Early Morn</hi>—I was in the water thirty or forty minutes, and saw several people floating about.</p>

I am a Channel pilot and boatman—on 17th February, I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi> which was lying to, waiting for a pilot on the west of Shakspeare's Cliff and about a couple of miles I should judge, from Dover pier—my boat is called the <hi rend="italic">Brave Nelson</hi>, and I had come out in her to the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>—mine is a pilot boat—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> start from Dover Bay and saw the course she steered—I judge that when she started she was standing S S W—there was a moderate breeze, it had been blowing all the morning—I could see, I judge, 6 or 7 <hi rend="italic">miles</hi>—I <hi rend="italic">first saw the Franconia about 3 miles</hi> away <hi rend="italic">to the eastward</hi>; she might be a couple of miles from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> then—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> appeared to me to be going a great deal faster then the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was—I did not see them go into collision but I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> backing her stem from' the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I judge that I saw both vessels about three minutes before the collision—I can not say whether if the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had star boarded her helm at that time there would have been any collision; I was rather too far off—after the collision I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> backing out, she seemed to lay there about three minutes and then she ported her helm and steamed away into Dover—at the time of the collision the tugboat was close off the Admiralty Pier; I mean near to the pier—there was a breeze in the morning but there was no sea to prevent the lowering of boats.</p>

               <p>we were the first boat there—the ships were about three miles apart when 1 first saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—at that time the weather was perfectly clear—the sea was moderate and so was the wind—from the place where the collision took place we could see the town of Dover, and the houses quite plainly with the naked eye—she was rather abreast of the pier if at all—I noticed the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> porting her helm—I should think it was about two or three minutes before the collision, or it might have been four minutes, I could not say to a minute or two exactly—she was going a course S W by W to the best of my judgment.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walmer, I am the master of the lugger <hi rend="italic">Brave Nelson</hi>—on Thursday, 17th February, I went from the <hi rend="italic">Queen of Nations</hi>, to fetch a pilot from Dover—just before getting there I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> steaming from Dover Pier—she was steaming in a south westerly direction—I suppose she was steaming out in order to get into a fairway—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at the same time steaming down in a westerly direction—when I first saw them I should think the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> was about two miles from the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—we did not actually see the two vessels strike, but we saw them together; apparently in collision—we saw the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> come clear off—I saw the other steamer go down, and the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> steaming towards Dover—our boat was ashore at the Admirably Pier, waiting for the pilots that were coming there, we immediately made sail and proceeded towards the wreck—it was not more than a quarter of an hour between the time we saw the collision, and when we got to the wreck—we passed near the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, as we were going, as near as 200 or 300 yards—I think we were then about three-quarters of a mile off the land—when we got to the wreck we found the <hi rend="italic">Early Morn</hi> there, and we assisted in picking up the bodies.</p>

I am Superintendent of the Peninsular and Oriental boats—I examined the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> after her arrival in London—I do not remember the exact date—it was one of the days of the inquest at Poplar—I was examined as a witness there—I examined her on behalf of the builder of the vessel—I found that the stem was considerably damaged—part of it gone, and that the bows had been stove in as far as the collision</p>

               <p>bulkhead which was 11 ft. abaft the stem, but the bulkhead was sound as far as I could see, with one slight exception, which was a little bulging on the starboard side—I was given to understand she had come down from the Downs to London—her entire length is about 360 ft—she was quite safe going at a moderate rate of speed in fine weather, as far as my judgment goes—there was no imminent danger of sinking as far as I could see—she had another bulkhead as near as I can recollect, about 21 ft. abaft that—it was not water tight—there was one about 39 or 40 ft. abaft that, which was watertight up as far as the lower deck—the first bulkhead was about 21 ft, from the collision bulkhead, and the next about 40 ft—the second was not watertight, because it had a hole in the bottom—I did not see the size of it, the ship was too narrow for me—I did not go down, I was informed by the carpenter that it was 1 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter—I don't think the vessel would have sunk at all from those injuries if she was going slowly; if she had been driving at full speed it is impossible to say how long she would have taken to sink; if the collision bulkhead was sufficiently tight to stand the force of <hi rend="italic">going</hi> against the sea she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not fill in the other compartments, and she would not sink at all—supposing it did give way, I should think it would take five or six hours to fill the fore part up to the next watertight compartment—I should doubt whether that would sink her, it would bring her down by the head—the collision bulkhead is made strong for that very purpose—this was very strongly made and well supported.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

I did not examine the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at the request of the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—I examined her at the request of the builder—I was in communication with Mr. Gellatly, the solicitor for the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, the morning that I went down to see her, not with the owners—I was about three-quarters of an hour examining her, she was then in the Victoria Dock—I have been in the habit of surveying the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels, not as a surveyor, as their superintendent—it is my duty to survey vessels—I have surveyed vessels officially—I said at Poplar that I had not, but I corrected myself before the Court rose, and said I had made a mistake there—I surveyed the <hi rend="italic">Baltimore</hi> that is the only vessel I have surveyed outside the company—when I survey the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels, I make the reports when they are asked from me; it is not generally asked from me; on special occasions—official surveyors do not accompany me—by official surveyors, I mean gentlemen who profess to be surveyors of vessels—when the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels are seriously damaged, as a rule there is official survey, not by me alone—I give them a very partial examination when they come into port, that is all, unless in special cases—when I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> I measured the distances of the bulkheads I have named—I have not got them here, they are at my office—I was not aware until this morning that I was to be brought to give evidence—I came up from Victoria Dock as fast as I could—to the best of my recollection the collision bulkhead was three-eighths of an inch thick; I am not quite certain, it might have been seven-sixteenths of an inch, I don't know—I did not notice the extent to which the plates were puckered—that would be a very good indication of the severity of the blow, possibly the best—I saw that they were, puckered, but I can't say to what extent—the danger of a bulkhead giving way depends entirely upon the severity of the blow—I was not asked to examine the extent to which the plates were puckered, or</p>

               <p>whether there was danger of the collision bulkhead giving way; that was not the object 1 had in view in seeing the ship; I looked at it and saw that it had not given way—I have a certain amount of practical experience which would enable me to judge when I see a bulkhead, whether it is strong enough or not, or whether it has given way—I examined the plates on the inside of the bulkhead carefully, and I examined those on the after side as far down as I could see, I could not see any broken—I could not undertake to say whether one was broken—I did not see any danger of the collision bulkhead giving way—I tried to see on the inside, I went down and examined it, as far as I could get, I suppose about 6 ft. off the bottom of the ship—without going down to the bottom you could not for certain ascertain the danger of its giving way—I say as far as I could see there was no danger of its giving way—I have not seen her in dry dock since the collision—I have not been asked to do so—if the collision bulkhead had given way I should say about 350 tons of water would have got into the ship—I will not undertake to say that 600 tons would not have got in—I took no measurement that would enable me to say that only 350 tons would come in, it is a guess—I looked at the plates in the immediate vicinity of the bulkhead—I did not notice any particular damage abaft the collision bulkhead—I am not prepared to swear there was not any—viewing it from the front I should say it would indicate great danger—if I had seen it at the moment, I might, as an experienced captain have feared that the collision bulkhead would hare given way; I might have thought there was imminent danger—I noticed that there was a small shore there—I did not take its dimensions, it struck me from the look of it as being small—I did not observe any shore there above 6 inches thick—I can't say whether there was only one shore, I did not pay any attention to the amount of shoring, if it had been heavily shored I should have observed it—I mean, with heavy baulks of timber—I observed only one shore between one of the frames and the bulkhead—I did not pay any particular attention to it; I will not undertake to swear how many shores there were, or how thick they were—it would have taken about five minutes to put up the small shore I saw—I can't conceive it would take an hour—I have seen a bulkhead shored before, I saw one on board the <hi rend="italic">Baltimore</hi> that went on shore at Hastings, about eight years ago—that was the last time I saw a bulkhead shored up; that is the only time I can call to mind—I was examined before the Coroner, at Poplar—I did not hear Mr. Barnard examined—I heard of his having been appointed by the Coroner to examine the vessel, and I saw his examination in the paper the next day—the Second bulkhead was not watertight; I took that from the carpenter—I did not go sufficiently low down to see whether there was a hole or no—I could not get down, I tried—I noticed some iron doors on the lower deck, at the end of one of the bulkheads; those doors were not nearly watertight, so that that bulkhead would not be watertight above the lower deck—the time it would take for the vessel to sink would partly depend upon the quantity of water that would get into her—if I am wrong in my estimate of 350 tons of water getting in from the collision bulkhead giving way, I may be entirely wrong in my estimate of the time it would take to sink the vessel—there is a good deal to be seen in dry dock which cannot be seen when the vessel is not in dry dock—a good deal of valuable information as to the state of a ship is to be obtained from examining the bottom of it—I had no opportunity of properly judging of the state of this ship—I had no opportunity further than the examination 1 made in the Victoria Dock.</p>

I am a licensed pilot to the port of Havre—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> at Grimsby at 6 o'clock in the morning of the 10th February to pilot her into Havre—at 3.45 on the 17th February I was down below and the cabin doctor said some<lb></lb>thing to me—I went on deck and saw a steamboat on our starboard side about two ship's lengths, steering S W by S—I went on the bridge—and looked at the compass—our vessel's head was W S W, a few degrees &amp;—the captain was on the bridge on the starboard side; I saw him walk quickly towards the telegraph and he brought the handle of the telegraph upright, which means stop her—he then turned it towards the after part of the ship, which means astern full speed—he then walked to the extreme port side of the bridge, and said "Port the helm," and waved for the helm to be ported—he then went to the starboard side of the bridge, took off his cap and waved it, and made use of an English word which I did not understand—I saw no effect at all on the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>—the courses of the two vessels crossed immediately afterwards and the collision happened—when I saw the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> before the collision she was certainly crossing our course—we were steering W S W and the other one S W by S—the courses were crossing each other by 3 points, that is only approximately—at the time of the collision Dover was abreast of us about—I did not pay attention whether our course was changed—three of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> boats were got over the side—the English pilot was shouting out to port the helm and to go ahead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a consulting engineer, of the City of Lon<lb></lb>don—I have had great experience with ships, especially iron ships—I have made a careful examination of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>—I examined her in the Vic<lb></lb>toria Docks, and more recently in the dry dock—on the first occasion she was afloat—in such a case as this you cannot ascertain when she is afloat all the damage a ship may have sustained in a severe collision—it takes several days to carefully survey and ascertain the damage done to a ship similar to the damage done on the present occasion—it is impossible to do much in three-quarters of an hour—I have carefully examined the condition of the collision bulkhead—it was shored up when I saw it—it is not true that there was only one small shoring; there were six shores and two stiffeners toler<lb></lb>ably thick and strong—it would take much longer than half an hour to shore up those bulkheads—I do not think anyone could have examined that bulkhead carefully who said that there was only one small shoring—I found on the first occasion the forepart of the ship, from the stem to the collision bulkhead, from the shear streak down to the surface of the water, completely crushed and puckered and bent over—I am speaking of the skin of the ship; I am coming to the bulkhead—a great portion of the plating was crushed, and it fell overboard; all the frames were broken up to the collision bulkhead, and some of the frames of the collision bulkhead itself on the starboard side—the frames on the collision bulkhead were twisted inwards—"puckering" is indentation, and of course the deeper it is indented the weaker it becomes—the collision bulkhead had sustained con<lb></lb>siderable damage, and there was considerable risk of its giving way, and if it had given way it would have caused serious danger to the ship—there are three water-tight bulkheads in the ship, two are water-tight up to the main deck and one to the lower deck—if the collision bulkhead had given way 533 tons of water would have got into that compartment—I have calcu<lb></lb>lated that carefully—if that quantity of water had got into the ship the next bulkhead would have given way, and in that case the ship would have been in imminent danger—there is an open hatchway in the fore peak which is not water-tight, and if the collision bulkhead had given way that hatch<lb></lb>way would have been 2 feet below the level of the water—on my examina<lb></lb>tion before the Coroner I had not been able to get sufficiently low down in the ship to know that the second division was not water-tight, and I assumed that it was water-tight—another surveyor and I went down and found a hole, and found that it was not water-tight, and I found that it was never intended to be water-tight—as regards the bottom of the ship, which I could not examine when she was afloat, I found that the stem was entirely gone—that shook the bulkhead very much—the stem would act as a stay and support to the bulkhead—when it had gone it would not tend to injure the bulkhead, but having given way it started the bottom—the ship making 10,12, and very soon 14 inches of water almost immediately after the col<lb></lb>lision clearly showed that it had started the bulkhead—supposing the colli<lb></lb>sion bulkhead had given way, what I call the division bulkhead, the hatch<lb></lb>way would have got below the level of the sea, and the ship must have gone down in a very short time—the collision bulkhead and the bow must have presented an appearance such as to alarm a captain of ordinary skill; it must have made him believe that the vessel would sink; it cer<lb></lb>tainly was such as to make a careful captain believe that his ship would sink—the shoring of the bulkhead had some effect in strengthening it—if</p>

               <p>it had not been shored I think it would have been very risky—it would not have been safe for the ship to have gone ahead with that bulkhead un<lb></lb>shored—I think it would have given way—it would, I should say, take ten minutes to launch the steam launch, and she could not be rowed if she were launched—she is too big a thing for two men to row, and it would take at least a quarter of an hour to get up her steam—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmer-ston</hi> tug, and I know her size—she is large enough to have saved all the lives if she had got to the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde—if</hi> I had seen this collision take place, and had seen the damage to the collision bulkhead, and noticed the water coming through, and had seen the state of the bows, I think a prudent man might have considered it necessary to have beached his vessel—I have no interest whatever in this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. What I mean to convey is this, if I had been in command of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> and seen the damage she had received I would have steamed away to Dover and let the people drown, and I am as humane a man as most people are—I should certainly have been so much alarmed and felt so much for my crew that I should have felt it my duty—I have heard that three boats were put over the side of the ship and that there were about five others—I do not know whether there were eight, I have not been listening to the evidence—I do not know whether the cap train could have put some of the boats in the the water and put some of his crew into them before he started to Dover—I do not know whether the <hi rend="italic">Franconia's</hi> boats would hold the crews of both vessels and all the people in them—the collision bulkhead is a structure for the especial purpose of pre<lb></lb>venting the water getting into the other part of the ship, supposing a colli<lb></lb>sion occurs and the stem is injured, but not for such a crash as this; that is the object of it; it is a strong bulkhead, made of iron—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> is very strongly built—it would take, I should say, two hours to shore up the bulkhead—it was shored up and it was very efficiently done—I heard the carpenter say that the first thing he did when he went down was to clear away, and then, I suppose he would begin to shore it—there would be a little more pressure if he did it when the vessel was going 8 1/2 knots than when she was at rest, but not very much—I do not know that it would make much difference—there would be a little danger when going through the water at considerable speed, of widening the aperture made in the stem, but not much—twenty-eight plates of the stem were injured, down to the bottom from the shear streak to the keel, fourteen on each side—the plates on the starboard side were very much crushed and puckered, and on the port side there was nothing to prevent any body of water rushing in—I am an engineer, I have not had command of vessels—in my opinion, as an engineer, I do not think the most prudent thing for the time for the <hi rend="italic">Fran<lb></lb>conia</hi> to have done would have been to remain still, for this reason, she was in a tide way, as I understand, and every minute she remained at rest she would he going from shore—the next compartment I speak of was 22 feet further to the stern than the collision bulkhead, and it extends up to the lower deck—there would be an ordinary bulkhead to divide it from the pro<lb></lb>vision hold—I supposed it to be an ordinary bulkhead before I examined it, and I supposed it to be watertight, as it ran on to the main deck; I could not get at it on the first occasion; there were some Custom House things in it on the first occasion, there was a seal on the door, and I could not get in—the collision bulkhead I examined was originally perfectly sound and strong, but not when I examined it; it was started and puckered on the</p>

               <p>starboard side in this shape; it would not admit a great quantity of water; if that bulkhead had given way it would probably have been an hour before the vessel sank—I do not say that if the bulkhead gave way the captain of tie <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> would have had an hour to do whatever he wanted; the ship would have been perfectly unmanageable before that—the boats would have lowered themselves, the vessel would have gone down so rapidly—the crew could have lowered the boats in an hour if they had nothing else to do, if they had not the ship to save and their own lives—when I said before the Coroner "I should be sorry to insure her life more than five hours if the bulkhead had given way," that was assuming that the bulkhead, which I call the divisional bulkhead, had been watertight—if the divisional bulkhead bad been watertight she would have floated five hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The craw do not generally remain on board till a ship sinks—the captain was perfectly right in my opinion in taking his vessel towards the land when he saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi>, steaming towards the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde—</hi> if the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> had gone at full speed there would have been serious danger of the collision bulkhead giving way—I should not have allowed the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> to have gone at full speed with that bulkhead—I have examined the bulkhead very carefully, and am perfectly astonished at its not giving way, it is next to a miracle that it did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE JUTY</hi>. I think it was a miracle that it did not give way, or that its efficiency was not entirely destroyed—you must not take it that it turned out stronger than I estimated, on the contrary, I found when she was perfectly dry that the danger was much more serious than I at first anticipated, in fact, the bulkhead was merely hanging as it were by a string; had it not been for these shores she must have gone down—it is a difficult question to say how many shores were necessary to take away the imminent danger, and how long it would take to place them—I have explained to you that it was an awkward place to get at—there is a hatch, say 2 feet square, and then you are landed on a place 6 feet deep, and it is very difficult to get the shores down; you cannot get the materials down, there would not be space enough—I do not think shoring alone would take away the imminent danger of the bulkhead giving way, because the sides of the ship were started and we wanted something to take away the strain—it is no use shoring unless you have something to shore against, and the shores which they had got there occupied all the space which you could shore against—there was never in my opinion 15 feet of water inside the ship; certainly not in the bulkhead, nor in any part—I say that, because when water gets into a ship it generally leaves a mark, just as you would see in the tide, and I found no trace of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I should think there may have been 15 or 16 feet depth of water on the outside of the collision bulkhead, between the bow side of it and the stem—if you were to drop a line down to the bottom of the keel, on the side next the bow, it would be 15 or 16 feet deep, and that portion of the ship from the bulkhead forward to the stem was open to the sea.</p>

               <p>dry dock, and have thereby arrived at a more accurate knowledge of her condition—I have heard Mr. Harrington's evidence, and quite agree with it—the collision bulkhead was puckered back 4 inches and the frames were started from the bottom and were cracked in the throat, which is the internal part of the angle, and the rivets were started from the top of the collision bulkhead to the keel on the starboard side—I also examined the bottom of the ship in the dry, dock to the stem—there was considerable clanger of the collision bulkhead giving way when I saw it afterwards—I found it shored up with several wood shores—anybody who says that it was only shored with small shores could not have gone down to examine it at all—there were I think eight pieces of timber—he could not get at it to shore without clearing away—it might take an hour and a half to two hours to do that shoring, it is such a small place to work it—if there had been no shoring I should only have liked to go very slow indeed—the bows of the vessel were entirely gone—I have a rough sketch here in Court—that part of. the ship in front of the collision bulkhead was full of water—I am not at all astonished to hear that there was in the other part of the vessel from 14 to 15 inches of water; the port side where the collision bulkhead came in, was open 1 inch and I put my hand in, and on the other side three-eighths of an inch, it was broken off short—the next was not a watertight compartment, nor was it intended to be—if the collision bulk head had given—way and there was a rush of water, I have no doubt that the next compartment would have given way, and there would have been serious danger to the ship—she would have floated some time, but she could not have been navigated, her helm would have been useless to her—the crew could not have remained on board—if the. two compartments had given way, two hatches would have been under water, she would have gone down rapidly and the water would have come into the main forehold—I have been at sea twelve years—if after this collision I had seen the bulk head in this condition, I should have thought most decidedly that there was danger of its giving way—as captain of that ship, I should have thought that she was in imminent danger; it is easy to be wise after the event—it would take a great number of men to launch the steam-launch; two men could not have moved it with rapidity, nor ten—I know the tug <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> well—I have heard that the English pilot on looking at the bows, cried out to the captain to bench his vessel—I heard him say that when he saw the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> standing down towards the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, he ordered the engines to go ahead to bring the vessel nearer the land—that was not improper in my opinion—I dare say the <hi rend="italic">Palmerston</hi> could carry on her deck 200 people—I also heard that there was a barque and a lugger—the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> cer<lb></lb>tainly could not with any consideration for her own safety have gone ahead with that bulkhead injured; the bulkhead would have given way I am certain—having seen its condition I should not have liked to go at any speed with it unshared—I had not seen the ship in dry dock when I gave my evidence, she was in the Victoria Dock, afloat—when I saw her in the dry dock she appeared far more damaged below the water-line than when I saw her afloat—my evidence before the Coroner when I saw her afloat was not the same as today—I had not the opportunity of saying what I say now—it was absolutely necessary to see her in the dry dock, and I re<lb></lb>marked that to the Coroner—Captain Black must have been very smart to have ascertained the damage to the collision bulkhead in three-quarters of an hour—I was there on three different occasions; the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> had to be</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. They could have done it better when she was still, than when she was going through the water—the screw was going very slow to keep her from going out to sea, and the crew would occupy themselves in shoring it up as quickly as they could to prevent further damage—if I had been the captain I should not have liked to go quickly through the water; I should have gone slowly, but I cannot say that I think I should then have been tolerably safe because it might have given way; not safe for the sea, considering that I should have been on a damaged vessel—if the bulkhead had given way; the hold would hold some 530 tons which would have brought her to the water line, and the water line I calculate from a drawing would come down 20 or 22 feet, and the hatches would both be under water which would fill the other compart<lb></lb>ment, and the rush of water would come in very fast—if the bulkhead had given way it would perhaps have been a couple of hours before the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> went down—when I say "perhaps," that is the opinion I arrive at after making the best calculation in my power—if I had been master of the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi>, I think I should have thought it prudent to man my boats with part of the crew, and then steamed towards the shore—if that had been done a good many lives might have been saved—I have not heard what the weather was—there was no well into which they pumped the water—the 14 inches of water was from the keel up to the floor, I suppose; all along the vessel, I suppose—there were some powerful pumps and taking those 14 inches of water, in seasonable weather I should probably have stood by and seen whether I could have saved any of the lives, but it is hard to say what you would do on an occasion like this—she was a fairly strong vessel; I have seen stronger—it would take ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to get the steam launch over the side, and when launched she would have been useless—I cannot say whether the other boats could have been got out—a reasonably nimble crew if a boat is properly managed can get her out in about five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> To lower a boat the engines must be stopped, and the tide would carry the vessel away unless she was fitted with patent shifting gear which she was not—if the boats had gone away, perhaps the ship might have been in a reasonable condition of safety for some time; I cannot say for how long—if I had been placed in this position of emergency as captain, I should have thought no doubt that my vessel was in very great danger—I know nothing about any pumps, I merely examined the damage done—I do not suppose the crew would remain on board the whole time that the ship remained afloat, because she would have been going gradually down by the head all the time.</p>

I have not made a very distinct mark, that would occupy too much room—it is this left-hand cross—there are two or three crosses—the wreck is 1 mile and 9 cables from the Pier Head: it is given as 2 miles in the notice to mariners, but that is an approximate thing—I decimal 9 is right; that is 1 mile and 9-10ths—it would depend upon how long the ship was sinking how far she got after her engines were stopped—she would drift some distance—if the tide was set<lb></lb>ting E N E that would bring the vessel a very little nearer to the laud, almost parallel to the land—having got to the bottom she would never move afterwards—the state of the tide would not drive the <hi rend="italic">Franconia</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> out to sea—I have heard two or three different courses as that which the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> was making, that she was S W by S when left Dover, that she then altered half a point and made it 1/2 S—if the captain started S W by S to get into the offing, and when he saw the vessels approaching each other altered his course to S 1/2 S, that would be altering her course to the west; that would bring her head half a point to the westward—if the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi>, when she started from Dover, was a mile to the east of the Admiralty Pier she would get into the stream if she steered S W by S—I mean into the line of the tide; she would get decidedly to the west of the position she did, but not a great deal to the west—S W by S would bring her 2 miles to the south from the Pier Head—I think I said before the Coroner "If the <hi rend="italic">Strathclyde</hi> left a mile east of Dover Pier she would get into the position she has if steering S W by S; if half a mile off the pier she might have come into the same position, but if east of the pier, she could not."</p>

The result of that would be that if the tide was running straight she might get somewhere near that spot, and if she started straight away from the pier she would have been at a distance from the land <hi rend="italic">two</hi> miles eastwards.</p>

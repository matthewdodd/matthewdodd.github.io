            . Q. Are you a porter in the employ of Messrs. Marsh - A. I am delivering porter to Messrs. Marsh, at the Bull inn, Bishopsgate street. - On the 8th of October I had a parcel to deliver to Messrs. Simpson and Pitfold; I think at No. 132, Aldermanbury they did live; I took the parcel to deliver to the house; when I got there they were removed to Noble street; I went back to the waggon, which stood in Aldermanbury, and carried the parcel in my arms till I came to <placeName id="t18081126-26-crimeloc137">Wood street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it there - A. No, it was not; I did not see the parcel till I went to Guildhall. I am positive it is the same.</p>

            . Q. Did the last witness bring you the parcel to your master's waggon - A. Yes, he brought it and put it in the waggon in Wood street; I took the parcel and put it farther in the waggon; I am waggoner; I placed it as I thought it could not fall out; the waggon is wood at the bottom and rails at the side. I looked for the parcel when the last witness came back; it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when he went with the parcel - A. I turned the waggon round; and stood by it till he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the parcel again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it - A. It was after dark, it might be half after six, or a little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the parcel since - A. I have seen it at Guildhall, I thought it was the same parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Can you read or write - A. I can. I am not much of a scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. The waggon was standing in an open street - A. Yes, in Wood street.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he was gone, and before he returned again, had you been talking to any body during the time - A. No, I do not know that I spoke to any body; I did not perceive any body come to the waggon; I stood towards the hind part of the waggon; it was so dark that a person might have taken it out of the waggon without my seeing it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body when you was in the shop - A. When I was standing at the street door window I saw a man looking in; he walked past the shop window, and then stood at the corner of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The man that stands there at the bar: in about two or three minutes afterwards he came in and asked for the parcel, he said if you please, sir, will you give me the parcel that a drunken man has thrown into your yard.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchmaker living in Wood street - A. I am. I received the parcel from the last witness a little after six, it was not seven; I just cast the string from one end, I copied the address of Messrs. Simpson and Pitfold, and then I sent the child to inform them I particularly wanted to see them; the child says, there is a man looking in at the window; I said ask him what he wants; he opened the door and then vanished; either him or another came in a minute, when he began in a pitiful tone of voice, half crying, stooping his head, as though the light offended his sight; I had a large candle in my hand; I did not tell him that I saw the parcel, or knew any thing of it. I asked him the description of the parcel, begging him to come farther in the passage, I would get the parcel if it was there; he did not give me a satisfactory answer to that and several questions I put to him; I bid the girl shut the door; he stood with his feet in such a position that the child could not shut the door; he said, he hoped for God's sake I would give him the parcel, he should lose his place, and he employed it for the sake of his wife and family. Upon several questions which I put to him he could not describe the parcel which I had seen, when I peremptorily told the child to shut the door; at that moment he made a run from the door, I shoved the child back and pushed out, and with the candle in my hand I pursued him and cried stop thief; he took down Wood street, turned down Love lane, made a small turn to the right, and then to the left into Love lane again, where he was taken; I never lost sight of him; I once laid hold of his coat. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe to his lordship what is the situation of your yard and the height of the wall - A. The side of my house is a common thoroughfare, next a small passage; my wall may be eight or nine, or ten feet, it is a common passage to Staining lane, Falcon square; it immediately leads from Wood street to Oat lane; it is called Bull Head passage.</p>

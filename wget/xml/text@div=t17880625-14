               <p>Was any thing said to you before you was knocked down? - There was nothing said at all that I heard, I was stunned with the blow.</p>
               <p>What was you knocked down with? - I took it to be a fist, they both held me down and rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>What did they take from you? - My watch, a crown piece, and 6 s. 6 d. in silver; the handkerchief off my neck, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No, I could not, being stunned with the blow; I laid there for half an hour, and never could see any more of them.</p>
               <p>The men ran away? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk? - A little, but not so drunk but I could remember something of it.</p>
               <p>Did the man that knocked you down come behind you, or on one side of you, or meet you? - They met me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the person that met you before he struck you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the persons so as to know them? - Yes, I knew them directly as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - Not very dark.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch again? - Yes, my wife found it as a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>How long were they rifling your pockets? - Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250023"></xptr>Had you ever seen the people before? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then can you take upon yourself to know the people again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were not you frightened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that fright, being in liquor and stunned with the blow, two men you had never seen before, and in the night, can you pretend to say you know them again? - I know something of them.</p>
               <p>When did you see the men again? - This was on the 25th, I saw them at the Justice's on the 27th.</p>
               <p>For that two days you had not seen them? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Place. Will you venture to swear I was the man that knocked you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that, if you saw neither of them till after you were struck? - I did not remember them till afterwards.</p>
               <p>But how can you tell if you are knocked down by a man that you don't see, and rifled by another, how can you say which it was that knocked you down? - I believe that was the man and I always shall.</p>
               <p>But I want to know the reason of your belief? - I am sure he knocked me down, and the other rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harris. Did you ever see me before? - Never before you picked my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the person? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; I had an information that two sweeps had knocked down a man on the Sunday night; I went on the 27th to the prisoner's lodgings, they lodge together in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's, I found Place at home, I told him I wanted him, he said what for; I told him for a robbery; I tied his hands, and seeing a box in the room I asked him whose it was, he said it was Harris's; the box was opened and I found twenty shillings and a duplicate of a watch. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>To Tomlinson. Is that your duplicate? - It is.</p>
               <p>PLACE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at a public-house; this young man came in and chucked down a guinea and asked me to drink with him, which I did, he said he had found a prize, I asked him what, and he said a watch, and, that he had pawned it for twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>HARRIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found it under some mud early in the morning, I had it several hours, I did not know what to do with it, and I pawned it; the prosecutor said before the Justice that he could not swear to us.</p>
               <p>To Billing. Did you say that before the Justice? - I did, I thought to have my property again without any farther trouble.</p>
               <p>Then you chose to swear falsely to save yourself trouble? - I swore nothing that was not true.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to them better now than you could then? - I have recollected since.</p>

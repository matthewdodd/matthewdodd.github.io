ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at these papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These are cards given out daily to the bellman, to mark the amount of postage they receive for paid letters—these cards have been delivered to the prisoner, and brought back by him on the 18th, 20th, and 21st of February—here are three inland letters on the 18th, charged 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was his duty to deliver in that account every day, but it has been occasionally omitted—I have searched for the prisoner's account of the 19th of February, and cannot find it.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">HOWLETT</hi>. I have the custody of the cards—I searched on Satur<lb></lb>day</p>

               <p>night, for one of the 19th, of the prisoner's—I looked hack for about nine months, hut could not find it.</p>

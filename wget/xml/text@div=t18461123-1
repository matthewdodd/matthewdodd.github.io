                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my mother, at Connaught-terrace, Edgeware-road. On Saturday the 18th of July, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times—(read</hi>—"Wanted, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two weeks, on the deposit of securities worth 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not bulky, by a respectable person, who will give a note of hand for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Apply, by letter, Free, Mr. Craven, 29, Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square")—in consequence of that I wrote to the address—on the Monday the prisoner came to my house, produced my note, and asked me if I wrote that—I said, "Yes"—he said he was the person who wanted to borrow 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took him into the room where my mother was, and asked him what his security was?—he said they were tea-warrants, and took them from his pocket-book—we said we did not understand them—he said if we would allow him he would explain them to us, as to the value of them—he said they were for tea which was lying in the docks, and that the warrants were worth 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said they were equal to bank notes—the warrants specified the weight of the tea—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—he said the tea was sold at the grocers' shops at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—that they were perfectly good, and that on the prompt day he had drawn the warrants for the true weight of the tea; and as to the payment, there was nothing to pay on them on getting the tea—he said he was a tea-dealer, and that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was nothing to speculate with him, as we had alluded to the interest—he said, oh, he could make 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-day by it, and if he was obliged to sell the tea he must sell it at a reduced price, which would hurt the trade—I at last advanced him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and signed a paper which he wrote—I do not know what became of it—I did not have it.</p>

               <p>question to refer to the newspaper not to the agreement—that was after the close of the transaction altogether—I advanced him two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and he gave me this promissory-note—before I gave him the money I said we should want a stamp—he took his pocket-book from his pocket, and said, "Oh, I carry stamps, I am in the habit of doing business in that way," drew the stamp out, and wrote upon it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it—read</hi>—"20th July, 1840. 14 days after date I promise to pay Miss C. F. White, or order, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., value received.—<hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM WILMOT</hi>, 20, Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square.")—on that I gave him the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he folded the warrants up in a piece of paper, and said, "Oh, I will seal them, and put my crest on them," taking a ring from his finger, he put his crest on them, and delivered them to me—these are the three warrants—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—he then said, "I will merely write out this little paper as a memorandum, that when I come you will deliver up these warrants—he then wrote out the paper, which I signed—he said he lived at No. 20, Grafton-street, Fitzroy<lb></lb>square, as was on the promissory-note—the note was not paid on the day it became due—I went to Grafton-street, took the note with me, and inquired for the prisoner, and was not able to find him—a woman opened the door—I asked for Mr. Wilmot—she said he had left there, and was gone out of town—next day I sent again, and the answer was he had gone to America, that the case was hopeless, and I was not able to see him—I have never received any part of my money back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Clarke and Co., of Arthur-street, tea-dealers—I obtained these warrants from Mr. Knight, Miss White's solicitor—I took them to the East India China Tea-warehouse, and examined the tea—it is Bohea, which is very common tea—it is Bohea tea, which has undergone a process to dye it, to make it appear green, but in fact it is black tea—it is common black tea disguised.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the difference between Hyson and Bohea when both are young? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never witnessed the growth of either, but there is a great difference when it comes into this country—black and green tea are the pro<lb></lb>duce of two different plants—it is not all the same tea prepared differently—young Hyson is green, and old Hyson would be green also—a person ac<lb></lb>quainted with tea would not be likely to mistake this for young Hyson—it is impossible.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you take the warrants yourself to the warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went with them—Mr. Knight banded them to me—the warehouse-keeper produced the chests of tea, on my producing the warrants—the chests did not appear to have been broken—nothing appeared taken from them—tea warrants are of value—they are negotiated to an enormous extent—a tea-warrant may go through 100 hands, even if the tea is bad—if tea warrants were brought to me I should take care to sample the tea before I had any<lb></lb>thing to do with them—warrants are frequently passed from hand to hand without sampling, when the teas are put up at public sales with printed cata<lb></lb>logues—these have been put up at public sale.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the value ascertained by the printed catalogue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, When put up for public sale, they are either sold, and then the price is known in the trade, or they are withdrawn at certain prices fixed by the broker, or at times without any price at all, but the trade can sample each lot—when these were sold there was no price attached to them—I know that, having referred to our catalogue—they came from Singapore, and were no doubt imported for sale—I believe the charge for bringing tea from China and landing it here is</p>

               <p>equal to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—there are about 50 lbs. in a chest—we have no reason to suppose it has got damaged by keeping—tea is not forfeited if the duty or dock charges are paid within a certain time—there is a period called "prompt," which is three months after the sale—the duties are not compelled to be paid then, but the teas are to be paid for—these must have been paid for, or the warrants would not have been issued, if they sold at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound it would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a chest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal tea-clerk at the East India China Tea-warehouse.

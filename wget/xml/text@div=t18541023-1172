                  </hi>. My dwelling house is in the parish of Saint paul's Deptford. On 4th Oct., I went out about 2 o'clock, and returned about 2 minutes after 5 o'clock. When I went out, I secured the house, and fastened the outer door with a padlock—there was nobody left in the house—on my return, I found that the outer door, which gives access to the other part of the house, had been broken open—the padlock was gone—there was a staple in the door, and if was wrenched off, which released the fastening—I went up stairs, and found the whole of the things in the box and cupboard, and other places, strewed all over the room—I missed my blue trowsers, and spoons, and sugar tongs, and a piece of bacon—they were all safe when I left the house—I did not miss my other trowsers till the middle of the night—I had seen them safe on the Sunday previous—these</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Charles-street, Deptford—I am a dealer in clothes. On 9th Oct., the prisoner came into my shop and asked me to buy a pair of trowsers—I told him I would look at them; I looked at them; I said they were of no value to me; they were of the wrong make, and likewise there was no lining in them—they had been darned—I said they were only fit to cut up for patches—he threw them on the floor, and said he would sell them for sixpence—they are the trowsers which the officer has produced—I hung them out at the door for sale; the owner of the property was passing, and he came into my shop—I gave them to the officer.</p>

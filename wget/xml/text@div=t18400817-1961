                  </hi>. The prisoner was my servant—I saw what money my father-in-law put into his purse, two or three times, and on the 11th of July, about twelve o'clock at night, I counted the money in his purse—next morning 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were missing—after speaking to the pri<lb></lb>soner, I determined to have the plate counted, and sent for a policeman, and left him in the pantry with the prisoner—he said several times he had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. about him—the policeman afterwards gave me some in<lb></lb>formation, and I said to him "How is this, you told me you had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., when here is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on you," which the policeman said bad fallen out of his boot—he said it slipped down his trowsers—I asked why he did not tell me he had it about him—he said it was money he bad saved to buy some shoes.</p>

I am an accountant—I was employed by the bankrupt after the adjudication, and before the choice of assignees—I was afterwards appointed by the Court to assist the bankrupt in preparing the necessary accounts for the assignees—the bankrupt divided his books into two classes: first, those that have reference to the Greenwich business; and second, those that have reference to the railway—in respect of the Green<lb></lb>wich business, there was a mass of books and papers—in regard to the rail<lb></lb>way business, here is a bill-book, which contains the railway account of his bills payable and receivable, and also an account of the shares and debentures in the railway—I have had Mr. Cadogan's account—first I produce the bill-book</p>

               <p>relative to books in Italy; as to vouchers I can, but I cannot recollect anything about books—he said he would write to Collins for the vouchers, and they should come over—that was not very long before the last meeting, I think in the early part of May—I have not spoken to him since that—he has not furnished me with any document since his visit to Italy—in this account of Collins, I find a great number of entries running over a great many thousand francs, for the purchase of land—I have not made any inquiries of the bankrupt about the payments for the acqui<lb></lb>sition of land—when we requested the vouchers to be sent, we stopped our labours—he has not given us any vouchers for those accounts—he has not given us any voucher for a single item throughout the whole of Collins' account—we have had numerous conversations with the bankrupt about the land—he has not given us any information, or any document of title to show where the land is, or what has become of it.</p>

I was the assistant-manager to the bankrupt, in King William-street—I took the financial department—I was there from the middle of February, 1861, till February, 1862, up to the bankruptcy—during that time materials to a large extent were sent out to Italy for the purposes of the railway; iron, timber, and fastenings, to an amount ap<lb></lb>proaching 20,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—money was also sent out to Italy to a large amount, for the use of the railway—it was sent out to the bankrupt, and to his agent there, Mr. Charles Collins, for the purpose of carrying out the railway con<lb></lb>tract—more than 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went through my hands to Italy, in cash—that extended from the month of May until October—I think it ceased in October—I had the obtaining of the money on shares and debentures on almost all of them, and the money that was obtained came into my hands—all the money that I have spoken of was raised on debentures and shares, by sale, loan, and deposit—all the business in England connected with the railway was carried on at the office in King William-street, and in Italy, Charles Collins represented the bankrupt—Frank Collins was associated with me, as a manager—I found him engaged in the office when I went, and he continued there—he attended to all the correspondence, and to the shipping of the goods to Italy—Mr. William Collins, another brother, was also engaged there, and one or two other clerks—the bankrupt was con<lb></lb>tinually passing to and fro between Italy and England—when in England, he was constantly at the office in King William-street—we did not keep books of account there—there were really no proper books kept—there was my own account, which I have delivered in—that contained all the cash raised upon the securities—there was also a telegram-book, a letter-book, and a bill-book; there was no cash-book—my cash account was mere ab<lb></lb>stracts from my private banking account—I was careful to pay everything through a banking account, that I might at all times prove it—I made out the account I spoke of from the bank-book—the account was kept in my own name; it was my own private account—I had strict instructions from the bankrupt to pay all moneys into my account, and draw from it any moneys that he required—it was very soon known what was mine and what was his—mine was limited—the whole did not belong to him—there was no difficulty in knowing about that, whether it was large or small—I could tell by marking my entries in my books, that was all, in the banker's pass<lb></lb>book, and in the cheque-book—I looked after the bank-book; it was in my</p>

               <p>that was merely in waiting to see Mr. Preston; my eye caught upon it—I had never seen it before, and knew nothing of it—I spoke to the bankrupt about it afterwards; he told me it was to prevent the Railway Company getting possession of the goods that he had given this lien upon them—he told me that the company were making a claim against him, and that he was making a large claim against them—I have heard that the amount of their claim against him was fifty odd thousand—I think that was before he spoke of this deed; that is my impression—I think the bankrupt went to Italy about 21st December, and then returned, and went again about 6th January—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of my book—Mr. Buckwell went to Italy either on 21st December or the day after—he returned very quickly, I know—to the best of my belief, it was about the 8th or 9th of January that he went to Italy again—he was here on 5th February, and he was here the first week in January.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not on the 1st of January that you received the paper, that you spoke of just now, which made you more attentive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What makes me rather careful about it is this: there were two papers on bankruptcy, one just previous to the other, within a fortnight of each other; the first was settled by the bankrupt before he went to Italy the last time but one; and this one, on which the bankruptcy was really completed, came within a week or two afterwards—I have no actual recollection of calling his atten<lb></lb>tion to that piece of paper when he was in England the first week in January, but I am sure to have done it—the second paper of which I spoke was delivered between 8th and 9th of January; I must have called his attention to that if I saw him—it was either that or the previous paper that made me more particular—he had the papers in the bag on one of the two journeys; but the difficulty in my mind is, to say whether it was the one or the other—I know it was within a few weeks of the actual bank<lb></lb>ruptcy—at the time the papers were put in the bag, there was this dispute with the company—the bankrupt was being pressed by them—he was pressed by this notice in bankruptcy, besides the dispute with the company—he was pressed by other persons—I am not aware that Mr. Wood was pressing him—he had a loan with Mr. Wood, but I don't think he was pressing him—he was paying off that loan by small instalments, but in a friendly manner—I gather from my books that he was paying 60 per cent on that loan; he was paying it off by degrees—Mr. Wood was a creditor when I first went to Mr. Buckwell's, and he continued so up to the end—there are several entries of payments, the last one is on 2d January, 1862; bills were renewed for one month, and the interest was 5 per cent. for the month—the whole amount of the debt was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I first went, and it was reduced to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 2d January, it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not all paid off; there is a claim now of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last payment was on 2d January—Messrs. Price and Bowstead, the petitioning creditors here, were also pressing him, on account of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was by letter, and they also applied to me personally for money—that was three or four months before they issued out the bankruptcy proceedings—I gave them debentures and shares, and they gave some three months time or something of that sort; that time expired, the money was not paid, and they took proceedings in bankruptcy—they could get the debentures registered, but the company would not allow the shares to be transferred; they would not register the transfer—at the time these papers were put in the bag, the bankrupt's credit was stopped, from his dispute with the company; they had refused to go on with their advances to him—subsequent to the bankruptcy, they</p>

               <p>alleged that the shares were improperly obtained; I did not hear that before—he was being pressed for money at that time, and could not raise it with<lb></lb>out securities; he had not securities—I was the recipient of a gratuity of 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares—I was to have had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year salary, but I never received 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I have only received, as my books show, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the other goes into a matter of account; I have an account against it—the shares that I had were to the nominal amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not the market-value.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). Messrs.

               <p>—Collins would be more familiar with that part of the amount of shares was given to Mr. Hoffman, as security for the timber, and that was arranged in that way—Anderton's claim was arranged by deben<lb></lb>tures, and with regard to Captains Hay and Jameson, they have debentures in their possession to twice the amount of their claim—the General Discount Company had no security, but it was a very much reduced account; it was nearly paid off—Sewell has been settled with, Masterman's not, but they have a very large quantity of shares deposited with them, representing in value the full amount, supposing they could be sold at their nominal value—Captains Hay and Jameson's security was debentures—they were pressing for their money, notwithstanding they had been deposited—the Novara and Lake Orta Railway Company have refused to allow the shares to be dealt with, not the debentures—there was a dispute between the bankrupt and the Company as to their right to interfere—the bankrupt claims a large amount of the Company, and the Company make a claim of him of about the same amount—he disputed their right to interfere with the transfer of the shares—if his claim on the Company had been paid, there would have been plenty to discharge all these claims.</p>

I was employed by the bankrupt, at 26, King William-street—my duties chiefly referred to the contracts and correspondence, from the commencement of Mr. Buckwell's contract for making the railway—I was acquainted with him before; I had some few dealings with him, that was all—I corresponded with Charles Collins, who represented Mr. Buck<lb></lb>well in Italy—I corresponded with him under the control and with the sanction of Mr. Buckwell—that was for the most part of 1861—I received not only letters but telegraphic messages from him, and also frequently sent them to him in the middle of the year—some of the messages received from him were kept in the office, and in some instances copies were kept of those I sent to him—there was a telegram-book kept in the office, supplied by the telegraph company—letters which came from Charles Collins, on Mr. Buck<lb></lb>well's account, were also kept in the office—copies of some of those sent to him were entered in a letter-book, probably the great bulk of them—I very frequently used to write without keeping a copy—if I sent any letter of importance, of course I should have it copied—the letter-book was kept in the office—there was no other book kept in the office besides the tele<lb></lb>gram-book and the letter-book, except the bill-book; I mean in my office, in the office generally—Mr. Buckwell had a banking account at Master<lb></lb>man's; that was besides the one that Mr. Cadogan had; it was at the same banker's, Masterman—the account was in Mr. Buck well's name before Mr. Cadogan was associated with him; that was up to the spring of 1861—Mr. Buckwell's account then virtually ceased, and Mr. Cadogan's account commenced—I had an account at the Bank of London—there was money which was paid on Mr. Buckwell's account, paid into my account; it was my account—money received for matters connected with Mr. Buckwell was very frequently paid into my bank—as I received them I paid them in to my account, some sums; and then I drew out that account when I wanted to pay matter for Mr. Buckwell and for myself—the account was so situated that generally the moneys I received on the part of Mr. Buckwell were, in fact, due to myself; therefore it was my account—I don't say that was always the case—he was generally in my debt, for advances and salary—my appointment with Mr. Buckwell was at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, at first—my position was improved nominally afterwards—I tendered my resignation to Mr. Buckwell on two occasions, and at the time of the formation of the</p>

Price &amp; Bowatead pressing; I went down to Mr. Preston's about that—I think it is very likely that I mentioned that to Mr. Buckwell as soon as he came from Italy, but I have no particular recollection of doing so—I was very little with Mr. Buckwell at that time, and saw very little of him—I don't know what has become of the letters since the bankruptcy; they came from Charles Collins, addressed to me—I gave them to Mr. Buckwell from time to time, as they arrived; I would rather not specify the number; there were a number, twenty or thirty probably—I handed them all over to Mr. Buck<lb></lb>well without reading or opening them; they were for him under cover to me—I handed him the telegrams also, if there were any—when he was in England I did not open the letters—he was occasionally at the office after the bankruptcy, and elsewhere among his friends—part of the time he was living with me—a considerable part of the time he was in the North—his</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you mean that it was your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had an independent business besides my connexion with Mr. Buckwell—he had the greater part of the office—I considered one room mine more especially, but he had the run of the whole—before he was engaged by this railway, we occupied these rooms, each paying a moiety of the expense, and so it re<lb></lb>mained until he took other offices at the same place; he had some additional rooms, still continuing to have the use of a portion of mine and to pay half the expense, in fact, he undertook to pay all the expenses; as he went on a little further in 1861, the business got more flourishing—to the best of my belief a great number of the letters which had been in the letter-book were handed over to the assignees—my attention was drawn to it by a letter some time after the messenger had been—I then gave the letter-books bodily to Mr. Buckwell, who I heard give instructions to his clerk, Mr. Raftery, to endorse them and send them to the assignees—I do not know of any letters which at that time were not sent to the assignees—I have not since seen what letters were in the possession of the assignees—I don't remember any particular occasion when the bankrupt took away letters with him to Italy; he took some on all occasions—I did not mean to infer that there was one occasion in particular—I don't remember any particular time when a large number were taken.</p>

Collins, Borgo Maniero, to the directors of the Novara and Lake Orta Railway Company—that is not a machine-copy but a hand-copy, with the word "copy" in the margin—here is an original letter from Charles Collins to Frank Collins, but that has no appearance of being torn out of a book—I saw nothing having the appearance of being torn out—we have a list here of the bundles—here is a bundle headed "letters and copies, Charles Collins, Italy"—none of these have the appearance of being torn out of a book—this is a copy by hand of a letter from Charles Collins to Mr. Buckwell, in London—I don't see any copies of letters from London to Charles Collins—several of these</p>

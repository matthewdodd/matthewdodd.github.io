                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and did live at Shannon-terrace, Dalston. I now live at Gloucester—on 13th Jan., between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in Petticoat-lane—a Jew stood at my back, or at my side, and the prisoner was slightly in advance of me, with something in his hand, wrapped up in thin paper, for which the Jew offered first 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; then 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he would not let him have it—the Jew was rattling money in his hand—I walked on—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "Will you buy it?"—I said, "What?"—he said, "It is a valuable gold curb chain"—I asked to see it—he looked about, and begged of me great secrecy, and went through a passage, I following him—he then handed me this chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that it was sixteen carat gold, and weighed 2ozs. all but 1 dwt.—he asked 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; for it—I told him I had not got suffi<lb></lb>cient money with me to purchase it, and that it was too much—he offered it to me for 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then went to keep an appointment which I had—he accompanied me as far as Aldgate—I said that I should not be more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he waited till I returned—I was then going to keep another appointment in the Strand, and as he was still very urgent to sell the chain, he accompanied me—during the journey I inquired of him how he became possessed of it; he said that he was employed at a manufacturing goldsmith's in the City, where they had taken stock the week previous, and by that means he was able to abstract gold chains and guards for the next twelve months without being detected—he entreated me to keep secrecy, and said that if he could depend upon me, it would be many pounds in my pocket—I kept my appointment in the Strand, and he then went with me to St. John-street-road—during the walk, I appointed to meet him at 8 o'clock in the evening, at the corner of New Inn Yard, Shoreditch, to purchase the chain—as soon as I parted with him, I informed police inspector Townsend, at the Hoxton station—in the evening I kept the appointment; the prisoner was there to a moment—he came up, and asked me if I was prepared to buy the chain—I said, "Certainly," and took him into the Bishop Blaze tavern—I went in first, at his request, for the purpose of seeing whether there was anybody there, as, if there was, we were not to go in—I told him that there was no one there, and we went in—the landlord came, and I ordered some porter—when he was gone, the prisoner handed me the chain—when the landlord was about to bring in the porter, the prisoner snatched the chain back, and said, "There is nothing like secrecy in these matters"—immediately afterwards two officers came in; one of them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185702020066"></xptr>
               <p>asked me what I did there—I told him I had come to purchase a chain of this person, which was represented as sixteen carat gold, and weighed 2 ozs. all but 1 dwt.—he asked the prisoner for the chain, but he refused to give it up—they took him into custody, secured his hands, and took the-chain out of his left hand pocket—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 492). On 13th Jan., about 8 o'clock in the evening, I and another officer went to a public house in New Inn Yard, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor—I took the prisoner into custody, and told him that I took him for being in possession of a counterfeit chain—he did not produce it, and I put my hand into his pocket, and drew it out—there was only one there—this is it—he said outside the door, "You must be a child, don't you know it is a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>?"—that is a slang term, which I understand means something spurious—I said, "I don't know that it is" he said, "Tell him you are satisfied, give me the chain, I will sell it to him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you shall have half a sovereign for your trouble"—I told him I did not do business in that manner, and took him to the station.</p>

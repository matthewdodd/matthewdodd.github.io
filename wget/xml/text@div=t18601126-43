                  </hi>. I am a carpenter of New Milman-street—on 19th March, I was going into Russell-street with some work—the prisoner was standing on a step, and said, "How do you do?" I said, "You have the ad<lb></lb>vantage of me; I do not know you"—he said, "I have known you for years; my brother kept the Blue Lion public-house, Blue Lion Yard;"—I said, "Well, I cannot stop," and went on—as I came back he was still standing there—he said, "You have not been long"—I said, "No;"—I walked on, and he followed me—he said he was waiting there on business—that he had bought a horse of a quaker for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had paid it to the groom, and when the groom took the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. home to his master, the master said it was twenty guineas; and that the groom had gone to see what he could do with his master about it—directly he said that, he said, "Here he comes;" and the groom came across the road, dressed as a stableman—he had a broadish brimmed hat on, more like a quaker's than anything else—the prisoner said, "What did the old man say?" he said, "He says you shall not have it at all now; I am to sell it for twenty guiness, but not to sell it to you"—he then said that he did not know what he should do, for he had sold the horse to a dealer for thirty guineas, and he-must have it—as he walked down Guilford-street we had to pass a livery stable, where there is what they call a ride—we went about three parts of the way down to see the horse, and he turned round to me and said, "I do not know that I need trouble you to see the horse, because I want the horse for the gentleman that I sold it to"—my house is at the corner of New Milman-street, the Portland Arms public-house is opposite—we went there and had a pot of ale, which I paid for; he pretended to give me the money to pay for the ale—he had a large pocket-book full of notes, and if they were genuine, there must have been at least 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he kept handing a note or two to me to pay for the horse—to give t it to the groom for him, who was present with us—the groom kept saying, "No; I will not run the risk of losing a good situation for you, but if this person will pay the money to you, I will pay him again, and I will go and transfer the horse into your name"—that was so that his master should not know that he had sold it to me—he kept pressing me to buy it, because he' said he had sold it for thirty guineas, and he should lose the money—I went home to ray house, directly opposite—they both went with me—I went down stairs, and took the money out of a drawer, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, having received a bill in the morning—Wilson counted the money and said that it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I counted it over and found that I had taken two half-sovereigns for sovereigns—they both handled the money, but I don't know which of them put it in their pockets—I have never seen it since—they" said, "Now come along up to Yeoman's, and I will give the horse into your possession;" I gave my son the candle, and before I could get up stairs, it being the corner house, they were both gone—I rather think that both took some of the money.</p>

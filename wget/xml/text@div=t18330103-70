            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gilbert-street. The prisoner came to my shop on the evening of the 24th of December, about seven o'clock, and wished to dispose of a silver mug, and three silver tops belonging to a dressing-case; I inquired whose property they were; she said her own, and they had been given her - I think she said by a lady's maid, whose name she mentioned, but which I forget - she gave me her own address at No. 25, James-street - I sent my young man there; they said they knew her very well, and she was a very respectable woman; but I did not feel satisfied, and sent for a Police officer - I think these articles are worth 25s. as old silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to James-street? A. No - the prisoner did not say it was her brother's house; she did not wish to pawn these articles - she went to James-street with my young man.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 3.) I took the prisoner - these articles were on the counter; I asked her how she came by them - she said they were given her by Fanny Baptiste, who had formerly lived in Green-street, Grosvenor-square, but she could not tell the number, and who was now gone to Russia or Prussia; she said she had known her for two months - I asked her where she herself lived; she said at No. 51, James-street; I went there, and found she had a lodging, and a few things there - I found on her 1l. 2s. 6d. and a bottle - and at the watch-house the inspector saw something on the floor, which turned out to be this silver lace band; I asked if she had any more plate - she said Yes, she had a silver spoon in her box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you at first doubted whether these articles belonged to the gentleman? A. I never doubted about this top of the tooth-brush glass; I did not tell Mrs. Marsh that I should be better able to tell if I went back and looked at the cupboard - Mrs. Marsh told me the prisoner had been taken; she supposed, for trying to pawn some articles belonging to Mr. Bosanquet; I said if she had only been going to pawn them I should take no notice of it, as I thought she might intend to restore them - she said she could not tell what the articles were; she said she thought it was the silver lid of a sugar dish - I said I did not recollect such an article; this mug has the initials of one of Mr. Bosanquet's children on it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I let the back attic to the prisoner on the 22d of December, at 4 s. a week, ready furnished - there was a flat iron among other things; she left on the Saturday week following; she has not made any payment, nor given notice. She left the room locked, and took the key; we opened the door, and the room was stripped of almost every thing. The articles stated in the indictment were let with the lodging. Last Tuesday week I met her in St. Giles's, and brought her down to Mr. Gaddis's house - the officer was sent for.</p>

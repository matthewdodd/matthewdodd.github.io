            . I am a setter in the employ of the prosecutors. The prisoner was a setter; on Monday the 10th of October, the prisoner asked me if I was going out; I said I should go out and have a pint of beer at one o'clock. The prisoner said he would do the same. Some of the men were gone to dinner; they lived thereabouts. No one was left in the field but the prisoner and me. I returned in about three quarters of an hour; the prisoner was not there; he did not come to work no more in the course of that day. There is a place in the field where these pieces were put when they were dry, and they are left until we have done work.</p>

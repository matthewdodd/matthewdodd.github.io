On 7th Aug., about half-past 1 o'clock, I was in Great Winchester-street—I saw the prisoner in the passage of a house, which is let for offices, looking at this coat—I lost sight of him for a moment, and then saw him come from a doorway under the staircase with this bag, and the coat in it—he went to 36, Old Broad-street, and came out again in about a minute with the bag in his hand—he went towards the Exchange—I stopped him, and asked what he had in his bag—he said it was no business of mine—I said I was a policeman, and I wished to know—he said it was a coat he had bought in the street, and he would show me where—he wanted to take me to Petticoat-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Sadler, Harris, and Co., in Austin Friars. This is my coat; it had no business in Great Winchester-street—I never sold it, or parted with it to a person in Petticoat-lane—I had it on 7th Aug.—I took' it off at 11 o'clock in the morning, when I was going out, and I left it in the office—it is my office coat—I returned about 1; I do not know whether it was then gone; I did not look for it; I did not miss it till the policeman came, about 3—I left the office-door open when I returned at 1, and I went down-stairs—it was locked till 1—when I came back I unlocked it—the office is about two minutes' walk from Great Winchester-street—my name is in the coat, and there is a piece of paper in the pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went down Petticoat-lane to purchase a coat; I bought this one of an old man, with a white coat on; it exactly fitted me; I did not know whether it was stolen or not.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ewbank, of Black heath-terrace—I am now in the service of a lady in Black heath-park—about a fortnight after my first seeing the prisoner I met him again as I was out on an errand—he told me he had lost my ad<lb></lb>dress, which was the reason he had not written to me before—I met him repeatedly afterwards by his solicitation—he made proposals of marriage to me, in consequence of which I purchased some property of two persons named Moore and Jennings—the prisoner went with me to Moore's on the 10th of February, and I purchased a bed, bolster and pillows, blanket, table-cloth, carpet, counterpane, six knives and forks, and six silver tea<lb></lb>spoons, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner proposed taking the things to the room of a friend of his named Jennings, there to remain till we were married—we were to live there when married—he was to take the room when Jen<lb></lb>nings left it—I saw the things taken to Jennings' house, and put into Jennings' custody—the prisoner was with me—I also purchased a bed, bedstead, a clock, half a dozen pictures, four chairs, three saucepans, and a tea-kettle of Jennings for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down on account that evening, and he was to come over to Blackheath for the rest—on the Sunday evening following, the 14th of February, he and Jennings came together—the prisoner sent a note in to me—I went out, and he said he had come for the remainder of the money for the furniture—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Jennings for the furni<lb></lb>ture—I saw the prisoner again a week or nine days after, and have often met him since—about six weeks ago he said he had a furlough, that he was going into the country on account of some property that was left him by his aunt, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go down—I said I could not lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would lend him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did—I did not see him afterwards till I saw him at the police-court—my suspicions were excited, and I went to Jennings last Monday fortnight to inquire about the things I had deposited there, and they were all gone—I never gave the prisoner any authority to part with any of the things—I have since seen the table at the police-court at Woolwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soldier in the same regiment as the prisoner. I now live at Deal—at the time in question I lived in Wool<lb></lb>wich. Some goods were brought to my room by the prisoner and prose<lb></lb>cutrix, and placed in my custody to take care of—there was a bed, bolster, pillows, carpet, clock, and a good many things—I think the pro<lb></lb>secutrix had the knives and forks in her own possession—she did not leave them with me—she purchased 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of things from me, and paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account that same evening—she said she would give me the remain<lb></lb>ing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two days—I afterwards went with the prisoner to where she was in service to get the remainder of the money—he spoke to her privately—I saw her hand him some money, but I cannot tell what quantity—the prisoner afterwards told me that he would give me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the morning—he did not do so—in the morning he told me he would give it me in the evening</p>

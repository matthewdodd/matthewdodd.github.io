            . I am a watchman. On the 25th of September, about ten minutes before two o'clock in the morning, I was going by this house, and heard a noise; it appeared as if some one was entering the house, but when I got to the house I heard a noise of some one wrenching off the beading - I listened for ten minutes - the Policeman came up; I told him what I heard - he listened, and told me to wait there while he brought the serjeant and another Policeman - one stopped in front, and three of us went to the back; we saw a light in the back room - we opened the shutter, and saw Smith go out and run down the street - we went and took him, and saw Humbey when we came back; both the sashes were taken from the front parlour frames, and taken into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before had you seen them? A. Not for some months - the shutters were shut- I only went up there once a day; whether they had been unfixed before I cannot tell - it was not a very dark night - there was a light in the back parlour; I saw Smith go into the passage - I saw his back and his side face; he run out - we pursued about sixty yards and took him.</p>

She came one evening, and asked if she might sleep with me; we went out together about eight o'clock, she had the key, and left me in the street to return. I went home about one o'clock, I could not find her, but the door was open, every thing in confusion, and the things gone. She came back about 11 o'clock in the morning; I said, I was robbed, and could suspect nobody but her, she denied it. I said, I was sorry to charge her if it was not so, and if she would say where she had slept, I would go and enquire, and say no more about it. She sent me to a house in Soho-square. I gave her in charge that day.</p>

I asked what she had done with the things, and after hesitating, she said she sold them for 18 s. at Smith's, and took me there; I asked her for the money, she gave me half a sovereign, two half crowns, and 2 s. out of her shoe.</p>

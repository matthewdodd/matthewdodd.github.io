On the 11th of July, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, M'Kenzie came into the shop. Another customer was there. Only myself was serving. The other customer left the shop almost immediately, and another came in. M'Kenzie asked to see some common lace; I handed her some; none suited her; I shewed her several cards. The other customer being in a hurry, I reached her some satin which was behind me; I turned round to do so - she bought some. I then turned to the prisoner again; she said none of the lace suited her and left the shop; I had observed nothing, and had not seen Williams. About twenty minutes after the officer brought the prisoner in, and enquired if I had lost any lace. From the quantity we have I could not tell. He produced twenty-three yards which I knew by the shop-mark. M'Kenzie had bought none. The lowest value is 11 d. or 1 s. a yard.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of July I was in St. John-street, and saw the prisoners in company about a quarter of a mile from Sawyer's shop. I watched them into five different shops; sometimes one went in, and at others the other. I followed them to Sawyer's. M'Kenzie went in and Williams stood at the corner of the window. I could not see what M'Kenzie was doing. She came out and joined Williams - they walked away. I apprehended them about two hundred yards off, and found the lace in M'Kenzie's apron. Miller claimed it.</p>

               <p>Did you go with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - They did not ask me.</p>

               <p>How much was you to take for your trouble? - She did not promise me any thing particular; she said I should be satisfied.</p>

               <p>You read the direction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room at Mrs. Mould's at the time that the man came there? - Not that I know of; he enquired for her when he came in, and Mrs. Moulds sent for her.</p>
               <p>When she came, what happened then? - I do not know, I took no further notice, till she handed me the letter; I saw him give her the letter.</p>
               <p>Was the letter sealed, or unsealed? - Sealed.</p>
               <p>Did he tell her who it came from? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>What was in the letter? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What was there besides the letter? - There was a will in it.</p>
               <p>Whose will was it? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was a will? - When I read it, every body in the house said it was a will; I did not know it was a will till I was told it.</p>
               <p>You do not remember whose it was? - No.</p>
               <p>Look at that writing and tell me whether it is your hand, did you write that before my Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happens it that you, who have known this woman so long, should not know Mr. Mullens? - She has had two or three husbands while I knew her.</p>
               <p>You are not one of them, are you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Abel. Did you never receive a letter from her desiring you to come? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Edwin. Do you know who it was that brought the letter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Look at Mr. Patterson, and say whether that was him or not? - I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Can you say it was not? - It is so long ago I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Where was this woman's husband when the letter was delivered? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you never said it was Patterson that wrote the letter? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know how long Mrs. Moulds has kept that house? - While I was in London.</p>
               <p>How long is that? - About six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Court to Patterson. Was not you the person that brought this letter? - I was persuaded to say so at first.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether you did not deliver this letter to this woman at Moulds'? now take care before you answer it. - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not? - No.</p>
               <p>Is Mrs. Moulds here? I will read to you what the minutes are of your examination, and then I wish you to consider what answer you will give to me; you said you was born at Hippersley in Worcestershire; that you was on board the Eleanor brigg five years ago, is that true? - Yes.</p>

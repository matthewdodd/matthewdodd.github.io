                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and builder, at Bermondsey. On 8th Oct, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, the prisoner came and asked the price of laths—I told him—he said he should want between fire and six loads next week, but he had repairs at Dockhead and wanted half a load at once—he purchased half a load, and gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he said he was building some houses in the London-road—I asked him in what part, he said it was the second turning on the left hand side, leading from the Kent-road—he said he would send for the laths next day, but he did not until the day after—I asked him to write his name on the note, and saw him write, "Mr. Clark"—he omitted patting the address, I reminded him of it, and he gave it me, and I put it down as he stated, "Westmoreland-road, Newington"—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put my initials to it—I afterwards paid the note away, and it was returned to me stamped "forged"—that same day the prisoner called again, and said he wanted to see me about some more laths—I asked him what quantity he wanted—he said about a load, and he would call in the morning, and pay me for them—I told him that I could not find any person out of the name that he had written on the note, neither could I find out any buildings like those he described—he said he was right, and I must be mistaken—he seemed a little surprised and confused—I then told him that he had passed a bad note to me—he did not make any particular answer farther than he would take me to the person he had taken it of—I had a friend (Mr. Frost) in the house, because the prisoner had sent word that he was going to call, and I was prepared for him—he could not give any satisfactory account of himself, and I gave him in charge.</p>

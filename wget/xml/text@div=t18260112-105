            . I live in Golden-lane; I am errand boy to Mr. Phillips. I was in his shop about nine o'clock on the night of the 4th of January - the prisoner came in to bring some work home - he laid himself up against some shoes, and asked where the man was; I said in the cellar; a lady then came to be measured for a pair of boots - I called the man to measure her - there was no one else in the shop but the prisoner; when the lady left the man went into the cellar; the prisoner put out the gas, and went to the other side of the counter - he then went to go away, and I saw the boots in his basket; I said, "What have you got in your basket?" I ran and took hold of him, but could not hold him - he dragged me up an alley, where there was an officer - he then threw the boots down, and said "What do you want, I have got nothing." I told the officer to hold him, and I got the boots from the kennel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop he asked me which gas gave the best light; he turned off one, and told me to turn on the other - I turned it the wrong way; the man then came out of the cellar and put down my money in the book - when I was going out the witness came after me, and said, "What have you got in your basket?" I said, "Nothing but my mother's shop-book;" he then said, I should drag him as far as I could - and I took him up an alley; he then called for an officer, and said I had taken a pair of boots.</p>

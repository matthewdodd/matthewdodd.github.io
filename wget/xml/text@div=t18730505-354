I am a silk manufacturer, at Macclesfield—on the 12th April, I placed in a box fifteen dozen ties, and addressed it to Mr. Spall, of Cheapside—there were two boxes, one contained black neckties and the other coloured ties—they were delivered to the carrier at Macclesfield to be conveyed by the London and North Western Railway—we have been shown eighteen ties, which were part of those put in the box—I valued them at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private constable in the employ of the London and North Western Railway Company—on the 14th April, in consequence of instructions, I was watching the prisoner—he was the head checker of a gang—I saw him leave his gang and go into No.6 arch—this parcel was in No.6 arch, and I saw him go to it, take it up, and take out all of these pocket handkerchiefs and put one in each trowsers pocket—I think he saw some one coming—he dropped one by the side of him—I called him back, and asked him what he had been doing with the package—he said "No<lb></lb>thing"—I asked him if he had got anything about him that did not belong to him?—he said, no, he had not; he had got nothing—I took him to the policeman's box, and then told him to take the things out of his pocket—he took these two neckties out of his pocket, and laid them on the table—I told him I was surprised he should do that sort of thing—he said "he should not have done it, but he had got a small family of children, and he expected his wife would be confined soon"—I then told him I should take him into custody on the charge of stealing things belonging to the London and North Western Railway Company—I afterwards accompanied Copping to the prisoner's house, and we found a quantity of other goods—these ties completed the quantity there was in the invoice.</p>

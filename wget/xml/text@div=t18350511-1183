                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Heath-street, Stepney. On the 15th of April I was outside the White Swan, at Shad<lb></lb>well—I saw the prisoner and two mdre females, and the prosecutor and another seafaring man, all in conversation—a cab drove up, and I saw the prisoner put her hand to the prosecutor's right-hand jacket-pocket, and take something out—the policeman came up the minute after, and took the prisoner—he put his hand into her bosom and took out a small yellow watch—the prosecutor was rather intoxicated.</p>

I went up to the prisoner, and said, "Old girl, what have you got there?" seeing something shine between her fingers—she made use of some had expressions, and put her hand into her bosom—I put my hand in and found this watch, which the prosecutor claimed; but he did not then know he had lost it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I knew the prisoner before I went on my last voyage; I lived with her—I had a little yellow watch—I had never called it her little watch—on the day in question, I had it about me—the prisoner had no rigfct to take it—I never allowed her to use it—on the day this happened I was in liquor—I had no intention of giving her the watch—I never said I would.</p>

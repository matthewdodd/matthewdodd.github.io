'I live at 34, Portpool Lane, Gray's Inn Road, and am carman to John Camp, a bookbinder, of John Street, Clerkenwell—on 24th April, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was with a horse and cart, belonging to Mr. Camp—I went into Spottiswoode's, and left, the horse and cart outside—I was there about three minutes—when I came out it was gone—I ran down to the bottom of Stonecutter Street, to see whether I could see it, or whether it had strayed away—I then went to the Smith<lb></lb>field police-station, and gave information—I saw the horse and cart again about 4.45, in John Street, Clerkenwell, where I am employed; where my master lives—the prisoner and another young man were in the cart—the prisoner was driving—I stopped them as soon as I saw they passed the mews, where I was telling the circumstance to a friend of mine—I ran after them; they asked me what I wanted—I said "I will tell you, if you will stay a moment"—they asked me what I had to do with it—I tried to find a policeman—I could not, and they walked away—they were not in a hurry to get out of the cart—the man who was with me said "You go for an officer, and I'll mind the cart"—when he said that, the men got out and walked away—I followed them all down Exmouth Street, into Wood Street, and then they ran, and I ran after them—I saw the prisoner stopped by the officer—the horse and cart were worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

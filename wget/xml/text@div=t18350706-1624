I was butler to Lord Edward Somerset who was living at Lord John Thynne's—I recollect the candles being brought-two hours after they were delivered, a person came after them but did not have them and about half past six o'clock next morning the prisoner came for them and said he had come from Mr. Barclay-that he wanted the candles, for they ought to have been sent off into the country two days ago—he said they were sent there by mistake and he wanted them directly—I brought them up—he asked me how many there were of them—I said I did not know and he had better count them.</p>

On the 4th of June the prisoner came to me in Berkeley-square and said, I want you to fetch six papers for me; will you fetch them?"I said, "I cannot tell, you must tell me what they contain"—he said Barclay had sent six papers of candles to Lord Thynne's house by mistake and he said, "Will you fetch them for me and I will write you a note"—he took out his pocket book picked up a bit of paper and wrote this note on the step of No. 13—he said, "They will fetch 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will give you a sovereign if you will fetch them"—I said nothing to that—he went away, and I saw no more of him till he was ap<lb></lb>prehended-at six o'clock I went to the station-house and showed the inspector the note he wrote for me to go and fetch the candles.</p>

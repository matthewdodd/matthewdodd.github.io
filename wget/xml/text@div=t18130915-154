Branscomb was with me; we waited some time; he at one part of the yard, and I at the other; and after some time Levy came there, he went into the coach-office; I followed him in, from what I heard before. I asked the book-keeper if this was the gentleman who had left the bundle; he told me it was. I then asked Levy if he had not come for these two bags; he said, no. I asked the book-keeper if this was not the gentleman who generally paid for such things; he told me yes. I then told him that he must go with me; I took him to a public-house in Gracechurch-street; there I searched him; on him I found a pocketbook; I handed over the book to Branscomb, and while I was searching him further, Branscomb produced me a letter; I saw him take it out of the prisoner's pocket-book. (The letter read.) I read the letter, and told him there were facts to prove these things were directed to him; it corresponded with the weight. I said, I had facts that these were directed to him; he then, told me that he thought every thing that was sent up was fair, that was what he agreed for. I then asked him who he had them from; he said

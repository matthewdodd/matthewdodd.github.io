                  </hi>. I live at Uxbridge. On Tuesday evening, 5th Feb., about six o'clock, I hung out a shift to dry, and in about ten minutes missed it from the line—I went to the prisoner Coker's grandmother's, and the two prisoners were there, and said they had not seen the shift—I only know Grove by passing backwards and forwards—the line on which the shift hung was close to the grandmother's house—I have seen the shift since—it is mine, and has my mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the Eaton Police. I went after the prisoners with Roadnight, and apprehended Coker in the street, and we found the female in Windsor station—I said to her, "Have you got a <hi rend="italic">shimmey</hi> on that was given you by Coker?"—she said, "Yes"—she was told to pull it off, and she went into the cell, and pulled it off—next day, at Hillingdon station, she said to Coker, "You know you gave me that <hi rend="italic">shimmey,"</hi> and she afterwards said, "You told me that you stole it"—that was when the charge was entered against her; and Coker said, "No I did not"—she said, Yes you did, and you ought to speak the truth; you are more able to bear the punishment than I am"—he said, "How can you say I stole it, for you found it on your table, did not you?"—she said, "Yes I did, but you put it there, for no person had the key of the house but you"—this is the shift.</p>

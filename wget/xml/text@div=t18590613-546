                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Serjeant, F</hi> 3). On 19th March I was on duty in Lincoln's-inn-fields—I watched the prisoner and his two sons—I followed them from there to Fleet-street—I saw his son Francis enter from ten to a dozen shops—the father waited a few yards off on the opposite side of the way, and when the son came out they had some conversation—they went on till they got to Mr. Edmeads, where Francis entered, and his brother John looked out; the father went on the opposite side of the street—Francis came out of the shop with this concertina, holding it in front of him—he walked a few yards down Fleet-street and there John took it from him, and they went down Whitefriars-street—I passed by the prisoner and went after the two sons—I ran across—a civilian ran with me—he secured Francis, and I secured John—a policeman came up who knew me—I gave Francis to the policeman, and ran back instantly for the father—he was then missing—I knew where he lived—I went to his house and waited for his coming home; he did not come—he deserted his family—I did not see him till 21st May, when I saw him in Holborn—he was bending down to speak to two children—knowing his voice I called to him to stop—I told him I should take him in custody for being concerned in stealing a concertina in Fleet-street—he said, "Mr. Holmes, I think you have had quite sufficient; and he said he had a few shillings in his pocket which he offered me"—he then asked what he should get—I told him that did not apply to me—he said, "It is a bad job, I suppose I shall get two years"—I took him to the station—he had got about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a piano-forte maker in Fleet-street—on 19th March, about 3 o'clock, I left my errand boy in my shop—I was called down and found the boy was gone—Holmes produced this concertina to me—it is my property, and is worth about twelve guineas.</p>

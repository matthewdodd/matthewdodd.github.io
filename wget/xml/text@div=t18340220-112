            . I am an officer - I was on duty in the Edgeware-road on Sunday, the 19th of January, and saw both the prisoners - I first saw Waller with a bundle under his arm, it was these three pieces of lead - I stopped him and asked what he had got - he said, "Wood;" I said,"It is lead;" he then said, "I found it at Kensington;" the other prisoner, who was just before him, ran away directly - I stopped Waller - I called to a constable, who ran and caught Fisher, and brought him back - I took him to the station-house - I went and compared the lead with what was lying in the field, at the back of Mr. Oldfield's - it fitted it exactly - this piece has got the invoice number on it - I can swear this piece came off one sheet.</p>
               <p>WALLER. Q. Did you ask me whether it was wood or not? A. I asked you if it was wood, and you said, "Yes."</p>

            . I am an officer - I was with Hancock, and ran after Fisher, and caught him - I asked him what he had got - he said, "Only a piece of wood" - I found this piece of lead on him - he said he found it at Kensington, under some shavings - I took him back to Hancock, who took him to the station-house - next morning we went to Oldfield's, and compared the lead with the sheet - I can swear that is part of the same sheet of lead.</p>
               <p>Fisher. Q. In what parish did you catch me? A. Mary-le-bone, against Hyde Park gates - the lead was in Paddington parish - he crossed over into Mary-le-bone parish, and was going to turn into the Park, but I stopped him, and found a knife on Fisher.</p>
               <p>Waller's Defence. As we came by we saw the lead in a hole, as we were playing along with several more boys - it was covered over with shavings - Fisher said,"Waller, what is that?" - I kicked it, and said, "It is lead" - we picked it up, and were going to take it home - we picked it up in a hole about the middle of Mr. Oldfield's field.</p>
               <p>Fisher's Defence. The field does not belong to Mr. Oldfield, but to Mr. Edwards - I was in the service of my uncle, Mr. Bermisch, who keeps a public-house, No. 2, Duke-street, Grosvenor-street.</p>

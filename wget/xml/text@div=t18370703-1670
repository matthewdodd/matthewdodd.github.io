                  </hi>. I live at Clapton. On the 2nd of July I was going to Fulham, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the Hammersmith-road—he asked me if I had got any money—I said, "No"—he said if I did not give him all I had got, he wouls smash my b----brains out—he then took my bonnet and shawl, and a bonnet<lb></lb>cap and apron, which I had in my hand—I told him if he did not give me my things I would call "Murder"—he said if I did he would fill my b----mouth full of dirt—I called "Murder"—he then threw my things down, and ran away—as soon I got home I complained of it, and persons went in pursut of him—he did not do any thing to me before he took the things from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutix's brother, and live at Fulham. About a quarter before eleven o'clock, I saw my sister, who made a complaint to me and described the person—I went in search of the person, and found the perisoner in an alley called Devil's-alley, about half a mile from where the robbery was committed—he was lying on a dunghill, but when he saw me he got up and ran away—I had a constable with me—we followed and took him—I knew him before, and had been at school with him—the policeman asked him what made him run away—he said because he saw me with a policeman.</p>

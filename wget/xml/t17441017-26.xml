            . Some time last month, but I can't be positive to the day, I lost a pair of shoes, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170033"></xptr> 11 o'clock in the day time: I was in the shop when they were lost, but did not see the Prisoner take them, my man went after him, seized him and brought him back, and the were in the bosom of his coat.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Hose; I saw the Prisoner take the shoes one by one off my master's show-glass, I followed him and took the shoes out of the left side of his coat and brought him back to my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say but this, I am out of my senses once in a moon, that I don't know what I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he plead that as an excuse when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Game. He did not say any thing to me about that when I took him, he desired nothing, but that we would use him well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he looked like a man in his senses?</p>
               <p>Game. I think he did not look like a man in his senses , to take the shoes in the day-time and come by the door with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hose. I saw the shoes in his bosom before he was brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he looked like a man in his senses?</p>
               <p>Hose. I don't think he looked any wise like a man that was out of his senses. <rs id="t17441017-26-verdict160" type="verdictDescription">

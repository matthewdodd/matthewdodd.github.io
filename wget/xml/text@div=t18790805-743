                  </hi>. I live at 12, St. Agnes Terrace, Kennington Park, and am a dressmaker—on 18th July, or 1 o'clock on the 19th, I arrived at the Elephant and Castle by an Atlas omnibus—I was alone—I went down Kennington Park Road on my way home, and some one who I believe was the prisoner spoke to me—I walked on and made no reply—he followed me till I got to South Place, which is about five minutes' walk, and spoke to me again, but I did not catch his words—I told him to go away and mind his own busi<lb></lb>ness—that is rather a dark part—he came up again and said that he was going home with me—I said that he was not—he said that he had lost his train to Wimbledon, and must go home with some one—I said "I live here"—he said "I shall go home with you, for I have given you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that was not true; I had never seen him before in my life—he said "You b——, I have given it to you, and if I do not have it I will have the worth of it," and dealt me a blow between my eyes which knocked me down—when I got up I was bleeding,'and saw him at some distance stopped by a constable—I missed my watch, and my chain was broken—I did not miss my bracelet at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have Jived there about four months—I lived with my mother before that—I am here for the benefit of my health—I suffer from heart disease, and, I believe, consumption—I went out and sat in the Park first, and then took an omnibus to Charing Cross and met a friend, and kept with her for a time—her name is Charlton, and I believe she is on the stage—I had not seen her for some time—it was rather showery, and I took the last omnibus at Trafalgar Square—the prisoner spoke to me first—he told me that he came up from Wimbledon—he did not say that he was a seaman on board the Excellent—I swear that I did not invite him to come with me—I have never accosted anybody in the streets at that time of night—I did not ask him if he had any money, nor did he tell me he had only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did I ask him to give me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I stopped at South Place, where I turned down—the prisoner paid for nothing for me—I did not tell him I was a singer—I said that I lived in very respectable apartments, and therefore if he came with me I should call for help—I did not leave him at the corner of the road and go down to the back door saying that I had the key; there is no back door or side door—I did not leave him for a time—he did not tell me where I had put the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no struggle before he knocked me down—I do not know that his lanyard was found there, but possibly I might have caught hold of the cord when he knocked me down—he made a dash for my pocket and tore my dress at the side—I did not see my watch on the ground or see the prisoner take it up—some of my chain was found on the ground with his lanyard—I was living with my mother at</p>

               <p>Ramsgate before this—she is independent—I have heard of Mr. Buss there, he is the Superintendent of Police—I still say that my mother is indepen<lb></lb>dent—she does not keep a brothel that I know of—I do not know that she was convicted of keeping one in October, 1874, I was in London at that time—I was not on the town at Ramsgate, that I swear, nor in London—the policeman lent me his lantern when I went back, and I found my watch and trinkets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> What I have said is true—I never received any money from the prisoner—the watch was in my watch-pocket outside, the chain was partly outside, a portion of it could be seen—as a rule I wore the trinkets inside my dress, but I cannot say whether they were out or in then—I had the bracelet on.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 103). I was on duty in Palmer's Road about 2 a.m, and heard cries of "Police!"—I saw the prisoner running up the middle of the road and stopped him and asked him what he was running for—he said "That woman has robbed me of my money"—a few seconds afterwards the prosecutrix came up and said "He has robbed me of my watch and chain"—he said "She has got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my money;" she said "It is wrong, I have not; he has robbed me of my watch and chain and knocked me down"—I asked him where the watch and chain were, he gave them to me and a bracelet—they were in his right hand—I went back with them and we looked about and found the trinkets on the ground and a portion of the chain and the prisoner's lanyard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner made no attempt to get away—the prosecutrix told the Magistrate that she did not wish to injure the prisoner's character—when I picked up his lanyard she said "I held him by that as long as I could"—I have made inquiries and find that he bears an excellent character on the ship; he was selected to go to Wimbledon as one of the working party, who were all good-conduct men—he showed me his discharges from several ships, they were all very good.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I stood ready in the middle of the road in case he should dodge me, and he came right up to me—he said nothing about having her watch and chain till she charged him—she was bleeding from the nose, and crying, and she had her handkerchief in her hand—I saw at the station the marks of a blow at the side of her nose—her pocket was torn—she was perfectly sober.</p>

I did make some remark at the police-court about not wishing to press the charge; I was very ill, I had been in bed for a week after this, and only got up that morning to go to the Court, and I asked the Magistrate if he would kindly settle it; he said that he could not, and the next time I asked him again, and said I had no wish to hurt the prisoner's character—the Magistrate let him out on bail the second week.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was butter to the Earl of Kinnoull, at No. 58, Green-street, Grosvenor-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner was the under butler—his Lord<lb></lb>ship was leaving town in July—previous to his leaving it was customary to examine all the plate before it was sent to the banker's—a small portion of the plate was left behind in the house, kept in a small iron chest—on the 14th of July I told the prisoner to put all the plate out as usual, that it might be examined before it was sent to the banker's—next morning I went into the pantry—the plate was in the strong closet—the prisoner was in the pantry—I did not find the plate put out, but found one chest packed and another partly packed—I said, "I desired you to put the plate out that I might examine it before any part was put away"—he said, there was bags belonging to what was put away, and he thought it much better to put it in the chest out of the way—I asked him the contents of the chest, and as he named them I wrote them down in a memorandum book—it was the chest No. 1, which was already packed—he lifted the trays out of the chest—I saw the large things, and there was a number of small things, which I took his word that they were there as he named them—he locked that chest down, and we went on packing the other chest—I said, "Now we will put all the plate out in the pantry before any more is put away, we will have it out and examine it,—it was done—I examined it and missed the snuffer-tray—I asked him where it was—he said he would tell me after a short time—I then went on, and missed a lemon-dish and two strainers—I asked him where they were—he said he would tell me after a bit—these articles were replaced by the prisoner the same evening—I found the remainder of the plate correct as far as I examined—about twelve o'clock the same night I went into the pantry, and opened the chest No. 1, which had been packed by him—I examined them by the list he had given me, and found four salt-cellars missing, and six ladles—I examined the other chest, and found it right—next morning I went into the pantry—the prisoner came in afterwards—I told him I had a claret cork to put away, and asked him what chest we should put it into—he said, "No. 1 chest"—when this chest was opened, I said, "I did not examine the contents of this chest, it would be more satisfactory to myself, and also to you, that we should examine it"—I told him to take all the things out—I asked him if the things were in that chest according to the list, and read it down to him three times over, and he said it was correct—I then said it would be more satisfactory to examine them—they were taken out, and four salts and six ladles were missing—I asked him where the salts</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Lambeth—I have known the prisoner between five and six months—I worked with him. On 21st May we went to Chelsea together, and bad three or four pots of beer at the Nell Gwynne public-house—two or three drank with us—we were both a little the worse for liquor—between 10 and 11 o'clock at night we quarrelled—some blows with our fists passed in the house—he struck me while I was in the house—I then went out in the road, and he followed me, and <hi rend="italic">pitched into me</hi> again in the road—I did not see him have anything in his hand; we both went down together, and when I got up he was gone—I did not know at that time that anything had been done to me, but afterwards I found blood coming about my body—I became insensible, and did not know anything till Sunday morning, when I found myself in St. George's Hospital; I remained there three weeks and three days—I had worked with the prisoner five or six months at the Exhibition—the quarrel was about some beer that I upset—we had not had any quarrel before that day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 143). I was on duty that night in Chelsea—I found a mob outside the Nell Gwynne—there was a fight; Page was there, and he was in liquor—the last witness had been taken away by some civilians—it was about a quarter before 11 o'clock—Page was lying in the road—I picked him up—he said he had been fighting with a man, and he wished to give him into custody—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "the only thing you can do is to summon him"—I did not know what had happened, and Page went away—in consequence of information, I went to a house in Nell Gwynne-court, and found the prosecutor insensible—I found two stabs under his lower rib on the left side, and one on the right side of the chest—his trowsers and shirt were soaked in blood—he was taken to the Hospital.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on 27th June, at his mother's house, No. 13, York-street, Blackfriars-road—I told him there was a warrant against him for stabbing John Derrick—he said he was very sorry for it—they were fighting, and he found Derrick was getting the upper hand of him, and he was determined to have his revenge—he said a great deal more—he said, "I have done it, and I deserve to suffer for it; I done it in self defence.

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—Derrick was brought there on 21st May, at 11 o'clock in the evening—he was wounded in six places—five were incised wounds; and one, which was below the right collar bone, was decidedly a stab, and done with a very sharp instrument—the wounds on the side were very dangerous—the lower one had very nearly penetrated the abdomen—that was the one I was most afraid of—he was discharged on 15th June.</p>

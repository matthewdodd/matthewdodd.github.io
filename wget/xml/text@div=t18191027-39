            . I am a coachman, and live in Adamson-street, Bryanstone-square. On the 3d of October I was standing at my door, from which I can see <placeName id="t18191027-39-crimeloc221">No. 69, Seymour-place</placeName>

I went with others into the house to get the servant out - a gentleman went down the area and opened the street door; I and several others rushed in, and searched every place we safely could. We searched in the back-parlour, but saw no person there, only a bed; we afterwards went there again, and saw the prisoner moving her head from under the bed-clothes in a state of great insensibility; several of us spoke to her, but she made no answer - she had only her shift on; the corner of the bed and bedstead were on fire. We took her to the opposite house, No. 14, returned, and immediately brought her bed over for her to lay on, then went to the house, and assisted in getting the furniture out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the fire come from - A. From the staircase - it burnt downwards. I went over to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. During the time you was carrying her over, did she return to a state of sensibility - A. I perceived an alteration, but on my return from moving the furniture, which was about two hours, I found a great alteration in her; she talked rationally, but was a little convulsed at times. I asked her if she knew in what way the fire happened? She said she was the person who was guilty, and did not wish for any thing but to suffer. I asked her how she could think of committing such a dreadful crime? She said her friends had all turned their backs upon her, that her character was blasted, and she had no remedy whatever to get rid of her enemies but by being burnt in the flames. I asked her if she had been ill-advised by any one to do it? She said No, she was the person who had done it, and that she did not wish to lay the blame upon any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come in while this was going forward - A. Yes, a lady whom she had formerly lived with. She exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh Jane!" The prisoner wept, and said she was guilty. I asked her which way she set fire to the house? She said by cutting the sheets, and setting fire to them in the back kitchen, that she got up about three o'clock in the morning, and took some laudanum and Holland's out of her master's cellaret, and about five o'clock in the morning she retired to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You did not at first find her in the bed - A. No, the blankets were rolled over her. She seemed to me to talk rational; she said she set two sheets on fire in the back kitchen, there was no appearance of the fire ascending up - it could not be so for there was no fire below whatever. She had three or four scratches on her throat, as if she had attempted to make away with herself.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 74, Seymour-place; I was called in to attend to the prisoner. I found her in the front parlour of No. 14, wrapped up in a blanket; she was then in convulsions, which subsided in a minute or two. She then became convulsed again, and was in a considerable agitation; I was told that she had been burnt, but I found that was not the case. I examined her throat, and found that she had attempted to cut it - the wounds were comparatively trifling, so that they did not excite my attention particularly - there were two or three scratches on it. I left her, and in the course of two hours went to her again, and found her comparatively tranquil; she was still in a state of agitation, but not convulsed. A man said, in her hearing, that she had confessed every thing. I asked her if it was true that she had set fire to the house? and she said it was. I asked her what could be her inducement to commit such a crime? She replied that her character had been destroyed by a parcel of rubbish - that was her expression. From what I heard, I asked her if a soldier was connected with her? She distinctly and positively answered No; but in the course of the conversation she said she could not speak the truth for fear of ruining people. I gathered from her general insinuations, that she had been ill-treated by her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she account for the wounds in her throat - A. She told me she had attempted to cut her throat with her master's razor; from the nature of the wounds it was evident that they had been inflicted by some sharp instrument - she said she had taken laudanum, and from her description of the quantity, I should suppose it to be about a table-spoonful.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that likely to kill - A. It depends upon the constitution, and whether the person is used to take it. She was moved to the Westminster Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Her conversation was very incoherent - A. Very. It is impossible for me to form an opinion as to the mind of a person, who had met with such an accident as she had. I certainly should not pronounce her a person of sound mind.</p>

            . I am apothecary to the Marylebone Infirmary. On Sunday the 3d of October the prisoner was brought there. I had a little conversation with her, but her answers were exceedingly inconsistent, and unintelligible.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such effects be produced by strong opiates - A. It might; she was very sick, and vomited, which was of a dark colour; I could not ascertain what it was as it was mixed with bile. She never appeared in a collected state, except on a few points - she talked a great deal of nonsence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about this circumstance - A. She seemed to have an apathy to the conversation, and said she set fire to the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. You had conversation with her several times - A. Yes, at least a dozen. I have no doubt she was insane while she was in the infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. After the effect of the laudanum was gone off, a person of sane mind would resume her reason - A. Yes, but as the effect went off, the derangement developed itself - it is common for insane persons to know what they have been about. Persons are insane on different points; her conversation throughout was that of an insane person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge whether the insanity had continued any time - A. I should judge it had been of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270023"></xptr>long duration; it was a melancholy derangement, which comes on gradually.</p>

               <p>Q. You searched the house, and found none of the property stolen - A. A fortnight before the fire happened I examined the house - she had confessed to me at the Infirmary that she had made away with some of the property, and mentioned three different shops where she had pawned it. I saw some of the goods there. I found a cream-pot, a bible, and a pair of sugar-tongs at Flint's; she said there were two ten-spoons, and a sheet at Monk-house's, in Chandler-street. I went there; they did not own to me that they had them. I went to another shop in Crawford-street, but found nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. What was her condition when she came in - A. She was a good deal debilitated in her system.</p>

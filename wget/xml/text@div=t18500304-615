                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Rowlandson, of 83, Whitechapel-road. On 19th Feb. I saw a carpet bag under the counter at the back part of the shop, containing 40 yards of calico, and 10 yards of linen—I saw it several times—I saw it last on the 21st, about nine o'clock in the evening, in</p>

               <p>a drawer, in the prisoner Edis's department—the same goods as I have de<lb></lb>scribed were then in it—on that night the shop was closed between nine and ten, and I went up-stairs to supper, leaving Edis to turn the gas off—Mr. Rowlandson was up-stairs, and Edis joined us soon afterwards—supper was over at half-past nine, and Edis put his hat on, and went down-stairs—he remained down-stairs two or three minutes, and then went out—I heard the door open and close—I then went down-stairs to the drawer where the bag had been, and which faces the entrance to the side-door, and the bag was gone—I looked for it, but did not find it till after the prisoners were brought back—I had seen Kempton and Edis before that evening in company—after they were brought in, I saw Mr. Rowlandson find the bag about a yard from the door which leads into the yard—it was just set down, rather under<lb></lb>neath a bedstead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpet and furniture manufacturer, in partnership with my brother, in the Whitechapel-road. On 21st Feb., in consequence of a communication from Buckle, my brother spoke to the police—about ten o'clock the prisoners were brought back to the shop, and a few minutes after that the carpet bag was found—I saw it myself first, about a yard from the side-door—the bag is our property, and contained a piece of calico, and two pieces of linen, also our property—the calico had been taken from Buckle's department—Edis was an assistant, and had been in our employ five or six months—on that night I had supper with the young men, between nine and ten—after supper, Edis went out with his hat on—as soon as we heard the door shut, we sent Buckle down—he made a communication to me both before and after that—he has been in our service about eighteen months.</p>

On the 21st Feb., about nine o'clock, in consequence of information, I went and put myself in a position commanding a view of the side-door of Mr. Rowlandson's premises—about half-past nine, or twenty minutes to ten, Edis came to the side-door, opened it, and looked up and down the yard cautiously—he then went down the yard to the street, and joined Kempton—they then both returned—Edis went in, and Kempton remained standing on the threshold—Edis was away a minute or more, he returned to the door, and looked up and down cautiously—at that time there was a person passing—he then went into the house again, and returned to the side-door in Jess than a minute—Kempton had not moved—they then both went away towards the street—I then received information that the bag was gone, and followed them into the Duke's Head public-house, in the Whitechapel-road, next door but one—I took them both into custody, and told them they were charged with stealing Irish linen, long-cloth, and a carpet bag—I took them back to the shop, and on the way Kempton thought to escape, by slipping his coat off.</p>

            . I am a watchman; just after the clock struck one, on the 3d of December in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutrix's door, in a white cloak; she spread her arms wide, that I should not see the four chairs in the passage, behind her at the stair foot. I saw them and ask'd her, whether they were coming in, or going out; she said, she had just brought them in; I had seen the door shut too, about a quarter of an hour before, when I went by; then I call'd up Mrs. Turnbull; she came down, and said, the chairs were her's; we then went up stairs, but the prisoner had fastened the door, and would make no answer; upon which, Mrs. Turnbull fastened the passage door, so I went away and came again at 3 o'clock; then the landlady push'd the prisoner's door open, and said, she miss'd the things mention'd in the indictment; I took her to the constable of the night, there she confess'd she brought one of the chairs down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went out that night between 5 and 6 o'clock, and when I came home about 9, my husband had carried away all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Did she take the room as a single, or a married woman?</p>
               <p>E. Turnbull. She took it as a single woman; I never saw a man with her; she has talked since of a husband, and she has said, she did once live with a man 8 months, but was not married to him.</p>
               <p>The watchman said, he liv'd in the same house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175012050020"></xptr> but never was in the prisoner's room, nor did he ever take her to be a married woman, saying, he never saw a man with her; but that this night, at about 11 o'clock, he saw a man in a blue coat near the door in the street, leaning upon a post.</p>

The prisoner came and called for a pint of beer on the 27th of January; there was nobody up but me; I went down for his beer, and before I came up with it he was gone, and the tea-kettle also was missing from the chimney corner, that cost 16 s. he never came back for his beer: That very day sennight I was going out at the door, and the prisoner was going by; I called my son, and he came out and took him; we got the kettle by his telling us where it was.</p>

            . The week after the kettle was lost I took the prisoner in the street; I got him into the house, and desired some people to take charge of him while I went to Justice Wright for his advice; he granted me a warrant; I took the prisoner before him; he stiffly denied knowing any thing of the kettle: He was committed to the Gatehouse. Coming down Windmill-street, we went in at the Coachmaker's-arms and had a pot of purl; there I desired if he had pawned or sold it to let me know, and I would get it again; he flatly denied it then. I left the constable and him together a little while; the constable will give the Court an account what past.</p>

He said, let me go to Mr. Galley's, and I'll tell you something about it; we went into Mr. Galley's taproom; then he said to me he had taken it, and sold it to a broker in Tyburn-road for 2 s. we went to the justice again, and told him what the prisoner had said; he granted a search warrant to find it; I went with the prisoner; the prisoner saw a servant in the cellar; he said, that is the man I sold it to; there we found the kettle.

I bid him a shilling, and he agreed to take 18 d. then I went to that house and offered it for Half a-crown, and sold it for 2 s. and a pint of purl.</p>

               <p>JAMES TERRY. I am a patrol. On the 22nd of December, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Cow-cross; he went into two marine-store shops, and as he came out of the second I took him, and asked what he had got - he said Nothing; he then said, "A few nails" - I found 10lbs. of nails on him; the next day I searched his lodging, at King's-road, St. Pancras, and found 16lbs. of nails and eighteen dozen of screws.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you the first who spoke to him, and asked the name of his employer? A. The constable did in my presence; he stated who he worked for, and where he lived.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILLER. I was watch-house keeper; I searched the prisoner, and took the basket from him with these 10lbs. of nails in it - I searched his lodgings, and found a gimblet, a quantity of wood, these nails and screws.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How did you find his lodging? A. He gave me his address.</p>

No; this is not a common moulding - I will not swear there are not thousands of these in London, but I do not think there are; I never saw one similar to this - Mr. Pringle gave me a drawing for it, and the plane was made according to it; it is his own invention.</p>

            . Last Tuesday was fortnight, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Rule's house, I live right against him. There was a woman with a callimanco gown with her, she stood at the window, the prisoner was in about six minutes, and I saw her come out again with some things in her apron. I went immediately to Mrs. Jenny, and ask'd if she had lost any thing, she was above stairs, she went down and missed the things. Then we went and pursued the prisoner, and she was taken just as she was going to take water. She had on a stripe cotton gown, which I gave as a direction to apprehend the right person. She was brought back with the things in her apron.</p>

               <p>I am as innocent as the child unborn: my partner was so wicked as to take the things and put them into my apron. I thought she had bought them. She gave sixpence to go over the water, and I never saw her since.</p>

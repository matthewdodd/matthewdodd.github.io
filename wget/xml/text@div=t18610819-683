                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother as cabinet-makers, 26, Newman-street, Oxford-street—on Friday evening, 5th July, I locked up the house, the entrance to the kitchen and so forth, between a quarter past 10 and a quarter to 11—I slept on the premises—I went to bed about that time—the next morning I examined the premises about 7 or half-past—I had not been disturbed in the night—I found the house had been broken into through the kitchen; the window was open and the shutter also pushed open, and they had broken open the kitchen door, which was locked—the window-sash was thrown up—it was not fastened the night before, but it was down—the kitchen door that leads into the house was looked the night before, but in the morning I found it broken open—the shorter prisoner of the two had been in my service two months or six weeks previous to the robbery—I do not know whether his name is John or William Thompson—that, is not the name I knew him by—he was in my service by the name of Lewis—he was acquainted with the lower part of the house—I took him twice into my service—I dare say altogether he was in my service twelve months, or perhaps more; I cannot say exactly—we pay our workmen on a Saturday—we have the money in the house on Saturday afternoon for that purpose—sometimes we have it on the Friday, but not often—our house is in Marylebone parish—I reside there myself.</p>

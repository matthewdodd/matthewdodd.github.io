"—he said, "Gale"—I said, "How comes your brother's name Matthews?"—he said, "He has been married lately, and that alters his name "—I said, "No, it does not; I shall stop you, and send to know if it is true"—he said, "Don't stop me; you may keep the pony, and I won't tell my brother where it is"—I sent my man to Mr. Matthews, who came and owned it—I asked him, in the prisoner's presence, if he was his brother; and he said he had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the service of the Great Northern Railway—the prisoner was a van driver, and in the habit of taking goods to the east end of the town for delivery—it was my duty to put the goods on to his van and to sign the sheet as checked—on the 13th September, I put</p>

               <p>into his van all the goods mentioned on this sheet marked "77 K"—he was on the van and loaded the goods—among the goods was a truss for Hyam &amp; Co., Gracechurch Street—I also noticed four other trusses with red crosses on them, which formed part of the load—the prisoner took away the goods about 9.30 in the morning—the goods tor Hyam &amp; Co. were wrapped in a canvas wrapper—it was marked "L.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the company's service—it is the car<lb></lb>man's duty when he brings back goods to communicate with me—on this day the prisoner only brought back four bales of goods, for Bridge &amp; Co., with red crosses—I marked his sheet to that effect—I saw him about the truss directed to Hyam &amp; Co.—he said he remembered perfectly well delivering the truss on that day—I drew his attention to these four crosses, and on his seeing that entry it seemed to make it more clearly of his having delivered this truss, and said he obtained the signature of the gentleman who usually signs for the goods—he said he put it down in the warehouse—Hodgson's name is spelt with a "G" in it—his signature! are very similar on these three sheets—they are not like the one on the fourth, written "Hodson"—there is a "G" left out in the signature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

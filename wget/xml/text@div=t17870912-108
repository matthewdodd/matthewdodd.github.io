               <p>Mr. Silvester. You had information against a house at <placeName id="t17870912-108-crimeloc511">Sedbury-castle</placeName>

               <p>That is in the parish of Shoreditch? - Yes, I went there on the 11th of August, with Harper, Beamont, and Shakeshaft; on entering the garden, the house the prisoner lives in, was at the bottom with two front windows that commanded the walk; I looked up at the windows directly, and I saw a man without his coat; and seeing him confused, I ran and pushed the door open, with the officers at my back; in the lower room, there was a woman who appeared to be his wife, and a maid, and the man said he was concerned in some business under the sheriff; I observed a ladder which led up to the other apartments, and I went immediately to that place, and on the step of the ladder that went out of the lower room, namely, into the one pair of stairs higher, by way of a stair case, I found these things. (Producing some farthings.) The woman was nearest to the ladder; I was not time enough in to see whether she had come from it, but that being there, it attracted my attention; I catched hold of it, opened it, and found it contained all new farthings, and I told the other officer to secure the people; they were in this apron or handkerchief; the other officers were then in the house, and we secured the other things, and the prisoner was then taken to the Magistrate, he, his wife, and the man.</p>
               <p>Did you search the house? - No, the other officers did.</p>
               <p>What quantity of farthings are there? - A great many indeed; I cannot speak to the quantity; on being taken to the Magistrate, the prisoner said he found them; there was in one part of the house, a corner cupboard, in which I found some that seemed to be black; the man that was taken, was discharged at the prisoner's request, as only coming to deliver a message to him; these were in a cupboard by the side of the bed; on going to the Magistrate, the Magistrate took the prisoner's word, and his brother's, for his appearance at twelve o'clock, on Monday, to be examined before Mr. Vernon.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On a Saturday; he not coming, Mr. Vernon went home, and we had orders to keep these things, and in about an hour after Mr. Vernon was gone the prisoner came; on Friday following, the 17th, we again received another information against a house where the prisoners was supposed to be at work.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you discharged the prisoner on the Monday? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>And you had a second information? - Yes, we had a search warrant, and we went to a house behind the Rum Puncheon at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the other house? - There is a walk called Hare-walk; then there is a field which takes you right to the gardens, where the prisoner's first house was.</p>
               <p>Then the communication is by the walk and the field? - Yes; it may be half a mile apart to the best of my knowledge; I knocked twice at the door, and could get no admittance; I threw up the sash of the parlour window, and jumped in; in coming into the room, I observed a dirty blanket, and some saw-dust; in the lower room to the left hand, there was a stamping press, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120168"></xptr>this apron nailed to it; here is the stamping press.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is not a stamping press, it is a cutting press? - It is a stamping press; this is a fly which fixes on here, and this stood on a little block of a tree fixed, and the apron nailed to the block to receive these kind of blanks as fast as they are cut and stamped; this is made with a handle that is pulled by that; there is a movement and cutter here, that cuts the impression from the blanks.</p>
               <p>Court. Put it together if you can.</p>
               <p>(The witness put it together, and shewed how it was worked.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now working it in that fashion, what could be the effect of it, would it cut or impress, or do either? - To all appearance when fixed on a tree you may either cut or impress any similitude you please with it.</p>
               <p>Now look at it, and shew the Jury whether with that instrument such a piece of stuff as that you have got in your hand could be made? - It is the exact size of the cutter that is in.</p>
               <p>As it is now, it cuts out blanks, but remove this cutter, it is a stamping press? - If you remove this cutter, and put the die between it, it becomes what you call a stamping press; this screw removes, then take it out, and put in the die.</p>
               <p>Did you find any dies any where in that room, or about the house? - No dies whatever, in either house.</p>
               <p>But without a die, that piece of copper could not have been under? - They must have a die to finish them afterwards.</p>
               <p>What else did you find? - On going up stairs into the garret, the prisoner was there without his coat.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the prisoner below stairs? - No, he asked me leave to fetch his coat; I told him he might, but he must go with me to put it on, as such he came down stairs, where this press was fixed, and the apron nailed to the tree; and there was his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to have said you found farthings in that apron? - Yes, my Lord, they were in the first house; I brought him down, and he put his coat on; his hands were greasy, and he informed me he saw me when I was at the door, and it appeared as though he had been at work at this press; the floor where this press was fixed was boards, and the boards were taken up, and the trunk fixed in the ground to deaden the found, and so it was at the house where we found them before.</p>

               <p>Then does it make a noise? - It would make a jarring if it was not for its being fixed in the ground; I have been where halfpence have been coined, and I always saw them fixed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his person? - No, the officers did that.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Beamont, Armstrong, and Shakeshaft; I have got some farthings; I went on the 11th with the other witnesses, and in going into the garden, Mr. Armstrong went first, and I went, I saw people in the house rather confused; we ran as fast as we could directly, and when we ran in, the prisoner had these two bags of farthings in his hands, and I seized them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they hot or cold? - As cold as they are now; they are all finished for circulation.</p>
               <p>What papers are they? - I never examined or counted them; I seized these farthings in his hand, after that I went up stairs, and there I found nothing.</p>
               <p>SHAKESHAFT sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to this house with the other officers; I kept with the prisoner while they searched the house, on the 11th; I saw the farthings taken from the prisoner; he said he had just found them; I found these farthings in a table drawer, and several farthings I picked up on the stairs; I said it is very odd if you have just found them, that these are distributed about the house; we brought him away, and he was discharged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120169"></xptr>before the Magistrate then; we then had another information; we went to the house; there we secured him again, and I searched him, and in his pocket I found ten farthings, the very same as those found at the other house; I believe they are all of the same die; there is some saw dust, and here is a sieve to sift them with; this sieve we found -</p>
               <p>Court. What use is made of the sieve? - They hustle them in a dirty blanket, and make them black with oil and saw dust, and then put them into this sieve, and fist the saw dust from them; here is some brimstone that I found; they boil them in brimstone and salt first, and then they hustle them in the blanket with oil and saw dust, and then sift them in this sieve to get the saw dust from them, and cleanse them.</p>
               <p>What is the metal of which they are composed? - Copper, here is some sessill which I found.</p>
               <p>Had you the curiosity to see whether the sessill corresponded with the size of the farthing? - I believe it does; there may be a small difference in the size.</p>
               <p>Did you find any copper? - Yes, there is every thing fit for coining except the dies.</p>
               <p>How large a thing is a die? - This something resembles one.</p>
               <p>Is a die of such a size that it can be easily made away with? - Very easily; that is a halfpenny die, but there is no impression upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad to know if I told him whether they were boiled, and hustled in a blanket as he has described? - I have been at the taking of coiners many times.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he inform you any thing of that sort? - In the first house he said he was making of buttons, and he desired us to go to the other house, and there we should find the shanks in a cupboard in a tea pot; we went there, but we could find none; there was some boards up there, the same as at the other place, and the flooring was taken up, and we supposed a press had been fixed there; we put our sticks into the mould, and found it soft, and I found amongst the dirt, these four farthings, answering the same as the others.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have seen a press, look at that, what press is it? - This is a cutting press.</p>
               <p>Can it be made into a stamping press? - Clearly so, by taking out the cutter, and fixing a die; it would do not for heavy work, but it would do for stamping farthings.</p>
               <p>Look at those farthings? - These farthings are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Court. What metal are they? - It is a copper of a worser sort than what is used in the tower by sixpence a pound; it is copper worth about ten-pence a pound; it is what they call a bastard copper.</p>
               <p>Is that of the likeness of a legal farthing? - It is not like a tower farthing, but it will pass current for a farthing.</p>
               <p>Now look at that press? - I have looked at it before, I see there is every thing complete for coining except a die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If he will examine it, he will see it is only fit for stamping slight impressions upon buttons? - It will put impressions upon any thing of a small nature.</p>
               <p>Would it make impressions of this nature? - Certainly it will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you examine the press, you will see it is a cutting press? - It may be made a stamping press; this is a receiver to catch the piece of metal that is cut as it runs through; then remove this cutter, and put in this solid piece of iron, and the die, and then it cannot run through the hole; it is preserved at the bottom of the die.</p>
               <p>Then it may be made a stamping press? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did he say any thing about the dies when you went to the second house? - He said you may search for dies as long as you please, but you will find none here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the farthings in Hoxton fields, and I have several witnesses here to prove what my business is, and what I get my living by.</p>

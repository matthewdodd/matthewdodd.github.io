             went to the shop of Mrs. Elvey, No. 9, New Bond-street, Oxford-street, with intention of asking any one that might be in the shop where one Mr. Easton, a tailor lived. Mrs. Elvey informed me the place of his abode. When in the shop, Mr. Knight enquired the price of a dressing case, and asked me if I was not in want of such an article, which question caused me to look at one. We looked at one; the price was one hundred and ten pounds. We answered we would call, and give an answer in the morning, having just returned from Brighton. Knight observed to me that we should lose no time. We fixed upon an apartment to have it sent home. Knight advised me to take the name of

            . This was on the 27th, in the morning; the lady of the house not being able to inform us the terms, we deferred taking it till the next morning. We returned to Mrs. Elvey, and informed her that we should have the dressing-case at one hundred and ten pounds, and to look out the pocket-book and other articles, which made it one hundred and thirty-seven pounds thirteen shillings. We then desired her to send it to No. 14, Charles-street; I told her to make out the bill for

            . He immediately returned to the door; a knock came at the same time, the door was opened; Mrs. Elvey came up to us; Knight gave the check into my hands, and without previous excuse left me. Mrs. Elvey and her man went into the parlour; she produced the dressing-case, the bill, and other articles, which amounted to more than she had told us. I gave her the draft; she went away. I ordered the man of the house to take the box to the first coach stand; he did. I put the case on my shoulder; I had not proceeded far in Brompton-row, when Knight asked me for some of the things. I told him, after using me as he had he should have none. We proceeded then to the public-house and opened the case.</p>

I met the prisoner; he came and run right up against me. I never saw him before with my eyes, although he told me he was an old acquaintance, I looked very hard at him, to see if I had any knowledge of him at all; in the mean time, some one pushed me up to him, and at the very moment I felt a rush at my side pocket. I clapped my elbow against my pocket, to give my pocket book protection. I found it was gone; he did it as sharp as he could, and took the pocket book out. Upon this I was very much alarmed for a moment; I saw the prisoner walking off with the pocket book in his hand; the prisoner walked quietly off; I was so alarmed for a moment or two I did not cry out. At last I cried out, Stop thief! The prisoner was pursued and brought back to me. They asked me whether he was the man, when they brought him back; I called out that he is the man, hold him. The prisoner went into some ruins; I saw him brought out of the ruins; as soon as he came out of the ruins I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man who went into the ruins took your pocket-book away - A. I have not a doubt of it. I had my pocket-book brought back to me again; that was the pocket-book that the prisoner had taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round at the prisoner, and see whether you have any doubt that he is the man -

            He is the very man, as he called me an old acquaintance, I thought I had a right to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say that he walked quietly, was that first - A. Yes; when I cried out, Stop thief, he mended his pace briskly.</p>

            . I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner running towards me, just making his escape from the persons who were in pursuit of him. I stopped him and searched him, and delivered him into the officer's' hands. The prisoner said, for God's sake let me go; some persons came up; he wished me to deliver him into their hands. I threw the prisoner down; by way of detaining him. One of the party struck me; I fell upon the prisoner; I delivered the prisoner to the officer Bacon.</p>

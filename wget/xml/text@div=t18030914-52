               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live at the time this happened? - A. At No. 9, Buckeridge-street; I lodged in the same room with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both your husbands absent at that time? - A. No, she had her husband with her, and my husband was absent from me; I left the lodgings to go on board a King's ship to see my son; I left all I had in the world with the prisoner, locked up in a trunk, except what I stood upright in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did the house belong to where she lodged? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since you went away, and left this trunk in her possession? - A. Four months ago; I locked up what I had in the trunk before her eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the trunk contain? - A. There was a tin-box in it in the shape of a nutmeggraser; it had a 15l. note in it, a 10l. note, two twos, and two ones.</p>
               <p>Q. All Bank-notes? - A. Yes; there was a silver milk-pot that my son bought for me, a pair of silver buckles, and all my clothes; I put the tin-box into a tea-chest, and put it into my trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return from the place where you went to see your son? - A. I think it is ten weeks next Sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you absent? - A. A month and a week; I found my trunk broke open, and my little trunk tore to pieces; I found three or four gowns in it, and two or three tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner quitted the lodging? - A. Yes, she had run away to her sister's, and she was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had her husband left the lodging too? - A. Her husband had run away; I afterwards saw my tin-box at Box-street; she was apprehended before I came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. You lodged with this woman and her husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Her husband was at home as well as herself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the husband up? - A. No, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received the sum of 16l. 10s.? - A. It is in hand; the constable has it I dare say.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Whitcomb-street, Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. A painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I saw her at Bow-street; her husband worked with me as a bricklayer's labourer: On the 30th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, he came to me when the men had left work, to a building I was repairing in Holborn; he had absented himself from me two or three days; I was standing in the passage to look at the building, and this man came down the passage very much in liquor; I asked him what brought him in that situation at such an hour; he said, he was come to take leave of me, he was going to Ireland: that he had taken his place to go the next day, as he was a freeman of the city of Cork, and could earn a guinea a week in Cork; he earned but fifteen or sixteen shillings a week with me; he said he had got money enough, and produced a tin-box that I suppose would hold an ounce of snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the form of a nutmeg-grater? - A. I understand there are some made in that form; he pulled out of the box a one-pound note, and afterwards a 15l. note; I told him I was very sorry to see him with it in the condition he was then in, and recommended his leaving the money with me till the next day, which he did; after exhorting him very much to go home immediately, he promised me he would, and I gave him the notes back again in the box; on his quitting the building he turned the contrary way from home; he turned to go to Snow-hill instead of St. Giles's, where he said he lived; I was sorry I had given him the money when I saw him go the wrong way, and I sent another labourer after him, to tell him I wanted him; after an absence of a few minutes he returned, and to induce him to give it me back, I told him I had a bill to pay that night, if he would lend me the money I would be obliged to him, and he should have it in the morning when he came to work; the man very willingly gave me the money, and on the day following I brought the notes and the box with me to the building, expecting to see him there, and in the yard of the building I found Mr. Wildman, a next door neighbour, who said he had been robbed of a sum of money, which one of my labourers had found; I desired him to go to the Police-office, Hatton-Garden, and make his complaint, and I would attend, and shew the money; an officer of the Police came to me with Mr. Wildman, at the request of the Magistrate, for me to shew him the notes; I shewed the notes and the box to Mr. Wildman, and they proved to be of a much later date than the loss of Mr. Wildman's property; after that a Mr. Keeley, a publican, came the same day.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140031"></xptr>Q. Where does Keeley live? - A. In Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - A. I believe it is Lawrence; he complained of the robbery that the woman has been describing to you, and requested to have the property, as he had other property of the woman's in his care; I refused to part with the notes out of my hand, but by a course of law; I produced them before Mr. Bond, and by his order I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the notes you gave the officer were the same? - A. I marked them the day after I received them; I have kept them always in the tin-box.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's husband has never returned? - A. I have never seen him since.</p>

               <p>Q. Keeley's own house? - A. I believe it is; Michael Lahey and I searched the house; she was absconded from there; I found upon her bed a white muslin apron, and in a box I found two brass candlesticks, some caps and handkerchiefs; soon after that I heard she was at her sister's lodgings, at No. 6, Buckeridge-street; I went there immediately, and she was in bed; I came out of the room till she had dressed herself, and I took her into custody immediately; I took her to Mr. Keeley's, and she confessed there was a pair of pockets and an apron under the bed where she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had that conversation, what was said to her? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her she would be severely punished if she did not? - A. No; when I took her to Bow-street, she said she did not do it; her husband broke it open; Lahey has got the pockets and the apron; the prisoner was examined at Bow-street; Mr. Parker appeared, and I received from him this tin-box, with a fifteen-pound Bank-note and a one-pound note; I think that was at the second examination. - (Produces them.)</p>

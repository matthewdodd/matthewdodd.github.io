             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of March, I went with Mr. Clark and other officers, to Wilson's house, having received an information that they were coming halfpence there; there were officers fixed all round the house. I entered the street-door, and went through the parlour into the kitchen, I met Mrs. Wilson in the parlour; she asked for God's sake what is the matter? I told her I had an information that there was coining there. I looked in the kitchen, but could see nobody. I opened the cupboards under the dresser, and looked all round; there was nothing to be seen concerning coining. I returned from thence into the parlour again. One of the officers, Labar, came into the kitchen and said one had jumped out of the window, but he had catched him. I stood there about two minutes talking to him; I turned round and saw Mrs. Wilson smoothing down the cape of West's great coat. I had examined the kitchen thoroughly before. I said to West, Good God! where are you come from, out of the ground? He said he had been sitting upon a chair by the fire in the kitchen. I said, Good God! would you persuade me I am blind? I have examined every place in the kitchen. I then examined every place about to see where he could have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130054"></xptr> from, but I could find none for some time. We had searched for the space of two hours I believe, and could not find any implements for coining. I said to the rest of the officers we may as well give it up, they certainly cannot be at work here. I went up stairs into the one-pair-of-stairs room; there were some empty hampers and lumber. There I saw in the crevice between two of the boards a place that looked as if a board had been taken up with a knife; I drew my cutlass, ran it between the boards, and lifted the board up and there was a place made with steps and two ropes to go from thence to the side of the kitchen. I called Mr. Clarke and said I had found the nest at last; Mr. Clarke went down, and I followed him. When we came to the bottom there was a small press for cutting out blanks, &amp;c. and a large one for striking the impression upon the halfpence. I told them I would go up stairs, and desired them to knock hard that I might see if there was any other way of getting there. They knocked with an hammer, and by that I saw where West had come up; it was under the sink in the kitchen. There was I suppose half a bushel of coals and a pail of water stood, and there was a little door to open to come out of the hole under the sink. I then took down all the wainscoting on that side of the room. The hole they had made to go down was through a cupboard; they had made a partition. It was not a cellar, but an hole dug in the ground, I suppose longer than half as big as this table; there was room enough for the flies to work, but it was a very confined place. Here are a quantity of halfpence finished; a quantity of blanks which are not struck. Here are the dye, the cecil, and the other things used in coining.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson was not there? - No.</p>
               <p>He was in the country at this time I believe? - It is impossible for me to tell that, they said he was just gone out.</p>
               <p>Was your back towards this sink at the time you was talking with the officer? - It was.</p>
               <p>Court. Could West have got into the kitchen by any other means than out of this hole at the sink without your seeing him? - No, it was impossible, unless he had been let out at the top of the house; there was an opening at the side; it was a great height, as high as the top of this court; I stood in the doorway, talking to Labar. When I turned round he was behind my back. I am very certain he came out of that hole.</p>
               <p>Court. What was his dress? - He had a sort of lightish great coat with a red cape. I believe he had no apron, he had corderoy breeches very dirty and a brown waistcoat.</p>
               <p>West. There was a door opened from the sink, which was between Prothero and me; I was behind it, he might look several times, if he did not come behind that door to see; there are several doors out of that kitchen which I know of; but I know of no such thing as a trap door.</p>
               <p>Court. Could he be by the sink and you not see him when you went into the room? - No, it was impossible, for I examined every place; there was a bell fixed just by the great press below in the hole, and a wire came up to the parlour from it.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Prothero and Mr. Clarke to this house; I went to the back part; they made a noise getting in forwards, upon which Nash opened the back window on the first floor which leads into the yard, and jumped out, I secured him, and went and told Mr. Prothero of it. While I was talking to Mr. Prothero, I saw the cupboard door move a little, I looked very steadily at it, and saw West come out of it, in a great coat, his hands and breeches were quite green. When we came to examine the door we saw it was to go down into the hole below.</p>
               <p>Where was Prothero at the time you saw West come out of the cupboard door? - Talking with me at the kitchen door, standing with his face to me. When Mr. Prothero found the place out, I went down and saw the dies and things there.</p>
               <p>West. Whether there was any other door he could see me come out of? - There was no other door to that room but that we were standing talking at.</p>

               <p>Court. You say Nash came out at the window, was there any communication from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130055"></xptr> the place where that window was to this hole? - He might come up the hole and go through the kitchen, but if he had done that the people in the house must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Was Prothero in the house before you saw Nash? - I imagine so, because of his jumping out at window.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a working dress with a white jacket.</p>
               <p>Was any thing green about him? - I did not observe any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did his hands appear dirty as if he had been at bricklayer's work? - His hands appeared brown and coppery.</p>

               <p>I went with Prothero and Labar, to the house of Wilson.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body in this house? - Yes, I saw West; when I saw him he had on a pair of breeches which smelt very strong of copper, and his hands appeared as if he had been at work in this way; the next morning when he was brought before the justice I challenged him with having changed his breeches in the prison.</p>
               <p>Describe what you found in this hole? - I was the first who went into the hole; it was fifteen feet deep from the boards to the ground where the presses were fixed; when I got down I saw a large press fixed, with a pair of dies, and a large quantity of halfpence round it.</p>
               <p>What was the large press for? - For stamping the impression; and upon the left side of the large press there was a small one with a large quantity of cecils and blanks, and some sheet-copper; these dies were set in the press; these halfpence were struck off from this die, which was then in the press.</p>
               <p>The whole apparatus was complete for the making of halfpence? - As complete as it possibly could be.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose house this is? - I know it to be Wilson's house.</p>
               <p>NASH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at work, setting the kitchen-range in the back-kitchen; when they knocked at the door I went to open the door; there was a hole in the door, they ran the cutlass through the hole of the door; then I ran out backwards, for I did not know what they were about.</p>
               <p>Court to Prothero. Was there a back-kitchen? - Yes, and a private still at work in it without paying the duty; we sent for an officer to seise it.</p>
               <p>Was there any range? - I am not sure, I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Was there any mortar? - I did see mortar in the back-kitchen, but I did not see any tools.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did his hands appear as if he had been at work at the bricklayer's trade? - I did not observe his hands; there was mortar in the room, the window of which he jumped out at.</p>
               <p>To Labar. How did his hands appear? - As if he had been at work with copper.</p>
               <p>Was there any mortar upon his hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he any apron on? - He had no apron on.</p>
               <p>Would the tiling and bricks give his hands that colour? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any bricks in the back-kitchen? - None loose that I saw.</p>

               <p>I have known Nash twenty years; he used to do labouring work for my husband; he was out of business and wanted a job; Mr. Skynner asked my husband if he knew of a man? He told him yes; this young fellow went there and Skynner employed him to set up a grate, that was about a fortnight before Easter Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Where was he setting up a grate? - At Mr. Wilson's, at the back of the Fleece.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I saw the grate, and saw him setting it up there.</p>

               <p>You said just now he was a labourer? - Yes; but when he was out of employment he worked at that.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you know the grate was to be put up for Wilson? - My husband took an apartment backwards of Wilson, and this grate was to be put up for our use. Mr. Pratt was the man who employed him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130056"></xptr>I thought you said Skynner just now? - Skynner was the landlord.</p>
               <p>You said Skynner employed him to set up the grate? - No Pratt.</p>
               <p>How came you to say Skynner? - I made a blunder; Pratt is at the door now.</p>
               <p>How long was he about that? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding it was put up for your use? - I believe five or six days, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>What became of him afterwards? - Indeed I don't know no further than there was somebody coming in after the coiners, and he was getting out at the window, because he thought it was a press-gang, as he told me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any of the officers a drawn cutlass when he opened the door.</p>
               <p>Prothero. I had a cutlass under my coat, but I did not draw it, nor never do till I find there is occasion for it; as to Nash he was on a different side of the house to where I was.</p>

               <p>What time of day? - Eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I did not make any remark about the time, I think it was about April; I did not take any account.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Easter? - I think it was after; it was the day he was taken up I think.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I am.</p>
               <p>How long were you there? - Not any time; I went through there to the shed to Mr. Pratt; there is a way through the house.</p>
               <p>Through the back-kitchen? - Through a part of the passage. He is an acquaintance of mine. I stopped, as I went through, to see him.</p>
               <p>Did you know he worked there before? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened you to find him out then? - He used to use the Fleece; I knew he worked about the neighbourhood; I did not know he was in that house till I saw him there; I met him in the passage; he came out for mortar or bricks, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court to Prothero. What time was it when you went to the house? - It was after dinner; it might be three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Then you must go through the window? - There is a door-way and passage leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>A common passage? - No; Mr. Pratt's gate was shut up, and so I went through there.</p>
               <p>What, is it a thoroughfare? - No; there is a bricklayer's shed in the farther part of the yard; you go through the hall of the house, and then through a long passage.</p>
               <p>How came you to go through Mr. Wilson's house? - Because Mr. Pratt had a shed there, and the gate was shut.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A carpenter.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with this man? - I have known him on and off some time.</p>
               <p>He is a bricklayer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You wanted to speak with the master bricklayer? - Yes.</p>

               <p>WEST's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I worked for Mr. Wilson, cutting of fire wood; he had bought two load; I cut a good part of it up; he sold it in penny-bundles; when I went in I did not see any body in the kitchen, because the kitchen-door was shut, and Mrs. Wilson was gone with the key to let me in. I went into the kitchen; when I got in I did but just turn myself about and people came in at the door; I did not know what they wanted; I stood by the sink-door where there were coals lying; I went to see for an ax I had to cut wood with; I went into the kitchen for it.</p>
               <p>(There being no evidence to affect Wilson he was not put upon his defence.)</p>

               <p>Do you know the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any sink in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any cupboard or door by that sink? - There is a door shuts in the sink that parts the kitchen and the sink; it is a sort of a closet.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been down in the hole below the kitchen? - I never saw any thing of the like kind; the boards were nailed down.</p>

               <p>When did you see it? - Three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>In May or June? - I cannot say; it was before last term.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to do with the terms? - No, only I was here attending last term.</p>
               <p>Last session you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know this house in the month of March? - Yes, before that; I knew the house before Mr. Wilson was in it; a relation of mine lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Was there any communication from the sink to this hole? - I never saw any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Have you examined it enough to say there is no communication from this place to the kitchen? - I have.</p>
               <p>There is no communication? - No.</p>
               <p>You swear there was no communication in the month of March? - Yes; and I stand to it.</p>
               <p>I asked you if you had been acquainted with the house before? - Yes; three years.</p>
               <p>Have you examined the house sufficiently to swear to the situation of it in the month of March? - I have, and there was no communication from the sink to the hole that you speak of; I can speak within these three years, there has been no communication.</p>
               <p>Was there any communication from any other part of the kitchen to this place? - I never saw any; I examined it thoroughly; I can say positively there was not.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the hole since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go in? - From the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you call the sink the closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a communication from this closet to the hole? - No, Mr. Wilson asked me to go down and examine the place, that was about a fortnight before last session; I have lain in the house several nights.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No. 7, Aldersgate-buildings.</p>
               <p>When you went to this house you found it in the same situation as it was when you saw it before? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>The wainscoting was not pulled down, nor the cupboards altered at all? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>How came you to examine if there was any communication between the hole and the kitchen? - Mr. Wilson desired me, for he said there was a fellow would swear his life away, and he must be guarded against him, if possible; I know there was an affair happened in that house and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>How did you get down into the hole? - From the top of the house, the top story.</p>
               <p>Three pair of stairs? - I believe there is two-pair-of-stairs besides the garrets, because I plaistered the garrets I went through.</p>
               <p>This passage was from the garrets down to the hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How deep was it? - About twenty-seven, or between twenty and thirty foot.</p>
               <p>This hole did not exist then, nor upon your oath, never did exist? - I do not know that it ever did exist; there never was a hole made in the sink to appearance.</p>
               <p>Nor under the sink? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether you saw that hole in the month of March? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Will you say there was none? - I will during the year and an half I was there, there was none; I have seen Wilson chopping wood, I never saw him do any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I live in Mr. Wilson's house now, and have for a year and an half.</p>

               <p>How came you to examine this so minutely if you never heard any thing about it? - Mr. Wilson gave me leave to go there for coals; I never saw any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>You swear there is no such thing? - I never saw it; I must have seen it if it had been there.</p>
               <p>How many floors are there in this house? - I do not know, I have never been over all the rooms; I lived in the one-pair-of-stairs; it goes to the next house to go up into the other rooms.</p>
               <p>You have heard talk of this hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which was the way to it? - I never saw it; I do not know; I live forwards.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in the house besides you, did not one Mrs. Dickins? - No; one Browne lodged there.</p>
               <p>Lovejoy did not live there? - No.</p>

               <p>Did not you look under the sink to see the way to the hole? - I was not in the room five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did your curiosity never lead you to examine it? - No.</p>
               <p>Where do you dress your victuals as you have the use of the kitchen? - I do not use it now; my sister was very much frightened.</p>

               <p>Was you subpoenaed to come here? - No; I was desired to come here to speak the truth that there was no hole there.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell that gentleman that you never heard it said whether there was or not till you' came into the court? - I must hear of it being in the house.</p>
               <p>Prothero. I took all the presses out of that hole, one of which was seven hundred weight; there was a sink for washing of dishes; under the sink there was a hole with coals in it, and behind the hole there was a hatch which was loose, which opens to the hole. I took every bit of the wainscot down from the top to the bottom with a pick-axe. Mr. Vernon saw me do it; this man says he came in from the top of the house, the house is but one story high.</p>
               <p>To Labar. Did you look at this hole? - Yes; it was a place by the sink, a little touch would open it.</p>
               <p>Was it such as any person might come out of or go in at? - Yes, without any trouble at all.</p>

               <p>I am asking you about the hole, or communication, from the kitchen to the place where the people were at work? - It was beside the sink.</p>

            : On Wednesday, the 8th of January, I was passing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150053"></xptr>by the gate where the heifers were kept, I saw it had been opened and just closed to, this was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I looked and saw that the heifers were gone; the last time I had seen them was the Saturday before, I missed them, and went home and told my mistress of it; I saw one of them again the Saturday after, at Stepney; I went to Mr. Marshall first, that bought them at Smithfield, I never saw the other afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; he is a <rs id="t18000115-58-deflabel337" type="occupation">farmer's son</rs>

             sworn. - I am a drover; the prisoner came to me on Thursday night, at Enfield Highway, where I lived, and delivered me two heifers; I asked him whether our salesman should fell them, and he said, yes; I asked him if the money was to be brought down for them, and he said, yes; they were sold, and my mother has got the money; the two were sold for ten guineas; he was to call for the money at our house, but he never called; one of them had got a great deal of white about it, of a pinchbeck colour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time did the prisoner come to you? - A. About ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a farmer's son, is he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the usual mode, is it not, for a farmer to send his beasts up by a drover? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- MARSHALL sworn. - Last Friday week, I bought two heifers of Mr. Collins, a salesman; I live in Aldgate High-street; one was a brindled, and the other was a spotted one; I killed one, and sent the other to a field, by Stepney-church; some persons came to see the heifer afterwards, but I was not present; they said, there was a brand in the horn of one of them, but I could see none.</p>
               <p>Biley. They had been all branded, I helped to brand them.</p>
               <p>Marshall. He said the brand was wore out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I saw a man with these two heifers on the road, and he said he was going into Hertfordshire, and I bought them of him, and gave ten pounds for them; I gave them to Mr. Field to sell for me.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HANNINGTON sworn. - The prisoner is a farmer, at Waltham-abbey; I know the field-gate belonging to Mrs. Cokeham's farm; on the 5th of January, in the evening, I was coming home from Waltham-abbey, I live near Mrs. Cokeham; I met two beasts, within two hundred yards of the field-gate, and some person driving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that was driving them? - A. I do not know; but I think, to the best of my knowledge, it was not the prisoner; it was very near eleven o'clock; I have known the prisoner these nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the colour of these two beasts? - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who gave him a good character, and deposed that his father had lately taken a farm for him, at North-hall.</p>

I directed my son and daughter to watch on the night of the 23d of February - they sat up in the room adjoining the kitchen, till three o'clock in the morning. I got up between five and six next morning, and came out on the stairs - I thought I heard some footsteps moving softly in the passage - I came on to the middle of the stairs, and heard the two prisoners whispering together at the bar door - I saw the light of a candle at the foot of the stairs I called and said</p>
               <p>"Is that you, James?" and Scrace said</p>
               <p>"It is;" I said</p>
               <p>"Give me a light?" He did so - I put it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070028"></xptr>my room and came down on the stairs without it. I then heard the bar door shut and locked, and the key taken out - I then heard the cellar door opened with a key, and heard one of the men go down into the cellar - I came down near the cellar door, and heard some liquor rattling into a can; Scrace then came out and went along the passage, stamping and calling out - I waited till Turner came up with a can full of gin - when he came to the top of the cellar stairs I took hold of his arm - I said</p>
               <p>"Samuel, is it you who is robbing us?" - he made no answer, but tried to get away - I cried Murder! he let the can drop, but got from me - he got over the pales in the yard and got away. I then went into the kitchen and saw Scrace standing there - I said</p>
               <p>"You and Samuel are robbing us;" he said he knew nothing at all about it - he seemed anxious to light the fire, and take up the ashes; we sent for a constable, and before he came another servant lighted the fire, and in the ashes we found this key, which will lock and unlock the bar door - we gave Scrace into custody. They had no right to draw any liquors - they get up about six o'clock generally - they usually slept together in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not one of the prisoners to have some gin for cutting your husband's corns? A. Yes, he gave it to him the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your husband give him some directions to go and get some bottle for a medicine for a dog? A. No, there was no bottle for dog medicine in the cellar - they must have known that - I had got a light of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time do your servants generally get up? A. Between five and six; the kitchen joins the bar, which was locked the night before by my son, who had the key - the cellar is on the other side of the passage - the cellar keys were locked up in the bar.</p>

            . In consequence of some information we had received, I and my brother sat up till three o'clock in the morning, and then I went to bed. I had seen my brother lock the cellar door, and put the key into the bar - he locked the bar door and put the key into his pocket - soon after five we were awoke by a cry of Thieves! I went down and saw Scrace standing by the kitchen fire - I asked if they had been robbing us; he said he had not; I said one could not do it without the other; he said he knew nothing about it; he seemed anxious to light the fire and take up the cinders - I said he should not do any thing till the constable came. When the cinders were sifted this key was found there - it was his usual business to fight the fire.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 23d of February I was applied to take Scrace into custody - Turner was brought to me at the watch-house afterwards; I believe I said I was sorry for what they had done, or to see them in that situation - I have no recollection of any thing they said, but that they were sorry, or something to that effect. I had known them some time, as servants at the Adam and Eve, public-house; I know Mr. Healy - there was nothing said in my hearing about their being transported or hanged.</p>

            . I slept in the house that night, but I do not know whether Scrace did - his usual place was with Turner; I know he went to sleep in the soldiers' room while Turner was cutting my father's corns - he could let himself into the house when he came to work in the morning; I stood by my father part of the time while he was having his corns cut, and then staid up till three o'clock. I gave orders to Turner to get some castor oil for the dog, and said I would get him a bottle out of the cellar in the morning, but he was not to get it. I fastened the cellar door, and hung the key in the bar, and then locked the bar, and put the key into my pocket.</p>

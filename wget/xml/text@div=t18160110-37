            . My husband's name is John. At the time this affair happened, we lived in Mary-le-bone-lane; we sold clothes of all descriptions. On the 20th of December, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and asked the price of a watch; I told him it was twenty five shillings. He looked at the watch, and went away without bidding any money for it. In a minute or two afterwards,he came in, and offered twenty three shillings for the watch; I told him, I could not take it. He turned his back to go out of the shop, and I went into the parlour. The pelisse in question was hanging inside the door, inside the door-way leading to the street; the door is open all day; there were two articles hung at the door before it; it was within the prisoner's reach at the door. A man came and told me that a man had ran away with the pelisse. I asked him to run after him, and he went together with another young man, named

            . I remember what passed; I live in a shoe-maker's stall close by. I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100017"></xptr>Prisoner come from Mr. Elliott's door, with the coat under his arm. I went and told Mr. Elliott; I went a little further, until I came to Mr. Brooks's shop, and the gentleman and I went after the prisoner together; we went about three hundred yards,and Mr. Brooks pursued him, and took him in Spanish-place.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROOKS. I have only this to say, that Moses Green came and told me that a man had stole a coat or a pelisse; I ran along with him; he ran one way, and I ran another; he ran up into the square, and I ran up Charles-street, and up Spanish-place; I saw the prisoner, and thinking I should meet Moses Green to come the other way; I pointed,and he nodded his head, and I secured the prisoner, and brought him to Mr. Elliott's shop, with the pelisse.</p>

I went down to Blackwall to try to get a ship, and as I was going home, I saw this watch hanging in the window; I asked the price of it, and offered twenty-three shillings; the lady would not take it, and I came away; as I was going along, a Jew shewed me this pelisse, and asked me twelve shillings for it; I offered him nine shillings, and when I was going away, he said he would take it, and just as I got to the corner of Charles-street, this gentleman collared me, and I said I would walk quietly with him, which I did. The good woman did not wish to swear I stole it.</p>

               <p>HARRISON'S Defence. I came up from Hull to look for my husband; I arrived early in the morning, and asked two young men the way to Westminster; they said they were going there: when I got there I took a room of the prisoner Wells; the two young men came again afterwards, and left the bundle, which they said they would give me 5 s. to sell, and they would stand at the corner of the street; I went out and met Wells, and we went to Hart's shop, and offered the things; when the officer came I went out with him to look for the young men.</p>
               <p>WELLS' Defence. On the 4th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I came out of my room and met the other prisoner, who asked me if I had a room to let - between two and three o'clock that afternoon, as I was returning home, I met her again, and she said could I tell her where they sold old silver; I went and asked Mr. Hart - he said come in, and then we were taken.</p>

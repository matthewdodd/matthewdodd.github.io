             sworn. - I am a constable; I was employed to watch the prisoner: On Sunday morning, I waited with Mr. Lambert's nephew from eight o'clock till nine, at No. 47, East-Smithfield, and within a few minutes of nine o'clock, Mr. Lambert's nephew shewed me the prisoner; he had a bag across his shoulder with this soap wrapped up in an apron in it; there were twenty-four pounds weight of soap in the bag; I jumped out of the coach, and waited for the prisoner coming up to the door, he went in at No. 47, at Robarts's, a potato warehouse; I followed him, I never had him out of my sight; he sat down, I went up to him, and told him he was my prisoner; I took the bag and him into custody, and conveyed him into the coach; I then asked him where he lived, and he gave me one or two false directions; by great persuasions we got from him where he lived, and there we found a great deal of Mr. Lambert's property, oil, and a great many other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with Robarts, did you take him? - A. No; they mostly lock the officer out of their house; I secured the prisoner, and took the property.</p>
               <p>Court. You did very right, but the house may be watched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in open day-light? - A. It was about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutor.) Q. Look at the soap? (the soap produced) - A. Here is the stamp that I put at the ends of the bars, and in this one there is the wire; I have some of the same wire left in my pocket, which exactly corresponds with this.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Lambert shewed to the Court the piece of wire he had left, and the wire he had then taken out of the soap.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To the prosecutor.) Q. I suppose you did not take this man without a good character? - A. No, I had a good character with him.</p>

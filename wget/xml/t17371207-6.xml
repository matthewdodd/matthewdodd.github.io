               <p>Mr. Cade. On the 25th of October, between 12 and 1 in the Morning, the Prisoner stopp'd me in <placeName id="t17371207-6-crimeloc39">Chiswell-street</placeName>

Immediately another laid hold of me with a long Knife, and he cry'd out, - your Money, quickly, or else we'll shoot you; upon which I deliver'd them 3 s. 6 d. and some Half-pence. The Prisoner search'd me for my Watch, and then they walk'd off, swearing if I turn'd after them, they would shoot me through the Head. I went cross the Way, and saw two Watchmen; then I cry'd out, Stop Thief, and the Prisoner took up a Court that was no Thorough-fare: I follow'd him, and he ran out of the Court again, and made down White-cross-street, and though I pursu'd and call'd out stop Thief, yet he ran past two Watchmen, and they never attempted to stop him, but in Beech-lane this little Watchman fell'd him with his Staff. I am positive to the Prisoner, for he was never out of my Sight, but just turning the Corner. My Penknife was found in the Prisoner's Pocket, and a loaded Pistol; the other Man ran away with my Money.</p>

The Prosecutor calling out stop Thief, and the Prisoner running toward my Stand in Beech-Lane, I bid him stand twice, he refused, and so I knocked him down, - that I did indeed; then the Gentleman came up and charged him with robbing him; so we carried him to the Watch-house, and found a Pistol upon him, and this naked Fork. <rs id="t17371207-6-verdict40" type="verdictDescription">

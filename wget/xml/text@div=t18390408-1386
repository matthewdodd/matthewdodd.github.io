                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, carrying on business in Felix-terrace, Liverpool-road, Islington. On the 1st of December the pri<lb></lb>soner came into my service as shop-boy—he was to have 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I had a character with him from Mr. Ludlow—he was not well furnished with clothes—on the 1st of January I paid him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, account of his wages, and advanced his salary 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year more—on Sunday, the 17th of March, I was in my kitchen—I looked into the safe in the area, where the prisoner kept his clothes, and found a pocket-book there with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I and my family kept a watch on him—I think it was on the 19th of March that I missed two handkerchiefs, which were taken from pieces which I have here—I asked the prisoner if they were sold—he said he had not sold them—on the 20th of March, when I came home at night, I sent him to bed in consequence of a communication made to me—I searched the win<lb></lb>dow, and found the same pocket-book which I had seen before, in the win<lb></lb>dow between two dresses—it then contained 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 51/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—Mr. Fowler called on me on the Sunday morning, and made a communication to me—I after that made another search, and found two silk handkerchiefs between the rafters of the floor and the skirting of the window, lying on the pavement—the shop-front runs out on the pave<lb></lb>ment, and near the skirting which goes on the pavement I found the hand-kerchiefs wrapped up—Mr. Fowler was with me when I found them—I put them back—they could not have got off the pieces by any accident—I had some difficulty to get, at them—I was obliged to go, down on my</p>

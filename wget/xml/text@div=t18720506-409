                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Thames Police Court—I was present on 5th April when James Donovan appeared to that summons—I produce notes of the evidence which was taken—several witnesses were called to prove the assaults, and some were called for the defence, amongst whom was the. defendant, Thomas Webster—he was sworn—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I live at 4, King Street—I am a coal-heaver—I was in Glasshouse Street on the morning in question—I saw the defendant (Donovan), Marr, and Ives there—I saw Crawley also there, and A crowd fighting with another man named Quill—the defendant was in the crowd—he never struck Crawley—I never saw him—if he did strike him I must have seen him—the defendant did not strike Crawley while I was there—I was there till the latter end of it—after they passed us by I went away—I was looking for work—I did not hear the man fighting with Crawley say anything—I heard Crawley Bay that he would break our club up, and that the money should be spent in drink—I am a member of the club—neither the defendant nor myself took any notice of this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Previous to this summons a summons had been issued for a common assault, but I was not present at the hearing of that case—I know that the case was withdrawn at the suggestion of the Magistrate—another summons was issued, in which the defendant, and Ives, and Marr were included, that was withdrawn, and a suggestion was made that separate summonses should be taken in order that each defendant might be called as a witness for the other—the summons was not dismissed—it was with<lb></lb>drawn at the suggestion of the Magistrate—it was not heard—I have no recollection of the case beyond the evidence on my notes—the notes were read over by the Magistrate, and each witness was asked whether they were correct, and they said they were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at the Thames Police Court—I was acting-clerk on the 6th April, when the summons against William Marr was gone into—Webster was called as a witness on his be<lb></lb>half—I took notes of his evidence—he was sworn. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I saw Crawley fighting with Quill—there was a crowd there—neither Marr, Donovan, nor I struck complainant—I must have seen them if they had done so.") Dennis Crawley was the complainant in that summons—on the same day the summons against James Ives was also taken—Webster was sworn as a witness on his behalf—he said "I swear Ives never spoke to Crawley, nor did any of the three strike him; I must have seen it if it had occurred"—the Magistrate cautioned the witness, and then he said: "I swear positively that neither Donovan, Ives, nor Marr struck Crawley; if either of them had done so I must have seen it"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was present when the other summonses were with<lb></lb>drawn—on the first occasion it was withdrawn because it was a summons for a common assault, and in the second case it was withdrawn because the solicitor wished it drawn in this form: "That they assaulted him with a view to coerce"—Counsel objected to the form of the summons, and the Magistrate decided to adjourn it, and then it was withdrawn—I don't recollect when Webster was giving his evidence, that he was asked whether he had seen Donovan strike Crawley—I have no doubt he was—I can't recollect whether when he was asked "Did you see Donovan strike Crawley?" he said "I did not"—I don't remember whether he was asked "Were you present with Donovan?" or that he said "I was;" or whether he was then asked if Donovan had struck Crawley he must have seen it—the Magistrate probably pressed that question—I have a sort of general impression that it was done, but I can't say—I can't say that he said "The reason I am particular is because I wish to speak the truth"—it is a very common speech for a witness, but I can't say that he said it.</p>

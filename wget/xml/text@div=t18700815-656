                  </hi>. I was living with the prisoner as his wife, at 19, Devon shire Street, St. George's—on the night of 10th July I was in the Clyde public-house—the prisoner came there and wanted me to go home—I would not go at first—we then went to a beer-shop at the corner of Star Street, and got home about 12.30—we were both the worse for liquor—we had some words, and I opened the window and was going to jump out—the pri<lb></lb>soner was sitting at the table—he had been cutting up some tobacco—when I opened the window he pulled me in, and tore down the back of the frock I have got on—I took the frock off and put on my black jacket—I took up the knife, and he ran down stairs after me, in the dark, and we fell down, and I felt I was cut—I did not know I was cut till I saw the blood, and I did not know where till after I was in the hospital—I found I was cut on my breast then—I was three weeks all but a day in the hospital—I don't know how the wound was inflicted.</p>

At the time of this occurrence I was a police-constable, I have since resigned—on 10th July, about 2.45 in the morning, I heard screams in Devonshire Street—I went there, and saw the prisoner in the street, bleeding from the chest—he handed me this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was shut—there were marks of blood on it—he said "I have stabbed my wife and myself three times; I don't care for myself, I hope she will get over it. God forgive me!"—I took him to the hospital, and when I got there I found the prosecutrix had been taken there before—the pri<lb></lb>soner was sober then—there were appearances of his having been drinking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On 10th July I went to the London Hospital and saw the prisoner—he was sensible, but very ill indeed—I said "I have come to take your statement, as the doctor says you are likely to die. You are charged with attempting to kill yourself, and also with stab<lb></lb>bing Selina Ford"—he then made this statement, which I wrote down—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, William Dash, aged 29, now an inmate of the London Hospital, state as follows:—That at about 2 a.m., of the 12th instant, a quarrel took place between Selina Ford and me. She threatened when I came home from work about a quarter past 11 p.m. We then had some words; she was in a beer-shop with a man. I asked her to come home, but she would not. I pushed her. Got home about 2 a.m.; had more words. She left the house, I fetched her back; she was then nearly drunk, and said she would get drunk when she liked. She was going to leap out of the window. I pulled her back. She took my pocket-knife, which was on the table; I took it from her. She was about to leave the house again, and in the struggle I saw she was wounded, and I then stabbed myself three times."—I took that and read it to Selina Ford, who was in another part of the hospital—she made a state<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>to me, which I also took down—I then went to the prisoner's bedside and read over to him what Sclina Ford said; this is the statement—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Selina Ford, aged 29, lived with William Dash as man and wife about nine months. About 11 p.m. on the 9th instant I was in the Clyde public-house, Commercial Road. Dash was passing, when he saw me in there; he said 'Come home.' I said 'All right, wait a minute.' He said 'If you don't I will make you.' I said 'I sha'n't go at all for you.' He pushed and hit me in the mouth. A policeman was near, I said 'I will give him in charge;' he said 'I shall not take him, I will take you if you don't go home; never mind him.' I went down to the beer-shop at the corner of Star Street; both entered with other persons known to us. At 12 at night we took a pot of beer and went home. We then had a quarrel. I left the room; he ran after me into the landlady's back room, where he stabbed me. I said 'Bill, you have killed me.' He said, 'You have made me do it; kiss me.' I did. I ran into the street. I saw him plunge the knife into himself I fell, and two men picked me up. I did not see any knife until I was stabbed. Selina Ford, + her mark."—She afterwards said "I hope he will not be punished."—I read that to Dash, and he said Ford did see the knife previous to his stabbing her—when he was charged at the station, he said that he did it, that he deserved punishment, and he wished the case to be got over—that was what made him come out of the hospital before he was ordered—he came out on the Sunday instead of the Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on 10th July I was called, and found the prosecutrix suffering from a stab in the chest, between the third and fourth ribs, penetrating into the lungs—it was a dangerous wound for some time, and must have been given with some degree of violence—she is perfectly well now—the wound could have been caused by this knife—I also examined the prisoner; he had three wounds, two in the chest and one under the arm-pit—one of the wounds pierced the lungs—that might have been done with this knife also—he was in danger for some time—I saw him at Arbour Square about ten days ago, and I did not consider he was well then—he went out before I told him to.</p>

If I had let her jump out of window there would have been no blame, I should not have been here.</p>

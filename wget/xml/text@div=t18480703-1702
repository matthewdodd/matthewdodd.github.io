                  </hi>. I live in Sugar Loaf-court, Tower-street. On 25th June I lost an over-coat, two pairs of trowsers, a black satin waistcoat, and some other things; a half-sovereign, a silver sixpence, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers—they were my property—I am married—I also lost a silver watch and a velvet waistcoat—I have one room on the first floor, and one on the second floor—the prisoner lodged in a room on the first floor, with his father—all the things were safe at a quarter-past four o'clock, when we went out—we came back at a quarter-past eight—we locked our door when we went out, and it was locked when we came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lowton, of 3, Little College-street. On 25th June, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner in company with a man named Godfrey—they went to a public-house—Godfrey went in, and the prisoner went up the court—Godfrey came out with a pot of beer, and the prisoner came and drank part of it—they both went up Sugar-loaf-court—when they came back the prisoner was dressed in a different suit, a dark suit; and Godfrey followed him, with a large bundle tied up in a handkerchief—the prisoner crossed the road, and Godfrey followed—they went towards London-bridge—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

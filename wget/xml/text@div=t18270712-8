I had a large box in my room containing this money in a silk purse, it laid at the bottom of the box, which was not locked, but there was another box on the top of it. I saw the money safe on Saturday morning, about nine o'clock, and the cap also. On Sunday about three o'clock, I wanted some money, and missed it - she was in and out of the room on Sunday morning; I went to her house, in Drury-court, that afternoon, and found her in the second-floor room, which is not her own - I sent for a constable, and found the ring of the purse in her pocket; here it is - I have had it many years, it is a common one. I have no mark on it - I found the cap in a drawer in her mother's room. I also missed a bed quilt which I have not found; the constable who had the cap is dead.</p>

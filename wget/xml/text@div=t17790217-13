On the 8th of February I lost three pigs; there were two found on the prisoner at the Three Tons in Turnmill-street in a bag; I saw them afterwards in the house of Mr. Isaacs the constable; I knew one of them by a piece being cut off the tail; there was no mark in particular on the other, therefore I cannot positively say that was mine.</p>
               <p>Were they small pigs? - Yes; five weeks old.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were they boar pigs or sow pigs? - That with the tail cut was a boar pig, the other was a sow pig.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of February; I went into the Three Tons to call for a pennyworth of purl, and saw him with a bag with two pigs in it in his hand; he was offering them to sale; he asked three shillings a piece for them. I asked him how he came by them; he said what was that to me; I said I believed he had stolen them, and would take him to a magistrate to see how he came by them. I took him to the magistrate; there he said first that he bought them; then he said he found them in the bag; they were warm. When I took him I found a knife upon him which I suppose he had stuck them with for there was blood upon it, and his hands were bloody; the pigs had not been long killed. I enquired about the neighbourhood, and was told they were Mr. Dunn's property; and he swore to them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Jury. What colour were the pigs? - Both white about five weeks old.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170010"></xptr>Was there any mark? - The tail of one was cut.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether they were sow or boar pigs? - The one a sow the other a boar; the boar pig had the tail cut.</p>

               <p>Last Monday was a week, as I was going by Charter-house wall, I saw a man with a bag across his shoulder; he asked me to buy two pigs; he asked nine shillings for them; I said I would give him six; he would not take it; he allowed them me for seven shillings and sixpence. I took them; I went into a publick-house for a pennyworth of purl; I put the bag down and went out to make water; when I came in Isaacs had hold of the bag, he might have changed the pigs for any thing I know; they are not the prosecutor's property; he keeps pigs for other people he has none of his own.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Do you keep pigs for other people? - No.</p>
               <p>Are those your own property? - They are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Anderson. When he came in he was very much in liquor. Witness. I was not; I had been drinking, but had my senses about me - I do not remember having conversation with any girls at the tap-room, or calling for rum and water; the persons at the same table might have it, but I did not drink any to my recollection. I did not dance with any body - I do not know whether I asked them to dance or not; I did not say Johnson had robbed me; I said Anderson was the woman, and so she is; I did not give charge of her that night, because I was not acquainted with the law in England - the Police-officer said, "Give her in charge;" I said I would next night, and the next night I dressed myself in other clothes; I found her, and said, "I hope you made good use of the money you took last night;" she said, "What money? I am not the person who robbed you."</p>

            . I am the Policeman. I went to the Bell - the prosecutor said Anderson had robbed him - he was not drunk, but had been drinking a little; I searched her, and found only a sixpence and a few halfpence on her - he wished me to search her; he did not say she had parted with the property - I did not take charge of her till the following night; she said she did not pick his pocket, but she knew the person who did - she went with me to Limehouse, and pointed out the other two prisoners, who, she said, were concerned in the robbery; she then said she took 10s. out of his pocket, which was all he had, and divided it; that Jackson said she had 2s., and so did the other, and two others, who are not apprehended; and Anderson said she had paid 2s. for rent that night.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. I was standing outside the door - he came and asked me if I knew Jackson and Powell; I said I did - he did not tell me what he took me for; he asked if I would give him any gin - I said I had no ginmoney; Jackson had a silk handkerchief round her neck, and he asked her to leave that for half a pint of gin; I asked him for it again at the office, and he said, it was taken out of his pocket, and a muslin one put in its place.</p>

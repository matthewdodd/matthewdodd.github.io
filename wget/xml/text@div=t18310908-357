            , who was then a Policeman, and used my house - I had a sick brother from Wales; he died at my house - J. G. King had asked if I knew of a small house at Deptford, as his wife was ill in town, and he wished to bring her there; I was going to Wales, and took a house in King-street to put my furniture in, and gave J. G. King the use of two rooms, to look after my furniture and take care of my wife - I locked my property up in other rooms; I then went to Wales; I gave Goodman King(not the prisoners) the key of my apartment; I returned about the end of February or March, but, being ill, did not go to Deptford for three weeks - I saw J. G. King before the Magistrate; he was not then in the Police -I found my house in King-street in possession of a stranger, and all my property gone; I asked J. G. King, before the Magistrate, what had become of my property; he said he knew nothing of it, but that his brother was at Royston - in August I went to a house in Ironmonger-row, and found J. G. King there, and in the back-parlour a piece of oil-cloth and some crockery of mine - I gave him in charge; I found my beer-machine in May last at Phillips' in Chiswell-street, and found my property at different places.</p>
               <p>J. G. King. Q. Did not you place the whole of your affairs in the hands of Goodman King? A. And your's also - he did not have the pumps of the engine - I sold him goods to the amount of 9l. 13s., to provide my wife with things during my absence: it was for none of these things he was to advance that, but she never had a farthing - I did not let the house to Goodman King - I gave him the key; you were to move on the night I went to Wales, (looking at a letter) this is my writing - I only sent for 5l., and never received a farthing.</p>
               <p>The letter being read, among other things, stated-DEAR SIR, - I am without a penny; I have sold my umbrella to get a bed and some bread; I have only had sixpenny worth of bread, and four pints of beer since Monday - please to draw 15l. on some broker; I will sell all belonging to me as soon as I come to London, which I hope will be in a week, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Addressed to Mr. King, King-street, Deptford Broadway.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COCKMAN. I live in Hackney-road. I took some goods to Deptford for J. G. King, and brought some back; it was about the 24th of January, I think - there was a beer-engine and other things; he helped me to remove them; Goodman King was there, and said they were his; there were quart-pots with Watkins' name upon them; they were found at my house - I lent Goodman King 3l. on them; Goodman King said the machine was his own invention.</p>

            . I am a carman to Mr. Challenor. On the 18th of August of August I was sent by my master to the India House for five chests of tea. After I had the chests of tea in the cart I had to go to a sugar bakers in Wentworth-street, for a hogshead of sugar, and then I had to take the whole to my master's. I knew how the chests were marked by the permit. I recollect the number of one of the casks was 16947. When I got to <placeName id="t18131027-2-crimeloc13">Wentworth-street</placeName>

I went into the sugar-house with the order for the sugar. I had nobody with me to mind the cart. I was absent from the cart about ten minutes, and as soon as I had put the hogshead of sugar in the cart I uncovered the chests of tea. I took the tarpaulin off, I missed one chest of tea. I immediately went to the office, and acquainted the officers of it. I, on the same day, afterwards, saw the same chest at Mr. White's house, in Cobley's-court, Essex-street. That was the same chest that was missing from the cart; it had the same number on it.</p>

The prisoner, Skinner, stamped his foot on the top of the chest; he knocked the top in; he then said if he lost any of the tea his master would make him pay for it. He then asked me and another woman to hold a bag for him. A third man had the bag.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 18th of August, Prior (the carman) came and gave information that a chest of tea had been taken out of his cart; it was near three o'clock. Hall and I went to Lion Levy's house, in Wentworth-street. When I went into the house I saw the two prisoner and another person that is not taken; they were along with Mrs. Levy, the mistress of the house. I told Mrs. Levy that I had just got information that a chest of tea had been brought in there. She said she knew nothing of it; I said I must look over the house. I left my brother officer to take care of the three men while I went up stairs. I found no tea. Upon my search we had no information against these men. I had not seen any of the witnesses then at that time. We left the house, and when we came out we consulted, and we returned in again, and finding Skinner in the house, not knowing him, we took him with us. The others we left, we thought we should be able to find them. After Skinner was taken to the office, I saw Mrs. White. When the prosecutor saw Skinner he told him that he had seen witnesses that had seen him steal the tea. As soon as Skinner heard that he confessed the whole; he said it was done by him and the other men; he said it was the first time that he had ever done any thing of the sort, and he had received two pound of Mrs. Levy for his share of the tea; he helped Mrs. Levy to put the tea into a sheet. Levy was not taken up until after last sessions. We went back to the house of Levy, the two men were gone. We searched Levy's house the second time, we could not find the tea. Skinner said, that Levy (the prisoner) had also two pounds of Mrs. Levy. Mr. Challenor brought the tea chest to the office. It has been in my fellow officer's possession ever since.</p>
               <p>- HALL. I was with Mr. Griffiths. I have heard his account, it is correct. I searched Skinner; I took from him a two pound note; he said that was his share that he received for the tea.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Prior. As near as you can say what time of day was it when you left your cart in Wentworth-street - A. Between two and three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the sugar baker at whose door you stopped - A. Coslett.</p>
               <p>Skinner said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Levy's Defence. I was coming past this alley, I saw two young men that I had never seen before in my life; they had a chest and a bag in their hands up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270005"></xptr>this alley; one of them asked me to hold the bag open for them; I held it open, and in a short time I walked away. I have never seen them since. Then after that I went into the place at the back of Mr. Levy's house, which is a large yard, and there were several people playing at ball, and different games. I went in, and played among them. I had been there a quarter of an hour when some young fellows said there is some officers coming, we had better go away. Some of them run out of the yard. I went into Mr. Levy's back room, and sat down there. I saw the prisoner, Skinner, sitting in the room with another young man.</p>

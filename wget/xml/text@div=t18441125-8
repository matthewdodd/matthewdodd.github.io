I received Mr. Honour's watch to repair—I repaired it, and hung it in my window, where it remained till Fri<lb></lb>day, the 25th of Oct.—I had reason to leave my shop that day, and go across to the grocer's—I was not gone above two or three minutes—on my return, I missed the watch from the window—it hung first to the pane—I imme<lb></lb>diately went to Mr. Honour, and asked him if he had been in my shop since I had been gone—he said no—I sent for a constable, and informed him of it, and wrote round the country to different makers to stop it—I believe I had seen the prisoner that day at Tring; I am not altogether satisfied of it, but I believe I saw him that day.</p>

I saw the prisoner at Colney-hatch on the 2nd of Nov., going along the, public-road with this pistol in his hand, about a quarter to five o'clock in the afternoon—it was not loaded—I stopped him, and said, "Arnold, where did you get this pis<lb></lb>tol?"—he said, "I bought it some months back of a marine-store dealer in Edmonton, named Burton, for bird-scaring"—while I was questioning him I perceived this chain hanging a little below the body of his coat—I asked what that was—he said, "My watch?"—I said, "Where did you get it, let me see it?"—he pulled out this watch—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it at Watford—I asked who of—he said, "Of a man that was going along with a wagon"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "Thirty shillings?"—I said, "Where did you get 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>?"—he said, "I earned it at bird-catching, and by the sale of my birds"—I asked him how long he had it—he said, "About three months"—not believing that he came by it honestly, I took him into custody, and took him to Edmonton—I made inquiries about the pistol, and I believe it to be correct that he had bought it where he stated, for bird-catching—next day I looked over the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>, and saw a watch answering the name and number, as being stolen from Tring on the 25th of Oct.—I went there, and found the prosecutor, who identified it.</p>

I went to Lynn market on the 4th of December, and returned between twelve and one o'clock at night, on the gelding, which was afterwards stolen; it was worth 40l. - my servant boy took the gelding, and put it into the stable - I was alarmed between four and five o'clock in the morning, by my man, who informed me it was gone - I went immediately in pursuit, without going into the stable- three of us went different ways - I returned two days after, without finding it - I had information about a fortnight afterwards, and came to town, and saw my gelding in Henderson's stables; I am certain it is mine - it is over at the New Inn now, and is the one I lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew it again? A. Yes; it is a dark brown, and I knew it by some white hairs under the saddle.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you had it? A. Three years - I cannot be mistaken in it - I have known the prisoner ever since he was a child - he lived about half a mile from me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. I understand, up to the time this occurred, he bore a very good character? A. Very good - I had employed him at harvest work, and he gave me satisfaction.</p>

            . I am a veterinary surgeon, and live in Park-lane. I know the prisoner - I saw him on Friday the 7th of December, at Smithfield-market, and bought a horse of him that day, in the market - I paid him twelve sovereigns for it; it was afterwards claimed by Whisler; the same horse is now over at the New Inn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you would not have bought it, if you had entertained any suspicion? A. No; it was openly sold - I agreed for the price in the open market - I took him up the yard, and desired the ostler to bring a light, and I should see to pay him - I asked him whose horse it was; he said his own - I asked where he came from; he said it became his own, by the death of his father; he had a crape hat-band on, and I considered his story correct; he gave me the name of William Thompson, living at Totten-hill, near Lynn. I put it down at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Might he not have referred you to Thompson, as the person from whom the horse came? A. I am certain he said that was his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of the day did you complete the bargain with him? A. About half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I deal in china, glass, and Staffordshire ware, and live in Goswell-road, opposite the Northampton Arms. I have known the prisoner from a child. On the 8th of December, when I came home, about eight o'clock in the evening, I found him at my house; I said, "How came you so far from home?" he said, "I was out of employ," and so I thought he had come to town, to look for employ; he slept at my house that night, and I saw him again on Sunday morning, the 9th; he breakfasted with me, and some little time afterwards, while I was dressing myself, he said, "I am not left without money; I can raise eleven sovereigns, and some silver;" I said, "I am happy to hear it: you have not left home in poverty?" he said, No; he left eleven sovereigns with me to keep for him; and afterwards, in consequence of a message, I went and saw him in Newgate - I held out no threat nor promise whatever to him - I said, "Matthew, I am very sorry to see you in this case;" he looked at me, and was fit to cry; I said, "I suppose some evil person has led you into this;" he said there has, and named William Thompson of Totten-hill; he said William Thompson broke the stable door open, and took the horse out, and gave him directions to bring it to London, and what house to come to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was at the time? A. No; he said Thompson broke the stable open, and put the saddle and bridle on the horse, and told him which way to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Twelve or fourteen years - I know his friends; they are very respectable, for their situation in life; he always bore the best of character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

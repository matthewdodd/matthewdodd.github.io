                  </hi>. I am a student at Woolwich. On 13th March, I was on Woolwich Common—a number of soldiers had landed and were marching to their quarters—I had a watch when I went there, and I missed it about 4 o'clock—I put my hand to my pocket, and the watch was gone—I had had it safe half an hour before—there was a great crowd there—this is my watch, I found the chain broken; this is the part that was broken—I think the watch is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

THOMPSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you had it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—the glass was in it on that day—I am not sure what is the maker's name—the glass was not out of the watch when it was shown to me on the 13th—it has been broken since—the watch went—it was given to me by my father—it is gold—there are no particular marks on it by which I know it, except the appearance of it—I went on the common about 2 o'clock—all the boys of our school were there—I was just at the corner of the common when I first missed the watch—it was after the arrival of the Queen—she was there when I reached the common—I went down to the Arsenal to see them land and then went to the common—I do not know when I last saw my watch—I recollect telling a friend to take care of his watch, and at that time my watch was safe—I have no doubt about this being my watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 118). I was at Woolwich, in plain clothes, on 13th March—I saw the prisoner between 4 and 5 o'clock, in company with another man—they were coming from the common and going to the railway—I was passing, and I went over to the prisoner and asked him if he came from Holborn—he said, "No"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "I thought I saw you in London"—he said, "No, I came from Dart<lb></lb>ford"—I said, "What have you got in your pocket?"—he said, "A bit of tobacco"—I said, "Let me feel; I am a police constable"—he put his hand in his pocket and was handing something to the other one—I saw what he was doing and threw him on his back—I took this gold watch from his hand, and took him to the station—while the charge was being entered, I asked him if he had anything else—he said, "No"—he was searched, and I found this other gold watch—he dropped it from the back of his person on the ground.</p>

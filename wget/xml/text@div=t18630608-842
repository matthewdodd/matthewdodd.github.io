I am the wife of Cornelius Albuary, who keeps a coffee-shop at 3, Rail way-terrace, Plumstead—on Thursday afternoon, 21st May, a little before 4, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for a cup of coffee and two slices of bread and butter, which came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a half crown in payment, I put it into my purse—I had no other silver there than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I took out to give him in change—between 6 and 7 that even<lb></lb>ing I sent out that half crown by my little boy to buy some butter of Mr. Topley next door—Mr. Topley came back with the boy and the half-crown; I then saw it was bad—I went to Woolwich to look for the prisoner, but could not find him; I got home a little before 9, and found the prisoner in the shop, detained by my husband and the policeman—I recognised him at once—I gave the half-crown to the policeman.</p>

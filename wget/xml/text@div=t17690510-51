Some time after I had been in bed, I fell asleep, and awaked about five. I had put my breeches under my head at going to-bed; but when I awaked, I found them lying on my pillow. I felt in my pocket, and found there were no money in it. I had eight guineas, one half guinea, and a quarter guinea in my pocket, when I went to-bed. I sent a man out to know if he could hear of the prisoner, having a suspicion of him; he was taken up: The quarter guinea of mine I had taken in Smithfield in change for a nine shilling piece, where I paid it away. I had it returned for not good. There was a white spot like silver on the chin and upper lip. We found the prisoner had changed one with Mr. Eaton. I went to him, he laid down two. I took up one, and said, This is mine. There were five guineas, two half guineas, and two shillings and six-pence found upon the prisoner. By enquiring, I found he had spent two pounds at a house in White-hart-yard.</p>

I saw him when he came down; and my mother asked him why he came down again; he said he was a-dry, and wanted more beer. Then he went out at the door, came in again, and had got some money, and paid me a shilling for his lodging; he also paid for a pot of beer that he and another had in the evening. I changed him a shilling, when he paid for the beer. He said he should not lie in my house, but should use my house as usual. (He had quarrelled with a young man, when he came down stairs.) Then he went out again, which was about twelve at night. I never saw him after till before Sir

                  </hi>. I live in Clifton-street, Finsbury, and am a silk manufacturer. I was in partnership with my father till the 8th of October, for about two years—his name is william—on the 6th of the present month I called at the house of Steffanoni and Co., upholsterers, in Holborn, I found there some pieces of silk tabouret—I believe them to be ours—I brought them away, and delivered them to my father—the prisoner was in our employment—he left about the 4th of July—we had not authorized him to take any silk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's father. The prisoner was in our joint employ—he left us about the 4th of July—I can identify several of the pieces as ours—I have no doubt of any—I have examined the book to see if there is any entry of their going out, and there is none—I have the book here—I did not allow the prisoner to part with any such goods without making an entry—we have roughly guessed the value of them at 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not these left as patterns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never sent out patterns so large—I have heard he has gone into Mr. Bell's Employ—I do not know what trade he carries on—I know he solicits among my cus<lb></lb>tomers—he introduced me to some few, and he is now introducing them to Mr. Bell—we parted friends—I parted with him because I found the busi<lb></lb>ness he carried on, did not empower me to keep him—I never heard that he was himself in business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner on this day week—I told him it was for stealing some Silk be<lb></lb>longing to Mr. Gramolt—he begged me to go to Mr. Gramolt's—I did no, and he begged for forgiveness, and that very hard—I had received some pieces of silk from Mr. Gramolt's the day before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Steffanoni—I cannot swear that these pieces were delivered to young Mr. Gramolt—they were similar to these—they were received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Steffanoni is not here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir—these were left as patterns to get orders—pieces of this description are left as par<lb></lb>terns, and much larger—the prisoner called for them once or twice—he had not disposed of any of them—he was to have them back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were they left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three weeks from the present time, at about two o'clock, I should think—I understood he left them on his own account; I received them—he merely said they were left as patterns on approbation—we had not purchased them, but were to give orders on what we liked—we were to give the order to himself—I under<lb></lb>stood he was in business on his own account—they would he of use as par<lb></lb>terns for furniture—I think the largest is not more than two or three yards—we have sometimes patterns of five times the length of this, but still they are of value—they are useful for a pattern book—a whole piece consists of from forty to sixty yards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

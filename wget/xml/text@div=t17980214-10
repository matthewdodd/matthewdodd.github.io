The next morning, Saturday, I got up about seven; I went to the window, and saw Beal's cart drawn just under the Windsor stable door, I dressed myself, and came down stairs, I went to the cart, and in the cart was a sack with some oats and beans mixed in it; I then informed my master, and came back again; I did not see my master till past nine; when I came back, I saw Beal come into the yard, and went out again; the cart was standing in the same place I had seen it before; then Mr. Beal came in again to harness his horse, that was between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drew the cart there, you don't know? - A. No; Mr. Beale put his horse into the cart, and whispered something to Parker, who is the ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140021"></xptr>complice; Bickeridge was then in the stable; Beal put his house to, and another man helped him to harness it; Beal then went out of the yard with the horse and cart, I followed him out of the yard, and stopped him; I asked him what he had got in his cart, he said he had nothing at all but what was his own; I told him, if he got up, I thought he would find something there that was not his own; he would not get up, he had his dog in the cart; I told him, if he would move the dog, I would get into the cart myself; Beal said, then I will get up into the cart with you; there were two sacks in the cart, I took hold of the sacks, and asked him if that was all he had in his cart, and he said, yes, for any thing he knew; I got into the cart, and found the sack, with the corn in it, covered over with straw; I asked him if that was his, he said he did not know how it came there; I took the sack, and gave it to a gentleman to lift down, and I told Beal he should not go any further till my master came; he begged I would not make any piece of work about it, but if it was our corn, we should have it again; I told him I could not do that; he begged I would let him go, and if there was any thing the matter, he would settle it when he came again on Friday; afterwards he said he would tell the truth, he said that Parker told him there was something put into the cart for him; he said no more about the corn, but he said Mr. Gray was a long while, and he was afraid he should not get home by dark; I did not let him go till he was taken into custudy; the corn was taken into the Bell Savage parlour. I went into the Windsor stable the night before, there were about four bushels in the bin, and in the morning there was but about half a bushel left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sack that was in Beal's cart full? - A. No, it contained about two bushels; when the constable came, my master took Beal into the parlour, and asked Beal how he came by the oats, and he said Parker told him there was something for him in the cart; I went to fetch Parker, and my master asked him about it, and he said Old Dick, that is, Bickeridge, told him there was a sack there, and desired him to put it into the cart, which he did; then I went to call Bickeridge, he was in the Windsor stable at work, he came in, and my master asked him if he knew any thing about the corn and beans that were put into Beal's cart; Bickeridge said he knew nothing at all about it; my master directly said, Parker says you told him to put it into the cart; Bickeridge said, how can you tell such a lie, Jem, for I nevertold you no such thing; and then they were all three taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you been ostler at this place? - A. Three years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.Beal has been a constant frequenter of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Every Friday, when he comes to Fleet-market? - A. Not every Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. He deals in fruit in Fleet-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Early in the morning he is obliged to be in the market upon his business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you saw the cart, Beal was not in the yard? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.But Bickering was in the stable? - A. I cannot say; he was there almost directly after.</p>
               <p>Q.Parker said, when he was taken up, that Bickeridge had told him to put something in the cart for Beal, did he not, at the same time, tell you that Beal was not there at the time it was put in? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Beal had a pretty fierce dog with him? - A. I cannot say that he was very fierce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not quiet the dog for you to get into the cart? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Beal was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, upon this evidence, Beal, if he is to be charged at all, should have been charged with receiving, and not with stealing: With respect to Bickeridge, there is no evidence to affect him, except that of an accomplice, and therefore they must be acquitted.</p>

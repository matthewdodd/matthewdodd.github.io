               <p>CHARLES BRADFIELD. I am a <rs id="t18330411-106-viclabel589" type="occupation">livery-stable keeper</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330411-106-victim837 t18330411-106-viclabel589"></join>, and live in Ropemaker-street, Finsbury. I have known the prisoner these twelve months - he was in my employ at the time in question (on the 13th of March) as <rs id="t18330411-106-deflabel590" type="occupation">groom</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330411-106-defend836 t18330411-106-deflabel590"></join>, and has been so about a month; I was in the stable with him, when one Macklin came in, and asked me to lend him a mare to go to Clapham, and to let Bailey go with him - he was to ride her there, and to fetch two horses for a gentleman; I gave the prisoner leave to go - Macklin said he should be gone two or three hours; I knew he and the prisoner were acquainted - the prisoner had mentioned Macklin's name to me several times, and said he had to fetch horses from Clapham - he had told me he was a very respectable man, and had a good deal of property; in the afternoon I found the mare was gone - she did not come back that night nor next day; (the 13th was on Wednesday) - I saw the prisoner again on the Friday; he came back to the stables - I asked him where he had been, and where was Jem Macklin; he said he did not know that he(Macklin) had left him at Putney on the Wednesday evening, and said he should return soon - he was taken into custody, and I found the mare at the White Lion, at Putney.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WENSLEY. I am a livery-stable keeper at the White Lion, Putney. On the 13th of March, in the evening, the prisoner and another person came to my place; the other man was driving the mare in a chaise - he desired me to take care of the horse; I took it in - he drove it into the yard, and the prisoner gave me orders to take care of it; I went into the house - I saw no more of the other man, but saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and he told me to take particular care of the horse, as they had drove him a great way - the horse had some gruel made; the prisoner stopped there till the Friday afternoon; he said he expected the other man back, he said he was gone to look at a gentleman's horse, and he expected him back every hour - that was the same evening, and on Thursday he said he wondered he did not come back; he offered the mare to me for sale, and to several other people, and asked 13l. for it; on Friday a gentleman came into the yard - I do not know his name; he came from Croydon - he had the mare out to try it; the prisoner was present, and borrowed a saddle and bridle of me to try it with - it was tried in the road by the gentleman; the gentleman did not buy it - about five o'clock that evening the prisoner went away; he said he was going to look after his master - the horse remained there; I asked him, if any body wanted to buy it, what I should sell it for - he said I was not to take less than 13l.; he said he expected his master every hour; I asked what I was to do with the horse and chaise if his master came; he said, "I suppose you would know him;" I said I did not know - that I should not suppose any body would come but the right owner; he asked me what the expenses were - I said about 13s.; he said that was right, and he must go and get the money - he went away, leaving the horse and chaise with me; Bradfield came that night he claimed it, and took it away next morning.</p>

               <p>MR. BRADFIELD. Macklin had no conversation with me which the prisoner did not hear; he heard him borrow it, and must know he had not bought it.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Bradfield's stables on Friday night - I saw him and the prisoner there; the prisoner said the horse, chaise, and harness were at Putney, and there were 14s. or 15s. to pay expences - I took him to the station-house; Bradfield went down to Putney; I have been after Macklin - he lived in Chiswell-street, and buys horses to go abroad for different gentlemen - he has run away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had sold the mare I should have paid the expences, and taken the money home to my master; I had not 1s. to pay my expences - she was for sale.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you ever commission the prisoner to sell her? A. No; it was for sale, and the price was 12l. - the prisoner might have heard me mention that; he was only groom, and never bargains for me about horses.</p>

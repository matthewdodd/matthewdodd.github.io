Some lead was missed—the prisoner was in my master's employ—on the 21st of June, I was placed in the office to watch—I could see the shop—I saw the prisoner—he cut up some lead, beat it up, and took some in his bosom, and some he put under a bag in the shed and secreted it under the stairs—when the time canto for them to go to dinner he left to go to his dinner, and was taken with twenty<lb></lb>six pounds of lead on him—the lead that was put under the stairs was removed somehow or another.</p>

                  </hi>. About two or three o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of October, I was in the vicinity of Covent-garden—I gave Perkins something to drink, and walked about some time—she asked me to go with her into Charles-street—I went with her—I was a little elevated with liquor—I sat down on a chair a little while, and fell asleep—I had a half-sovereign and some loose silver, a silk-handkerchief, and a watch in my pocket, I am certain, for I took it out and looked at it while I was there—there was nobody in the room but Perkins when I fell asleep—when I awoke I found myself robbed of every thing, and Perkins was gone—I came out and gave an alarm—this watch, chain, and seal, are mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Perkins</hi>. It was to Robinson he gave the watch, and not to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did hot see Robinson in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi>. He gave me the watch as a pledge—he was in company with five or six more women at Shaw's public-house at the corner, and he took another woman up, and swore to her. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Red Lion public-house in Drury-lane. Robinson came into our house about a quarter after five o'clock; in the morning, sat down, and called for a quartern of gin—then for another quartern, and asked one or two persons who came in, to drink—she pulled a watch out of her bosom, and asked me to lend her a knife—she went the end of the place, and began scratching it—she brought it to me, and asked me to pawn it for her—a few minutes after some more females came in, and she told me to lay the watch down—she began crying, and said her husband had been away seven years, and he had sent her a watch, and handkerchief, and plenty of money—about twenty minutes afterwards Perkins came in. and said to Robinson, "I have left him sitting in the room"—another female named Rose came, and they were laughing toge<lb></lb>ther</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183910210113"></xptr>
               <p>—I suspected the watch was stolen, and spoke to Rose, who gave me information—the prisoners went out together, returned again in five mi<lb></lb>nutes, and Perkins asked mc for the half-sovereign—I told her I knew no<lb></lb>thing about any half-sovereign, and asked what she meant—Robinson called her away, and said, "No, no, that is all right"—Perkins then asked me for the watch—I asked where she got it—she made use of very abu<lb></lb>sive language, and asked me what business it was of mine, and what b—business I had to detain the watch—I told her it was stolen, and I should detain it till Mr. Cocket, my master, came down—this is the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past six o'clock on this morning, I saw the prisoners and another in a coffee-shop—Perkins was putting something into her bosom—I asked her for the watch—she said, "What watch? I have no watch"—I told her to get up, and this watch fell from her person on the ground—Robinson was sitting along-side of her—she said nothing—another constable, who is not here, took her.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Robinsons Defence</hi>. About four o'clock on Tuesday morning, I felt very poorly, and went into the public-house at the corner of the Piazza—to prosecutor, was there with four or five women—he asked us to have something to drink, and when we left, he asked if he should see us home—I agreed, and he went home with us; and having no money, he gave me the watch to pawn for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as soon as the pawnbroker's was open, and said he would call for me in the evening—I left the watch at the Still till the pawnbroker's was open—Perkins is entirely innocent—she was sent for to the Still, and saw the watch.</p>

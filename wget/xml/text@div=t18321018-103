On the 1st of October, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a shawl, which came to 1l., and two pairs of stockings for 2s.8d. - she tendered me a 5l. Bank note; I looked at it, and told her I thought it was a forgery - she said, "If it is, my husband can get it changed from the person who got it from the Bank of England;" she said she received it from her husband, and gave me his address, No. 18, Windmill-street, Haymarket - I gave the note to Staff, my shopman; he brought it back in about five minutes, and marked it at the station that evening - I never parted with it till I got to the station, nor mixed it with any other; this is it (looking at it) - when Staff brought it back, I went out to Chapelplace to ask Mr. Braithwaite's opinion, and was satisfied it was forged; I returned, and said I would go with her to her husband; she said there was no occasion, for that it would make things unpleasant; she said she would leave half a crown, and call in an hour, and pay the rest - she put half a crown on the counter, and asked to have the note back, which I refused, and gave her the half-crown; she then left the shop - I called for my hat, and followed her - she returned down Regent-street; I kept her in sight, and met Smith, a Policeman; he accompanied me down Regent-street, where I gave her in charge; we walked to the Quadrant, and then she said she would tell me the truth where and how she got the note; I do not recollect saying any thing to induce her to tell any thing - I might have said she had better tell me; she said she met a very nice old gentleman, who came up to her, caught hold of her shawl, and said, "Have not you a darker shawl, more suitable for the season which is coming?" she said No; and he said, "Well, I will give you one;" that he took out his pocket-book, gave her the note, and said she was not to give more than 1l. or 25s.; I asked where the man was, and if she would know him - she said Yes, he was a stout man, about fifty; I asked where she was to see him; she said, "Under the Quadrant, or if not there, at the first public-house on the right hand side in Windmill-street, Haymarket" - we went to that public-house, and made inquiry; she pointed nobody out there; I saw no such person - she was taken to the station.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. Where was she when she said she was to meet the old gentleman under the Quadrant? A.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Saunders. I remember the prisoner coming and tendering the 5l. note, which master desired me to take to Mr. Stanford, a neighbour, to ask his opinion whether it was good - I took it, leaving the prisoner in the shop; I brought the same note back, put it into master's hands, and told him Mr. Stauford's opinion - after that he said, in the prisoner's hearing, that he would go to a neighbour himself with it; she made no reply; after he was gone some time, she asked where he was gone; I said, "To a neighbour;" she said it would injure her very much, and she should be very late home; that her husband was not aware she was going to purchase a shawl, and it might cause some disagreeableness - she asked how long he might be; I said I could not tell, he was only gone a few doors off; in the mean time he came in, told her it was a bad note, and he must keep it - he wanted to walk home with her to her husband; she declined, saying it would make it very disagreeable, and she would leave all the silver she had, which was half a crown, which she laid on the counter; Mr. Saunders would not take it - she wished to have the note back; he said he could not return it; she told me she had seen some very pretty shawls in our window, which took her fancy, and induced her to come in; she declined allowing Mr. Saunders to walk with her, but said she would return with her husband in a quarter of an hour; she left the shop, and master followed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the note sent into Mr. Stanford's back parlour to be looked at? A. No; it was never out of my sight - I was gone not above five or ten minutes, and found her waiting there when I returned; I am sure she said the half-crown was all she had - I had left the shop by the private door, to watch her - I followed master and the officer.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 1st of October I met Mr. Saunders in Oxford-street, accompanied him down Regent-street, and went up to the prisoner - when we got to the end of the Quadrant, she turned round, and said, "Now, Sir, I will tell you the whole truth;" Mr. Saunders' account of what she said is correct - I had been with him for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and had not heard him say a word to induce her to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search her? A. Yes, and found 12s. on her, in silver - she was about twelve yards before us, till we stopped her; she turned down a court; I followed her, and she was tying her shoe or stocking, or pretending to do so; she then crossed to the other side, still going towards the Quadrant; Saunders first went up to her fifty or eighty yards from the Quadrant; some conversation might have taken place between her and Saunders before I went up - she might have thrown any thing away in the court, as it was dark, but I did not search to see if she had, which I should have done if I had suspected it.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. When was she searched, when she got to the station? A. Not for an hour; I searched her pockets, and merely felt her breast.</p>

               <p>MR. FOLLET. Q. Where was this? A. In Regent-street; it was on a Monday - we had walked from between six and seven o'clock - I was looking about for new patterns for my business, in different shop windows; I am a trimming manufacturer, and live in Old Montague-street, Brick-lane, Whitechapel - we met the gentleman in Regent-street; I left them down a turning close by Oxford-street; I do not know the name of the street - I walked with them for about half an hour, to various places; they were looking at different shop windows, up Regent-street, till they came to Oxford-street - the gentleman said in Regent-street; that he would make her a present of a shawl, and asked her to have something to drink - I saw him take out his purse, and heard him say he had nothing but a 5l. note, except a little silver - I saw him give her a bit of paper from his purse; it appeared like a note - by the prosecutor's shop she said "That is a shawl which, if I was going to purchase, I should like;" I wished them good night, and left them together, going towards the prosecutor's shop again; she took his arm, and walked towards the prosecutor's shop - I did not hear him tell her to meet him under the Quadrant or at a public-house; I heard him say"Mind and return the change, and not give more than 1l. or 25s., if you do, I shall be angry;" I at first thought that he was joking, but when he gave her the note I found he was in earnest; he said when he met her "Have you not a better shawl?" she said not - he said "I will give you one if you will go with me" - I heard she was in custody on the Wednesday following; I have known her four years, but do not know where she lived - I had not seen her for seven or eight months; I believe she is married.</p>

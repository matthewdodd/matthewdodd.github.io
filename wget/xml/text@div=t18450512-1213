                  </hi>. I carry on business at No. 110, Blackman-street, Bo<lb></lb>rough. On the evening of the 18th of April I was standing on the stain, and saw the prisoner sitting by the side of my counter—she took a table-cover from the counter, folded it, and put it under her shawl—I came down and waited about two minutes—she was sitting by the side of the counter—I told my man to go for the policeman—she then took the cover from under her shawl, and said, "What, about this"—she said she was going to ask the price of it—she had not bought anything then.</p>

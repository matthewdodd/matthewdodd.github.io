Says he, D - n your Blood, and threatened me if I did not go back what he would do to me. I knew the Captain, and went to him, and he sent him to the Black-Hold. Then he said, a Custom-House-Officer had taken the Goods from him by St Giles's Pound, and when he found the Commitment was made for him to go to New-Prison, he owned where the Tea was; that there was nine Pound at Mr Lovelace's, ten Pound in another Place, three Pound at another, and two Pound his Wife had.</p>

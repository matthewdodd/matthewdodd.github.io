                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman and lighterman, of Worcester-wharf, Thames-street.

I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and on Friday night, 19th Sept., I watched the barge <hi rend="italic">Edwin</hi>, at Nine Elms—there were three other officers with me—on the Saturday morning about 6 o'clock, I saw the three prisoners come across Battersea-fields, in a direction towards the barge—they went into her—they went into another barge first—they took some considerable trouble to get into this barge—when they got in, Beard went aft; he lifted up the scuttle, and looked into the cabin—Fordham let go the head rope, and Smith loosened the oare—they then commenced pushing the barge ashore towards a draw dock—I immediately went alongside of the barge, and Beard and Fordham jumped on to the other craft that were there—they had been pushing the barge in the direction of the draw dock, but they did not get there—I told the other officers to take Fordham and Beard, and I directed my attention to Smith, who was still in the barge—he could not get out, because the barge was then floating ahead—Smith had the hitcher in his hand—I said to him, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, I hare <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> you again"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Nailed</hi> me! what have you <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> me for?"—I said, "For those oats that are in the barge's cabin"—he said, "Oats in the cabin in the abin!

I said, 'Yes,' and I asked him where the barge was, and he walked along where there was a lot of rubbish, and showed me the barge; he said we were to land them out there; I told him I would be there in the morning; I was proceeding home, and I saw Smith and Beard; I asked them if they wanted a job; they said, 'Yes;' we met at 5 o'clock, at St. George's Church, in the Borough, to go and get these cats, and were walking along where they shot this rubbish; we saw some barges; Smith said, 'There is no oats in either of these barges;' he then got to this barge, and he lifted the tarpaulin and looked down in the cabin and said, 'Here are some oats here;' he said, 'We can't unload them here; there is a place where it will be most proper to unload them;' and as we were <hi rend="italic">shaving</hi> the barge along, they came in the boat and took us."</p>

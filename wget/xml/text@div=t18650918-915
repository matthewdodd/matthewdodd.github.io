I awoke a little before three o'clock, I went down stairs and brought the razors from the cupboard in the kitchen; I then came upstairs.

                  </hi>. I am a widow—my son is related to the prisoner—within the last six months I have occasionally gone in to look after the prisoner and her children—I was nursing her daughter at the time this matter occurred—she has appeared to be very lost in her mind—she would, very often, say very strange things at times, and then forget entirely what she had said—I have noticed that several times lately, three or four times in a week—she always complained of dreadful pains in her head, and choking in her throat, which, she said, would pass to her head—about a week before this occurrence, she stopped suckling the child; I persuaded her, on account of its weakening her head so—within the last two or three months she has had fits—she frequently fell down two or three times in a day—the Sunday morning was the last—she has been subject to these fits, on and off, since about a fortnight before last Christmas—they increased towards the latter part of the time—she had a very bad one on the Sunday; she went out to try and get a little bit of victuals for the children, and she fell down in the street, and was obliged to be carried home—that was not the last of them that she had before this occurrence; she had two on the Tuesday, the very day before; the first was between 10 and 11 in the morning, and the other, about 2 or 3 in the afternoon—sometimes she would be half an hour in one of these fits, and sometimes not more than a quarter of an hour—during the fits she had no senses whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you live near there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, close by—I saw her in two of the fits, and I have seen her several times, when she has just come out of them, before she has got her senses—I did not see her go into the fit; she fell down, and I went to her, to help her up—that has happened on two occasions to my knowledge—I saw her on the floor, on the Tuesday, and helped her on to a chair—I can't exactly say how long she was in the fit that day; about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Gardner, who has been examined—I have been in the prisoner's house continually for the last few months before this occurrence, I lived there—I have observed that she has had fits—I have helped her when she has been in the fits, and I have seen her go in fits—some of them would last a quarter of an hour, some three quarters, and some longer—while she was in the fits she was not sensible, and she would lose the use of her limbs entirely—her mind used to wander very much indeed—she used to say strange things—she used to ask me whether I had been to various places where I never thought of going, and she used to say she had been out to different places where she had never been in her life, and when she had not been out of doors—she has asked me if I had been to see persons that I have never known, and she has talked of persons that she never knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Scripture-reader—in that capacity I have been in the habit of visiting the prisoner since the year 1848—the last time I saw her to speak to her was on the 2d August last—latterly I have observed a great change in her manner; during the last seven years, a gradual change—her intellect has got weaker—that observation applies continuonsly to the, the last time I saw her—on one occasion last winter I called on her to leave her some relief and I was speaking to her with reference to the sufferings of Christ—she said His sufferings were not to be compared to hers, for her head was in such pain that she felt that she could jump over the bank, meaning the water-side.</p>

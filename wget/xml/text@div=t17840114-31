               <p>I took the prisoner; we missed this pistol over night, the 23d of December, and it was found in the stable; it had hung up in the room; we let it remain where we found it, and between two and three o'clock the door was open and the pistol gone, and about eight o'clock I saw the prisoner on the mushroom bed, covered with this cloth; I went there to search for the pistol; the prisoner was hid under hay; I trod upon him before I saw him, and stirring aside the hay I saw the pistol; he said he got the horse cloth out of the stable, he said he knew nothing of the pistol; he was sober.</p>

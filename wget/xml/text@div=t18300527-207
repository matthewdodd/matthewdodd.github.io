            . I bought these sashes of Mr. Brooks two or three days previous to their being stolen; I saw them again on the morning of the 20th of May, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270097"></xptr>the frame of the building - I told my man to take them down; I afterwards saw this sash, which is one I bought - I had not authorized any one to bring the sash away; I took the prisoner in consequence of information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you purchased many houses? A. No; several lots of different articles - I bought some of Mr. Brooks on the Monday previous to the 20th, which was Thursday; the sash was then fixed in the building - there were perhaps twenty sashes in the building, but this was a particular sash; there were no others like this in the building - they were two inch sashes, which is an uncommon size; I do not know how the prisoner became possessed of them - they were on the second floor of the house No. 7, Eastcheap.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of May, I was at No. 7, Eastcheap, working at the house, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew before - he was on the bottom floor; I saw one pair of sashes standing against my master's stove - I asked the prisoner whose they were; he said his - I said he must take them away, and he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he is a labourer? A. Yes; I saw him by the sashes - I do not know whose they were.</p>

            . I live at Bethnal-green. The prisoner was employed in taking down these premises - on the 20th May I saw him there, about two o'clock, with two sashes on his shoulder; he appeared to me to move quieter than usual - I thought all was not right; the sashes were like this, but I cannot say this was one - this is one I picked out of a hundred at Mr. Shearman's, and which had been on the building.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you pick it out? A. Last Friday week, by Mr. Shearman's request, but whether the prisoner brought this one out, I cannot say; the two he had, had been on the building.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure it is one of the four that were on the building? A. Yes, but I cannot be certain it is one the prisoner brought out.</p>

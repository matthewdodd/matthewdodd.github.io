                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, New Church-street, and am a baker. The prisoner has lived with me eighteen months—she lived three or four times with me as servant of all work—I am married—I missed some money out of my till—I concealed myself on the 16th of September under the show-board, from half-past five o'clock till half-past six in the morning—I heard the prisoner unlock the door from the parlour to the shop—(my wife locked the door that morning, and locked me in the shop, and took the key up with her)—the prisoner unlocked the door and went to the till—I saw her take something out—I had counted the money the preceding evening, and I missed 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she then went back, locked the door again, and put the key into the other door—it was the key of another door—I said nothing to her, but on the Monday following I set another witness to watch, and then she was taken.</p>

(Sarah Simpson, a laundress, gave the prisoner a good character, and promised to employ her.)</p>

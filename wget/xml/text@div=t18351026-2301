                  </hi>. I am porter to a tea-dealer in the Walworth-road. On Saturday afternoon, the 10th of October, I took out a basket, containing some tea and other goods—I called at a beer-shop in the Walworth-road, and left my basket at the door while I went in to drink—when I came out the prisoner was pointed out—he had this pound of tea which had been in my basket—I can swear to it, an it has the bill and recipt of all the goods tucked under the string.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I found it just by the curb-stone, six or seven feet from the basket—I had got a mile before he took me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I can swear it was in my basket when I went in to have some beer—I took the prisoner in three minutes.</p>
               <p>---- ---- I am a police-constable. I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got at Mr. Clark's office—I know he is the person.</p>

               <p>walking towards Great Russell-street—I saw Pybus on the opposite side of the street—it was a very wet morning, and I suspected he was there for no good purpose—I watched him, and saw him cross over the road, towards No. 29, Montague-street—he made a noise with his mouth—I turned round, and saw Smith coming out of one of the parlour windows of No. 29, the one nearest the door—I had a companion with me, named Chapman—I spoke to him loud enough for the prisoners to hear me—I saw Smith drop what appeared to me to be a bag, or something dark, into the area of the house—they jumped over the railings, and ran towards Russell<lb></lb>square—I followed them, crying, "Stop thief!"—I never lost sight of Pybus until he was in the hands of the police—I lost Smith for a moment, in turning the corner of Montague-place, but he was brought back, and I saw him in the custody of the policeman.</p>

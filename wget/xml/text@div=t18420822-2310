               <p>The prisoner hired a room in my house on the 29th of June—a person calling himself her husband, lodged with her for a short time, and then left—on the 18th of July, in consequence of suspicion, I went into the prisoner's room, she was there—I found the room strewed all over with feathers—the bed-tick had been cut in half, and the feathers taken out—I also missed a blanket, a bolster, a saw, two pillows, a candlestick, a pair of snuffers and tray, 2 flat-irons, and a saw, which were lent to her with the room—I did not see her after I missed these things, till she was taken.</p>

            's waggon. He came directly past No. 4, Warehouse. He came close to the tarpaulin In about three or four minutes, he was obliged to drive off to make room for another team. I observed the tarpaulin lay there, close to a pile of hides over which it had been thrown over. I saw the prisoner view it and handle it more than once, he stooped down and turned it over.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an opportunity of observing the mark upon it. - A. Probably he might, it was carelessly thrown off the hides, I directed the men to watch at the different windows, I placed myself also in another window. I received information a short time afterwards, I went down. I saw the prisoner going away with the tarpaulin in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose tarpaulin was it. - A. The London Dock Company's. He was folding it up smooth to lay it down in the bed of the waggon. I went and took the number of the waggon, and gave information to the gate-keeper. After he had folded it up smooth, he laid it in the head of the waggon, he covered it with some straw and a Russia mat. This is the tarpaulin, it belongs to the London Dock Company.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same person that Higgens saw. - A. Yes, the carman was looking about him. He came forward to the tarpaulin, he turned it part over, then he left it, he came back again and looked about him, took it on his shoulder and walked in the direction the waggon had gone.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was stationed at the North west gate that afternoon. I stopped the prisoner coming out of the docks with a waggon, in that waggon I found this tarpaulin. I asked him whether he had got any thing in the waggon, he said, no. I went up to the waggon, removed an old mat, and discovered this tarpaulin. I asked the prisoner whose tarpaulin it was, he said our's. The prisoner got up in the waggon and opened it. I said, it is not your's, it is our's.</p>

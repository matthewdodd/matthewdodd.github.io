                  </hi>. I live at 4, Sydenham Cottages, Forest Hill—I was in the habit of employing the elder prisoner to wash and iron—in about the third week in January the younger prisoner came to wash my bedroom—I had placed a brooch in a drawer in my bedroom at ten o'clock on Friday night, and on the following Sunday it was not there—the elder prisoner came to wash on the Saturday, and I asked her if her girl had brought it home—she said no, she had not seen it, and she wished I could find it—I told her of it repeatedly when she came to wash, and I next lost a pair of drawers—she sent the girl on the Friday to know whether I wanted her to come and iron—I said, "No; tell your mother I am in great trouble about the drawers"—I told the girl about the brooch, the mother came to my house and said deliberately, "Mrs. Wren, do you think I have got your drawers? and, about the brooch, do you think my Lizzie has taken it?"—I said, "I don't know; it strikes me I shall see it before I go to bed this night"—I went to a pawnbroker's, and from what I heard there I went to the elder prisoner's lodgings and told her that I had got my brooch—she denied all knowledge of it—I told her I had been to the pawnbroker, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186704080085"></xptr>
               <p>then she said, "I have found it, and you shall have it in half an hour"—I said, "Let me have it now; where is it?"—she said, "Up stairs; it is not in the house, but I will send for it," and in an hour or less she brought it to my door, and said, "Is this it?"—I said, "Yes"—she then said that she would take the work from me for nothing and pay me for the drawers, and the man she lives with came and offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they had never seen me wear the brooch; it had never been out of my drawer, because I was in mourning for my husband.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, two; but not that can reach to my drawer—my little girl is only three years old—I carry them up to bed, and carry them down—the other is a boy of eight—he is at school all day; he comes home at night, and I have taken him up to bed—nobody had access to my room except the younger prisoner—I value the brooch, because it was a love-token from my husband before I was married—the snow was not on the ground at the time the brooch was taken—my children are not in the habit of playing in the bedrooms—they never go into the bedrooms except with me—I have the whole house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of Forest Hill—I know both the prisoners—on a Saturday in February the younger prisoner brought me this brooch, to know whether it was gold—I tried it, and said yes, gave it back to her, and she took it away—while she was in the shop I saw the other prisoner at the door—the younger prisoner joined her on the step, and they went away together—the younger prisoner said she had found the brooch, and her mother sent her to pawn it—I did not take it, and she returned shortly afterwards and offered it for sale.</p>

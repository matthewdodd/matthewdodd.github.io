            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. On the 20th of March, between three and four o'clock, I was in the New road, and saw the prisoner driving at a most furious rate, with two more in a chaise; near Battle Bridge, he ran against a gentlemans' horse, and cut him. I stopped him for the assault. I detained the mare which was in the chaise, and sent her to the WhiteHart; he told me that he had brought her and a grey poney which he had sold, from Cokefield, and that they belonged to his brother; that he was going to Harford with the mare, and then to Ware, to a Mr. Godfrey, who was to give him 25 l. for it. He at first said he had sold it; and drove it in the chaise to see if he could warrant it to go quiet in harness, he was very drunk.</p>

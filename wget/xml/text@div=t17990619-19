             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Tingle: I remember the prisoner coming to my master's house with the delivery-book, I cannot say that is the book: On Wednesday, the 15th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the room at the back of the shop, Mr. Tingle was with me, Williams came in, threw the book on the counter, and made a remark on the coldness of the weather; he went immediately down the steps, and I observed he was intoxicated, for he appeared to be so; immediately as he had gone out, I went into the shop to serve something, that took me up but a few minutes; when the person went out, I observed the lid of the book to stick up, I had the curiosity to open it, and found a letter in it, with the seal upwards, broke; I turned it, and found it was directed to Mr. Jeffryes, Salisbury-square, Fleet-street; I made Mr. Tingle acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the letter? - A. I believe it is, but I will not undertake to swear to it, because I put no particular marks to it; I observed the direction of it; when I took it into the room, Mr. Tingle observed the seal broke, and the direction; he opened the letter, and in it was a piece of paper; he opened it, and it was a Shaftesbury and Salisbury Bank-note; he then read the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note? - A. I believe it is, but I will not attempt to swear to it, because I put no particular mark on it, it is just such a note; I did not see the prisoner again till the next morning, some time after nine o'clock, I cannot say how long after; he had been there before in the morning, but I was not there: the first words he said were, "now, about these breeches;" he had desired me to shew him patterns, and measure him; he then asked if I had found the book; I told him I had just come in, and would look for it, and I pretended to be looking for it among the goods; Mr. Tingle went to the Post-office; he urged me to look for the book, and told me there was a letter in it: he said nothing more than that there was a letter, and for God's sake to look for the book, or words to that effect; I told him if he would call again, I had not a doubt but he would hear of the book: he called again, I think, between eleven and twelve, and asked me if I had found the book, and had he not left it on the counter the evening before; I said, why do you want the book; says he, there is in the letter a Salisbury Bank-note of ten pounds. I asked him if it was a letter he had been directed to deliver; he said, no it was a letter he was going to take back to get it allowed; he said, for God's sake, don't let any person see it, because I would not have it lost for a thousand guineas. I thought he appeared very much agitated the last time, because it might be owing to his being a feeble old man; I cannot pretend to say how his feelings were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say it might arise from his being a very old man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very drunk the night before? - A. very much so.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not endeavour to hide the book - he put it, as he usually did, upon the counter? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. No endeavour to conceal it? - A. No, not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning he had called before you saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted to take it back to have it allowed? - A. He said that the third time of coming.</p>
               <p>Q.Allowed what? - A. I understand by saying allowed, the letter had been over-charged, and he was taking it back to have it rectified.</p>
               <p>Q. He was anxious it should be found, and looked for? - A.Very so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been in the neighbourhood long? - A. I have not been in the neighbourhood myself more than seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at all concerned in the management of the receiving-house? - A. Mr. Tingle entrusts me in the afternoon at four or five o'clock to see the bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, at your receiving-house, to which the postman brings the book, it has not happened before that you have had letters directed there which happened not to be in the delivery of the person who resorts to your receiving-house? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this letter came to be delivered in the division the prisoner was concerned in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have know him as long as you have been there? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, unfortunately, he drinks hard at times? - A.Very so.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, a mistake would be more likely to happen to an old, infirm, and drunken man, than to a person who is steady? - A. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Q. In what condition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190026"></xptr>was the letter? - A. The seal was broke, and that side towards me: he ought to have delivered it on the Tuesday, but did not till the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Tingle). You said Davis brought you the book - did you observe any thing in the book when he brought it? - A. Yes, a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it directed? - A. To Mr. H. Jeffryes, Salisbury-square, London; I cannot swear to the letter, there is no mark upon it, it was like this; I opened it in the presence of Davis, the seal was broke; I found in it a ten pound Salisbury and Shaftesbury note; I cannot swear to it, I did not mark it, it was such a note as that; I read it over, and I believe that to be the letter; I remember the contents of it; I immediately put it in the book again, and I put a mark upon the book in the presence of Davis, and that is the place I I marked it in; I took the letter with me to the post-office, to Mr. Stone's office; he was not in the way, and I brought it back and locked it up till eleven o'clock the next morning; I saw the prisoner the first time he came, about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect, which was rather unusual for him to come at that time; he asked me for the book; I told him, I did not know of it; he came round the counter to look into the drawer for it, and turned over all the books, and it was not there; I made some frivolous excuse that Davis was out of the way, and the book was mislaid; it was then locked up; he wished particularly for the book; he did not say there was any thing in it: I was in the back room, and saw him come in twice afterwards; he came in, and was asking to be shewn some patterns, or to be measured, or something of that kind; I heard him; he wanted particularly the book; I heard him say it was a letter that was overcharged to be allowed, or something of the kind; I delivered it to Mr. Stone on Thursday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have been acquainted with the prisoner some time? - A. Yes, I have known him for sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him to be often intoxicated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. An accident coming to him would be more likely to happen to him than to any person almost? - A. I make no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he was anxious to get the letter, that he might return it? - A. That he might get it allowed at the post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he wished to take it back, for that it was a letter given to him out of his delivery? - A. In mistake he put it into the delivery-book, instead of putting it into his pocket-book, I heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the book left in any place concealed? - A. No, on the counter, thrown carelessly down.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to the Post-office, and remember the last witness coming on the 26th of May and bringing a letter, and I believe that to be it; that is the London mark of paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that note indorsed in it? - A. It was, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In the course of your experience in the Post-office, I suppose you know it frequently happens, that persons employed in the Post-office get letters delivered to them in the wrong division? - A. It is not unusual by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, who, I understand, is a drunken old man, if such a thing happened to him, it would be more likely he should not discover it so soon as another person? - A. I should imagine so.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbett. Q. You, I believe, are inspector of the letter-carriers in the post-office? - A. Yes; I was attending on Wednesday, the 15th of May; I knew the prisoner, he was at the Post-office that morning, and was employed as a sorter of paid for and franked letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain to us into how many divisions London is divided? - A. Twelve; the prisoner was employed in division six.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, in that division? - A. Yes, but it is not in the district of the prisoner's delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his duty, when attending there as a sorter? - A. To take no letters but his own; if he has letters, not in his own district, he should put those letters to those to whom they belong.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he had an opportunity of taking a letter that belonged to another? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that London mark, and see whether you can tell when it came? - A. The 15th; the post comes from Marlborough in one day; there was no carriage to be paid by the person who received it, because it is post-paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand it is the duty of a sorter, in his particular division, to take only those letters which he is to deliver? - A. No other; if he should chance to put his hand upon another, he should hand it over.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, whether, in point of fact, in the post-office, men have not taken accidentally letters out of another division than their own? - A.There has been such mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, we have heard, was a drunken man? - A. Rather so, but I never saw him intoxicated on his duty in the office; he was not intoxicated in the morning the letters were sorted.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the coach is not changed from Marlborough to London? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190027"></xptr>Mr. Abbott. Q. You say, it sometimes happens that a letter gets into the hands of a carrier it does not belong to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the duty of that carrier? - A. If he has not an opportunity of delivering it to the proper carrier that day, he should bring it the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.How long had he been employed in the post-office? - A.Sixteen or seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing back a letter that had been given him by mistake? - A. It is impossible for me to say.</p>

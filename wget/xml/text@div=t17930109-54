               <p>About ten minutes before five in the morning, on the 24th of December, I was walking in Oxford-street, near Bird-street; there is a public house at the corner; under whose tap room window I saw this wheel barrow stand, with this piece of quartering laid across the barrow, covered up with a bit of old canvass, which gave me great suspicion that they could not be lawfully there at that time of the morning; with that the publican came out to undo the flap of the cellar window. I asked him if there was any body in that house that would own that barrow. I stopped there about a couple of minutes till I saw some body come out; the prisoner at the bar came out; I asked him how he came at that time of the morning to be with that barrow; he said he was sent by his master who was one Mr. Bell, who lived in Long-acre. I asked him when his master sent him, he told me that the night before his master ordered him to go at four o'clock in the morning. I asked him where he lived, he said he lived in Long-acre. I asked him at what time he left Long-acre, he said at four o'clock. I said my friend how came you to go so quick, to go up to Paddington and come all this way back, and he owned he had been a quarter of an hour in the public house; I then took him to the watch-house; I said he must go before the constable of the night; the constables of the night is here; and I took him to the justice's the same day; the bit of quartering and the garden pots are at the watch-house; the barrow is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did Haynes see at the watch-house? - He saw the wheel barrow, the two bits of quartering, and twenty-nine garden pots.</p>

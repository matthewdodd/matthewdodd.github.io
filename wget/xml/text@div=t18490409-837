                  </hi>. I took a contract under the Northern and Eastern Railway Company from Edmonton to Enfield, and while the work was going on, lived in Edmonton parish. The prisoner was in my service as time-keeper two or three months; he has been a butcher—his brother has been in the employ of the railway six or seven years—on 14th Feb. I went to Witham, in Essex, and told the prisoner I very probably should not be back till next morning—his brother was present—I left the house secure, but empty—I got back from Witham that night about ten o'clock—there was something the matter with the lock, and I could not get in, and I slept at a public-house—next morning I found my kitchen-door on the latch, a pair of my trowsers were on the landing, and the house had been ransacked—I missed a gun, pistol, spirit-level, and other things—I had moved my money; I sometimes have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house—the prisoner had access to the down-stairs part of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Edmonton. I was working for Mr. Winder, and have worked with the prisoner on the Edmonton and Enfield Railway—I passed Mr. Kendle's house on the evening of 14th Feb., at half-past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the house—I knew him well—I came back about seven; he was then in the garden, a few feet from the house, he could see everybody who came to the house—I saw him again half an hour afterwards, walking in the garden close to the house.</p>

On 14th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to call on Mr. Kendle, I knocked three times, but could get no answer, and went to the back of the house, but did not go to the door for fear of the dog—I saw a very clear light in the house—the prisoner was close to the front steps—he looked at me very hard for some time—I had seen him before—I do not think he knew me—I said nothing to him—when I left the back of the house he walked before me—I left him there, and returned home.</p>

The prisoner was in my charge—he made a statement to me—I said nothing to induce him to make it—he said his brother went to London the Sunday before, and got four men to come down and rob Mr. Kendle's house, and on the Wednesday morning they came down and robbed the house while he stood outside—that after they had done it his brother fetched him, and they went down the road, and found the four men, and his brother held a pistol to his head, and told him he was to go and show the men the way to the Ponder's-end railway station, and he went and then left them, and came home—he said Passey was one of the men, and he did not know the names of the others—after he was committed, he told me if there had been any money I should not have found him, that it was not goods they went for, but money.</p>

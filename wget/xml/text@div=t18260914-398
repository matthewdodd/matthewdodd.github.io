I know the prisoner, she lived in the neighbourhood. On Friday, the 4th of August, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon she called at my house, and seemed to have some pressing call upon her; I showed her to the water-closet, on the first floor; she then went away and said she would return in an hour, and then, she supposed, her kettle would boil, and I should take tea with her, or she with me; I went to the room on the first floor soon after she was gone, and missed, from a drawer, a gold watch, a gold chain, three gold seals, and a key, which had been in that drawer on the Monday before; I had not seen them after Monday; they were my husband's; the prisoner had been in that room a fortnight before, and I had shewn them to her in the drawer; these are the articles.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on Thursday, the 10th of August, in Blackfriars-road. The prosecutor had given me the information on the Sunday, and I went to look for her, but she had left her own house; when I took her I told her I was a constable, and I had come respecting a watch; she said she had never been happy since she took it, and she had written a letter to the prosecutrix or her husband, I do not know which; and meant to give herself up that night.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mrs. LAMB. Q. How long had you known her as a neighbour? A. About seven or eight weeks - she first came to inquire about a room in my house; she lived with a man who was a carpenter.</p>

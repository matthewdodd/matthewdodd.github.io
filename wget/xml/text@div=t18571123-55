I was on duty in Fore Street on 5th Nov.—I received information, and went to Bowling Alley, Whitecross Street—I saw the woman Parsonty lying down, with a wound in her neck—a surgeon was attending her—I went to No. 14, Bowling Alley, saw the prisoner, and told her she must consider herself in my custody, for wounding Mrs. Parsonty—she said that she had done it by throwing two tea cups—after I had taken her into custody, I went back to the room, and found this knife and a broken saucer under the fireplace—a man, whom I believe to be her husband, opened the door of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Parsonty; we live in King's Arms Yard, Whitecross Street. On 5th Nov. I went to No. 14, Bowling Alley, about half past 7 o'clock, to ask for a half crown that the prisoner had taken from me that day—she came in directly after, and I said to her, "Mrs. Brewer, you try to make a piece of work; you might have thought that I wanted that money"—she began to abuse me, and I thought she was going to strike me—I went back, and she said, "You so and so w—, I will have you," and she took a knife from the table and stabbed me, and blood came into my mouth—I wanted to get home, but I was obliged to lie against the wall, and two women came and covered me with a cloth—I was taken to the hospital on the Saturday, and was not fit to come out till the Wednesday week afterwards.</p>

Q.</hi> Did Mr. Timothy, the doctor, attend you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he attended me once before for an injury on my finger—he has not attended me for blows or bruises—I have known the prisoner sixteen years—we were never bad friends—she asked me to let her have the half crown till the evening—I did not ask her to take care of it for me—it was in my own house—I had been in a public house with her that day, I think it was the Grapes—my husband did not take me out of the public house—he did not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Barbican. On the evening of 5th Nov. I was called to the last witness—I found her suffering from great loss of blood, and an incised wound in her neck, between one and two inches long—it was not deep—it appeared to have been done with a blunt instrument—such a knife as this would cause it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it not have been inflicted by the patient having fallen on any sharp edge, as of a saucer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might, supposing the instrument to have been in a peculiar position—I believe I have attended the prosecutrix within the last twelve months; I cannot tell when, but by the parish book I find it was for bruises—she had been drinking, but was sober.</p>

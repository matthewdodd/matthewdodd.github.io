               <p>Q. And are you answerable for them?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any hose?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes. I am porter to the Kidderminster Waggon , and on the 19th of December last I lost a truss of hose out of the inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity there was in that truss ?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I believe there were twenty dozen, but I am sure there were ten dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the Prisoner was concerned in taking them?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I had sent my brother of an errand into the Old-Jewry, and when he came back from thence , he said there was a man gone out with a parcel of stockings, and asked me whether I had delivered any to him. I said I had not; I followed the Prisoner, and saw him with a bag, and about one hundred yards from the Inn gate in Wood-Street , he turned up into Gold-Street; I saw him with the bag of stockings upon his back or shoulders, and I saw him drop the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes, I pursued him and took him; he run out of Gold-Street into Gutter-Lane, and came into Cheapside ; I took him among the coachmen in Cheapside, and I never lost sight of him till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Stroud. It was about six or seven at night .</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes had the man on that you saw with the bag of stockings?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I think he had not all the same clothes on then as he has now, but the man had a white dussled coat, such as the Prisoner has on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. My brother and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your brother take the stockings up?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I ordered my brother to take them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay to see him take them up?</p>
               <p>Stroud . No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the Prisoner, did any discourse pass between you and him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. He said he was not the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came to run away?</p>
               <p>Stroud . He did run away, and I cried out stop thief , and the Prisoner he cried out stop thief too.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of what you say?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I know something of Christian knowledge, and I would not swear falsely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body go before the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Stroud. No, there was no body but my brother, myself, and the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them out of the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Stroud. They were never put into the warehouse, they lay in the inn-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these stockings to be delivered?</p>
               <p>Stroud. They were, as far as I can find out, to go to the Swan at Holbourn-Bridge, to go to an other carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your brother your servant?</p>
               <p>Stroud . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you-take all the stockings out of the waggon?</p>
               <p>Stroud. My brother and I did; we took out six trusses of stockings.</p>

             on the 19th of December, I went with a pot of butter to Mr. Robinson's in the Old-Jury, and then I went to the Cross Keys in Wood-Street; it was between six and seven, and I saw the Prisoner turning out of the inn with a bag of stockings upon his back or shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I did not know him till my brother had taken him, and he had on a double-breasted lapel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you came into the inn between six and seven?</p>
               <p>Stroud. Yes, and I saw the Prisoner with a bag of stockings at his back, just turning out of the inn-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the Prisoner at the bar, are you sure that is the man?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him?</p>
               <p>Stroud. By the lamp.</p>

               <p>Stroud. There is a light within the inn-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Stroud. No, but I am positive he is the man, for he was never out of my sight , till he dropped the stockings .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint your brother with it?</p>
               <p>Stroud. I said to my brother, Richard, have you delivered out a bag of stockings ? No, said he: said I, there is a bag gone; I followed the Prisoner, and he had like to have tumbled the stockings upon me.</p>

            . I am a news-man; I was coming out of the Horns in Gutter-Lane, on the saturday before Christmas-day, it was the 19th of Dec. between six and seven o'clock, and I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the Prisoner running along, no body run before the Prisoner. I turned about, and saw him turn out of Cheapside, into St. Paul's Church-yard ; I run after him, and cried, stop thief; and he cried, stop thief too; and in a minute's time he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes had he on?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. A light coloured coat, a double breasted waistcoat, and a light wig.</p>

There was somebody came into the Inn, and asked the Porter whether he had delivered out any parcel or bundle , and he said, no. They said, there was something lost, and that there was a man run away; the porter run out of the Inn after him, I was close at the porter's heels , but he was out of sight of every one; I lost sight of him at the corner of Gold-street, the next turning to the Cross-Keys Inn , in Wood-street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174801150019"></xptr>Morris. Because they cried out stop thief ; then the man went into Gutter-Lane, at the corner of Golden-Lane or Gold-Street, and they all lost sight of him. The man that I saw with the stockings was a little man.</p>

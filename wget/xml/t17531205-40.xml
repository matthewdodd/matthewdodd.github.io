Soon after I miss'd some of my linen, which was under his care; about ten days after, a gentleman came and told me he heard I had been robb'd of many things by my servant, but he said, he knew I had lost more than I knew of, and that he came from my servant, and wanted to make up the injury to me as much as he could. I went to the prisoner in a house in Fleet-street, where he told me he had taken a great many things out of a chest; some wearing cloaths, some silk stockings, three or four laced waistcoats, ten or eleven pair of ruffles, laced and plain, a vest embroidered with gold, one or two gold rings, and other things which I cannot recollect; he told me the woman at the bar received them of him, and carried them to divers pawnbrokers.

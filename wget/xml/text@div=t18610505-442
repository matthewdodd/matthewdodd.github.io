                  </hi>. I am inspector and collector at Newgate-market—about half-past 7 on the morning of 29th March last, in consequence of some information from a Mr. Shreeve, I went to the shop of Messrs. Allen and Shreeve—Mr. Shreeve showed me some meat in a hamper, consisting, I believe, of three quarters of cow-beef and the head, tongue, and heart—one fore-quarter was missing—I could not see any signs of the animal having been killed—I saw the skull, and I could not see any indication of its being knocked down in the usual way—the meat was in a very bad state—it was dressed and quartered in the usual way that good meat is quartered, and packed as usual, as a butcher would do it—in my opinion it was the three quarters of an animal that had died—there were indications of disease in the ribs, and also from the appearance of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the indications on the ribs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The usual indications in the pleura that we see on an animal with the lung complaint; and the meat altogether was in a very bad state, totally unfit for human food—what 1 saw in the pleura was indicative of inflammation in the lifetime.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is some term known, I believe, among butchers to indicate meat in that condition; wetness, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were traces of wetness—it was not so dry as good meat would have been—it was not very wet—inflammation can only be set up in lifetime—if I am light in saying there were indications of inflammation, that goes to show that the animal was diseased in life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to these indications on the pleura, were they visible on slaughtering the animal; is it in a part of the animal that is exposed on opening it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is immediately seen on opening the animal—it do not</p>

               <p>require any dissection of the animal beyond slaughtering; it is quite obvious—the whole condition of the meat presented an appearance of the animal being diseased, and to the eye of a butcher, or any one experienced in meat, they would say directly that it was unfit for human food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you condemned the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I called in my brother inspector, Mr. Newman, and it was destroyed in the usual way—there was "G. James, Semley," painted on the hamper—the meat was also packed in three cloths, as good meat would be—a calf was pointed out to me as having come in the same hamper—the calf was good meat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about the meat not being very wet, but not quite so dry as good meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I mean is that I have seen diseased meat wetter than that—it was not so dry as good meat—the state of the animal must have been obvious to the butcher, who opened it—the indications must have presented themselves immediately on the killing and cutting up of the animal—that is my opinion—I know sufficient of it to swear that that would be so—I have frequently been present when an animal has been killed and cut up—I have seen a great many cut up that have had slight inflammation—supposing there to be a slight inflammation of the pleura there would be an adhesion of the lungs to the pleura, and it would also affect what we call the brisket—the fact of this animal being cut into four quarters would not prevent that adhesion being noticed—it is cut across, so that the whole of the ribs would be on the fore-quarter—it would be quite apparent to a butcher—he could not slaughter it without observing it—the inside of the beast must be taken out before it is cut into quarters—it must have necessarily presented itself to the eye of the person who killed it—I should think it is very seldom that a beast is cut up warm and sent off directly—it never is cut up warm—they always let it hang till it gets cold and stiff—I have been a butcher all my life—I was born in the business—I should think that a beast is never cut up warm and sent off at once to the London market—the time which it would be allowed to hang would depend on the season of the year—in hot weather they would send it off sooner than in cold weather—of course, there is a great difference between a bullock in first-rate condition, intended for the west-end market, and a cow in a poor state—there would be a great difference in the meat—the cow would get tainted sooner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And if it were suffering under any disease, that disease would spread itself over the carcase in a shorter time, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not after death—in warm weather the meat would not keep so long good as meat free from disease—Mr. Wace, the proprietor of the premises, saw it before it was destroyed—the prisoner was not communicated with before it was destroyed—it was destroyed the same day—the prisoner had no opportunity of seeing it after it was seized—I am not aware that a bullock is sometimes killed by a knock on the back of the neck—they are generally hit on the top of the skull, by a pole-axe, and that enters into the centre of the brain—that is the usual way of killing beasts in this country—other methods have been tried, but they have failed—I have seen experiments made—a cow is not frequently killed by cutting its throat, not without being previously knocked down—it is either by a stroke on the forehead, or on the top of the head—they try to get at the brain at once—that is supposed to take away sensation—sometimes a butcher might make a mistake and hit it in a wrong place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you see any indication on the head of this</p>

               <p>animal of its having been stunned in any way preparatory to being slaughtered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not—when meat is destroyed it is the usual course to give the salesman a note of condemnation, and he accounts to his principal for the meat, by sending that note of condemnation to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If meat becomes tainted or putrid from bad packing, or from hot weather, what is the appearance it usually presents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Portions of it would become green, and there is a very disagreeable smell—I am quite able to distinguish between taint, or putridity and disease—they are quite dis<lb></lb>tinct and separate things—I have seen some meat wetter than this was the wetness is always an indication of the animal being in a very advanced state of disease in life—the meat never becomes stiff and dry—supposing an animal is diseased in life, the appearances of disease do not vanish upon its being slaughtered—there would be the indications where inflammation had been—the pleura was not so badly affected here as I have seen it in some cases—the meat altogether was in a high state of inflammation—inflammation of the pleura generally follows disease in the lungs—the disease shows itself: in the lung first, and after it has been there some time it—is shown in the pleura by inflammation—the pleura is easily seen on slaughtering the beast, and the lungs also—the disease in the pleura is the result of the disease in the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector to the Commissioners of Sewers to the City of London—I examined the meat in question, together with the last witness, on 29th March—I examined it carefully—from my experience I should think it was the meat of a cow that had been diseased, and had died diseased—I do not think it had been killed—it did not present the usual marks—if it had been killed, I have no doubt there was disease in it before death—I think it died from disease; but it was diseased during life, however it came to its death—I have heard the evidence given by Mr. Fisher—I concur in the description he has given of the state of the meat—we could not judge of it so much as if we had had the whole carcase before us—I believe the quarter that was kept away was the one where the disease was more strongly developed—I have reason to suppose, from what I saw of the three quarters, that the other quarter was not free from disease—there were signs of disease on the ribs—I think it was the right fore-quarter that we had—the lungs are sometimes situated on one side and sometimes on the other—they are between the two fore-quarters—the disease shows itself more on the fore-quarters—I have nothing to add to what Mr. fisher has said of the symptoms he saw—it was decidedly unfit for food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Newgate-market—on the morning of 29th March I received a hamper, containing a calf and three quarters of cow-beef—it came between 6 and 7 o'clock—we generally begin business about 5 or a little before—I know the defendant—he is a butcher at Donhead—I believe that is close to the Semley station—in consequence of the state of the meat when I opened the hamper, I sent for the inspector—he came and condemned it, and gave me a note of condemnation—I sent that in a letter to the defendant—I have from time to time corresponded with him, two or three times a week—I cannot recollect whether I sent two letters—I know one was sent with the condemnation note—I afterwards received a letter from the defendant, dated 14th April—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Donhead, St. Andrew, Wilts, April 14,1861; Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About how many carcases might he send? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend on circumstances—during the last three days of the latter week we received from himself and sons very nearly 70 carcases of very superior veal and pork—we have received as much as that on many occasions during what we call the veal season—that generally commences about February, and ends about the latter end of May or the beginning of June—that is the west country veal season—Semley is in the west of England—the carcases come up by the South-Western Line—the veal and pork we got was of a very superior quality—some of it making nearly 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—he is not a sender of beef—I never knew him to send but one carcase of beef before—he chiefly kills veal and pork, not mutton, I think—I believe he consigns entirely to us—I do not think he sends, on an average, one caroase of beef in a twelvemonth—he has sent to the firm to which I belong, for eight years, but altogether he has been thirty years a consignor to the London market—during all the time I have known him and received from him, he has never sent any meat improperly; in fact, we never had to raise a question before about any of his consignments—whenever we have anything brought to us that has the stamp of poverty upon it, we always send it to the inspector, for our own protection—we are not licensed as salesmen—we keep a shop—we are not under any obligation to send for the inspector, but we do so for our own protection, it is an end of all dispute, he is supposed to possess the mind of the case—we send for him whenever there is the least doubt about a carcase—we never had the slightest doubt about any of Mr. James's meat before this—the general practice is to kill a bullock or a cow by hitting it on the star of the forehead, but I have seen scores of beasts knocked down by a blow on the back of the neck, which touches the spinal marrow, and that produces the same effect—I have seen them knocked down in all sorts of ways—they sometimes do it with a pole-axe—we sometimes have carcases of meat sent to the London market that you would not suppose a butcher had had anything to do with—I do not know how calves are killed—I am not a calf butcher—report says that they bleed them—I think it right to say that in the country the almost invariable practice is in what is called scalping a bullock, to cut a large portion of the skull off to go with the hide, because it makes the hide weigh heavier, and in that case the axe hole would be on the hide and not on the head—I did not notice whether this animal came up with the hide on it or not—I did not examine it at all—I saw it was a poor body of beef, and sent at once for the inspector—I did not inquire how it had been killed—the calf which came up in the same hamper was good, and was sold by us and accounted for to the prisoner—that was not cut up in pieces, it was in carcase.</p>

I am medical officer of health to the City of London—I have had considerable experience in the examination of meat I have heard Mr. Fisher, Mr. Newman, and Mr. Wace describe the appearance of the meat in question—assuming them to be correct in the description of the meat, it would no doubt be quite unfit for food, and injurious to human health—it would either at once produce great irritation of the stomach and bowels, producing vomiting and diarrhoea, or it would become absorbed into the system and produce a low kind of fever—I have known death result from it, and have had to inquire into such cases—if there is diarrhoea and sickness the effects are got rid of, if not it is absorbed into the system and generates low fever—I am not alluding to the effects of tainted or putrid meat, but of diseased meat, even when comparatively fresh—the indications of taint or putridity are so essentially different from those of disease, that they cannot be confounded—I think it would be impossible for a person who understood it to make any mistake between the one and the other.</p>

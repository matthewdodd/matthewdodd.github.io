            </rs>.</p>
               <p>SECOND COUNT, stating his intent to be to disable or do her some bodily harm.</p>
               <p>LEAH GOODING. I am not in any business. I came to London six years and a half ago, and met with John Perry- we were out-asked in Lambeth church, but we were never married: he is a watchman, and I have been in the habit of going to meet him of a morning when he came off duty, as the doctor said a little morning air would he the best thing I could have for my health. On Sunday morning last I met Perry with the prisoner, whom I had not seen for some time, in the Hampstead-road; it was about half-past five o'clock - I said to Perry, "How is it you keep Waters' company, when I desired you not?" the prisoner gave me a blow on the bonnet, which tore one or two rows off, and gave me a kick on the left hip - I cannot say whether it was with his knee or his shoe; Perry then interfered, and said he could not think how he could behave so when we had acted so kind to him, and he had been as a brother to us - they went wrangling on to the watch-house, and I went in with them; they still wrangled, but I desired Perry to give over and come out, as it was Sabbath morning - he came out with me; when we got to the top of the Mews I saw the prisoner again - I said, "Here is Jem Waters;" we just passed by him, and I said, "Come on," but Perry turned and so did I - words again occurred between us, and I dare say I aggravated him, as I said I should be ashamed of myself to behave in this way, after we had been so good to him - he knocked Perry down; I turned to get him off, and recollect I pulled his hair - he then pulled off his shirt, and said he would fight both of us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You tore it off me. Witness. No: he tore off his shirt, and he fought right and left with both hands, and gave Perry such a blow as filled his mouth with blood; I turned again and made two or three attempts to strike him; he got quiet, and we passed along Little George-street on to Great George-street - Perry then said to me, "My girl, I have forgotten my key, we cannot get in" - I said, "If you go to the watch-house for it, you and Waters will begin quarrelling again;" and he was afraid he would quarrel with me, so we went back together - as we went down the mews, the prisoner was standing on the right side; I turned and said, "Jem, where are you going?" - he said "To the watch-house;" I said, "We are not going to the watch-house to say anything about you;" he then turned back, and went to some men and two women whom he had been talking to - Perry then went on to the watch-house, and I sat down on the curb - my cough came on, which I am subject to, and I heard Waters say.</p>
               <p>"D-n my eyes and limbs, I will end my own life;" I turned, and saw him coming towards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110165"></xptr>me - I said "Is it me he means to stub?" I looked at him, and thought he did not look natural - he pulled something out of his jacket pocket, and I saw it come to my heart; he said, "D-n your eyes and limbs, I will be hanged for you;" I was no more sensible - I thought I was going into eternity - I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it from your leaving him to go for the key, and his striking you? A. Nine or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.You are very ill, I believe? A.Yes Sir; Perry is not my husband; I have known the prisoner about two years and a half; I do not know whether he has been much given to drink - I had not seen him for some weeks - he had been drinking; he looked not natural; when he came to me he appeared a good deal affected - there had not been a great deal of quarrelling with us; I do not know what length of time had passed - not an hour; it was about six o'clock when this happened - I cannot say how many times I struck him; I did not pull the clothes off his back - I do not know what this blow was indicted with; I thought my time was come and I was thinking more about another world - I had not made use of any foul language, and not a foul word came out of my mouth; I had not called his mother a wh-re; he had before that morning said I was like his old mother; we have had some bickerings together - I summoned him for 10s. which he owned me - I had called him a bastard that morning, perhaps ten minutes before I was struck; I wanted him to tell the Jury that - I did not strike him, nor raise my hand to him when I received the blow; I could not have thought he was going to do it - I had made two or three attempts to strike him because he first struck me - but that was before I sat on the stone; I have had a fright since, which has weakened me a good deal - I suffered more from the fright than I did from the cut; I have been ill three years - I have not been to a surgeon for this cut; I have not been using any unkind expression as to what I would do to the prisoner; I forgive him with all my heart -God is my witness; we were in a public-house on Monday, before we went to the Grand Jury, but I did not speak unkindly of him; I said if the law would forgive him I would - I did not say any thing about hanging - I hope he will not be hung; Mrs. Stephens and another person were at the public-house; I said as my life was preserved, I hoped the Lord would preserve his - I said nothing about his not having means to procure a professional adviser.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I think I understand, that when you sat on the curb there were no words between you? A. No; There had been no words for five minutes between us -Perry had left us to go to the watch-house, and Waters went up the mews to speak to his company; he had spoken to them - I heard him say, "D-n my eyes and limbs I will go and end my own life;" it was before Perry and he fought - I had called him a bastard.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERRY. I was with the witness; we met the prisoner coming off duty, about half-past five o'clock or a quarter to six; something occurred between us and he struck me - Godding asked me why I kept his company, when it was not agreeable to her; she said something to him and he made her an answer, but I did not hear what it was - in going to the watch-house she spoke to him about his ill treatment of us, and he struck her; I stood in my own defence, and he struck me - I said I did not think he would behave so to us - we went down the mews and had some angry words about his striking her; when we got to the watch-house he struck his hand on the table and wished to fight me, but I would not - we came out, he struck me, and I struck him; he knocked me down in the road, and I said "I am ashamed of your striking us, as we have behaved so well to you;" we parted, and I went on to Great James-street - I said to Godding "I have forgotten the key of the street door, I must go back to the watch-house or we cannot get in;" she said "Let me go with you;" the prisoner was at some distance - we were going back, passed him, and left him at the top of the mews; as we were going down, Godding said "I will stop here," and she sat down on the curbstone - while I was in the watch-house she was brought in in a young man's arms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long have you known the prisoner? A.Near five years; we are both watchmen, and our beats join each other - we had passed the previous evening together and then been on duty; in the morning he and I had a pot of beer together at five o'clock, when we left duty - I had had a small glass of rum, and we had a quartern of gin between us - it was at the New inn - I had the glass of rum before I joined with the prisoner; we went into the New inn together, but I drank my rum at the bar and he was at the door - he must have known I had it; I then had the beer with him - we had the gin at the King's Head public-house at the corner of New-road; I had a pint or porter before I went on duty, at the

               <p>COURT. Q.Did you not hear her call him a bastard? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEARS. I am a hackney-coach master. I was present when the prisoner and the witnesses were together in Hampstead-road, at a quarter before six o'clock; I heard them quarrel - I saw the prisoner strike Perry; they then walked away, and Perry went back to the mews, with Godding - I saw the prisoner come round the corner from the Hampstead-road, with his hands in his jacket pockets; when Godding saw him coming, she rose from the curb-stone, and leaned against the house - when Perry came nearly opposite her, he pulled his right hand from his pocket, and forced it against her left breast, drew back his hand, and threw a knife down; I ran and caught hold of his right arm - he said, "I know my doom- I shall be hanged at Newgate; I resign myself up to you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Six months; I never quarrelled with him, nor joined in any prosecution for which a man was transported.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was in Hampstead-road last Sunday morning; Godding and the prisoner had some words - I was not near enough to hear any words; I saw the prisoner go down the yard, and strike the woman on the left breast - that was, perhaps, ten minutes after the first quarrel; they seemed to part after the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110166"></xptr>quarrelling - I then saw him strike her, but I do no know with what; I did not see the knife till I was at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was not the prisoner's back to you? A. Yes - I was a good bit off; it seemed to me that she aggravated him very much - she seemed like a woman in a rage.</p>

            . I produce this knife, which was given me by Mears; the prisoner came into the watch-house without a shirt, and looked like a madman.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JAMESON. I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner in one of the cells: he began by stating that Perrys' wife had called him a rogue, and a rascal, said his mother was a wh-e, and he was a bastard - I said "You had better compose yourself; where is your shirt?" he said they tore it off: I went and consulted about searching him - when I went back to him, he said he had done it, and he should be hanged next Monday week; in going from the watch-house he met Perry, and said to him."Jack, I have killed your wife; I shall be hanged tomorrow week;" he sent me word afterwards that he had a present to make me, if I would come and see him hanged - he afterwards begged me to go for a shirt for him; I went to his sister-in-law - she said she could not get out, as her two children were had with the measles, and I took it him in the evening; he stated that Mrs. Perry was the cause of his not marrying a girl he had kept company with some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What took you to the watch-house? A. I go there for letters and orders for the Commissioners; I am street-keeper - I did not think any harm of speaking to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>LEAH GOODING re-examined. I was stabbed in my left breast, and a little on my arm; he did keep company with a young woman - I know they were asked in church, and I persuaded her to marry him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PARKER. I am a porter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I have known the prisoner six years - he bears a humane character; he got a hurt, and has not been well since - for the last three months he has been drinking more like a madman than any thing else, and when he drinks he is overcome by it; he has, complained of his head and side.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMPBELL. I am a watchman, and have known the prisoner five years. I and my fellow servant got to the watch-house just before him, and the prosecutrix - I heard her say Perry was with that d-d villain Waters - she ran to him, and struck him repeatedly; he thrust her away with his hand and foot.</p>
               <p>EDWARD TALBOT. I am a watchman. I was going to the watch-house, and saw the prosecutrix strike the prisoner several times; and as she passed me she struck Perry, and said, "You are not a man, for not taking my part."</p>

               <p>JANE HELLINGS. I am the wife of John Hellings. On the 6th of June my goods were going to be seized - I went out, and had half a pint of beer; I was crying - the prisoner, who was a stranger, came and asked what was the matter; I told her - she said she would go home with me, and see me righted; I allowed her to stop all night we had some gin, and sat on the bed drinking; about ten o'clock at night, I felt my pockets going, and she walked away with them; this money was in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give an alarm? A. I felt something snap, but was not certain it was my pocket - I did not undress all night; I saw her about two o'clock the next afternoon, and asked for my money - she said, "Come with me, I will make it all right;" I went to two houses with her - she could not raise it, and about seven I gave her in charge.</p>

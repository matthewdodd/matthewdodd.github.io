            . I live in Wellington-street, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110043"></xptr>the Hampstead road; on the 28th of November I lost my pocket book, containing two ten pound bank notes, and two five pound bank notes.

I had taken the notes that were in my pocket-book at Child's the banker's, for a check. I did not know the number of the notes, until I lost the pocket-book. I then went to the bankers; they gave me the number of the notes, from the bankers I went to Bow-street Office, I also went to the bank, and stopped the notes.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer. On the 28th of November, I saw the prisoner in Allen-street, leading into Finsbury Market. I heard the cry of stop thief; upon that I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEES. Q. You belong to the Bank - A. I do. I produce a ten-pound note from the Bank 8880, date 13th of July, 1814.</p>
               <p>Bishop. That is the same note I took from the prisoner and carried to the Bank; I put my initials on it before I parted with it; that is the same note, it is dated 13th of July, 1814, a ten-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fuller. Is that the same note that you paid for Mr. Cleaver's check - A. There is no mark upon it that I know I paid it,</p>

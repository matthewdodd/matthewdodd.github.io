                  </hi>. I am occasionally in the employ of the General Omnibus Company, to check the conductors, to see what passengers they have. I have been so employed, off and on, for three years—on 28th Nov. I travelled in the Chelsea and Hoxton omnibus from the Bank to Chelsea—I got in at the Bank about 8 o'clock—the prisoner was the conductor—I took my seat about one from the door, but on the first opportunity I shifted to the door on the right hand side going in—I cannot say how many were in when I got in—I think it was full—I was aware for what distance 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was charged, for what distance 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and for what distance 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I rode as far as Sloane-street—I observed how many persons rode the different distances—I took a note of it not two minutes after I left the omni-bus—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) on the inside there were seven 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; fares, eleven 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and outside there were two 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; seven 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—on 9th Dec. I went again from the Bank to Chelsea—I took my seat as nearly as possible where I did before—I took a note of the passengers immediately after-wards—there were seven 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and nine 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. inside, and one 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and five 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. outside—in the course of those journeys there was no dispute between the conductor and the passengers—I saw something pass from every one—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You rode to Sloane-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about the middle; to Cadogan-place—I do not know how many I left in when I got out, I had nothing to do with that—I got in at the Bank—I have no note of how many got in between the Bank and Charing Cross—I cannot tell how many got in between the Bank and Hyde Park corner—I cannot tell how many were in when I got in—there were three on the top—two got off at the Bank, and left one on the left hand side of the omnibus—I sat inside, close to the door, on the right hand side—I entered at 8 o'clock—it would be about half past 8 o'clock when I got to Sloane-street, rather later—I cannot tell the place where any one got in, or any one got out—I made no note till I got out—on the first journey I made altogether thirty persons, nineteen inside and eleven outside—twelve is the number which makes the omnibus full inside, and nine outside—on 9th Dec. I made sixteen passengers inside, and six outside—I cannot tell how many were in on that day when I got in, or when I got out, or how many got in at Charing Cross—I do not believe there were any passes given on that day; I did not see any—I did not get out of the omnibus all the way—I could see through the window, and on the right and left, who got up—this is my book—these are all journeys that are entered here—it is exactly as I entered it at the time—I put my pencil into my mouth, which makes the entries blacker in some places than others—none have been pencilled over since: they have never been touched—here is 28th Nov. and then 9th Oct.—that is a mistake—I put Oct. for Dec.—I can swear to the day I did it—there are in this book ten journeys, all done with a view of checking the conductor—I entered all these correctly—I always enter one journey before I do another—here is Clapton to the City—I entered it 7 o'clock, and scratched it out, and entered 5 o'clock—I put the wrong time down—if I had sent that report in at 7 o'clock, it would not have corresponded with the conductor's account—it would not have got him into trouble, it would have been sent back to me—it would not correspond with the conductor's time—here are three at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is altered to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are no 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. fares on that road—I am familiar with those omnibuses—I altered this 7 o'clock to 5 o'clock, and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. soon afterwards—I altered the time and the fare—I generally carry a watch with me; if not, there is always plenty of time to see—I have frequently, in the course of these journeys, found that when I made these entries, I have made mistakes—I alter them directly if I make a mistake—this mistake was the time, but I am positive as to the number of passengers—I do not do this for a living, only when I have nothing else to do—I do not ride ten or twelve journeys every day—here is the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the fourteenth, the fifteenth, the sixteenth, and the seventeenth, and then I had business of my own to attend to—it is not a business that I like better than this—it is an honest business.</p>

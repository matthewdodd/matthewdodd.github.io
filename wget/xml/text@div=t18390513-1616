                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant N</hi> 8.) I went, about ten o'clock on Saturday night, into Morning-lane, Hackney, and saw Gazeley standing talking to a woman he lives with—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of a robbery at the Three Mariners—he said, "Very well, I suppose we shall make it all right"—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—while I was searching him he said, "You b—, you are two or three hours too late."</p>

I took Denby into cus<lb></lb>tody on Saturday night, the 20th of April, about twelve o'clock—I found him arm-in-arm with two others coming down Wick-street, singing—I told him what it was for—he resisted, and wished to get away from my grasp, but I succeeded in securing him—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am grandson to Robert Scholes, landlord of the Three Mariners. On Saturday, the 20th of April, the prosecutor came to our house about a quarter past one o'clock, and went into the tap-room—he had a pack with him—I went into the room while he was there, and he was asleep—that time all the prisoners were in the room, and several other people—I went in again about half-past two o'clock, and found nobody there but the prosecutor—he was looking at his pack, and com<lb></lb>plaining of having lost his property.</p>

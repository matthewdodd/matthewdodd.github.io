            , William Boyden, and myself: In consequence of a suspicion I took stock on Monday the 11th of December, and again on Sunday the 17th of December; I then missed two particular grosses of buttons, one of which I afterwards found upon the prisoner; I only took an account of that part of the stock that was most likely to be purloined; the prisoner was our porter; I concealed myself in a room adjoining to his bed-room, and through an aperture in the wainscoat which divides the two rooms, I observed him to take a parcel, or parcels, I believe there were two, from his box, those he deposited in the window-seat while he dressed himself, it was Sunday morning; when he had dressed himself, he put them in his coat-pocket, and went down stairs to his dinner; he came up about half an hour afterwards into his own room again, I was in the next room concealed all the time; he again opened his box, and took from it sundry articles of plate; he then went down stairs, I followed him, I rung the bell, and he was sent in to me; I asked him what he had to do with plate, indeed, I told him the situation I had been in, and what I had seen; he told me he came honestly by them, or some such answer; I told him my suspicions, and that, if he was an honest man, which I hoped he would prove himself to be, he would not object to let me see what he had about him, and what was in his box; he refused, and I sent for Church, the constable, he searched him, and in his coat-pocket were found the three gross of buttons charged in the indictment; there are only two gross that I can identify, they are the same kind of articles that I missed upon checking the stock; the gross of plated coat-buttons had the number 5391 in the writing of the manufacturer; I had particularly remarked those figures when I took the stock; there was only a gross and a half of that sort of buttons at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100078"></xptr>I took stock on the 11th of December, and when I checked it, there was but half a gross left, and there had been no buttons of that description sold by us; there was a gross of small gilt buttons found upon him, of which the white outside paper was torn off upon which the number was affixed, and it remained in brown paper only; to the best of my belief, that was the gross that I missed, I have no doubt of it; the others are a kind of button that we have a great many of, I cannot identify them; I sent for a constable, and the prisoner said, he could give an account how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was on a Sunday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you spent the morning in posting your books, and taking stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were kind enough to take the plate out of his box? - A. The constable took it with the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost no articles of plate? - A. No; they were afterwards returned to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards kind enough to stop a box of his, down at Wapping? - A. Yes; and that was returned to him.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he could give an account of these articles? - A. Yes; and I told him I was satisfied they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore that stopped all further explanation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you first of all accused him of coming dishonestly by the plate, and then he grew rather crusty, and refused to be searched till you sent for a constable? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever come to your knowledge that the prisoner was a dealer in goods of this sort? - A. No; I never knew that he had kept a shop of any description; I have heard it since, and I had reason to believe it, from invoices being found in his pocket of tea and hats.</p>
               <p>Q. You never happened to hear that he dealt in buttons? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. This manufacturer is, I dare say, entirely engaged in manufacturing for you? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. And this mark is the manufacturer's mark, and not your's? - A. It is not our's, but the manufacturer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you had not sold these articles by any person in your shop in the course of that week? - A. I mean to swear that no such article has ever been accounted for.</p>
               <p>Q. You have two partners? - A. They do not interfere at all in the conducting of the business, I conduct it myself, with Mr. Boyden, who travels for the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And will you, where a man stands in the perilous situation in which the prisoner stands, swear positively to these goods? - A. I only swear to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been with you? - A. A month and two days.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did Mr. Ashness give you charge of the plate? - A. Yes, or else I should not have taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. Any sheets? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any bed furniture, or curtains? - A. No; there were some calico.</p>

               <p>Q. Does Mr. Ashness ever deal in calico? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a pocket-book, perhaps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, perhaps, a Bank-note? - A. Yes, of 10l. and two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, he expected a box from Scotland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went after that too, perhaps? - A. Yes, by order of the Lord-Mayor; but it was not taken away till his wife went to fetch it with a letter from his Lordship; it was never brought before his Lordship, only an account taken of the things in it; I was sent by the Lord-Mayor to search it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after searching it narrowly, you let it all go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a great many articles of trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And bills of parcels? - A. I do not recollect seeing any bills of parcels, every thing was returned to him except the buttons. (The buttons were produced in Court, and deposed to by Mr. Ashness.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever carry on any business in London? - A. Yes; I have sold him buttons, my brother is a button-maker in Birmingham, and he sent me up some buttons, which I sold to the prisoner, he bought at one time, three gross, and three pair of buckles.</p>

I am steward of the ship <hi rend="italic">Bucephalus</hi>, lying at Curling and Young's dry-dock, Limehouse Mr. William Bell is the captain—the owners are Thomas and William Smith—I left the ship about 5th June, and was away until the 18th—I left again that day, and returned on Saturday. Hit—I then missed three bottles of brandy, five bottles of wine, and twelve bottles of beer, from a drawer in the pantry—the drawer was not locked—the pantry-door was locked, and I found it locked on 21st—the entry had been made from the bulk-head, at the back of the pantry, at another door which leads into the store-room—the staple of the padlock was withdrawn—the prisoner was an apprentice on board the ship, and had been so ten or eleven months—he had sailed in the ship to Calcutta and back.</p>

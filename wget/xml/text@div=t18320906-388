I said Yes - he said he would give me 3d., and that man took the bag to hold while I went; the prisoner could hear and see what passed - the man sent me to some street, and said the name of Painter was over the door; the prisoner came with me to the house, and then ran away - the name of Painter was over the house; when I came back the other man, who was to wait at the court, was gone; I saw the prisoner on the Monday following, in Air-street - both of them were together, one a little way from the other - I informed the officer, who took the prisoner; the other ran away - when I saw them the prisoner was laying down, and the other standing a little way from him; the other spoke to me, and asked me to go to Mr. Bloomfield's - I said I would not; I went home to my master, told him I had seen the man, and then returned with an officer, and pointed the prisoner out, who was still there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time of the day was this? A. I started about eleven o'clock in the morning, on Thursday, the 2nd of August; I was about half an hour going to where I lost the bag; when I saw the prisoner some days after he was asleep on the step - I had no conversation with him that day; they were about ten minutes with me when the bag was taken, I think - I observed him particularly; the one who took my bag had a black body coat on - I did not notice his neckerchief; I noticed his face.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the man who went with you to Painter's on the 2nd of August, and who you saw in Air-street on Monday? A. He is the man; he had the same coat he has on now, I think- I am confident of his person.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIES. On the 2nd of August I delivered Lymn a coat to carry to Mr. Freer, King-street, Finsbury - it was my property; I sent him out a little after eleven o'clock from No. 65, Regent-street; he returned in about two hours, without the bag, with a Policeman, and was crying - on the Monday following he came and took me to Air-street, and pointed out the prisoner; I felt doubtful about him, and desired him to be particular - he persisted, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the boy came home the first day was he not much alarmed and disturbed? A. He was crying, but did not seem particularly frightened; he was certainly confused.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner in Air-street, sitting on the step of a door; he denied the charge, and said before the Magistrate that he should be able to prove the boy had sold the coat some where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he asleep? A. I cannot say- he was hanging his head down; he appeared asleep - it was about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am a sawyer, and live at No. 42, Ham-yard, Windmill-street, Haymarket, and rent a place in the yard. On Thursday, the 2nd of August, I was at home all day, and not out of the yard, and saw the prisoner there - I first saw him coming into the yard about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060159"></xptr>a quarter to eleven o'clock; he stopped there till after one- Spry, a sawyer, was at work with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner's business? A. He works for the army, making soldier's caps, I believe - he was slack of work, and often came and sat by the timber in our yard when he has had nothing to do; I was there alongside of him the whole time; he sat there while I was eating my dinner - I dine about a quarter-past one o'clock- he had none of my dinner; Mumford and a person named Spearing was there - Mumford and Spry were at work, and Spearing was standing there, doing nothing but walking up and down; he is a farrier, but he had no horses in his shop, which is in the yard - the prisoner lives at No. 43, Ham-yard, at Morgan's house, and is single-Spry and Mumford fined with me on the timber, and had beef and pork; it was cold - Spearing had no dinner; the prisoner did not go away after dinner, for I gave him 1s. to move the stuff out of the way, and he never left till after eight o'clock at night, and was never out of my presence five minutes all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing from eleven o'clock in the morning till that time of night? A. Why, we had a book amusing ourselves with; I was reading the book - I believe they call it the Old Testament; the prisoner was hearing it; we could not read much, for it was a piece thrown out of a firkin of butter - I was the only person who read; I sometimes read to myself, and sometimes to the prisoner - he sat at one end of the timber; it was smeared and dirty - we got a verse here and there; I read for three hours - I had no tea; I did not give him any dinner; I had no supper, except bread and cheese - he had none of that - Mumford and Spry supped with me; they were at work, and had no reading - I was not able to work.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. On Thursday, the 2nd of August, I was at work at the saw-pit in Ham-yard, and saw the prisoner there at half-past ten o'clock, sitting at the end of the deals at the saw-pit; Edgington was there, but was not at work; I never left the saw-pit till half-past two- I had my dinner in the pit; it was corn beef and pork - it was hot: my mate, who was at work, and Edgington eat with me - the prisoner eat nothing, to my knowledge; Edgington was part of the time sharpening a saw; I was not attending to see exactly what else he might be doing; Mumford was sitting on the deals - the prisoner sat very near him; I left at half-past two o'clock, and left the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you get your hot pork and beef dressed? A. From Spicer's cook-shop, in Crowncourt - it was in one dish; Edgington's brother fetched it- he was my mate; it was not cold, but might not have been taken from the fire that moment; it was pretty hot- I had one plate at the top of the dish; I used my fingers for a fork, and cut it on my bread; neither Spearing nor Mumford work with me; I think Mumford dined with us - he works for us at times, but did not that day - I do not recollect Edgington reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of a greasy book? A. It was part of a leaf that was sent from the cook-shop - there was no book there; I do not recollect Edgington reading at all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was you on the top of the timber or down in the pit? A. On the top.</p>

            . I am a sawyer by trade. On the 2nd of August I was in Ham-yard during the whole of the day, and saw the prisoner there about ten o'clock; I went to my dinner between twelve and one - I believe the prisoner was then just gone up to his dinner at his own place- I am sure he was in the yard till then; the witness Edgington did not work that day; his brother and Spry were at work; I believe he was cutting timber, sawing it - I was there when Edgington and Spry dined; they had beef and pork - I do not know whether it was hot or cold- I had no work to do that day; I did not observe whether Edgington was reading or not; he might, and I not observe it - I dined at my sister's, which is in the yard, about one o'clock, and was up there about a quarter of an hour- I was in the yard all day.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Did you dine before Edgington or after him? A. After they had done, before I went up - I believe Spry brought the beef and pork; he fetched it from Crown-court; I was not at work all day - I did not help Edgington or Spry; the prisoner went up to his father's room to dinner; he lives at No. 33, Ham-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he doing in the yard that day? A. Smoking his pipe mostly the whole day; he walked from the saw-pit to the farrier's to light his pipe, but was mostly sitting down by the saw-pit - he was not employed at all; I was in the yard till about half-past nine o'clock; I should have seen if he had been at work, and am sure he did not do any thing; I remember it was the day the thunder and lightning was - it thundred and lightened very much between six and seven o'clock, and rained - we all remained in the saw-pit while it rained; it thundered loud, and the lightning was vivid, and it rained heavy.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He was in the yard most days when disengaged? A. Yes; I do not recollect where he was on the 31st of July, or the 1st of August, or any other day - I recollect the 2nd, because he came into the shop, and spoke about the thunder; it quite struck him and made him jump off his legs - that was about four o'clock; I was not much in the yard - I generally go outside for a little air, between the heats, but I was pretty well employed - I did not see them at dinner; it was not John Edgington that was at work, but a lusty man they employ - I saw

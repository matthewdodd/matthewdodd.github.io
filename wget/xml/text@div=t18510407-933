                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Clifford's-inn. In Oct., 1849 I had some communication with Mr. Henry Gobat, in consequence of which I ultimately saw the prisoner, and some communication took place between him, me, and Mr. Gobat—I advanced the prisoner 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some title-deeds were deposited with me as security—a memorandum was given—there was a receipt on the back of the deeds for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a promissory-note was given for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with 5 per cent, interest, at three months—it came due in Jan. 1850—it was not paid; but I saw the prisoner and Mr. Gobat, his solicitor, in Jan., 1850; they applied for a further loan, and I said if they would give a mortgage, instead of a deposit of the deeds, I would see if I could advance them more money—I heard something respecting the prisoner, and declined to make the advance, and urged him to give the mortgage—the prisoner called on 23rd Jan., 1850, alone—he said, "I shall owe you something for the abstract I ordered you to send to Mr. Richardson's"—I said, "Yes, it was a very long abstract"—he said, "Let me know what the amount is"—I told him, and he said, "I will pay you the amount if you can give me the difference out of this little bill"—he produced this bill to me, for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Who is this James Benjamin Parker? I do not know the acceptor"—he said, "He is a very respectable man, a corn-merchant, residing at Colchester, with whom I have had considerable dealings"—I said, "Very well, as that is the case, I will take the bill"—and I gave him a check for the difference, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when the bill became due in April, it was not paid; it was returned to my banker's, noted—I afterwards applied to Hankeys', where the bill was payable, and they stated they had no account—on the bill becoming due, I wrote to Colchester, to Newton, and to the acceptor, Parker; and I received my letter back from the post-office—it is directed to "J. B. Parker, corn<lb></lb>merchant"—I went to Colchester; I had friends there, of whom I could inquire—I went to the banker's: to the Corn Exchange: to the editor of the newspaper, and the solicitor, who all said, there was no such person there I inquired at every probable place—Newton had left—I tried to find him, and could not—when I came back to town, I continued to make exertions to find him—I did not hear of him till he was in custody, in Feb., 1851.</p>

B. Parker, corn-merchant, Col<lb></lb>chester, were written by Parker—I do not know his writing—I did not see Parker three different times on the day the prisoner was taken—on the face of the deeds there was a receipt for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Mr. Barnes, of Colchester, said they were not worth a shilling—I have not issued two writs on this bill; I have no writs on it—I know nothing of the Fingering Hoe Mills—I know the Military Mills—I do not know a person named</p>

               <p>Gray. a corn-merchant, there—I do not know that Parker has bad dealings in corn with a person named Gray, I think some witness at Guildhall said that; I did not hear that at Colchester—I think there was a letter from Parker, but I do not know where it is—I never saw him write—on my leaving Colchester, and rinding there was no such person, I concluded the bill was a forgery—that was in April, last year, after the bill became due—it was due on 19th April—I cannot tell how long it was after that—I never heard it was a forgery; I concluded it was a forgery after I left Colchester—I dare say it might be a month after—then I concluded the bill was a forgery—it was in April or May—this is my signature to this letter—it is dated 20th April, 1850, the day after the bill was due—I had not been to Colchester then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by this (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>), "I hear the bill is a forgery, and I shall take out a warrant unless I hear from you by Tuesday next"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had heard somebody speak about it—I Concluded it was a forgery—I employed Childs, a police-officer, to take the prisoner—I gave him authority by direction of the Magistrate—this is my authority to him—I gave this paper to him at the same time—this is an account for two writs, a bill, and other things, amounting altogether to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; bill and charges due to Mr. Fearnhead—I did not tell him to let Newton go if he could get this money—I gave this paper to Childs on the day of Newton going into custody—the date of the authority is 14th Feb., 1851—Childs desired me to include all the expenses that had been incurred against Newton and Parker, as he said they had got plenty of money, and Parker was going to pay the bill—Childs had been in search of both of these parties for a long time—I gave this at Childs's request—here are "two writs, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; "they have nothing to do with this bill—I included them because Childs said they wished to have all the amount—they are the writs for the 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I sent down—I do not know whether the second writ was issued on the day it bean date—I will swear I have not taken out this writ since Jan., 1850, for the purpose of charging it against Newton—this writ for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bears date 23rd Jan. 1850—it was issued on 14th Feb., and the interest of 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 23rd Jan.—I I swear this writ was issued on 14th Feb.—here is an item for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one guinea paid to Mr. Barnes—these moneys were paid at the time this was written—I always pay money directly—my expenses to Col<lb></lb>chester are not charged here—I told Childs at the time I gave him this memorandum that if he could get this 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd from the acceptor of the bill, he might let Newton go—I believed at that time that this hill was a forgery—Newton was then at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said that you held thedeecls in question as security for this bill, as well as for the 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said that I should not part with them till I got it—I know Charlotte Langfbrd; she called on me respecting the 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said her son would shortly be in cash; and if I would go to Mr. Isaacs, a solicitor, he would give the particulars—I think that was after Newton was in custody—I did not tell her if she could bring me 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would let him go—I did not specify any amount; I wished to get my principal and interest; I never asked for more—I would not attempt to compromise a felony—it was the other sum, the 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am an attorney, of forty years standing—the application was wade to me about the acceptor—at Guildhall I produced a piece of paper. and asked Parker whether it was his acceptance; he said, "No."</p>

I do not know the name of Parker, a coro<lb></lb>dealer, there—there is no such person as James Benjamin Parker—my business leads me much on the Corn Exchange—there has been no such person there—I know the Military Mills very well; I let them to a person named Gray—he was in possession of them in 1849 and 1850—he was there a few months, I cannot say how long—to the best of my knowledge, there was no person named Parker residing there—I had seen Gray there during that time.</p>

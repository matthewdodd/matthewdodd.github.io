On 23rd November at 6 o'clock I was on duty at Lewisham High Road, at the corner of Brockley Road, and saw four men standing opposite Mr. Grundy's house, 8, Brockley Road—these four men are in Court—I walked towards them, and they walked away, but returned to the same place—I walked towards them again, and they came towards me, two on one side, and two on the same side as I was—when I got opposite where they were watching, No. 8, I looked into the front garden and saw a cask standing at the front door—I knocked at the door and asked if it was the gentleman's property—I saw the wit-ness Grundy—I then went into the churchyard opposite and concealed myself and taw the four men walking to and fro—they afterwards stopped opposite the gate, and one man posted himself at a distance off, and another man at another distance, and two went in where the cask was—McCann and Hutchings went in for the cask—they raised it from the ground and I stepped over out of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> churchyard and rushed across the road, when the two who were keeping a look-out cried out "Look out;" but I secured Hutchings and McCann, and asked who the cask belonged to—they said that they did not know—I took them to the station with the assistance of another constable—Mr. Linnell afterwards brought the cask to the station.</p>

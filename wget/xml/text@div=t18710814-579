                  </hi>. I was head nurse to Mr. Owens, at Hampton Court—the prisoner was there as wet nurse—she is nineteen years old—she had been at Mr. Owen's about six weeks, and I was there nine months—there had never been any quarrel between us—on Thursday, 13th July, I went to bed about 11 o'clock—the prisoner slept in the same room, but not in the same bed—she woke me up two or three times during the night—the first time was soon after midnight, and she asked me to take something out of a glass—she asked for a razor to cut her corn; that was about 3 o'clock in the morning—I said I could not find it—she then asked if she might have a knife, and I said "Yes"—I went to sleep again—she woke me again, and asked me to take some more out of the glass, and I took a little—I don't know what it was—I tasted it and it was rather hot—I went to sleep again—when I woke again, she was kneeling on the bed by my side, with the knife in one hand and holding my hands with the other—I saw blood on my night dress, but what was done to my throat was done before I woke—I struggled with her for some time—she said "Don't make a noise, I only want you for a few minutes"—I succeeded in getting the</p>

Sampson was my head nurse—on Friday morning, 14th July, about 6 o'clock, she came into my room where I was sleeping with my wife—she had blood on her throat, and also on her night dress—she had this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her hand—she made a statement to me—I called in a medical man, and fetched a policeman—at that time Sampson was lying on the bed, very much agitated—when the policeman came, she gave the prisoner in custody for attempting to cut her throat.</p>

I don't recollect anything about it"—she also said "I had a fall down stairs seven years ago, and oftentimes since that I have no recollection of what I do"—after the remand she seemed quite a different girl—she was well fed in the meantime, and gave up the suckling.</p>

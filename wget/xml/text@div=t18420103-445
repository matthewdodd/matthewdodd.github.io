                  </hi>. I am watchman at the Wheatsheaf-wharf. On the night of the 2nd of January, at a quarter to seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner meddling with the skylight over the cabin of the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi>—he was moving it, to take it off or on—I said, "It is not so hot in the cabin that yon need to take that off; I am cold enough walking about"—he said, "It is not seven yet, is it?"—I said, "No"—I looked at my watch, and it wanted a quarter to seven—he then walked forward.</p>

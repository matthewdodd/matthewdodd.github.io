                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at No. 25, Giffin-street, Deptford; the prisoner lodged in my house, in the top front attic. On Monday evening 15th May, about 6 o'clock I was sitting in the front parlour at tea, and heard the prisoner's wife crying "Murder! and "Help!"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120080"></xptr>
               <p>—I got up out of my chair, went into the passage and saw the woman lying in the yard, and the prisoner standing over her, attempting to kick her—I went to him and said, "Well, John, what do you want to kill your wife for?" and I gave him a shove and pushed him away from her—he then turned round and made a hit at me, and as he drew his arm back I found that I was stabbed at the side of the ear—I did not see anything in his hand at first—he struck at me a second time, and I laid hold of his legs and threw him down—I then saw him throw the knife away; it was afterwards picked up; it was a clasp knife, not very sharp, with a kind of point to it—I struggled with the prisoner for some time—he said he would do it for me again—he meant that he would stab me again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you mention that he had stabbed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He knew that he had stabbed me; because the blood came from my ear, all over his face—it was whilst the blood was coming from me that he said that; it was after he had thrown the knife away—he had nothing then to do it with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you knock me down before I meddled with you, and give me a black eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I pushed you from your wife, to save her life—I never bad an angry word with you, all the eight months you lodged with me—in my opinion, you would have murdered your wife if I had not interfered—I never held a razor to my wife because she stopped out all night—you did mot draw the knife at me; you had it in your hand when you made the hit at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine fitter, and live in the same house with the prosecutor and prisoner. I was at home this day, and heard the woman scream "Murder!" and, for God's sake, for somebody to come and help her—Mr. Bell was the first that went out to her assistance—when I went out she was lying on the ground in the yard, and Bell was bleeding from a wound in the left ear—I had followed him closely—I went for a policeman—about fire minutes afterwards I picked up the knife, in the yard, between the door post and the water butt—I gave it to the policeman—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner owned it before the inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Bell strike the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were scuffling when I got there; Bell was struggling to get the prisoner away from his wife—I then went for the policeman, and did not see any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had net Bell got me down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not see him give you a black eye—you and he were not fighting—you could not have had five or six rounds before I went out—it was done instantly.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am a surgeon at Deptford. On 15th May, Bell called on me about 7 o'clock in the evening—he had a slight punctured wound on the left side of the head near the ear—I did not consider it of a dangerous character—it might be caused by such a knife as this—he was some time under my care—I dressed the wound several times; it was some inches from the carotid artery.</p>

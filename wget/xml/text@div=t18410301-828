                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Brown, of Aldgate. About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 25th of February, I was sweeping the doorway and saw the prisoner walk out of the shop with this cloth under his arm—there was no one in the shop—I ran after him—he threw the cloth under a wagon, loaded with paper—I picked it up, and pursued—he was going down Mitre-street, and could not get farther—there were some men coming up—I am sure he is the man.</p>

             sworn. - I follow the sea; I know the prisoners: On a Saturday, about the 10th of 11th of December, I think between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Benjamin James, came to my lodgings, at No. 13,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120023"></xptr>Denmark-street, and told me he had got some tongues from Mile-End, and he said he had one ham and four handkerchiefs that he got from the same place, and he said he had got some cards and gloves; I saw one pack of cards; he did not say where he had them from.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Denmark-street from Mile-End? - A. I dare say it is near two miles; I followed him to his lodgings, and while I was there, Hafford came in and Connor; James said, they had attacked some place, and got a coat and some load, and they were pursued, and obliged to leave it; he said they had been at Capt. Wright's, and that a man who was at the window might have shot one of them if he had had a mind.</p>

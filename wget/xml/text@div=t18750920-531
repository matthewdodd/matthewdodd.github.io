                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). On the 1st September I met Woodcock at the Rose Wharf, Blackwall, at about 11 o'clock in the forenoon—I told him I was an officer and should take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing two cows on the 6th of last May—he said "I think they are getting it up for me"—I told him he would have to go to Plaistow, where we had another man locked up—I took him there and charged him again—he said nothing at all—I had taken Hubbard on the 27th August—I had been on the look-out for Woodcock ever since then—when I took Hubbard and told him the charge, he said "All right, I know nothing about it. I expected this. I should not have done so if it had not been for little Ben Woodcock who sent me. to fetch the cows, and told me to tell Mark Gibbard that Mr. Smith had sent me for them. They were sold to go over the water. I went down to fetch them. Mark Gibbard would not let me have them that night until the next morning between 4 and 5 o'clock, when I brought them up to the World's End public-house, Stepney Green, and there little Ben took them from me and told me he would see me to-morrow night. He didn't see me till Saturday night; he then gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am sorry for Saul that he bought them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hubbard.</hi> When he asked me who it was that sent for the cows, I told him "A man named 'Little Ben.' I didn't know his other name." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, I am sure he said "Woodcock;" and he said "He can always be found at the Black Swan, Bow."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I. was at the police-court, and heard the whole of the case—I heard Hubbard say (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Woodcock</hi>) "This is not the man to whom I delivered the cows;" but that was after—I had not had him in my charge a minute before he told me all about it—I was with him about two hours—I didn't press him; he told me voluntarily—I asked him a good many times respecting Woodcock:—I didn't know who he was at the time—I said before the Magistrate that I didn't know who little <hi rend="italic">Benny</hi> was.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Cockley Street, Stepney Green, and am a potman—I am a brother of the prisoner Hubbard—I remember seeing Woodcock, in Whitechapel Market, about six weeks or two months ago, when I had some conversation with him about my brother Robert—I asked him if he had seen my brother, and he said "Do you know that the <hi rend="italic">detect</hi> are after him?"—I said "I am quite aware of that"—then he said "I gave your brother 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of what we got for the cows; if <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> is taken he won't <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on us; he will stand the racket of the lot"—he did'nt say how the cows were brought from Tottenham, or who brought them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That conversation took place about six weeks, or two months ago—about the end of July—I have seen him in the market before that, but have not had-anything to say to him—I am quite sure he said "I gave your brother 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of what we got for the cows"—I didn't say "Out of the sale of the two heifers" before the Magistrate; "two cows" I believe is what I said. (<hi rend="italic">The witnesses depositions being referred stated</hi>): "He told me had given my brother 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the sale of <hi rend="italic">'the two heifers</hi> which were sold at Tottenham.") It <hi rend="italic">was heifers</hi> he said before the Magistrate—as these cows were stolen on the Thursday, I bad information on the Satur<lb></lb>day, and then I enquired into the case—that would be on the 8th May, I believe—I knew my brother had gone away, but did not know where he had gone to—it is over two months ago since I first saw the police in the matter—I saw the first constable about it in May—he came from Ilford, and was in plain clothes—there were three or four detectives—there was Detective Smith—I didn't make Detective Murrell's acquaintance until my brother was in custody; not to tell him anything about the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hubbard.</hi> My brother came last Saturday to see me and he told me that the detective told, him to say what he has said, and that if he came and swore against Woodcock that it would get me off. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did see him last Saturday, but on my oath I never said a word of that kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hubbard's Defence.</hi> I wish to say that a man who sent me for the cows came to me and I happened to be the only one there on Thursday. When he first came it was <hi rend="italic">latish</hi> in the evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, and he asked me to go for two cows for Mr. Smith at East End Marshes and bring them to him and he would pay me for the trouble. I went down at night and could not get them. I went down the next morning, between 4 and 5 o'clock, and brought them to a gentleman on Stepney Green and delivered them to a man named Benjamin Woodcock. That is all I know.

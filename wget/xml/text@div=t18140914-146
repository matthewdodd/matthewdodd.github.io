Treachers' business is carried on in High Holborn; they have another concern in Pater-noster-row This was in High Holborn. On the evening of the 26th of August, Stiles was sent from the shop in Holborn, to the Duke of Northumberland's house, in the Strand, with twenty dozen candles. I assisted in packing them up. I am sure he went out with twenty dozen. After he was gone, I received some information; in consequence of that, I went to Northumberland house, and saw six dozen taken out of one box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had been delivered - A. They had not been emptied; the candles were in two boxes and one basket. The two boxes were quite full when he went from our house, and when I saw it at Northumberland house, six pounds were out of it. I asked him what became of them; he first said, the porter at Northumberland's house had his allowance out of it; he afterwards said, he had taken them out of the box and put them in the basket. The candles in the basket were considerably larger than those in the boxes, and there were none in the basket of the size of those in the boxes. I told the house-keeper to keep the candles separately. I corded up the boxes: she put them in a closet, and kept the key. The prisoner then brought home the truck, and when he had delivered the truck in the shop, the officer that I had with me, immediately took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw there was six pounds deficient - A. Yes; the value of them was seven shillings. I weighed the candles myself.</p>

On the 26th of August, I saw Stiles take a box of candles off the truck; he put them on his shoulder in St. Martin's-lane; he took them into a court; I saw him take the candles out of the box, a good many; I cannot say the quantity; he put them into Hodder's basket; I followed Hodder to the top of Long Acre, but no further. I saw them again at the magistrates. That is all I know of this business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Stiles did with the box afterwards - A. He put it on the truck again, and went towards Charing Cross.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of August, I was sent for. I saw Stiles coming out of Northumberland house; I followed him to his master's; I then took him in custody; I told him his situation. After some little hesitation, he owned that he took forty-seven or forty-nine candles in number, he was not sure which; that he had given them to Hodder, a shoe-maker, that he worked in a stall at the corner of Stone cutter-passage, Lincoln's-inn-fields, opposite of Whetstone-park. In consequence of this, I went to Hodder, and told him what I had against him; he denied it, and said, he knew nothing about the candles. I found five candles in his stall. I asked him where he got them; he said, he had them two months. They appeared to me to be of the same manufactory. The prisoners were then brought before the magistrate; there Hodder said, these five candles were part of what he had received of Stiles; the rest of them he had sold to a jew, with a bag at his back; he did not know the jew. From information, I went to the house of

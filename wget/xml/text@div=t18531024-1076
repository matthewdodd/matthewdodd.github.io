                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 5, Pleasant-row, High-street, Camden-town. On Monday afternoon 3rd Oct., about a quarter past 4 o'clock I was in Copenhagen-fields, where the works are going on for the New Market—I saw a load of slack brought to the ganger, that is a person who has charge <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a gang of men—I saw the prisoner there, I did not know him before; he called the ganger over—his mate wanted a barrow of slack, the ganger would not let them have it—the prisoner said he was no man, and he was <hi rend="italic">cheeking</hi> him <hi rend="italic">and jawing</hi> him, and said he would have some—he afterwards challenged the ganger to fight, and struck him in the eye and mouth—the ganger did not fight—the prisoner and his mate went away—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner called the ganger over again, and challenged him to fight, he did not accept the challenge—while this was going on Drew came up from his work, and told the prisoner he was no man for wanting to fight an old man like the ganger—the ganger was an oldish man—the prisoner said to Drew that he had better take it up, and asked him what he had to do with it—he asked Drew whether he wanted to fight, Drew said he did not mind it and pulled off his coat—the prisoner had his coat off—they then began to fight, a great number of workmen were present—a ring was formed—they had seconds, I do not know their names—in the first round Drew laid hold of the prisoner by the hair of his head, and struck him about the head—the prisoner fell down on his knee—the prisoner was the first that fell—he got round Drew's legs in the first round, and struck him with his fist in the Drew said, "It is not a manly action to strike unfair"—that was all that took place in the first round; in the second round the prisoner again got his arms round Drew's legs—I saw no blows struck in the second round—they both fell, the prisoner undermost—they got up, and renewed the fight—in the third round blows were struck by Drew, the prisoner did not strike any—the prisoner fell on his knees, Drew did not fall—they had a fourth round, and they both fell in a scuffle—I did not observe anything in the fifth round, there were about seven rounds</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240026"></xptr>
               <p>in all—I did not observe anything particular in the seventh round, at the end of the fight 1 saw Drew fall from a blow, which the prisoner struck him under the ear, it was a violent blow—I heard Drew say to the prisoner, "You have struck me, you have given me a violent blow under the ear, but I won't be done yet," and he got up on his knee and one foot, and fell back again—he never spoke afterwards—a gentleman came op, and in a few minutes he was removed into the City of London Tavern—the prisoner escaped, he was drunk—Drew had had something, but he was not so drunk as the prisoner.</p>

I will come and fetch you out"—he said that half an hour afterwards, that was when the prisoner wanted to strike the old ganger—it was not while he was at work in the hole—the prisoner was all over blood in the first round, from his nose—he got pretty well all the blows—Drew was taller and much bigger than the prisoner, and a stout powerful man—the prisoner was nearly insensible once on his second's knee, there was a call to time and they put him up again—Drew seemed to do almost what he liked with him as to striking—this happened where the carts were going through—there are tracks of the cart wheels there, I did not observe a rut close by—I did not see that Drew tripped his foot in going back when he fell—he did not fall with his back across some earth, he fell on his left side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Bemerton-street, Caledo<lb></lb>nian-road. On 3rd Oct., I was at work and saw the prisoner and the deceased fighting—I did not know either of them, the deceased was a big man—I believe they had had about one round when I got up—the first I saw when I got up was the prisoner knocked down—the deceased was not knocked down in that round—I never saw the deceased knocked down at all, until the last round—I did not see the prisoner lay hold of the deceased—they both fell together in the last round, the deceased was the most upper<lb></lb>most, but they fell sideways—I do not know what caused the deceased to fall, I never saw a blow struck at the last round by either party, they fell in the struggle—I did not hear the deceased speak—he did not get up again; I followed him to the City of London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Gloucester-place, Oakley-square. On 3rd Oct, about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon I was near the New Market, at Islington, and saw a crowd—I afterwards saw the deceased taken into the house and examined him there, he was dead, there was no external appearance—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was nothing remarkable externally, with the exception of ecchyraosis round both eyes, and some bloody froth from the left nostril, and a patch of blood on one of the ears—on removing the scalp we perceived blood extravasated at the lower edge of each parietal bone to the occipital region, but we could not perceive any fracture—on removing the skull cap we perceived extensive extravasation over both hemispheres of the brain, which extended to the base—there was a quantity of blood clots round the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi>, extending as far as the third vertebra; there was also ex<lb></lb>travasation of the right and left ventricle—the extravasation under the scalp behind the ear would account for that, it extended all round—a blow or a fall might cause that extravasation—I apprehend that one blow would not produce such extensive extravasation—I could not positively swear whether a fall or a blow from a fist in fighting Would be likely to produce it most likely a blow; but a fall might da it—a blow of sufficient force to cause death might be given there, and yet no mark be left—death was caused by pressure of blood on the brain; and that might be caused by a blow or a fall, I could not positively swear which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the appearances you observed have been occa<lb></lb>sioned by a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might; a fall on the back <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the bead from tripping over the ground might produce such appearances.</p>

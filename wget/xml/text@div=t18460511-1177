On the 12th of April, about half-past five o'clock, I left my house to attend chapel, and returned about half-past eight o'clock—when I got within 100 yards of my house I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and found a number of individuals gathered round my door—I learnt the thief had come out of my house—I went backwards, and the policeman had got the prisoner in charge—I went back to my house—Mr. Roberts and the policeman went in with me—I found a pair of trowsers and a cream-jug down stairs, which had been brought from up stairs—on proceeding up stairs I found a top coat on the landing—a chest of drawers in the back room first floor had been opened—I had left the top drawer locked—I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, a pocket-book, a cream-jug, and a bunch of keys in it—it was broken open—I afterwards saw a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note produced by the witness, and recognized it as one I had lost—my name is upon it—it was taken from that drawer—I saw my pocket. book also—I had received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes through the post, and had joined them—I had left all the articles safe in the house when I went out, and found every one of them removed from their place when I returned.</p>

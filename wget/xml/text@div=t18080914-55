               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch on the 27th of August last - A. I did; the prisoner took it; he was a lodger in my house.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see him take the watch - A. I saw the watch in his custody; I had lent the servant girl the watch; he brought the watch down stairs and gave it to my wife; he said he was a police officer, and he would take care of it; after he gave the watch to my wife he sat down in the tap room; there was some little dispute between my servant and me about her spoiling some fish me over night; he made a demand of the watch, and he said he would take charge of the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to take charge of the girl for - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any charge against the girl for stealing the watch - A. No. He sat down in the tap room, after he had demanded the watch, and minutely looked at it; he said there was some private mark, he wanted to see; after that the dispute between me and my servant was all made up; I asked him for my watch; he said I will not give you the watch now, never mind, I will take care of the watch; the next morning he went out early, he returned on the following day very much in liquor; he told me he had left the watch at Hounslow, then he said at Brentford, and afterwards he said at Knightsbridge; I sent for an officer; after the officer had taken charge of him, he said he had left it at the Castle at Brentford; he said he was sorry for what had happened, he meaned to fetch it the following day.</p>

            . I am a publican at Brentford. On the 28th of August, the prisoner got off the coach and asked me for one shilling and sixpence to pay for coach hire, I lent it him; he asked me to lend him sixpence to go up the town with; he came back and dined with me; after dinner he told me he had no money, he would leave the watch in security for what he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he leave it for - A. I lent him in the whole twenty five shillings and eight pence on the watch; he had been in my house five or six times; he represented himself as a police officer.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night the talling out was between the girl and the mistress, I came down with the key of the girl's room in my hand; I said the girl is leaving the house; yes, Mrs. Marshall said, I wish I had Mr. Marshall's watch out of her room; I went up and got it and gave it to Mrs. Marshall; she throwed it down on the glass: I said you will break the glass of that watch; I said give it to me; which she did. On the Sunday morning I got a little in liquor, I went down to Brentford to Mr. Barrett's, as he has said; I pulled out the watch and said I will leave it till tomorrow, and then I will come and redeem it; about twelve o'clock at night, I returned home, Mr. Marshall sent his girl up to me to know what I had done with the watch; the answer was the watch was safe enough, I would bring it back tomorrow evening; I had no intention of keeping his watch; I am a pensioner; I have served his Majesty sixteen years; I have a shilling a day; I could go and get the money at any time.</p>

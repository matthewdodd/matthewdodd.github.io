On 2nd Nov. the prisoner came about half past 11 o'clock at night; she asked for a pint of beer; I drew it, and she said she did not want that, she wanted a glass of beer—I gave her a glass of beer, and I saw her put down a shilling; I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, she drank the beer and went out—I directly found the shilling was bad; I put it aside—I saw the prisoner again in about ten minutes; she asked for a glass of beer, and put down a shilling—I said, "This is just the same as the other"—she said, "It is very good"—I said I would not give her the shilling nor the change—I marked the shillings, Nos. 1 and 2, and gave them to the policeman—the prisoner gave her address, No. 47, Blackfriars-road.</p>

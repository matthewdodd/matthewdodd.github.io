                  </hi>. I live in Ashley Crescent. On the 8th of April I saw my watch safe in my bed-room, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and missed it between eight and nine o'clock—this watch (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is very like mine.</p>

B." on it—this is a silver hunting-watch, and this seal has "W. B." on it—my watch had a black ribbon to it like this—I had worn it a good many years, and had sealed letters with the seal a hundred times—my watch had a mark on it, which I do not see on this—it is very like mine.</p>

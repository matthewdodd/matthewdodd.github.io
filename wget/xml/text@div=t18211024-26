I met Pearman, took him there, and as soon as they were taken in, I saw a sovereign laying by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240016"></xptr>the side of the fire place - only the prisoners, and the turnkey were in the room, 11 s. was found on Gordon, and 9 s. 6 d. on Williams, and in a glove belonging to her, we found a note.

            . I am one of the night police. I saw Kernot crossing from the Compter, I found the prisoners there, he charged them with robbing him of four sovereigns, and some silver, Gordon said she had dropped a sovereign, I found one by the fire-place, about two yards from where she stood, I found 9 s. 6 d. on her, and 11 s. on Williams; a 10 l. country note was found in Williams's glove.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know there was a sovereign on the floor - A. She said she dropped one, Williams contradicted her, and said "You have not." Both denied it. Kernot did not appear quite sober, but knew what he was about well enough.</p>

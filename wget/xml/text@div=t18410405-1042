                  </hi>. I live in Nottingham-court, King-street, St. Giles's, I know the prisoner. On the morning of the 10th of February I saw her in our court, she went into my house—I followed her in—I did not see any thing with her then—she asked me if <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> had been there that morning—I said, "No," she could go and see—<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> is my brother, Wil<lb></lb>liam Collins—he does not live in the house—my husband went out to call him, and while he was gone, the prisoner asked me if I had a knife—I said, "Yes"—I got her one, and she forced the caddy open with it—she had got it under her arm—I did not see it before—I saw silver spoons and money in it, but I do not know how much—I asked if it be-longed to her mother, she said, "No"—I asked who else—she made no answer—I said then, "Does it belong to your mistress?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "My God, girl, what courage you have!"—she said she was a fool that she did not have courage when she had a better opportu<lb></lb>nity, for she once counted twenty sovereigns in the box—I was very much surprised at her—she took the things out, wrapped them in a hand-kerchief, and put them into her bosom—she left the box in my room—my husband and brother then came in—she said to my brother, "I want to speak to you," and they both went out together—I told my husband what I had seen—the prisoner came back alone—I said I was sorry for her, and the best thing she could do was to send for her master and mistress, and give herself up to them, and if she liked I would go and call her mistress—she said she did not know what she was to do—we both persuaded her, and at last she consented—my husband went and fetched Mr. Denker, who saw the box—it was given to the policeman.</p>

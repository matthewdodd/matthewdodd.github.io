I am the wife of Richard Booth, a general dealer—my little girl used to work for the prisoner—in consequence of what my girl told me I spoke to the prisoner, and told him the child was very ill, why did she not take it to a doctor—she said she was forced to neglect it for her work, and likewise the money the mother allowed her did not support it—I saw the child on Whit Tuesday, and gave it a halfpennyworth of milk; it seemed to take it ravenously—on the 17th June I saw it in my little girl's arms at the door; it was very dirty, neither washed or dressed, and I took it to its mother, and fed it with pound-cake and arrow-root, and it took it very ravenously, and was very thin—I took it to the doctor, and had it at my place afterwards till it died.</p>

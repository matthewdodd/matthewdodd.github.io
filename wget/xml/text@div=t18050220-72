               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You seem to be quite in a supposition that there were only nineteen; did you see them all measured out; will you undertake to say there were any lost out of that room? - A. No; It was impossible for me to tell whether any were gone.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Whatever sacks of coals were in that craft, were the property of Mr. Copous? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a master smith; I have been these thirty years; I live at No. 77, High-street, Shadwell: On the 29th of January, about one o'clock in the day, I had been to see what my men were doing, and opposite to the White Hart, Queen-street, I saw a coal waggon first and a cart behind it; I saw the prisoner Clark take a sack of coals from the left side of the tail of the waggon and run across the way into the White Hart public-house; I went round to the front of the waggon to see who they belonged to, and saw Mr. Copous's name on it; I then saw Swift, he was beginning to tie up the rope a little tighter at the tail of the waggon; I then told Swift I had seen what was done and I would not pass it; he said he knew nothing of what had been done; I then went into the public-house and the first I saw was the prisoner Clark; he had just got rid of the sack, and was going to drink; I did not see the sack again, it was all instantly done; I said to him, my friend, I have seen what you have done, and I will not suffer it; he said, in answer, what have I done; I said, I saw you take a sack of coals out of the tail of that waggon and bring them into this house, to which he made no reply; the woman prisoner, Powell, as I supposed then, was the landlady of the house; she was near enough to hear what I had said to Clark; she stood at the left hand of the bar; I immediately turned round to her and said, madam, I have seen that man bring a sack of coals from the tail of that waggon now standing opposite the door, into this house, and I will not suffer it; I will go immediately and acquaint Mr. Copous? she said she knew nothing about any coals; upon that I immediately quitted the house, it was all momentarily done, I was not half a minute after Clark in the public-house, and the woman prisoner I found in the tap-room, standing still, she must have seen the coals; I then went to Mr. Copous's house and informed the clerk; his clerk went up with me immediately; we did not go into the house; the waggon and the cart had removed, but not out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Powell, the landlord of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You took no pains to see whether he was at home or not? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a passage through this house to an alley that leads to the wharf? - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that Mrs. Powell must have seen the situation she was in, if she was there? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether she was there when the coals were put down it is not possible for you to say? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. She was attending to different persons who were calling for liquor? - A. She was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several persons in the tap-room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200059"></xptr>it was her business to attend them? - A. I did not know she was the landlord's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you do not understand the question; were there not a number of people in the taproom, and was it not her business to attend them? - A. I think I have got intellects; certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she standing at the time the waggoner deposited the coals; that you do not know? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you return to the house and search for any coals, as soon as any information was given? - A. I did nothing about it till Mr. Copous came up, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Mr. Powell, the master of the public-house, agreed with you for any coals? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In point of fact no property was ever found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was not your intention to prosecute the woman? - A. I went up to Mr. Reid, the Magistrate, and he persuaded me to take them all up.</p>

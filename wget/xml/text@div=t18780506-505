                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a hairdresser, of 13, Princes Street—I occupy the whole of the place, except the shop and the back parlour—I sleep on the first-floor back—I went to bed at ten o'clock on the night of 27th March at about eight o'clock—Curtis came to apply for a lodging—I had one room—he looked in drink, and I said very roughly, "No, I have not a room"—this all took place in English—he went away—about 2 a.m. I was alarmed by a noise, got up five minutes after, went downstairs and lit the gas on the staircase, where I saw the two prisoners—I looked, and the passage door leading into the back parlour was shut—I asked them what they wanted?—they were standing close together, and I think it was Curtis said "I beg pardon, I have made a mistake"—I had a sword in my hand—Matthews was at the back of Curtis—he moved a little and I saw a chisel stuck in the door—I called "Police"—one or two minutes afterwards Victor Ouverie came downstairs while the prisoners were still in the passage—the police came and took them and found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a chisel, a piece of candle, and a few keys on the mats.</p>

The rent of my house is 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there are a shop and back parlour on the ground floor—no one sleeps there or on the basement—I and my wife sleep on the first floor—the front room is for my business and the back I occupy—Ouverie and his wife sleep on the second floor—the back room on that floor is not let—he has another room on the third floor which he uses as a kitchen—a young man in the City occupied the back room second floor—that room is sometimes let for short periods but not for a night—I let my rooms by the week—I swear that women are not allowed to occupy any of those rooms with men—I have had a good many Frenchwomen living in the house but not now—I had two loose women in my house four or five months ago—Mons. Ouverie has a latch-key, and his wife, also another lodger in the back room third floor—it would not be possible for my lodgers to let any one in after I had gone to bed without my knowing it, for even if a cat runs upstairs I am awoke by it—I am always awakened by my lodgers—in the evening, at 10.30, I heard Mr. Alex<lb></lb>ander, who lives in the third-floor back, go up, but nobody else—I did</p>

               <p>not hear Ouverie come in—I was asleep—the gas is not always burning on the staircase—I lit it when I got up—I have been in England ten years next August—I did not hear anybody go out after I was in bed—the street door was quite shut—my habit is when the last lodger comes in to get up and go down and tell him to put the bolt, but that night not hearing Monsieur Ouverie come in I did not do so—it is 2 1/2 yards from the staircase to the passage door and about 3 yards from the bottom of the staircase to the back parlour.</p>

I live at 13, Princes Street—I have a front room third-floor and Madame has a room on the second floor—we have separate rooms—I got home at 1 a.m. on the morning of 28th March—I locked the door as it cannot be put to otherwise than with the key—about half an hour after I had gone to bed I heard cries of "Police! help!"—I went down and saw Boutinorr with a sword in one hand and holding Curtis with the other—I saw both prisoners there, and a pair of pinchers and two separate keys on the floor, and, I think, a bunch of keys near the staircase—I saw the inspector pick up the pinchers after the prisoners were in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer carrying on business at 71, Coleman Streeet, City—on 7th May last, I saw the prisoner at my office—he wanted 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—I said "I shall want a bill of sale on your furniture, and a declaration that the goods are free and unincumbered and that you are solvent"—that was supposing the goods to be of sufficient value—I showed him the form of declaration—he said he was perfectly solvent, he could make that declaration—he wanted the money to complete the lease of a house that was finishing at Wood Green—I went to see the furniture at his house in Ambler's Road, which articles are enumerated in the sehedule of the first bill of sale—the declaration was prepared—he read it at my office and signed it—its provisions were fully explained to him by me. (<hi rend="italic">The declara<lb></lb>tion stated that the prisoner liad no other name, that he resided at</hi> 25, <hi rend="italic">Ambler's Road, the goods were his sole and absolute property, and there was no other right or title to them, that they were not charged or incumbered in any way, and not on hire; that he made such declaration fully cognizant of the pains and penalties of making false declarations, that he was in a state of solvency, and all his liabilities exclusive of the bill of sale just given did not exceed</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was signed, "Charles Vere," and declared at 25. Coleman Street.) I saw the prisoner sign it—with reference to his not owing more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said you had better say 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. above that—he said that was more than he owed—I then lent 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear, reserving 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my charges and interest—this was paid in different sums by cheque, as he said he was settling accounts for which he wanted the money to clear him—I found the furniture sufficient and the bill of sale was executed on the 7th May—it was not registered—it was part of the agreement that it should not be—it is a common thing not to register bill of sale for the purpose of keeping the name out of the trade circular—a second bill of sale, a duplicate of the first, was afterwards given which was registered—I believed the statement that the prisoner was solvent, and that he did not owe more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on which faith I parted with my money—I think it was on the 11th June that I heard of an execu<lb></lb>tion on the prisoner's goods and that the Sheriff of Middlesex was in possession—the prisoner came to me and told me that he had got the Sheriff in—I said "What the dickens does this mean? I thought you didn't owe more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world"—he said he was very sorry; he did not think it would come to this—then. I said perhaps the best thing I could do would be to pay the Sheriff out if I got any more security, and he offered me his stock-in-trade in Jewin Street, and a bill of sale was prepared for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was to pay the expenses and the amount of the execution by the Sheriff, 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if he would not withdraw—the stock was valued at 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a clerk of mine—I did not see it then, I subsequently sold it and it realised 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, which money I retain at the present time—I have received notice from the bankruptcy people not to dispose of that money—I cannot use it—three or four days after the 11th June I heard of the prisoner-filing a Petition in the Court of Bankruptcy for liquidation—before 1 could deal with anything or do anything I was restrained by an order from the Court in consequence of the petition, and was prevented handing over the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I dare say the petition was filed on the 18th June, it was before I could</p>

               <p>convert any security for my money—I was present at the meeting of creditors—Mr. Bordman the defendant's solicitor was there—I saw the de<lb></lb>fendant sign his statement of liabilities—the creditors came to no resolution. (<hi rend="italic">the proceedings in Bankruptcy were put in.</hi>) There was an interpleader issue between the Sheriff of Middlesex and myself, which was to come on for trial at the Hertford Assizes—we did not go on with the action because the resolution under the bankruptcy proceedings failed, and if I went against the Sheriff I should have lost against the trustee, so a <hi rend="italic">stet processus</hi> was entered—the sum total which the prisoner gives as his liabilities is 1,320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the furniture at Ambler's Road on which I advanced formed part of the assets, and passed to the different creditors—this is the prisoner's signature to his statement of affairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTOX</hi>. I have been well acquainted with lending on bills of sale for twelve years—I have forms of bills of sale and declarations regularly prepared and drawn up by the dozen, printed, which can be filled up with any name and amount—I have no doubt I said the same before the Magistrate that I have said here—I heard the case dismissed to the astonish<lb></lb>ment of everybody in Court—all the witnesses who are here to-day were not examined before the Magistrate—I cannot say how many were examined—my clerk was not examined—the prisoner when he asked me for the money was introduced by a Mr. Casey, not a friend or acquaintance of mine—he is a manager in a solicitor's office—I don't know that he is not a solicitor—I have known him for six or seven years—he was not in the habit of introducing people to me—he never introduced anybody to me before, he has been doing business during the six or seven years—I knew him by his being managing clerk to Messrs. Buchanan and Rogers, and I have come across him—I should have registered the bill of sale but for his being a clerk there—it was part of the under<lb></lb>standing that it should not be, and it was to be reniewed every twentyone days—the prisoner first asked me for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not ask for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—Mr. Casey was present when he came to apply for it, he was not acting for me—he saw the declaration and the bill of sale—I read them over and explained them thoroughly; I am in the habit of doing that—I found the furniture was unincumbered, and it would have been a sufficient security if the piano had not been on hire—I said before the Magistrate "The furniture after paying the Sheriff and the stock might, with care, have been sufficient to pay my debt;" which it might, with the security I then had—he did not say he wanted the money to pay pressing debts, but to pay the tradespeople engaged in finishing a house at Wood Green, because the lease would not be granted until the terms of the agreement had been complied with—I did not hear the Magistrate say that no jury would convict on the evidence—I was out of Court then; I gave the prisoner cheques for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him several small cheques—I cannot say whether the lease was in the possession of Casey—I did not ask him—he is clerk to the solicitors conducting this prosecution—the prisoner did not tell me that his pressing liabilities did not amount to more than 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I swear—I don't know what was asked before the Magistrate—the declaration of solvency was signed by the prisoner on the 29th May—my clerk Jones attested it—I cannot tell you the time of day it was signed—Casey had come the day before and said he would come the next day—the second bill of sale was signed in my office on the 29th May—I heard on the 11th June of the Sheriff taking possession for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my claim by interpleader issue was found on the second bill of sale, we went down to the Hertford Assizes to</p>

               <p>try the issue, but it was not tried—my clerk went down with me; I dare say to swear he saw the prisoner sign the bill of sale on the 29th—I went down to prove that I paid the money on the 7th May—I was not present when the bill of sale was signed on the 29th May, my clerk told me that he was—I saw Mr. Ribton down there in Court, and I was told that the bankruptcy resolution was rejected and Mr. Kemp advised us that if we went against the Sheriff we should lose against the trustee—I did hear before I withdrew from the action that several witnesses were in the town from Boston, to prove that the defendant was in Boston on the 29th and could not have signed the document on that day, and that if my clerk got into the box he would be indicted for perjury and I for suborna<lb></lb>tion—I think the debtor's solicitor said something of the kind; it was not on that account that I withdrew from the action—we instructed Counsel and paid the costs, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we could not get our costs—we were really fight<lb></lb>ing for the trustee—it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were perfectly good as against the Sheriff—there is a third bill of sale, dated about the 11th or 12th June—I did not say before I got the third bill of sale that I was in a very awkward position with Vere—I told you what I said—I said "What the dickens does this mean?"—I told the prisoner at one interview that he had made a false declaration, and he said he was very sorry that he had done it—I certainly did not say "I cannot be the loser, if I can't have a pocket of meal I will have a pocket of malt;" that is an invention—he did not say "I cannot help it, you yourself misled me by asking me what I wanted the money for, and also as to my pressing liabilities,"or" Why did not you ask me what I owed altogether if that is what you meant"—I got the third bill of sale for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner's place of business was somewhere in Jewin Street—I didn't go myself—the business was that of women's underclothing—my clerk valued it at 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was after I got the order from the Court of Bankruptcy—I received a summons two or three times, but did not attend—I had an order from the Bankruptcy Court not to sell the stock; I sold notwithstanding—I told Jones not to attend the summons—Casey in<lb></lb>troduced the prisoner to me—I did not hear Casey ask the prisoner to read the paper over or the prisoner say to Casey "Must I sign it?" or Casey say "Sign anything he wants you to, only 1 must not be present"—Casey is here—I did not ask the prisoner whether he could not get some goods on credit, so that I might seize them, I could not seize what was not in my bill of sale—I believe there is an erasure in the second bill of sale, the "27th" being altered to the "29th"—I do not know when that was done—the 29th would not be late—it does not matter so long as you renew before the Sheriff seizes—it is good against the Sheriff—I don't think I ever had an interpleader issue directed before; one case of false pretences before, three years ago, I stood in the dock myself fourteen or fifteen years ago, 1863, with Henry Feast, my brother; we were both charged in 1865 with conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences; I don't see that that has got anything to do with this—I have been fourteen years in Coleman Street—my brother and I pleaded guilty and were sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment—I was well aware this was going to be asked, it was held as a threat over me I have been ever since that in the same ward and the same parish of the City of London—since that I have not had even a County Court summons or anything against me, and it is hard to bring this against me and make me lose this money, my client's money—I have lost 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last few months, simply because when anything happens this question is to be asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170184"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not start in the money-lending business at all—I went to a gentle<lb></lb>man and learnt my business—my principal business is not lending money on bills of sale—I came back to London after the affair at Hertford—two months did not elapse before I summonsed the prisoner on this charge—I charged him before the Magistrate, I think, three days after the costs were taxed, perhaps a fortnight after the Hertford business, I think it was the 25th July—I got myself bound over to prosecute—the summons in bank<lb></lb>ruptcy was about a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> So far as I know, Buchanan and Rogers knew nothing of Casey introducing the prisoner to me—the pianoforte was included amongst the furniture at Ambler's Road in the first bill of sale, it was, in fact, some<lb></lb>body else's—there was no fee offered me to go to the Court of Bankruptcy—I was advised not to go.</p>

                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Francis Alcock—he is a builder, and lives in Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square-the prisoner was in his employ. On the 16th of Dec., about twelve o'clock in the day, I saw Mr. Alcock mark some lead which we found on a shelf under the stairs—we left it where we found it—I went out about two o'clock, and as I was coming back, I met the prisoner—I asked him where he was going to—he said for a pot of beer—I told him that was not the way they went for beer—I charged him with having the lead—I found it in his trowser's pocket—it was the lead my master had marked in my presence—this is it—it was in one piece when we marked it—it is in two now.</p>

               <p>How long have you known him? - About six or eight weeks; I have not lived in that place longer.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In a court there.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I have seen him at the horse trough watering his horses.</p>
               <p>What acquaintance had you with him? - None further than seeing him backwards and forwards and crying potatoes the corner of Carnaby Market; I have had no acquaintance with him at all.</p>
               <p>He did not say any thing when he laid hold of your shoulder? - No; he swore another oath when I called him by his name and told him who I was, and called me a bitch and went away.</p>

               <p>Did you stop at any public house, or at the door of any public house? - No; I did not; I had been at work, I go a charing at gentlemen's houses; I had been that day at Mr. Bull's at Carnaby Market.</p>
               <p>How came you to be out so late? - My mistress had somebody from the country she went out with, and therefore I could not finish the washing so soon or else I am never so late.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and live at Reading. On Saturday, 16th April, I was at Brentford, about 112 o'clock in the day—I was going from London to Reading—I had five half crowns, six shillings, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I met George Whitman, in Brentford—I had known him for four or five years—I said "Hallo, George, how long have you been in Brentford?" he said, "Eight or nine days"—I told him I was going down to Reading by the line, but I was a stranger and did not know the way—he said he had no money or else he would stand some beer—I took him info the Red Lion, and we had some beer there—we might be there about two hours or it might be a little more; I cannot say exactly—he said he would show me the way across to the station—I had no call to be in a hurry, I should be quite in time for the train—while I was in the Red Lion the other three prisoners came in, but I had but very little conversation with them—they were all in company—I should think it was about half past 5 o'clock when I left the Red Lion—I then went on and Whitman with me—he was going to show me to the station—we went on to another beer house, I do not know the name of it, we had same beer there; I paid for it—we then left that house and went to the Plough, at Little Ealing; all four of the prisoners were at the Plough—I cannot say how long I stopped there, it might be twenty minutes—I then said I would go to the station—Whitman said, "Don't be in a hurry, have another pot"—I did not, I went on—Whitman was with me, and the other three were behind us and another woman also—I went across one field, and the woman who is not taken put her hand into my jacket pocket and turned out some halfpence, they fell down, and she picked them up—I went on across the other field, and got over the third stilt—the prisoners all came over the stile close behind me, and when I had got about fifteen yards they pulled me down backward—I had a basket of tools on my back—I halloed murder—they all put their bands over my face to stop my mouth, and they squeezed me so hard that they made my nose bleed—they kneeled upon me and held me down, and took the money out of my pocket—when they had taken my money, Whitman said, "Oh, d—let's share it," and they all ran back the same way they came—Stuckey was not in the robbery—she did not come over the stile at all—there were the three prisoners, and the other woman that has not been taken-Stuckey was not one of the four—I afterwards showed the stile to the policeman, and there was the prints of their toes where they had kneeled down upon me.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 16th April, I went into Collins's beer shop, in Ealing-lane—the prosecutor came in there with Whitman and another stonemason, not either of the prisoners—the prosecutor pulled some half crowns and shillings out of his pocket to pay for a pot of beer—he pulled them all out together in a lump, like a drunken man—I was afterwards in Ealing-lane, about half past 4 o'clock, and saw the prosecutor there, standing between the doorposts of the New Inn—I saw Wheatley and Whitman standing with him—Whitman was pulling things out of his own pocket, and he had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of halfpence in his hand—the prosecutor said that Whitman had got another penny that he had given him, and he said he had not—I stood looking, and Wheatley said to the prosecutor, "There is a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that wants a penny;" and he answered, "Let him go and pawn his watch if he wants a penny"—I turned to go down the lane, and saw Davis and three young women standing together—I did not see them in company with the prosecutor at all—one of them said, "Let one of us go down to him first;" and then I walked on—Stuckey was one of the women—Davis was near enough to hear what they said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live at Ealing—on Saturday, 16th April, about halt-past 5 I was standing just against the first stile that leads across the fields to Hanwell, and saw the prosecutor and two men leading him by the arms, and a female walking close behind them—about 100 yards further on I met Davis and two females in his company—I had known him previously—he spoke to me—I went into a house, and returned in about five minutes; they were then all going across the fields towards Cut-throat-lane—you can go that way to the station.</p>

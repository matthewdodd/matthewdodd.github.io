On 21st April last, the prosecutor, Joseph Tinnuci, was brought to the hospital—I examined him—his face was much swollen, and very badly bruised—there were bruises round the left eye—the left eye was also badly bloodshot—there were contused wounds on the left cheek, nose, and lower lip—he remained in the hospital till 28th April, when he was discharged—I am not able to state the depth of the wound on the nose—it was partially healed when I saw it—it was about three quarters of an inch long—from the nature of the wounds they were inflicted with some blunt instrument, not a cutting instrument—they were not dangerous, with care—without care they might have been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a moulder, employed at the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham. I remember leaving the Crystal Palace on Tuesday, 25th April, it was about 7 o'clock—I came out of the gate near Sydenham, near the pump—when I got to the visitor's gate, I saw Giardelli and Bianchi—Bianchi said to me, "How do you do, it is a very long time since I have seen you?"—I said, "What brought you up here?"—he said, "I came up for a <hi rend="italic">spree"</hi>—Giardelli was with him then—I said, "It is too late for you to come for a <hi rend="italic">spree"</hi>—we had a pot of beer at the White Swan—there were four of us that drank the beer—one was Giardelli—we had nothing more than that pot of beer in the White Swan—when we came out of the White Swan, we went towards another public house lower down—we had some beer to drink at the second house—I do not know how much—I did not taste it—I was quite sober—after we left the second house, I did not observe anything in Giardelli's manner that attracted my attention—he was very steady at that time—we went towards the Annerley station—that is where I lodge—it is the next station towards Croydon, from Sydenham—when I passed the Victoria Hotel, Giardelli began to skip about, and began to ask me for my son—I said he was gone home to have his supper—it was past 9 o'clock, and it was very dark—Giardelli left my</p>

               <p>arm—he threw me down—I am quite satisfied he was the man that threw me down—Bianchi put his knee on my stomach, against my side—just before Giardelli threw me down, there was nothing said by him to me—Bianchi said to me, "I have got something to tell you"—I says, "What is it?"—he <hi rend="italic">says</hi>, "Don't you think you should be ashamed of yourself to treat a man in the manner you have Mancarini?"—I <hi rend="italic">says</hi>, "I have not," and the answer he gave to me was, "We have come from London to serve you out; you b—y b—r, your life is in my hands this night"—those words were used by Bianchi—it was directly after those words were used by Bianchi that Giardelli threw me down—I was not aware of it—Giardelli did not say anything to me, only about my son—he was wanting my son—he did not say anything to me personally—I cried out, when Giardelli <hi rend="italic">says</hi> to Bianchi, after he hit me, "Rip up the b—r, and have done with him"—they inflicted injuries upon me, all over my face and my head—they knocked two teeth out of my mouth, and cut me in several places (<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>)—he kicked me with his boots, and hit me with his fist—Bianchi inflicted these injuries on my face—Giardelli was behind me at the time the injuries were inflicted—I cried out—two men came to my assistance, and took me to the Rising Sun—I washed my face there—I had six handkerchiefs full of blood, and my clothes were covered with blood—I went to a doctor in Norwood, and he could do nothing to me—he strapped my nose up, and told me to go to London as quick as possible to the hospital—I went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and there I saw Dr. Cullender—I was under his care eight days—I did not see Mancarini there that night—I knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son, and work with him at the Crystal Palace. I remember, on the evening of 20th April, leaving the Crystal Palace—I left about five minutes before my father—on reaching the gate I saw Bianchi and Giardelli—they were against the door of the entrance—they both shook hands with me, and wanted me to go and drink with them—I said, no, I had the key of the room, and had to go and get my father's supper—I was living at Annerley—I did not have beer with them—I know Mancarini; before that day I had a quarrel with him.</p>

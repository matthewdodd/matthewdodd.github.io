I am a bullion merchant of 83, Minories—the prisoners are strangers to me—on 26th March, about 3 o'clock, they came and offered three silver watches, and a gold chain for sale—I tested the chain with aquafortis, and found it was gold—I only offered them 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, though it was worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as their behaviour looked so suspicious—I told them they had better take the watches to a jeweller, as I only bought the cases—they said, "Never mind the chain, we have a lot of chains and jewellery, will you buy about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth?"—Alderman took me on one side, and said, "We very often have lots of gold and silver, but you must not mind where we get them from; you must melt them down directly"—Priestley heard that—I answered, "Bring them here, I shall buy them"—my clerk was present, and heard it—while I was testing the chain, Priestley said, "Will you allow me your bottle of aquafortis, I want to try a ring"—I lent it to him, and saw him handle the bottle, but did not see what he was doing—after I weighed the chain, he put the bottle on the counter again—they left, saying that they would come back—they returned in about an hour—I was alone—Priestley said, "We have brought the jewellery we talked about before," and put on the counter a brown paper parcel, containing fourteen</p>

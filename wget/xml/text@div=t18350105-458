                  </hi>. I live in Henrietta-street, Vinegar-ground, and am a lunge-maker. On the afternoon of the 26th of December, I heard a female crying out—I ran to her assistance, but before I could get to her, I was knocked down, and received several kicks—I was taken away by several females, and after I had been in some time, Mrs. Davenham came in and said she had saved the watch—I did not know I had lost it till she brought it in—it was my watch—I had it when I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same street as the witness—my husband is a brush-maker. On the 26th of December, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and his two brothers—they came up to me and knocked down two little children—I asked them why they were not more careful of knocking children down—the prisoner came up, and struck me imme<lb></lb>diately</p>

               <p>—Mr. Smith came to my assistance, and they knocked him down—when he got up, one of the prisoner's brothers took the chain of his watch and twisted it round his finger—I ran over at the same time, and said if he meant that, he should not have it—I got it from him—I cannot say what the prisoner was doing at that time—he was behind somewhere—it was his second brother had the watch—the prisoner had joined in striking Smith two or three times before—I cannot say whether he did so then—he knocked me down first—it was not him who attempted to take the watch—he was close behind Smith.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are shopman to Mr. Hind, your brother? - A. Yes, he lives at No. 134, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, did you see them there on the 12th of March? - A. At half after one they both came into the shop to buy a brass footman; it had iron legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what they asked for at first? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you shew them the articles? - A. I did, the price was four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the women was it that particularly spoke for the article? - A. The person that called herself Evans; the one that goes by the name of Whiley.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the woman that has the child in her arms? - A. Yes, they bought the footman, and offered a one-pound note; I had not sufficient change for it; I went to get change, when I returned I suspected the note; I sent for Mr. Tare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come into the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate any thing to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after that when Tare was with you? - A. He thought it was a bad one; they said they did not know it, and offered another, a good one, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the first note? - A. Mr. Tare had it his possession.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did both of them say they did not know it was a bad note, or only one of them? - A. I believe both of them expressed their surprise; but one of them I know said they did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the other note? - A. Yes, that was a good one; Mr. Tare had the possession of the other; I delivered the bad note to him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110044"></xptr>Q. You received the other note; did you give change for that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Tare do with the women. - A. He told them they must go with him to the Bank; I asked Evans for her address; she at first refused to give her address; she said she would call the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she afterwards give you any address? - A. Yes, Mrs. Evans, No. 7, Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Tare had possession of the note, and went to the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. These two women came together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They asked for a brass footman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mrs. Whiley is the person who gave the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this moment you are quite sure she is the person that gave you the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not quite sure of the person that said they did not know it was a bad one? - A. No, I am not, but both expressed their surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was a bad one? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you asked them any thing about their address? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then intimating it was a bad one, she gave her name, her description that you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But at first both expressed their surprise of its being a bad one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I understood you to have said that Evans, who is proved to be the name of Whiley, expressed her surprise? - A. They both expressed their surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this footman at the door or in the shop, so as passengers could see it? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was a thing that a stranger might observe passing? - A. I believe it was behind a stove; they asked at first whether we sold footmen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Was it or was it not exposed out of the shop? - A. It was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you find any account of Mrs. Foss? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you there find any account of Mrs. Haynes? - A. No, positively none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Whiley say any thing more in the course of her conversation? - A. Nothing more particular than she did not like to be searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look at that paper (the note handed to the witness); is the paper any thing corresponding with the Bank paper? - A. It is not the Bank paper; nor is it in the hand-writing of any person there; it is all forged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whiley gave an exact account? - A. Yes, she said she lived in Change-court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You are an inspector of Banknotes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been an examination before? - A. Yes, about an hour or half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go like the good Samaritan? - A. I went to be convinced as to their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to go into conversation with them? - A. I thought I had, because they had given a false address before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for a double purpose, for conversation as well as to their persons; did you say any thing that you would befriend them? - A. Nothing of the kind; I believed they had got some forged notes about them, and my object was to see them searched; they had been very loosely taken care of before.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I understood they were to be kept separate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in company with them they were in prison? - A. Yes, they were both standing together.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear they were kept loose? - A. They were standing together; I desired them to be kept separate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not go and put these questions, in order that you might be enabled to give the result upon this prosecution? - A. If I was called upon I meant to state the facts no doubt, I went strictly to see the parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you expect to be called upon? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did you not expect they were ordered to be kept separate? - A. I did, and when I came there they were both standing together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you serve them with it? - A. No; I told them I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. What said they? - A. They asked me to let them taste the best Cambridge salt butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they offer to purchase any of that? - A. I let them taste that, and they asked for three pounds first, and then afterwards they asked for six pounds, at sixteen pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did that amount to, at sixteen pence a pound? - A. The butter they had amounted to eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they purchase any thing else then? - A. Yes, two shillings worth of eggs, they had ten shillings to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do towards paying you? - A. They gave me a two-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that two-pound note? - A. That lady with a child in her arms, Whiley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at that note? - A. Yes, I told them it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say? - A. They seemed rather alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not own to it? - A. I presented it back to them; they neither of them took it up; I took it up from the counter; I asked them where they lived; I agreed to take the note upon these terms, if they would tell me where they lived.</p>
               <p>Q Did they, either of them, tell you their names? - A. Yes, that lady with the child in her arms, Whiley. (The note handed to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that note - what address did Whiley give you? - A. She gave me the name of Evans, and said she lived at No. 19, Charterhouse-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that street near you? - A. It is not far off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Whiley gave you her address, and the name of Evans, what did the other person say? - A. The other person said, what use is that direction to you; if she wished to give you a bad note, do you think she would give you a right direction? I said, suppose she does not, if I should meet you in the street, how foolish you would look in the street with a false direction; I took the note, and gave them their change, and they took the butter and eggs.</p>

               <p>Q. You are quite sure these are the women? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This is a long while ago - when was it? - A. On the 13th of February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long was it before you found it was a bad note? - A. On the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. You put them altogether, did not you? - A. I had marked it on the back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Had you written Evans on all the other notes? - A. No.</p>

            , by profession a Quaker, of Broad-street, Bloomsbury, a grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember these two persons? - A. I remember on the 28th of February I was called by my husband to come and assist in the shop; he had a note in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two persons in the shop at the same time? - A. They were; my husband said he was afraid it was a bad note, and he would step into Mr. Rider's, his next door neighbour, and ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into Mr. Rider's? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return? - A. Almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between your husband and the prisoners? - A. When he came in, he addressed himself to the prisoners, and said it was a bad one, and Mr. Rider came in with him, and he said he would swear it was a bad one; Mr. Corder said he could not think of giving up the note without they would bring any body to satisfy him how they came by it, and then they should have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Rider making any observation about that? - A. Mr. Rider said, he ought to detain them also; my husband asked them where they got it; Mrs. Whiley, (I do not recollect the other said any thing,) said, she took it in exchange for a ten-pound note in Swallow-street; she said, of a man that sold pork in the street; I do not recollect any thing further; they gave a good two-pound note, and took the change; they took the articles they had purchased, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they mention where they lived? - A. Mr. Corder asked where they lived when they were going out; they said No. 3, Charlton-place, Charlton-street, Sommer's Town, and that their names were Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that answer given by Whiley? - A. I think it was; I do not recollect the other saying any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever come again? - A. I never saw them any more till I saw them in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them, then you knew them? - A. I knew them directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what accident happened at your house that day? - A. I believe my husband cut his finger, I did not see it, but I observed it bleeding, and I observed some blood upon the note; I had it in my possession till the next day; (the note shewn the witness.) That is the same note that I had; I wrote my name upon the back, February 29,

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember your next door neighbour coming in, and asking your opinion of a note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him to the shop? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the two prisoners there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry with him the note upon which he asked your opinion? - A. He did; he told them that he had every reason to believe it was a forged note, and he had that note in his hand; he told them that he could not give that note up, that his neighbour told him it was a bad one; he asked them if they had any money to pay for the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon his saying he could not give the note up? - A. I told them I thought he ought to detain the persons; I have no doubt but they heard it; they gave him a good two-pound note, and he gave them the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corder make any proposal about calling the next day to bring some reputable person to say where they had the note from, and then he would give it to them again? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this is the good one that was given in the place of the other? (The note shewn the witness.) A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Corder make that memorandum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the address? - A. Yes, it was by my desire; Evans, No. 3, Charlton-place, Charlton-street, Sommer's Town.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Mrs. Whiley? - A. Yes, he wrote it down on the counter upon a slip of paper; I took it, and have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Corder.) When your husband went to Mr. Rider's, did he take any more notes than the bad one? - A. I do not recollect that he took any other.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back, he had the same one? - A. He had.</p>

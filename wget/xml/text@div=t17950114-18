               <p>Mr. Bramwell sent for me on the 1st of November, to take the prisoner into custody for stealing the funnel; I took her to Marlborough-street office, and I locked her up till Mr. Bramwell came, and after Mr. Bramwell came she dropped a pint pot there, from under her petticoat; and after that I took her before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of a funnel? - Yes, the funnell was put into my care, Mr. Bramwell found the funnel on her.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bramwell. What was the reason for sending for the constable? - Because I detected the funnel on her. I <rs id="t17950114-18-viclabel109" type="occupation">keep a public house</rs>

               <p>Q. Had she been employed about your house? - Occasionally, to go of an errand or so, for these six or seven years past; there was a black man that used to black shoes at the door, and she passed for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to suspect any thing? - I see the funnel under her cloak as she was going out of my house, I was just coming to the door as she got out; I see a large bulge, and I suspected, and I lifted up her cloak, and found the funnel just under her cloak; I know it by its general appearance, I have had it about five or six or seven years; as to the pot I know it to be mine, because it has my name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the effects last, before they were missing? - My wife was saying before this woman, that she had lost a dozen pots this week, and this woman made a reply, and said, I wish their hands might drop off who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this pot before? - I cannot say, they are in general use about the house.</p>

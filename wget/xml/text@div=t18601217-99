I am shopman to Mr. Merson—I recollect seeing the prisoner on the night of the 30th—I went out to follow him—the moment he left the shop I was at the door—when I got out of the shop he was running past the shop—he kept on till he came to the second turning on the right—I followed him about an hour till I met the constable—when he came to different turnings he ran down them, and ran back some of them, and went down courts and alleys; some were very narrow streets—I turned round and said, "How much farther are you going before you change that two-shilling piece?"—he turned round and said, "I suppose you think I am a bad customer; you think I am a passer of bad money; I can show you their I am a sober, industrious, honest, hard-working man"—he said he got this florin in change in Oxford-street—he went at last into the "Lord Duncan" public-house, at the Broadway, London-field—that is, I should say, from two to two and a half miles from our shop—all this time I had not seen a policeman—I did not know where I was, for I was a quite a stranger about there—there was a constable just opposite the public-house he went into—I told the constable what had passed, and he took him—the prisoner did not go into an oil shop at all when I was with him.</p>

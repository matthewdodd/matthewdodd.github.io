On the 17th of October the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a half quartern loaf, which came to fourpence-halfpenny, and offered me a bad half-crown; I asked where he got it - he said he got it in change in the street - I asked him to show me the place; he declined and said he was afraid, he could not find the person, but if he did he would bring him forward - I kept the half-crown piece, he came again in the evening, with another person, and requested to see the half-crown piece - I declined showing it; the person said he had paid it to him for work done the previous night - I saw that person afterwards in custody at Guildhall, for being in company with the prisoner, and passing another bad half-crown; I gave Herdsfield the half-crown piece.</p>

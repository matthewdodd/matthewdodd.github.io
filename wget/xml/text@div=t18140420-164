On the 20th of March, two men and two women came into my shop; the prisoner was one of them. They bought two herrings, a twopenny loaf, and two ounces of cheese. They returned in about a minute or two, and asked me to change the twopenny loaf. I changed it for them. They went out again. I was shutting up my shop; the prisoner and the woman came in again; they said they wanted some more herrings. They opened the lattice partition that is put up to keep people's hands out of the window. There was some soap behind the lattice partition; they seemed to be choosing herrings; I watched them. I saw the prisoner actually take a cake of soap. I saw him pass it by the lattice partition, and gave it to another man behind the door post. I instantly ran from behind the counter, and seized the prisoner, and in my scuffling with him he scuffled towards the door. The woman assisted in pushing me towards the door. We got on the pavement. I called the watch. He sprang from me. I lost my hat. In about four or five minutes he was stopped. I was informed that they had found the prisoner, and there was a cake of soap found.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming into Playhouse-yard, crying the hour of one. I saw the prisoner walking without a hat. I heard the call of stop thief; the prisoner asked me what was the matter; I told him I would go and see. I took him with me. Some people passing told me what had happened. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and when I was taking him to Worship-street office he said, what a foolish man you are to lose so much time, if you would have let me gone either he or his friends would have brought me a crown. I said, it gave me more satisfaction to take such a man as him than two crowns.</p>

On Saturday night, the 29th of January, I shut the house up secure; I shut the windows - it was perfectly safe. I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and got up a little after seven in the morning. I opened the parlour door, and saw the papers laying about the room, on the table and the floor; there was a candle on the bar of the fire-grate, which was in the candlestick the over night - candle-grease was dropped on the papers and on the sideboard; a small drawer full of papers, in the sideboard, was broken open - the cellaret was also broken open. There was a round hole in the small drawer, which had been scooped out, and the cellaret-drawer was broken in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the plate - A. The four salts were in a drawer above the cellaret, which was not locked; a silver sugar-bason and tongs were taken from a cupboard in the cellaret, which was not locked; a pair of plated candlesticks, and a bed-side candlestick were taken off the table; a pair of decanters, two stoppers of other decanters, a table-cloth, and a small and large pair of snuffers - also a small taper-stand off the chimney-piece. I went and called my master up.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the thieves entered the room - A. A square hole had been cut in the outside shutter that contained two small bolts, which fastened the sash - they were forced. The window was not broken; every thing was safe the night before - it was getting light when I arose. I was about a quarter of an hour coming down stairs. It must have taken some time to force all these places.</p>

            , ESQ. I rent the house, which is in the parish of Fulham. The servant called me up, upon which I immediately went down, and found every thing in confusion in the parlour; I was the last person there the night before, except the servant - the drawers were locked, and all things safe and in order. In the morning the papers were all scattered about - I missed the articles stated in the inditment - sixteen or eighteen holes were cut in the shutter by a centre-bit, and all broken out into a square hole. A candle was left on the grate, which appeared to have been burnt, from the quantity of grease that was laying about the grate, and my papers were covered with grease - I gave information to Pople. I have since seen a pair of steel snuffers, on the Monday, which I knew to be mine - they were in a drawer of the sideboard over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Pople apply the centre-bit to the holes in the shutter - A. Yes; it did not fit them - it was applied to the holes in the drawer of the sideboard, but did not fit. A crow-bar was produced, which exactly fitted the holes in the sideboard - it was of a particular shape, and fitted the impression exactly. To the impression of different parts of the drawer and the window, a chisel was also applied, but I cannot speak to that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Sunday morning the 30th of January, Mr. Wyllie applied to me. I went to his house, and examined it. The window-shutter was bored with a centre-bit, and the piece broken out, sufficiently to let a hand in to undo the bolt; I suppose twelve or fourteen holes were bored in it - it would take two or three minutes to do it. After the shutter was opened the sash was forced up by some instrument, apparently by a crow-bar, and the fastening broken. I examined the sideboard in the parlour, and in the middle drawer there was a hole made with a centre-bit, so as to get the bolt of the lock back, and two other drawers appeared to be forced open with a crowbar. I found a piece of printed paper in the room which smelt very strong of tinder, and on this paper was printed</p>

               <p>Q. Was the breaking effected by clumsy thieves or not - A. By old thieves, in my judgment. The same afternoon I received information, went to the Bell, public-house, Old Pye-street, Westminster, with

I knew them to be his lodgings by having frequently been there to him - it is the first room on the right-hand side of the ground floor. The following day I was not satisfied with my brother's search, went there myself, and in the table-drawer of the room I found a centre-bit, and in the cupboard I found a tobacco-box full of tinder.

I searched, and found a pair of steel snuffers there, hanging on a nail in the room - a girl whom he cohabited with was there; I am confident they were not in sight when I was there the night before - the prosecutor claimed them. An iron chisel was found there; my brother afterwards produced a crow-bar to me. I went to the house, and compared the centre-bit with the marks on the shutter and sideboard, but they were rather larger than the instrument. The crow-bar fitted as exactly as possible with the marks on the cellaret.</p>

            . I look after the Fulham stages. On Saturday night, the 29th of January, I was at the Bull, Stamford Bridge, and saw the prisoners there, about half-past nine, or a quarter before ten o'clock. I knew them quite well before. I called for a pint of porter - they asked me to drink with them; I did so, and put my pint to their pot. They then said they were going on a crack, and shewed me a chisel and a crow-bar, like those produced. I noticed it being broken at the end - it is the same. I noticed one corner of the chisel being broken, and so is this; they both produced them, each produced one from their persons. I went away, heard of the robbery next day, and on Monday morning I told Mr. Wyllie what I knew.</p>

               <p>Q. What makes you certain of it - A. There was a poor man, who was discharged from the Guards, came in with pies to sell about a quarter before nine o'clock, and a person for mischief knocked his tins over, and about sixpenny worth of his pies were thrown down. There was a subscription to defray the expence, and the prisoner, George, subscribed. I think Mitcham was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How should you know Bird was there any more than Mitcham - A. It was partly the prisoner's fault that the pies were kicked down. I was very much displeased at it, and spoke crossly to Bird about it.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mitcham was there he must have heard it - Yes. I spoke very high. The prisoner subscribed 2 d. The poor man comes in every night. I did not mention this to him. I can prove nothing more than up to nine o'clock, for I had company in the parlour, and particularly attended to them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you shut up - A. A little before twelve o'clock. I do not know when Huish went away. Several men were in company with Bird; one was named Hall.

             - A. Not long; no further than dealing with him. I was there at five, seven, nine, and eleven o'clock. I heard some talk about the pieman. Mitcham and the landlord were at the table with Bird - I believe he was drinking with him. I am nearly positive he was there at eleven o'clock when I left. Mitcham and the painter was also there. I think the landlord was drinking with them at eleven o'clock. He was in the taproom every time I went.</p>

             used to come backwards and forwards - it was not his lodgings. The snuffers were found in my room, they are mine; they were given to me two years ago this April, by a young man named Cooper, who is gone out of the country. I always kept them hung on a nail in the room, and never used them - they are plain steel snuffers, about six inches long. I am an unfortunate girl.</p>

I cannot swear to the prisoners, but I firmly believe them to be two of the three persons who were there in company. I was not there above two or three minutes after they came in.</p>

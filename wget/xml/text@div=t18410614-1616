                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in North-street, Pop<lb></lb>lar. I met the prisoner in High-street, Shadwell, on the morning of the 2nd of June—I had four half-crowns, a half-sovereign, and a few halfpence in my pocket—I went to a house with her, and gave her something—my money was safe when I came out, in a purse in my waistcoat pocket—she asked me, outside the house, for a pint of beer—I went to a public-house with her, and, coming out, she met a man outside—he treated her to a pot of beer—she persuaded me to go with them—I took a drink out of the pot, and came out again—I had my money safe as I came out—she fol<lb></lb>lowed me out, and clapped her hand under my arm at the side on which my purse was—she pulled her hand back—I clapped my hand in my pocket, and my money was gone—she ran away.</p>

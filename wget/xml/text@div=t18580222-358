                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Olave's Union. I knew the deceased, Christopher Wright, he was an inmate and the prisoner also—on Saturday, 6th Feb., I was with them in the old man's hall, and a quarrel took place between them; it began by the prisoner calling the deceased <hi rend="italic">Yorkey</hi>, and jeering him; the deceased threatened to punch his head if he did not desist; the prisoner kept on, and the deceased got up and struck him once with the flat of his hand; there was a little bit of a scuffle, but I did not see the prisoner return the blow, he ran away laughing; in fact it was at that time all play on the part of the prisoner—the deceased returned, and kept <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> and jeering about the county he belonged to, and about Yorkshire pudding—the deceased got up and struck the prisoner a blow in the face, and the prisoner returned it with his fist that time, and on the left side of the cheek—there were one or two blows, and they closed almost immediately; the deceased fell underneath, and the prisoner on top of him—the deceased fell flat on his back, being paralyzed with his left arm; he was about 48 or 49 years old—a man named Kane, who was in charge of the room, pulled the prisoner off, and Wright was picked up and put on a form, and they asked him whether he was hurt much, he made no reply—as they went out to supper I saw the prisoner and Wright shaking hands—I went in with them to supper, and when we had been at supper some little time, Wright was taken in a fit—I told one of the men to untie his handkerchief; he was taken into the receiving ward, and the doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Olaves Workhouse. I was present at the scuffle between the prisoner and the deceased—there was first some joking and teasing on the part of the prisoner towards Wright; the prisoner said "Well, <hi rend="italic">Yorkey</hi>, how goes it now?"—he said, "Ax my a"; call me that again, and I will come round and hit you"—the prisoner said "You had better try"—Wright got up, went round and struck the prisoner with his open hand, and the prisoner ran away laughing—a minute or two after that the prisoner went round and said "Well, <hi rend="italic">Yorkey</hi>, what do you think of the Yorkshire pudding?"—Wright got up directly and struck the prisoner with his fist, they both closed, and the deceased struck him—they fell, and Wright was undermost—not more than three or four blows on each side were struck before they fell—a</p>

               <p>blow on each side, that was all, and they closed and fell—I ran and took the prisoner off the deceased, took him to the door and was going to tell the master, but the bell rung, and when I went into the hall I told the master—when the prisoner got to the door he said "If you have not had enough come outside and you shall have some more"—he said it jokingly, because I said "What are you about?"—I told the master and he told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself to strike a poor paralyzed man—he said it is only play Sir—the master said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, I will send you somewhere else"—it was all fun from the first to the last of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the blow in the face in play? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I must draw in there; it might have been in earnest then on the deceased's part, but I do not believe it was on the prisoner's part—I saw a mark on the deceased's face, and said, "Wright, why you have got a black eye," and before they went to supper they shook hands together—while they were at supper the deceased went off in a faint, and never recovered from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, and surgeon to the St. Olave's Union. I was sent for on 6th Feb. to see Wright, and found him insensible and suffering from compression of the brain; he remained insensible till his death, on the 11th; I was quite unable to rouse him from it—I after<lb></lb>wards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of his body; I found a large quantity of blood extravasated on the right side of the brain, which, in my opinion, was the cause of death; I found nothing else to account for death—I have not the least doubt that the brain had been in a state of disease for some time from it's appearance, but that was not a state likely to lead to sudden death without external causes; I have heard the evidence, and am of opinion that the violence used would lead to that extravasation of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What violence do you refer to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The fall; the blow on the left cheek would not be sufficient to produce it, but the fall occasioned by the blow, and the prisoner falling on him—the extravasated state could not have proceeded from the diseased brain without external violence.</p>

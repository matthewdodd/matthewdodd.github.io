On the 23d of December, at ten o'clock at night, I overtook the prisoner, Frampton, at Wilderness-row, St. John-street. I got into conversation with him; I walked all the way with him, to the top of St. John-street; he said, he was going to Islington; I was going the same road, between <placeName id="t18170115-66-crimeloc343">Ashby-str</placeName>

I was met by the prisoner, Barton, who instantly struck me over the left eye with a stick, and knocked me down in the kennel and stunned me; the first returning sensation that I felt was a difficulty of breathing; I found the prisoner, Barton, was kneeling on my breast - He had his hands over my mouth and nose; I struggled hard to liberate myself; he pointed a stick between my nose and mouth, and said, if I moved an inch he would blow my brains out. Frampton was turning my pockets inside out. Barton asked him, if he had drawn all out. Barton then struck me on the nose, and left me again insensible; when I came to, I felt the water flow on my neck. I got up to pursue them, with the assistance of the watchman, from St. John-street to Goswell-street, without effect. I went home. I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment. I lost the handkerchief off my neck, and I am sure, Frampton is the man who ritled my pockets. I am also sure, Barton was the other man. I looked particularly in his face, when I was in the kennel; he was between me and the lamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. It was dark, but the shops were open; I must have passed one hundred shops with Frampton; I told him, I was going to the City-road; he did not frighten me; he is a little man. - Q. Do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150030"></xptr>you mean to say, that sixteen days after the transaction, you would know him again? - A. I pointed them out myself. The prisoner, Frampton, was sitting by the fire; and in order to convince myself that he was the man, I turned upon him and he drew his hat over his face, and left the room, his partner was there. I did not see the police officer till I had seen the men; I can swear to them positively.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I live in Clarke-street, Sutton-street, Goswell-street. I went to No. 53, Vineyard-street, Islington. On the 23d of December, I was in company with Frampton at the Angel, at the corner of George-street, Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. How do you know that it was the 23d of December? - A. Because the next day being Christmas-eve, made me remember it. I went to the Angel at a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening; Frampton came at half-past; he was on the other side of the room all the evening; he was not absent more than five minutes; I continued there till eleven o'clock at night; I am sure he was there till eleven o'clock, except for two or three minutes; he was drinking by himself on the other side of the room. I have used the Angel, this five years; it is in my neighbourhood. Frampton usually came in, at a little after eight o'clock; he was apprehended at this house; I should suppose he was there, four or five times a week; I go there every night. I am a single man. I get from 1l. 10s. to 1l. 15s. per week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you are there every night, how can you swear to the 23d of December. A. I had to get up the next morning very early, to do some particular work; and my brother came to fetch me that evening.</p>

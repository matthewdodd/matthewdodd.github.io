                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Charles and Michael Samuel, of Ludgate-hill. On 2nd Jan., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was employed to take a suit of clothes to Mr. Hall—I rang the bell at the door, a woman came, and I gave her the clothes—my master had ordered me not to deliver them without cash—the woman took them up-stairs, and brought this note down—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Mr. Hall, 5, Poultry, City. Pay the bearer 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for clothes)—I said it would not do, I must either have the clothes or money (that was the first time I had intimated that)—she said his father always paid for his clothes, and he was not of age; and if I were to be in the Poultry by eight, I could get the money—that did not satisfy me, and I said I would take the clothes to his father's, and if he paid, I would bring them back—the prisoner came down dressed in the clothes, but I did not know them, as I had not seen them—I said to him, "I must have the clothes or the money back"—he said, "You will have neither the clothes nor the money; you, nor no one else; if you will be at my father's before eight o'clock, you will have the money," and if I did not get the money in the Poultry, I was to go to a tripe-warehouse, 130, Bishopsgate-street—I went with him there—he said his father was not in the way to speak to him—we then both went to my master, at Ludgate-hill—he stayed outside—I went in and told Mr. Samuels.</p>

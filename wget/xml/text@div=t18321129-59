I left town with my family about the end of May; the prisoner was in my service: I did not then know that she was married - she was with me about two years; I had occasionally come backwards and forwards to town, and my family returned to town on the 27th of October; while I was in the country I received information, and wrote to the prisoner, desiring that she would leave on my return, and on the 27th of October she left - I almost immediately missed some articles from the house; I obtained a warrant, and appointed for the prisoner to be at my chambers to receive her board wages, and any items due to her - she came there, and I asked her what could induce her to marry without letting me know of it, when she might be quite certain that if her husband was a man of good character, I should have been happy to have had the protection of a man sleeping in my house at night - she said she knew she had done wrong, and repented it as much as I could; I appointed for herto come again, and went to my chambers with an officer - she came there, and I said as she was now married, and in possession of a house, what would she think of leaving an individual in charge of that house, and to find that every bed in it, had been robbed of feathers to make one for themselves - she said, "You don't suppose that I have done that;" I said, "That is not the question, what would you do to such a person;" she said, "I should imprison them" - I said, "That is your case, you have stripped every bed in my house; this is the officer, and you will accompany us to your house to search:" we went there in a hackney-coach - in going along I asked her where she got the feathers of which she had made a new bed; she said she bought them of a woman in Wardour-street, in July - I asked what she knew of the person; she said nothing, but that in passing Wardour-street, she met a woman carrying a bed to a pawnbroker's, and that she purchased it; when we got to the house we found the things stated in the indictment, and I believe some more: I asked how she came to take them - she said she really did not know, and that she was the only person who was guilty of the feathers; I asked her how she came to do it - she said from having heard of it, and that other servants did it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe she had conducted herself well? A. Up to the time of my leaving town; I placed unlimited confidence in her - I heard she was married the Sunday after I left town; I searched her house again on a subsequent day, and found some other things which were not taken before, though they were there - I have indicted the husband separately; I believe some of the articles in this indictment are in the indictment against him - there were a quarter's wages due to her, and some board wages; there may be 13l. due to her.</p>

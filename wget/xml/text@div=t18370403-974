                  </hi>. I live in Hall-street, St. Luke's. My wife, who is a brush-maker, employed the prisoner for three days—I saw one of these spoons on Saturday night, and the other on the Thursday, at tea time—I missed them on the Sunday morning—the prisoner had left us on Saturday evening, about six or seven o'clock—I suspected her, and went to the address she gave, which was false—I got her right address at last—she was denied being at home by a younger sister, but I said I wanted her to do some work the next morning, and then the prisoner came up from the kitchen—I said, "I suppose you know what I come about"—she said, "No, I don't; I am innocent"—I had not then said what it was—I said, "Give me the ticket"—she said she had none; she had sold them—I sent for an officer, and took her.</p>

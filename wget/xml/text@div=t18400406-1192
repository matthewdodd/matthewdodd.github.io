                  </hi>. I live with my father, who is a bricklayer, in Brunswick-street, Battle-bridge. On the night of the 7th of September the prisoner came and asked my father to give him a lodging—ray father said he should sleep there—I had only known him by seeing him sell things about the street—he went to bed before me, and slept in my bed—when I went to bed I had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a twopenny-piece in my fob pocket—I put my trowsers under my head—next morning my father awoke me about a quarter-past five o'clock—the prisoner was then gone—I found my trowsers in the middle of the room, and my money was gone—I never saw him again till eight or nine weeks ago, when I saw him in Skinner-street with a box on his head—I said, "You are the boy who took my money away"—he said, "Go on you fool"—he then said, "I am the boy that took your money, did not I?"—I then said "No," because I was afraid he would hit me, but he is the boy that took it—he afterwards said he would pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week.</p>

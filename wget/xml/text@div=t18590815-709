                  </hi>. I am a picture dealer at 29a, Jewin-street—I know the prisoner—he has been in the habit of coming to my shop—about a month ago I missed this oil painting and some books from the shop—the prisoner had no right to take them—a boy about 11 years old was in charge of the shop door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Pratt, of 93, Cloth-fair—I buy old clothes and other things—the prisoner brought this picture and offered it for sale for a shilling, as the value of the frame—he said it was a portrait of his sister—I bought it—I afterwards took it to Mr. Ibbett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor has known me about 20 years; he knows that I am a man of strict honour and integrity: a small quantity of spirits affects my head. He has behaved very kindly to me and induced me some time ago to take the pledge, which I kept for 16 months. In an evil hour I broke it, and this is the fruit of it. When I possessed myself of the picture it was with no felonious intent; it was done under the insanity of drink. The case would have ended at Guildhall had not the magistrate told the prosecutor that I could bring an action against him if the case was dismissed; I had intended to avail myself of a defence that was prepared for me, showing that there was no evidence that I stole the picture; but after listening to the pious exhortations of the chaplain day after day I cannot consent to purchase my liberty at the sacrifice of truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">IBBETT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) I have known the prisoner for 20 years—I got him to sign the pledge, knowing he was dreadfully given to intemperance—I always believed him to be honest—he is related to the wife of Robert Burns the poet, and was at one time highly respected—seeing him fallen so low I set him up in business and kept him for 12 months—the last thing I expected was this—I think it must have been done in an evil hour—I told the magistrate I could not condone the matter; as I had given him in charge I must substantiate the truth of the thing or he might bring an action.</p>

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knowles, and the case by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>I think the act of parliament may meet this crime; if you should be satisfied that he, when he applied at this office, did it with an intention afterwards to apply to the pay-table, and receive the pay of this seaman;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140068"></xptr> if you should ultimately be of opinion that he did it wantonly, foolishly, and that he had no such intention to receive the money, as he certainly has not applied to the pay-table, it may be lucky for him that he was detected in this early stage of business; I shall be perfectly satisfied with the decision of the law from the Recorder.</p>

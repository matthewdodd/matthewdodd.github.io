            . I worked with Mr. Williams; I had left a chest of tools upon Saturday night, the 8th of June, in my master's shop; I came there about five o'clock on Monday morning, I observed the chest broke and some of the tools taken out, and particularly the tools mentioned in the indictment; I am sure they were in the chest on Saturday night; upon looking further, I found the shop had been broke open, a board was taken out near the end of the chest, about four in the afternoon; I heard of them at one Mr. Blassan's; I went up to him; they delivered me the things mentioned in the indictment, they are my property; (produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>- Blassan. I am a carpenter; I went to work about five o'clock; Philips came to me and told me he had lost his working tools, out of his chest; in the afternoon as I was going to the shop, two little boys came to me and asked if I had lost any tools, they brought two plains; I said, I believed I know who had: I sent to Mr. Phillips; he came, and then the boys shewed me where they found them; with looking about, I found the augur; it was upon a dunghill, very near the shop; having discovered them in the dunghill; and having received the account from the boys, thought it proper to advise the prosecutor to let them remain there; and watch to see who would come for them.</p>
               <p>Phillips. In consequence of that advise I did watch; I left two plains there, and watched till about 10 o'clock, when a man came down the street and went behind a cart near where the tools were concealed; he went away again' I missed him at that time; he came again' and then seeing him search under the cart, looking backwards and forwards; I seized him, and found one of the plains in his pocket; which I produced; I charged him and he denied it: I promised to let him go, if he would bring me to the rest of the s, he confessed they were at one

            . Phillips came to me about five in the morning; he began talking about the tools he had lost, and mentioned the prisoner, who lodged at his father's house, he says he had lodged there a twelvemonth. Phillips having told me that these to were up in a closet in his room, I went to see if the door was open, found it was a-jar, I went into the room, the wife was in bed, I opened the closet door and found the tools.</p>

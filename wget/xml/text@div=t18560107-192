                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the morning of 2nd Jan. I was on duty in Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner carrying a box—I asked him what he had got, he said, "I have got nothing but an empty box"—I requested him to allow me to look into it, he said, "No, I have got some<lb></lb>thing in it, but I do not know what"—I took it off his shoulder, and found it contained buttons, a muslin cap, and other articles—I asked him where he got it, he said that <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> gave it to him to take to <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi>—I asked him who <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi> was, he said that he did not know; I asked him who <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi> was, he said that he did not know, but if I would hold the box he would go and fetch her—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this rule on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he said was his property—he gave his name, John White, 9, White Hart-lane, Royal Mint-street—I could find no such place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Potter, of Albert-street, Shad<lb></lb>well. This box and contents are my husband's property—it was safe on Tuesday night, 1st Jan., at 9 o'clock, with all these things in it, and a great many more—I had put the shutters, to about half past 4 o'clock, but do not think I bolted them—I was called up about a quarter past 1 o'clock, missed the box and contents, and found a large square of glass broken and the window thrown open—this rule is my husband's, and was in the box—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About half past 12 o'clock I was coming down Albert-street, home; I work hard for Messrs. Scott and Russell; although I have been on the ticket-of-leave, I was sentenced innocent as ever a man was in his life; I was coming down Albert-street, where the woman says she lives, and two girls came running after me, named <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polly</hi>, as a man called them; they asked me if I would take this box; I did so, and took it Rosemary-lane way; I did not know where I was going; I took it off my head, and showed it to the policeman; I asked him next morning whether I came along steadily, he said, "Yes, you came along pretty steady;" it is very hard that the policeman should go to my room and mention my name, as I am on a ticket-of-leave, and that is the reason I gave a wrong name; I did not want my father and mother to know it; the witness said before the Magistrate that it was a taller man than me, and that his voice was not like mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Your attention was called to three persons? A. Yes; I found my handkerchief in his possession in about half a minute - he was separated from the other two; I did not see him in their company - he produced it himself on my collaring him; it was quite concealed in his breast; the gentleman directed my attention to three persons - two on one side, and one on the other.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

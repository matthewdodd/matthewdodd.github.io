               <p>Q. Did you see this man take the coals? - No, I do not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from? - From Mr. Fletcher's barges, I have no doubt of that; it was on the 25th of October, about eight in the evening, I was passing along Thames-street, I saw a man bring a sack of coals up the gangway from <placeName id="t17941111-51-crimeloc255">Paul's-wharf</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was this after you had seen a man in the gangway? - Yes, that induced me to go on the whars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you immediately went to this door? - I gave him time to dispose of his first freight, and return for the second, then I went up to go on the whars, and I met with the other witness, and we went up the whars in Thames-street, and went down the gang way, which leads to the stairs, I went down the gang way and saw this person still in the white waistcoat; I conceived that he would not come on shore, that he had either heard or seen me, we walked up that gang way again, and I stopped exactly at the top, and in about five or six minutes the prisoner at the bar came up the gang way, with this sack of coals on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whose coals these were? - I cannot swear to the coals, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other coals laying in this Paul's wharf, besides Mr. Fletcher's? - There was at that time no other craft with coals in them but Mr. Fletcher's. I asked him what he had got in the sack? I said, I perceive they are coals, how did you come by them? he stammered, and at length said, that a west country bargeman had given them to him; I told him that must be explained to my satisfaction, and he walked on, and I along side of him, and when he came to Bennet's-hill, he threw down the sack, and seemed determined to escape if possible, and we had a scussle on the hill, I found that in all probability he would escape from me, the other witness being an elderly man, I then threw him, and we both sell, he being much stronger than me, he shot me under, and got up and ran away; I also got up, and followed him, and he runned up Addle-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him till you took him? - No, not at all till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. The coal sack, who does that belong to? - I do not know, there are never no sacks in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man came up with the sack on his back, was he drest in a white jacket? - Yes, he was, to the best of my recollection it was a flannel waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wore a white jacket in my life; there were other barges there, in my master's dock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110109"></xptr>Prosecutor. There is a dock belongs to an oil man, between the causeway and where Mr. Fletcher's barges lay; the barges he talks of, was on the left hand of the cause way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the barges he talks of from Mr. Fletcher's? - Thirty or forty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he could come from that barge of his master's, and be in that situation in which you found him? - Surely, because I found him at the top of the gang way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is a servant there or no? - I have heard that he is a servant to Messrs. Crawshaw and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he get out of your sight before you stopped him? - No.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the night, the prisoner was at the watch-house, when that I came to set the watch, the charge was given to me, and I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About eight o'clock that evening, I went down to Paul's whars, there is a necessary there, which I goes there almost every night in the week; when I had done I went to the steps on the landing place, and I thought I saw something by the pile, the side of the cause-way, like a bundle, and being dark I went down the steps, on purpose to see what it was, and I found it was a little bag of coals, and I stopped a minute or two, to see if any body was there, and I called halloo! but nobody answered, and I took them up, and when I came about a hundred, or a hundred and fifty yards up, just in Thames-street, that gentleman collared me, and he directly said, he would send me to goal, where I never was before, and he used me very ill, and threw me down, and I thought I would make the best escape I could, and I ran I do not know which way.</p>

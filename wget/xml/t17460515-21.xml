The Witness was asked whether she had any Notice that this Tobacco was stolen; he thinks she knew that very well, that she had often lent Hammers to break them open, and says that he himself made the Discovery of it, voluntarily, before Justice Jones. This Witness was asked by the Prisoner May, whether he was upon Duty that Night; the Answer he gave, that he was upon Duty. The other Question was, whether he had a Candle and Lanthorn; the Answer the Evidence gave, that he had heard May declare, that he had no Candle and Lanthorn, or rather that he was not there that Night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Princes'-street, Finsbury. On the 3rd of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, I was near Fetter-lane, in Fleet-street, and was asked if I had lost a pocket handkerchief—I felt, and missed it—a gentleman had hold of the prisoner by the collar, and was taking the handkerchief from him—I re<lb></lb>cognised it as being mine—there was no particular mark on it—it was a silk handkerchief.</p>

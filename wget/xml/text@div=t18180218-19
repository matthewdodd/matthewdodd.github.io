               <p>EDWARD DAVENPORT. I live in Brill-row, St. Pancras. On the 20th of January, I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night, I was the last up, and fastened the doors and windows. I have three lodgers. I got up at half-past seven o'clock the next morning, and found the table-linen, sheets, and other things had been moved, in the room where I slept; in about ten minutes after we found the window open, and the wash-house door had been forced open with a chisel, or something like it-it was then light - I am sure they were fastened when I went to bed. I had not heard any noise. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw the property at the office. I sleep in the front room on the ground-floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there any fastening to the staircase window - A. No, but it was shut down.</p>
               <p>JOHN DIMMOCK. I am a watchman in Clerkenwell. On the 21st of January, I was calling two o'clock in the morning, in Hamilton-row, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner with a bag under his arm; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had got? he said they were shirts and other things, which he had brought from the country, and he was going to his lodgings in Spafields. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MAY. I lodge in the house. On the 21st of January I observed the staircase window open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did it through the greatest distress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer in the employ of the Great Northern Railway—on 1st February I was on duty in Fore-street, and saw Wild carrying a cheese on his head—about twelve or fifteen yards behind him on the other side of the way, I saw Hunt—I followed them into Moorgate-street—prior to getting there Hunt came up and received the cheese on his head from Wild—it was enclosed in a large box covered over with a sack—Wild then followed up behind Hunt, about twelve or fifteen yards off, on the other side of Moorgate-street—they then spoke to each other and exchanged the cheese—I followed them into Prince's-street, and met 114, City-policeman—I said something to him, and followed Wild—I saw Hunt taken by the officer, and then Wild ran along King William-street towards London-bridge—I ran after him, seized bold of him, and told him I was a policeman—he said, "What do you want with me!' and he resisted most violently—I called on a bystander to assist me—I said to Wild, 'I shall take you across to your companion, and you will see what I want of you"—in taking him across, be suddenly put his left hand into his coat-pocket, and then with-drew it closed—I said, 'What have you got in your hand?"—he said, 'Nothing"—I laid hold of his wrist, bent his hand back, and opened it—in his band was a large signet-ring, with the engraving of a ship on it—I said, 'I believe this is gold"—he said I was asleep; I had got my eyes shut—I said if my eyes were shut, I could see him going along with the cheese—he said I was a b----liar; that he never had the cheese on his head; he said that he did not know Hunt, he had never seen him before—I heard the constable say to Hunt, 'What have you got here? 'pointing to what was on his head—Hunt replied, 'A cheese"—the constable said, 'Where are you going to take it to?"—Hunt replied, 'To Friar-street, Blackfriars"—the constable said, 'Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From the Underground Railway"—they were both taken into custody—I carried the cheese to Bow-lane Police-station.</p>

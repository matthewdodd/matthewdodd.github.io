            : I delivered the flax into the craft that was sent by Mr. Atkins.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the delivery take up? - A. I began on Tuesday the 4th of November; on Wednesday the 5th, another parcel; and Friday the 7th, another.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The parcels that you put in were never unladen? - A. No; they were in the same bulk that we received them at Petersburgh; there were four hundred and fifty-six bobbins, that is, flax done up at both ends; part of them contained nine heads, and part twelve; after I had delivered them all into the craft, the lightermen, Arthur and Williams, took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Minerva at that time? - A. In Cherry-garden tier, on the Surry-side of the water; the craft lay close along-side.</p>
               <p>Q. All the flax then was safely delivered into the craft? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that it is Mr. Atkins's property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How do you know it is Mr. Atkins's property? - A. By the bill of lading.</p>

            ). Q. Did you see the flax on board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the flax afterwards at Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it the same appearance with the flax you had lost? - A. One bottom of flax is like another; but there was just the quantity that we had lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Lost from where? - A. Either from the lighter or the shore.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARTHUR, jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. My father is a lighterman; he was employed by Mr. Atkins: I went down in the craft, in November last, for the bobbins of flax for Mr. Atkins, from the Minerva; she was lying off Wapping Old Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any bobbins at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any flax put into the craft? - A. Yes, by the people belonging to the Minerva; I was not in the craft at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any in the craft? - A. Yes, apparently a large quantity; I was to have delivered them at Davis's wharf, upon Mr. Atkins's account; I went to Davis's wharf, and then I went and fetched the watchman of Davis's wharf, Crawley; I saw the barge fastened, and I left it in the care of Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Davis's wharf? - A. Just below Battle-bridge, on the other side of the water; after I had seen the barge fast, I went home, that was on the 7th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How many days were you receiving the flax from the Minerva? - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself receive any orders from Mr. Atkins? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by when any orders were given by Mr. Atkins? - A. No; I saw a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Excepting from the letter, you did not know on whose account you went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many bobbins of flax you received? - A. The account that was given to me, was four hundred and fifty-six, I did not count them myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, what quantity of flax was to be delivered? - A. Five hundred bobbins; when I heard it was landed, I went to Daivs's wharf to see it, that was, I suppose, about a week after; I had given the order to Arthur.</p>

            , came to our counting-house, and asked me if I would buy any flax, and pulled out a small sample of a pound weight out of his pocket, he assured me, that it was all like the sample; I enquired the quantity and the price; he said, the quantity, he supposed, might be from nine to ten hundred weight, and the price fifty-seven shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a fair price or not? - A. From sixty-seven to sixty-eight shillings, was the market price at that time; I told him I could not purchase by that sample, I wished to see the bulk about the middle of the day; he came again, and brought a head of flax in a handkerchief, with the headband of the flax cut: I then told him, that I should rather see the bulk; I asked him again the price, and he was still in the same story; he said, he had lent a man fifty-five shillings a hundred weight upon it, he wanted money, and he must sell the flax; I told him it was not customary to sell flax by sample, could I see the bulk; I told him, I would send my brother to see it, and if he approved of it, he might bring the flax and have his money; he objected to my brother going to see the flax, by saying, the people of the house would not shew the flax without he was present, but he would bring the bulk for me to look at; he said, his horses and carts were then out, that he could not bring it before nine o'clock; I told him it was an odd time to look at flax, but that he might bring it; I immediately gave notice at Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other prisoner at all? - A. No, I did not see him till I saw him in custody at the Cherry-tree, opposite our house.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. In consequence of the information of Mr. Gamson, on Monday the 17th of November, by orders from the office, between eight and nine at night, in company with my brother officers, I went into Kingsland-road; coming near to Mr. Gamson's door, I observed a cart standing, apparently to me full; I then saw the two prisoners, as if going to say something, or had been saying something to one abother, I do not know which; the prisoner, Francis, went a little from the other, and I caught hold of him; the other prisoner I saw instantly in custody of the other officers; I then said to the prisoner, Francis, the other prisoner being close by, what is that cart loaded with, he said, go see, it is a hired cart, the contents are mine; I then said, sir, you have some bill of parcels, or some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030022"></xptr>thing to shew; we then took both the prisoners to a public-house, had the cart secured at the door, and went into a little back room, I did not know then what it contained; I then addressed Francis, will you now tell me who you are, and where you live? I and the rest are constables; he did not, nor would not give his name, nor any residence, but after a little time, said, the contents came from a wharf over the water; I then said to the other prisoner, Edward, what is your name? he gave me his name directly,

            , jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a flax-dealer in Mark-lane: I saw the flax that was produced at Worship-street, and I saw the bulk at Davis's Wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the different sorts of flax? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the flax, that you saw at the one place and the other, appear to be of the same quality? - A. Yes; they resembled each other so nearly, that I should think they are the same; I have not the least doubt but they are the same parcel of flax; it was Petersburgh flax.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe most of the flax that comes into this country, it Russian flax? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A very large quantity of Russian flax, of the same quality, comes into this country? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to it? - A. No; but from certain appearances which can only be known to the trade, I judged that they must be the same parcel.</p>

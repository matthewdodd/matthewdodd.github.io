               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fenwick. There was nobody with me but the prisoner, we were in bed together, and I had seen my money at going to bed, there were 8 guineas, one 36 s. piece and 1 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to know that you had that money ?</p>
               <p>Fenwick. He saw me put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Fenwick. Better than a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches at going to bed?</p>
               <p>Fenwick I put them under my head. I was called up between 3 and 4 o'clock, and left my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175606030039"></xptr> breeches and money there, I put on another pair of breeches, and left the prisoner in bed, but I know he was up in the night, went to the room door, and came back again in his shirt. When I missed the money, I asked him after it; he said he knew nothing of it. I took him before a justice of the peace, he denied it there; all he said was, he would give me a note for the money, if I would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he said that?</p>
               <p>Fenwick. In Newgate, and before he went there, but he denied taking it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the fact laid to my charge. I never saw a farthing of his money in all the course of my life. I am a poor countryman from Salisbury, and have no acquaintance in London, because I always made it my care to mind my business.</p>

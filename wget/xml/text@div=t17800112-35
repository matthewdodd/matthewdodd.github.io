             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost some stack-wood in December last; I missed it when I went with my cart to fetch it out from where it stood upon <placeName id="t17800112-35-crimeloc177">Enfield Chase</placeName>

               <p>Was all that was there gone? - All that stood upon that spot. I followed the track of the cart till I came to the prisoner's house, and found it upon his premisses.</p>
               <p>Is there any road or tracks over that part of the Chase; - Several roads.</p>
               <p>How came you to follow this particular cart? - I do not imagine there had been a cart upon that part of the Chase for a month or six weeks before, the time of year was so bad. The track I followed was a fresh one, it had been made but some few days.</p>
               <p>Was the track so fresh that you could distinguish it from the old tracks? - Yes, very plain.</p>
               <p>When you came to the man's house you taxed him with it and he denied it? - In looking round I found a great part of the wood in the yard under his hovel.</p>
               <p>Had he any wood of his own there? - He had split some into small pieces.</p>
               <p>How did you know this wood which you found in his yard under the hovel to be your's? - By a particular mark that was upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120059"></xptr>stick; I brought it away with me. There was a mark of a saw upon it, which my people, who I had employed, had fixed on it; there was a dispute between the two men, one thought it was not long enough; they measured it again, and then cut it an inch longer than where they had begun. I know a great part of it. Besides, there were one or two more which the saw had touched.</p>
               <p>Was there any other particular mark than the mark of the saw? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not your wood like other stack-wood? - There was no other such upon that quarter.</p>
               <p>In what did it differ from other stack-wood? - This was a butt of an oak.</p>
               <p>Was not there a great deal of other oak upon the Chase besides this which was cut for your stack-wood? - This was rather a large stack.</p>
               <p>Was your's the only large stack upon Enfield Chase? - That was any way near there that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was this wood covered up or concealed, or was it lying open in the prisoner's yard? - It was lying open in the yard. I took that stick away, and had the prisoner taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have not told us quite all you know about this business have you? - I do not recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>What business may you be of? - A publican.</p>
               <p>Did you go with your own cart yourself to fetch home this wood? - With my servant.</p>
               <p>You had not received information of any of the wood being missing before you went for it? - Yes, I had heard that some of my wood was gone.</p>
               <p>There are pretty large quantities of stack-wood about the Chase? - Not just at that place, the wood has been taken off.</p>
               <p>I am told there are four or five thousand pieces of oak of much the same kind there now? - Not near it.</p>
               <p>There is such sort of wood upon the Chase? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>You have been talking of the butt of an oak, what do you mean by the butt of an oak, is it the stump or body? - The lower part.</p>
               <p>What lengths might this be cut into? - Three feet. One of the men was for cutting it three feet, and the other three feet and an inch; it was at last cut at three feet two inches.</p>
               <p>You have been asked what enables you to swear so positively to this piece of wood, the answers you have given, if I understand you right, were that there had been a saw in it; might not that have happened to any other piece of wood? - I cannot say; I know this very well.</p>
               <p>So the whole mark upon that wood is a cut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is it which you mean to swear by? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a man as Mr. Smith a wheeler, in you neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any body see the mark of the wheels of a cart besides yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been giving an account that there are a great number of roads where there are wheel tracks? - Certainly upon such a forest as that.</p>
               <p>You are acquainted with Mr. Rookes, I believe? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having any meeting with Mr. Hall and Mrs. Rookes? - Meeting! Mrs. Rookes was one of the prisoner's bail.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any meeting you had with them? - I keep a public-house.</p>
               <p>If you have had a meeting do not be ashamed of it, say so? - Only when they bailed him, and when we took him into custody again.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect telling Mr. Hall that unless he would give you twenty guineas you would hang him? - I never told him any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>What then is become of the notes you got from this man? - I do not know; I have got no notes.</p>
               <p>You do not know any thing about that then? - No.</p>
               <p>Then tell the court plainly, have you got notes from this man? - I never had any in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you deny that you ever had any notes given you by the prisoner at the bar? - I never had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120060"></xptr>Do you recollect the prisoner's waiting upon you to pay the first of these notes? - The prisoner came one day with a handful of money, but I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Is your wife in town? - She is near at hand.</p>
               <p>Was not she present when this transaction happened? - She might be at hand.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the prisoner if he would not give you twenty guineas, and then you reduced it down to ten, that you would prosecute and hang him? - That I deny. There were some notes drawn up between him and his bail, but I know nothing about them.</p>
               <p>They were not then made payable to you? - I do not know who they were made payable to.</p>
               <p>Did not Hall wait upon you to pay you one of these notes? - I never had the notes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Hall that you should not deliver him up this note unless he would agree to have them both burnt? - No.</p>
               <p>The whole of this is a fiction then, it is all a story? - Certainly; what his bail and he did I know nothing about.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A labouring man. I cleft some stack-wood for Mr. Bickley; it was upon Enfield Chase.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any of it afterwards? - Yes, I saw one piece of it, which Mr. Bickley shewed me at his own house, which I cleft. I never saw it at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>(The piece of wood was produced in court by the constable.)</p>
               <p>To Bickley. Where did you find that piece of wood? - In Mr. Hall's yard.</p>
               <p>That is the piece of wood you take upon you to swear to? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>To Tulett. Do you know any thing of that piece of wood? - Whilst we were cleaving this, there arose a dispute between my partner and me in sawing it off; we set the saw in; I said we will go an inch farther.</p>
               <p>How do you know that to be the same piece of wood again? - To the best of my knowledge that is the piece.</p>
               <p>Have you often been employed in cleaving stack-wood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it never happen in all your cleaving wood, that you put the saw in a wrong place and took it out again? - Yes, to be sure that might happen.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon you to swear that that is the very piece of wood that you cut for Mr. Bickley? - No, I certainly cannot.</p>

               <p>- FRANKLAND sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bickley, the prosecutor, desired me to go along with him to trace the cart from the place where the wood was taken.</p>
               <p>Do you know the place where the wood was before it was taken away? - Perfectly well. I saw the tracks of a six-inch wheel cart. The tracks began from the three quarters of a stack of wood which was taken away. We followed it all the way to the prisoner's yard.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the tract any farther than that? - No farther than his yard.</p>
               <p>But at the other end, next to where the track was, did you look to see whether the track went any farther than the stack? - I did not examine that.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Bickley had not pointed it out to you should you have taken notice of that more particularly than any other track? - No; but when Mr. Bickley pointed it out to me we could follow it very plain.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to be a fresh or an old track? - It appeared to have been made within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Were there any other fresh tracks besides that from that part of the Chase? - None but what were gone down in the right road, but this went across the other tracks.</p>
               <p>As the Chase lies open are there not tracks going almost every way across the Chase there? - In different places there are.</p>
               <p>When you followed the tracks to this man's yard, did the tracks go into the yard? - We followed the tracks up to the gate and when they came to the gate, going into the yard it is a very hard stony gravel, there the track was lost.</p>
               <p>Is there any way through Mr. Hall's yard? - None on the other side at all, I am pretty sure.</p>
               <p>How far from the prisoner's gate is the ground hard so that you lost the track? - Not more than twice the length of my stick, it is only just the gateway.</p>
               <p>Did you look about Mr. Hall's yard or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120061"></xptr>beyond it to see whether the tracks began again and went farther? - We did, but could not find any tracks; when we went into the yard Mr. Hall was at work in the yard; the prosecutor said to him what have you been at, Mr. Hall, you have been robbing me; he said no I have not been robbing you; the prosecutor said I am very certain of it; I have suspected you a great while, but could not find it out before; we have traced the cart all the way to your yard door; he positively denied it; the prosecutor turned round to come out of the yard and he saw some wood lie piled up; he examined it and found this piece of wood among it.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hall present at the same time? - Yes; Mr. Hall freely gave him leave to take this piece of wood away.</p>
               <p>Was there any cart there? - Yes; there was a body of a cart and a pair of six-inch wheels; I measured them.</p>
               <p>Could you discern distinctly from the tracks whether it was a four or a two wheel cart? - I could discern very distinctly that it was a two wheel cart.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A herdsman to the parish of Edmonton, to look after the wood and the cattle.</p>
               <p>You have an allowance for that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a considerable quantity of wood? - There is.</p>
               <p>This happened in the month of December? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The chase was extremely wet at that time? - Yes; it was before the frost set in.</p>
               <p>What depth do you suppose this track you have been talking of might have been? - I cannot tell that; it varied in various places; in some places it was harder than others.</p>
               <p>Is there any great difference in the appearance of a track whether it is made to day or three or four days ago; can you by your eye undertake positively to swear to a fresh or an old track? - I can to a track that has gone across the other tracks, I could not upon the main road.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted in this chase there are a great many cross tracks? - There are so.</p>
               <p>Is it not possible for there to have been a track from Mr. Hall's yard up to the stack-wood, and for that to have broke into some other track that was upon the Chase; can you undertake to swear that the track was continued from Mr. Hall's gate to the stack wood, and did not break in upon any other track, and was it not possible to go from the house to the stack a different road? - Yes; many different roads.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no track leading from the house to the stack? - I never examined that.</p>
               <p>You must have seen it if there had been two? - No; he might possibly have gone different ways; there was but that one track all the way to his house.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Does it not follow that if the ground was so wet there must have been two tracks with the cart, one going the other coming back? - If he had gone that way there would.</p>
               <p>The wood in Hall's yard was lying open? - It was piled up in the yard, either in the shed or adjoining to it; it was no ways concealed.</p>
               <p>I think you said Hall voluntarily offered Bickley to take away this piece of wood? - Yes; Mr. Bickley when he examined the wood said, I suppose if I take away a piece of wood you will swear a robbery against me. Hall said no, he was welcome to take it. He asked Mr. Hall where he bought this wood? Mr. Hall said he bought it of one

               <p>Were any terms proposed by Bickley to Mr. Hall to settle the business? - Hall asked Bickley what terms he would settle it upon? Bickley said if he would give him five pounds down and five pounds shortly afterwards. Hall said he would give him a note for five pounds, and another note twenty one days afterwards accordingly.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me the very words Bickley said? - He said he would have ten pounds; five pounds down immediately, and Mr. Hall promised to give him five pounds in twenty one days after.</p>
               <p>Did Hall give him five pounds? - He could not then; Bickley accepted of his note till the Saturday.</p>
               <p>I understood you just now that Mr. Hall persevered in denying that he was guilty of the charge that was imputed to him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then did it not appear to you a little extraordinary that he should consent to give the prosecutor ten pounds? - I cannot say his meaning for so doing.</p>
               <p>Was it through teriour of mind, or for what cause that he consented to pay this money? - I cannot say unless it was through fear of further trouble.</p>
               <p>Who wrote those notes? - I wrote them; the prisoner could not read or write.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the tenor of the notes were? - I think I do.</p>
               <p>Read that, (giving the witness a paper) and tell me if that is the exact copy of the notes given at the time? - January the 8th, 1780, I promise to pay to

               <p>Court. Who made that copy? - I made it yesterday.</p>
               <p>From what did you make this copy? - I was desired to make a copy of the notes as nearly as I could; I made that from my memory.</p>
               <p>Then you could as well have told us from your memory what was the substance of the notes? - I can clearly recollect that is as exactly the copy of the notes as possible. (Repeats the notes from memory exactly as the copy.)</p>
               <p>This was on the 8th of this month? - Yes, that the first note came due.</p>
               <p>When were the notes given? - On the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>That was the 5th or 6th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came they to be dated upon the 8th? - They were so dated.</p>
               <p>Who desired them to be so dated? - Catlin told me to date them from the 8th; Catlin is bail with me.</p>
               <p>After these two notes were given to Bickley, what further conversation passed? - He said we had done; accordingly Hall discharged the reckoning; it came to eleven shillings and ten-pence the whole day's expence.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hall went to pay the first note to Bickley? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when these notes were burnt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - We were then coming to town to Hicks's-hall; this was at the Bell and Hare, at Tottenham; Mr. Bickley and Catlin went into a parlour, where there was a fire; Catlin asked if we would not go into a little room, as we had no call to tell our business to people that were in the tap-room; we went into the parlour; Bickley pulled out the note, he shewed me the notes, and asked me if I knew them; I said they were my hand writing; he gave them to Catlin, the constable, and the constable put them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Was it by the directions of Bickley that they were burnt? - He did not positively tell him to burn them in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Was she present when the notes were given? - We were in a little parlour, she was in the tap-room in her own house.</p>

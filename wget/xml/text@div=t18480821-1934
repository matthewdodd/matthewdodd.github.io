                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Friday evening, 28th July last, I attended a meeting at the theatre in Milton-street, City—I arrived there about a quarter to eight o'clock—there were about 100 persons there when I arrived—when the chairman was appointed it had increased to about 500—John Shaw was the chairman—the numbers increased to upwards of 1000 in the course of the evening—they appeared to be composed of the poorer classes, but principally Irish I judge—the speakers spoke from the stage of the theatre—the defendant came on the stage a moment or two after Shaw the chairman had been speaking—I took a note of Shaw's speech, and have it here—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" Friends, you have placed me in rather a responsible situa<lb></lb>tion to-night; however, I obey the call with alacrity, and with pleasure to myself, and I trust any despotic conduct of mine, or on my part to-night, will be excused by you, because I believe you have all assembled here for the same good and religious purpose that I have been induced to attend here for. I will just read you the bill calling this meeting. I believe the meeting was only agreed on to-day; I was not privy to any of the arrangements, and therefore, however I may express my ignorance of the arrangements that are made by the conductors, I trust you will excuse it on the score of ignorance. It is as follows, 'Is Ireland up? 'That is a most important question to me. 'A great public meeting will be held to-night, Friday, July 28th, at the Milton-street Theatre. Cripplegate, to take into consideration the momentous crisis in Ireland. Chair taken at eight o'clock. Several talented patriots</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210120"></xptr>
               <p>will address the meeting. Englishmen, Irishmen, attend! attend! Admis<lb></lb>sion, pit and gallery, one penny; platform and boxes, twopence.' I believe it is not the intention of the conveners of this meeting to shut any poor man out, be he Englishman or Irishman, for want of the means; therefore if there are any of those persons outside, I trust, as your chairman here to-night that the managers of this meeting will announce the same to them, and give free admission to every poor man. (Applause.) My friends, let the police all come in—let the walking telegraphs come in if they please—let the living telegraphs, that are placed over you to watch over your every act, come—make room for them all if you can convert them, if there is the slightest probability of making honest men of them at all, let them all in: however I despair of any great utility arising from such a task as that. My friends, I was about to say, I rejoice to think, and I verily believe it, that Ireland is up! (Cheers.) Notwithstanding the garbled reports that we receive continually day by day, and every express that arrives in order to delude and deceive the people of this country, I believe sincerely that Ireland is up, and I believe that Ireland will do its duty to itself. The time has now arrived when it is too late to mince the matter; the time has now arrived that both Englishmen and Irish<lb></lb>men should be up to do their duty. I will tell you a little bit of intelligence that was conveyed to me about half an hour ago, intelligence that I deeply deplore; cur worthy, patriotic, straightforward, indomitable friend Patrick O'Higgins, is apprehended on a charge of high treason: now there is no question in my mind, that every other honest and patriotic fellow, both in Eng<lb></lb>land and Ireland, will be pounced upon by the same worthless hands, as soon as there is an opportunity. My friends, Patrick O'Higgins is in durance vile, I have every reason to believe; and as soon as ever the govern<lb></lb>ment are prepared to arrest your indomitable champion, Smith O'Brien, they will serve him precisely the same. However, I am glad to think they have not got him yet, and I do believe they will have something to do to take him too. While Smith O'Brien is surrounded by 100, 000 brave Irish hearts, (he government will have something to do to stop him. I believe they say that he carries a brace of pistols with him; now these things perhaps ought not to be indulged in by a public meeting like this, but I sincerely hope to God that such is the fact, and the first dirty fingers, be it a policeman in his own uniform or otherwise, that lays a hand upon Smith O'Brien, or any other man who dares to vindicate the rights of his country, I trust that—I dare scarcely trust myself, for our respected friends here, on my right hand and on my left, are sent here for the purpose of performing a professional duty, and I do hope and trust you will excuse them in the performance of their duty,—that alluded to myself and Mr. Bennett, who accompanied me—" they are but men, and they must perform that duty for which they are sent here faith<lb></lb>fully, and in accordance with the employ under which they labour. Is Ireland up? I should like to answer that in a very Irish method practised by this country, by putting another question—Is England up? I trust we are up; at all events, my friends, we are up this night, to listen and to be ad<lb></lb>vised by those gentlemen who will presently address you. This is a very critical period of our history, both for England and for Ireland. I believe, and I do hope and trust that we are up in this way, that we shall calmly dis<lb></lb>cuss the subjects that may from time to time be brought before us, and that when this meeting concludes, that we will give no possible pretext to the common foe to pounce upon any man; no processions, no row, or anything of that sort publicly made, so as to enable them to lay hold of you and your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210121"></xptr>
               <p>friends to-night; but every one will leave this Theatre, and he will pursue his own quiet and calm way home again, and reflect on what he has heard. I hope, nevertheless, that you will agree with die sentiments that will be uttered here to-night. I do not believe that there is one man that will address you to-night, but are your best friends, consequently they will give you no bad advice; at the same time, I think it is the duty of every man here, to register a vow in heaven that he will never rest contented till both England and Ireland are in possession of their rights. I think, my friends, that it is a duty incumbent upon all; and it is of no use for Mr. John O'Con<lb></lb>nell or any other sham patriot, threatening me, or Irishmen and Englishmen either, that if the people do not agree with his advice and will not act upon it, he will walk his body away, and take his father's bones with him; if he should, my friends, carry his threats into execution, I do not think it will be any great loss to his country at all. My friends, I shall presently introduce Mr. Dwaine to your notice, to move the first resolution. In reply to that, I an sure I have not the slightest disposition to disturb the bones of Daniel O'Connell, or any other dead man, but I think when we are threatened by the mnan who has taken that illustrious man's place in the affections of Ireland, when he threatens to deprive us of such a valuable blessing as that, namely the bones of the late Daniel O'Connell, I think we ought to pass our opinions on his motives and conduct. I will not address you at any further length to-night, my friends; but I have this request to make, that those gentlemen who are inconvenienced towards the entrance of the pit, will be allowed to move on.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now after some other persons had spoken, did the defendant Bezer speak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I took a note of his speech—this is it (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"It is not the fashion of Chartists to prevent free" and fair discussion; it is the fashion of the enemies of the Chartist to prevent discussion. I love discus<lb></lb>sion; I glory in being in a discussion, and simply because I think that dis<lb></lb>cussion, based upon fair and equitable grounds, is the best way of arriving at the truth; and I hope it was a little mistake on the part of two or three of our friends; if it was not a mistake, it was only a trick of the authorities themselves to kick up a disturbance. Now then to the resolution I hold in my hand,—'Resolved, that this meeting deeply sympathises with the struggling people of Ireland, and is resolved to assist them by all and every means in their power, and that we consider the physical preparations of the government unjustifiable, without the proper remedial measure attached thereto.' Brother Chartists! brother Republicans! brother Democrats! for I do not know that I can address you by any better name than democrats, for the principle of democracy is the principle of fair play; the principle of democracy is the principle of a free stage to all, and no favour to any; the principle of democracy is the right of the rich, and no more; the principle of democracy is the right of the poor, and no less; the principle of democracy is the greatest amount of good to the greatest number; in short, the principle of democracy is the principle of justice and of truth. Democrats understand each other all over the world. Democrats are the same in every nation; the democrats of Russia, the democrats of Poland, the democrats of Switzerland, the democrats of Germany, the democrats of France, the democrats of Ireland understand each other; they are all travelling the same road; they have all one end; they have all one aim; they have all one object in view, and that object is glorious liberty! they are all singing one song, not in the same language perhaps, but the same sentiment—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210122"></xptr>
               <p>' Oh liberty! will man resign thee; Once having felt thy gen'rous flame? Shall locks, or bars, or bolts confine thee? Or whips thy noble spirit tame?'No, it has not tamed John Mitchell yet, I will be bound. It has not yet tamed Ernest Jones, I will be bound. Did it tame the men of old, when they were burned at the stake? No, it did not; it actually progressed their principles more than they would have progressed; and let tyrants beware. You had better shut up shop; you had better put up your swords, and cut and run, for democracy is spreading, depend upon it, and sooner or later it will overwhelm you all. My friends, we live in strange times, we live in very queer times; and yet it is a privilege to live in these times. We have seen a great many things; we have seen lords, and dukes, and princes, and all the rest of the mob in different nations cut and run. Louis Philippe had to change his clothes and his whiskers, and to take his umbrella and cat and run away. (Cheers and laughter.) We have seen great changes, and we shall live to see greater changes yet. As a democrat I hope so; and as I said before, I do not know that I can address you by any better word than democrats. I might say, Mr. Chairman, and all respectable people, and for this reason, because every man that works for his living honestly, either by his head or his hands, is a respectable man, though by bad laws he may be badly clothed, badly housed, and badly fed; and those who do not work for their living, but who fatten upon the labour of others, are not respectable people; but, on the contrary, are thieves, and rogues, and vagabonds—(loud cheers)—though they may wear fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day; though they may wear crowns on their heads, and have swords hanging at their tails—(laughter)—and though they may be called lords, and dukes, and marquesses, and viscounts and right reverend fathers in God, and knights of the garter, and grooms of the stole, and lords of the bedchamber, and all the other mummery, and flummery, and humbuggery. I therefore will address you, Mr. Chairman and friends, as respectable people; for I presume, that with the exception of a sprinkling here and a sprinkling there, and a few here and a few there of despicable wretches, who have hired themselves for blood-money,—with the exception of these creatures we are all respectable people, I hope. I work for my living. If Lord John Russell wants to know what I am, I am a merchant of the City of London. I am a merchant in the City of London; and though perhaps I have not much <hi rend="italic">rhino</hi>, I am perhaps more respectable than many other merchants, for I do go to market with ready money. I sell fish about the streets; and if Lord John Russell wants to be a customer, I will sell him a <hi rend="italic">pike</hi> cheap—(loud cheers, two or three times repeated)—or if the Treasury is almost exhausted, (which I dare say it nearly is,) it the Exche<lb></lb>quer is very low indeed, I am a charitable man, although our friend Shaw the other night said he would not be so merciful as I am,—if the Treasury is so very low, and Lord John Russell can't afford to buy a pike, I will give him one. (Laughter and cheers.) I was going to say we live in queer times; I say again, it is a privilege to live in these times; but let us not forget that there is a danger also in living in these times. Some of the men that I invited to-day to speak on this platform perhaps think so. However, there is one thing that we must not forget, before all and above all, viz., that we live in times when every man expects each other to do his duty. (Cheers.) These are the times for duty; we must perform our duty. If we perform our duty well, genera<lb></lb>tions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210123"></xptr>
               <p>yet unborn will bless us; if we perform our duty ill, generations yet unborn will curse us. What is that duty? The <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> of last week says our duty is to sympathize with Ireland; the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> says well. Is our duty to end there? My friends, our duty is to sympathize with Ire<lb></lb>land; yes, our duty is to pity Ireland; yes, and our duty is to help Ireland (loud cheers); and I will tell you how we will help her the best way we can. (Loud cheers.) I am not going to tell you, 'Gentlemen,' or 'Friends, in God's name, get arms! for that is sedition; I am not going to say, 'In God's name, get pikes! 'for that is felony; but I am going to say, in God's name, get umbrellas, for the rain may fall (laughter); I am going to say, in God's name, get great coats, for the winter is coming, and you might catch cold. I am not going to tell you my opinion of the Government of this country; you all pretty well know that; but I will give you the opinion of somebody else; and as this man is a long way off, I do not think that the Government will be able to catch him; and that is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>. I am reading from a stamped newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, the most loyal paper in all the world, and therefore there is no treason in that. This is what Brother Jonathan thinks of the British Government. They say we are a nation, you and I, we are a nation, Say they, grovelling in abject slavery;' there is a shame: a narrow oligarchy is grinding the masses of our population to powder; it rules taxes and plunders the State for its own lucre and ambition; the Church, the Law, the Army and the Navy, and the Crown, are kept up only to satiate its hungry maw, and aggrandize its power. 'The middle classes' says Brother Jonathan, (I do not say so,) 'are either slaves or toadies; the lower classes only slaves. Chartism, says Brother Jonathan, 'is the natural and true expression of the popular feeling; the unconcealed wish of the majority of the people is fora republic, and they are only kept in check by the terrors of military force.' And now something to the point that has called us together to-night We will quote Brother Jonathan again, because they cannot catch him. 'If ever there were a people,' says the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>—which, mark you, is the organ of the War party, and the War party in America is now getting the ascendancy, and that is another sig<lb></lb>nificant fact—' If ever there were a people who had cause to rise and strike down their tyrants, the Irish are that people; if there ever was a time to do it, the present is it. The crisis may be delayed till after the harvest, but we are inclined to think that it will come then beyond all peradventure. They will gain an accession to their ranks, from Mr. Mitchell's conviction and trans<lb></lb>portation, of thousands who have heretofore opposed their movements; and if, after rising in arms, they can but hold their ground for five or six weeks, their example will assuredly be followed by Chartists;'—I do not say so, it is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald;</hi>—'and the result will be the downfall of the great tyrant of the universe,—one of the most corrupt, tyrannical, grinding, and despotic governments that Providence ever permitted to afflict a world. In this downfall the nobility and aristocracy, the well-fed puppets of the government, they who have lived on the fat of the land, and revelled in luxury, purchased by the sweat and anguish of a nation, will be crushed to atoms.' (Loud cheers.) If I am not detaining you too long, I will read you another extract—(Cries of 'Go on')—because, you know, I was told the other night that I was a very good general, that I should not get into <hi rend="italic">quod</hi>. It would be more luck than judgment, in my opinion, however. The last evening I spoke, I only prayed something. It does not say in the Act that we must not pray; it only says that we must 'not imagine, compass, or devise. To-night I am only reading something. The Gagging Bill does not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210124"></xptr>
               <p>say we must not read; so you see I like to do everything according to law Brother Jonathan says again,: 'By the last arrival from England, we have some indications of the policy which England has shaped, and which, from all appearances, she is determined to pursue. It is not a direct, open, and honest policy, such as Russia has marked out, but a mean, pitiful, sneaking and underhand system of petty intrigue, and Machivælian deception, which has always characterised her Government from time immemorial. It is the same system which she has so successfully thus far used towards Ireland, and by which she has been enabled to retain her dominion over that of Ireland, in despite of the wishes of its people, and in direct contravention of all princi<lb></lb>ples of justice, human and Divine. Fearing the powerful republic, its increase, its stability, and its future greatness, and knowing herself to be powerless to oppose any obstacle in its way, this wicked, atrocious, and diabo<lb></lb>lical government has embarked in a policy which would disgrace the Thugs of India. She dare not meet the republic in the field, and there manfully and honourably dispute the spread of the principles of free government in Europe. The first shock of battle would show her nakedness, and pros<lb></lb>trate her; but she can play the assassin; she can stab her enemy in the back, as she has done on former occasions, and as she is attempting to do again, but it will be seen with what success eventually. The policy which she has determined upon is to send abroad her agents for the purpose of in<lb></lb>triguing with the people and with the governments of the continental nations; of putting the people against the governments, and the governments against the people; of inciting the masses to rise for their rights, and inciting the governments, when the masses have risen, to massacre them, as has been done in Naples; there is not only every probability but it is almost a moral certainty that the late dreadful massacres in the city of Naples, were the work of this treacherous and mean government: through the agency of its intriguers; at the present time there is no doubt that England has her agents scattered throughout all Europe'—of course she has, she has them scattered in Milton-street Theatre, 'whose missions are of this character, and who if successful would deluge Europe with the blood of her people, and re-establish amid carnage and desolation, monarchy in France, and stop the progress of the principles of free government from making further headway in Europe. These are the despicable and underhand means which this assassin govern<lb></lb>ment has resorted to, to overthrow France, not daring, as we have before stated, to measure lances with the giant republic;'—now, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> says, in answer to this, that England 'has no more to dread from the navies of France than she has from the armies of America, but she will meddle with the internal affairs of neither, not because she dreads the strength of either, but because' and I think so too, 'but because she respects the rights of Nations and recognises the value of peace. Now there is an important question in the Bill, 'Is Ireland up <hi rend="italic">V</hi> I am not in the cabinet; I am not in the coun<lb></lb>cil;"—(a person behind the speaker here handed him a slip of paper)—"oh yes, I know Lord John Russell was found guilty once by a Galway jury, but there has been more juries than the Galway jury sit upon Lord John Russell; but the question is asked in the Bill 'Is Ireland up?' I think you will all own that she has been down long enough; and another thing you will own too, I think, that it is time that she was up, and if she do not get up herself as one man, serve her right for being down, serve any willing slave right, serve any one right that kisses the chains that bind them, it is only a shame that the innocent should suffer with the guilty, and those who pant for liberty should still be in bondage, while some are slaves at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210125"></xptr>
               <p>heart, but I hope that Ireland is not a slave at heart, and the time is fast approaching, perhaps at this moment she is at it, and if she is, God of the suffering poor defend the right! In ancient times the question was asked, 'How long, O Lord, how long shall tyrants reign?' I ask that question. again; I say, 'How long, oh Lord, shall tyrants reign?' Tyrants have reigned in Ireland for seven centuries nearly, and I hope that those who have mocked her sufferings and starved her, may now meet with the reward they merit, whoever they are. But what would Ireland do if she had he nationat say some people; what has that to do with me as an Englishman. The Irish have a right to govern themselves; if they govern themselves ill, the rod will fall upon their own backs. Why should eight millions of Irish<lb></lb>men, merely because they are Irishmen, be called the most stupid people upon the face of the earth? if they govern themselves ill, they will have all the consequences; if they govern themselves well, they will have the advan<lb></lb>tage of all being well. But let the Irish nation, as every other nation, govern itself by its own laws; some people say, what have the English to do with it? The English I consider, if they are democrats at heart, have to do with everything that is oppressive and unjust. They have raised their voice against injustice and oppression in Poland. Why not raise their voice when oppression and injustice is perpetrated in Ireland? Lord John Russell said yesterday, when some of the Irish members of the House of Commons were told by his lordship to go to Ireland, where they were wanted to make peace, they said, 'But will you not give us some remedial measures—something by way of an olive-branch, to take to Ireland;' 'No,' said Lord John Russell 'you must go without any remedial measures at all.' I say the govern-ment are acting either very roguish or very insane, and therefore I say, openly and advisedly, that neither a roguish government, or an insane government ought to exist. But the same gentleman says that we do not want any reform—why, Gentlemen, I am ready here to assert, and as I love discussion, I would discuss it with anybody, that there is something rotten in the political state of England—that, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot there is nothing but wounds and putrifying sores. But Monarchs, Aristocrats, Lords, Free-Traders, Special-Constables, and Blue Devils, have all done that which. they ought not to have done, and have left undone that which they ought to do; and if there is one monopoly more than another in this country; it is the monopoly of legislation—one in seven has no voice in this country, and while that is so, we are virtually slaves. If there is one abomination in Ireland more than another, it is the English Church as by law established; and I advise you as soon as you have threepence about you, to read the <hi rend="italic">Black Book of England</hi>, published by Cleave, and learn, and mark well, and inwardly digest too, and you will find that Lord John Russell was very foolish, and told lies too, when he stated that the people of England wanted no reform. But some of them tell you that the great cause is the surplus popu<lb></lb>lation in England and Ireland; that is just what I believe myself, and I think that that is about the first time that the Government and I have ever agreed. But so it is, there is too many bishops, there is too much aristocracy, there is too many drones to live upon the bees.—I wish to God they would emi<lb></lb>grate, I would not send them to heaven, though there is no question about that, for they would not be let in, nor would I send them to hell, for I should not be uncharitable enough to do that; but I would send them to some remote quarter of the globe, and let no one go there but the bishops, and those persons. I say that a system of emigration is a very good thing, and the sooner these fellows emigrate the better. With these few remarks, I beg.</p>

               <p>leave to reiterate the sentiment, whether it be treason, or felony, or sedition or no. I beg leave to reiterate the sentiment that is now in my bosom, for I always like to say what I mean, and mean what I say, notwithstanding the consequences that may ensue, for the truth ought to be spoken. I reiterate the sentiment, that Ireland is justified in rising up in arms against those who have oppressed her, and God grant she may win, and I say, in the language of the poet of last week,</p>

Q.</hi> The meeting was announced by placard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—a person named Nash was turned out of the body of the meeting, but was after<lb></lb>wards admitted, and made a speech—I did not know his name at the time he was turned out, but when he came forward and spoke, I put it down.—(<hi rend="italic">The extracts from the</hi> New York Herald, <hi rend="italic">as given in the defendant's speech, were here read from the</hi> Times, <hi rend="italic">with the editor's remarks</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I shall detain the Court but a very few moments; and there is one thing, at all events, true in my speech, if there is nothing else, and that is, that I have not much judgment, not with standing all the 'cunning and talent, ability, eloquence, and wit' that I have displayed, according to the remarks of the learned Attorney-General; evidently I have not had much judg<lb></lb>ment, or I should not have been placed in this position; and permit me to state, that I stand here this day unaided by counsel, not because I have any idea that I can defend myself in anything like a lawyer-like manner; on the con<lb></lb>trary, I am a poor, uneducated working man, with no pretensions to learning; but the reason is simply that I have no money to provide professional aid, and if I had, I should consider that money better applied in relieving the necessities of my wife and family, who are placed in a poor and destitute posi<lb></lb>tion by my apprehension. I hope, therefore, Gentlemen, taking these facts into your consideration, that you will listen to the few remarks I have to make, just as calmly and dispassionately as you would to those of the highest law authority in this realm. You will agree with me, I think, Gentlemen, that it cannot be said of the laws of England, notwithstanding the learned counsel has told you in his opening address, that the law of sedition is very plain, and that any man can understand it; still, after all, I think you will agree with me, that it cannot be said that the laws of England are so plain and intelligible that a wayfaring man though a fool should not err therein; on the contrary, most men say that for the most part they are so inexplicable as to confuse the minds of the wisest of men. I shall not, therefore, attempt to enter into the labyrinths of that law, by following the learned counsel through its mazes, but I shall ground my defence upon principle, and upon principle alone. Gentlemen, I am a <hi rend="italic">Chartist</hi>—I avow it in this place—a conscientious <hi rend="italic">Chartist</hi>. I firmly believe that the principles of <hi rend="italic">the Charier</hi> are based upon sure foundations; that they are true, and if I suffer for the pro<lb></lb>mulgation of those principles, I shall not be the first by thousands that have suffered for the truth's sake; and let me tell you, Gentlemen, that although these Government prosecutions may be detrimental; for the time being, to the individual victims, I do think, and I here avow it, that they will rather accelerate than retard the democratic cause, because that democratic cause is the cause of justice, and must ultimately prevail, in spite of all opposition—in the language of Charles Mackay, that beautiful poet of the people—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210127"></xptr>
               <p>" The truth will yet come uppermost And justice will prevail." 'I am charged in the warrant issued for my apprehension, with maliciously endeavouring, by the words I uttered on 28th July, to incite the Queen's subjects to anarchy and rebellion. I deny that charge most emphatically, and with indignation. I hold that there is no maliciousness, no wickedness, in the free expression of one's firmly-rooted political opinion. There seemed to be no maliciousness, no wickedness, on the part of the Whigs when they were out of office in using exciting language; and yet I need not tell you that language as violent was uttered by the Whigs when out of power and place, as was used by your poor, humble fellow-countryman on 28th July last. The policeman who apprehended me has in his possession a paper, which was read in evidence against me at the Mansion-house; it was a mere extract from Goldsmith's History of England—a work certainly not seditious, and which I should like to have had for the purpose of preparing my defence in something like a uniform order, but that book, as well as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper of July 7th, was denied me by the authorities of the prison, though they were left at tie gate by my wife. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Cope, in answer to an inquiry from the Court, stated that he was not aware of any papers or books having been left at the gaol for the prisoner. The extract he referred to teas here handed to him by the policeman</hi>.) The papers are not at the gate now, my wife would not leave them. I merely wanted the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper for the purpose of showing that I did not say anything but that which was in the paper, but as it has been read, it is of no material consequence. But this is the extract from Gold<lb></lb>smith's History of England, and I think it is particularly applicable to the present time, and to my case; it is a portion of a speech of Mr. Curran, M. P., in 1796, relative to freedom of speech—he says: 'Freedom of speech is essential to all real liberty, and none but those who were conscious of wrong would attempt to impose silence upon the people. The public voice sounds harshly in the ears of bad ministers, whose fears prompt them to abridge the liberties of the nation, but he trusted that his countrymen would not tamely submit to such insult and oppression; it was only in meetings that the real sentiments of the people could be manifested; and if this right should be annihilated, all opposition to ministerial tyranny, either in or out of Parliament, would be crushed, and the democratic branch of the constitu<lb></lb>tion would be overborne by the Crown and the aristocracy.' Those were the sentiments of a member of Parliament in 1796, and that which was true then may also be said to be true in my case. It is only for freedom of speech—for I have done nothing, I have committed no moral wrong—it is only for freedom of speech that I stand here this day; it is only for exercising that acknowledged right of an Englishman, that a strong government has thought proper to lay violent hands upon your humble fellow-countryman; and why? doubtless because the Whig ministry are at their old game again—finality; notwithstanding their promises out of office, they are endeavour<lb></lb>ing to stop, by tyranny, the onward progress of all reform: they are endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">gag</hi> the mouths of your starving fellow-countrymen, not by acts of justice, but by acts of oppression; and in doing this they are flattering you; they are calling upon you, Gentlemen of the middle classes for the time being, just to serve their turn, and then they will grind you down also. Disappoint them, Gentlemen; show by your ver<lb></lb>dict this day, that acts of oppression and tyranny are not the means in these times to stifle public opinion; but if they want to continue in place and in power, let them do justice to all, to the working classes as well as to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210128"></xptr>
               <p>middle classes, or let them make room for better men. The learned coun<lb></lb>sel, I believe it is the Attorney-General, urges that I uttered a seditious speech, of a violent and inflammatory nature, and to persons of a violent and inflammable nature, too. That is not right; I did not assemble the people together; if they wort the 'lower order of Irish, (I saw plenty of English<lb></lb>men among them), it was not my fault; and if they had been, I presume that the lower order of Irish me men, are human beings, subject to the same difficulties, and to the same feelings as other men. Surely this cannot be urged against me; the assembly that was there met—they were men, and for aught I know, honest men, though perhaps not dressed in fine linen; not persons of the higher station of society, but still men. I uttered a seditious speech, says the learned Attorney-General. After all, what did I say? First, I gave it as my opinion that the democratic principle was founded on justice; that the principles of democracy were the principles of truth; and I believe that I spoke the truth in so stating, whether it be sedition or No. I also gave my humble definition of respectability; not in an eloquent style, that I could not do, for I am sell-taught, but I gave my definition of respectability, and that definition was simply that labour was the source of all wealth. I may have been mistaken in my views, but I apprehend that I uttered no sedition. Thousands upon thousands of the best and wisest of men in this country have laid that political doctrine down as an axiom not to he contro<lb></lb>verted. I believe so too; I reiterated that doctrine. I repeat I may be mis<lb></lb>taken, but I apprehend that in reiterating that, I uttered no sedition. I said, thirdly, in contradiction to Lord John Russell's assertion some time ago in the House of Commons, that we wanted no reform, that we did want reform. Surely it would be vain to take up your time in endeavouring to dilate upon the various reforms which men of all classes admit to be necessary. There is scarcely a man that has studied politics, but will admit that there are some reforms necessary in the state. I added, it is true, that all had done that which they ought not to have done, and left undone that which they ought to have done. Was that sedition? the mere political application of Holy writ? I have been told so by the reverend Ordinary in Newgate, time after time in the reading-desk since I have been here; and I said so at the meeting at Milton-street theatre: I uttered no sedition surely in saying those words. But fourthly, and upon this point the Attorney-General has spoken very strongly, I read extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, according to the remarks of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>. Now remember, Gentlemen, that whether those remarks be of seditious tendency or no,—for I admit my ignorance, I do not know that there is any shame in my saying that I admit my ignorance of the law,—he it remembered these remarks were not mine; that, the evidence this day incontestably proves,—I see that the Attorney-General by his pen and ink, is about to answer me,—the evidence of Mr. White incontestably proves that those remarks were not mine; but that, on the contrary, I interlarded those observations by giving an opinion contrary to the remarks of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, and actually agreed cor<lb></lb>dially with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> thereupon. Now then the question arises, whether the mere reading of these extracts constitutes sedition; if it does, then I plead ignorance of the law; and I humbly but naturally conclude that, if I am to suffer for reading these extracts, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> will be punished for printing them. I read them to 800 or 1000 persons, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> circulates about 30, 000 copies daily; if 1 am to be punished for merely reading them, then, in common justice, it may not be the law, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> ought to be punished for printing them. Certainly this is logic if nothing else is, that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210129"></xptr>
               <p>I could not have read them if he had not printed them. Well, Gentlemen, I expressed sympathy with Ireland—unhappy Ireland, and this is a crime! expressing sympathy for the sufferings of millions of my fellow-men. I said that it was our duty to help Ireland: did I say that it was our duty to help her with arms and ammunition? did I say it was our duty to help her unconstitutionally? I did not; I added that I hoped that those who had starved and plundered her would meet with the reward they merited; mean<lb></lb>ing of course the great landed proprietors in Ireland; and what does that amount to? Simply that I am no friend to the unnatural relationship exist<lb></lb>ing between landlord and tenant in that country; a relationship which gives all protection and power to the former, and none to the latter; a relationship that causes a drain of four millions in the shape of an absentee drain; and thus leaving millions of my fellow-countrymen in a helpless condition, and not only helpless and starving, but continually starving year after year. If uttering these remarks was sedition—if giving my veto against such acts of tyranny and oppression was sedition, then I believe that millions, at all events thousands, of my fellow-men of all ranks are seditious people; for they, like me, are no friends to the unnatural relationship which exists between landlord and tenant in that unhappy country. Well now, Gentlemen, this is about 'the head and front of my offending.' I urged no riot, nor was there any; I recommended no disturbance, nor did any take place—in short, I am here merely for the free expression of my conscientious opinion; and 1 am here too, because those conscientious opinions are displeasing to a truckling Whig ministry. But, Gentlemen, I anticipate a different verdict from you. Place yourselves in my position for a moment in imagination—a poor man, with a wife and five small children to maintain, in the heaviest taxed country in the world, solely by my own exertions, literally in a distressed condition, not because I am lazy, or a drunkard, or dishonest, or a spendthrift; there is no man in or out of this Court that can lay aught to my charge in this respect, or in any immoral respect; I say literally in a dibtresstd condition, and I am merely stating that condition to show that it is no worse than that of thousands, ay millions, of my fellow men. What is the condition of the greater portion of the labouring classes of this country at the present time? Thomas Hood depicted them very eloquently and very truthfully when he said,</p>
               <p>"Work, work, work! My labour never flags; And what are its wages? a bed of straw, A crust of bread, and rags." This was in a great measure my condition, and place yourselves in imagina<lb></lb>tion in my position, and you might—yes, Gentlemen, you might—for perhaps you never felt the pangs of hunger—perhaps you never had the struggles I have had, and the thousands, perhaps millions of my fellow men have had, to get through life. I have struggled hard from my youth up to obtain an honest living for those I love; and you might have used much warmer ex<lb></lb>pressions than I did on this occasion: then, do unto others as you would be done unto; and if you do, I confidently wait your verdict of acquittal. I hope you will consider these things calmly; I am undefended, and I am a poor, humble, uneducated, working man: and consider the times—the learned counsel has told you you ought to consider the time at which I uttered this speech. You ought to consider the time in one respect—perhaps in the respect which the Attorney-General has urged, but also in another—these are exciting times, distressing times, and you ought to consider that what I uttered was in a moment of excitement; it was no written speech; a man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210130"></xptr>
               <p>may utter that at one time which at another he might think it unadvisable to say; not that I am here this day to tell you that 1 have changed my princi<lb></lb>ples.; no, those principles are engrafted in my heart; I believe them to be founded in truth; I can see nothing unnatural, nothing unreasonable, nothing immoderate in the demand of the people when they ask for the charter. I cannot see that it is just that one in nine in England, one in eleven in Scot<lb></lb>land, and one in seventeen in Ireland, of the male population only, should have a voice in the country. I might go through the principles of the charter, but it is not, of course, necessary, you have all heard and read of them; I am not here to defend those principles eloquently; I cannot—you know what they are, and I think you will not see anything unreasonable or unjustifiable in my remarks. I am not here to endeavour to create pity among you; my principles are as they ever have been, and if I am to suffer in a dungeon, I shall at least have this to console me, that I am not there for any moral wrong that I have committed, but only for that which I think true and just. Take these circumstances into your consideration, and I confi<lb></lb>dently await your verdict. I hope the Searcher of all hearts will guide you right.</p>

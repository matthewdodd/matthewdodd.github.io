I suspected the prisoner as he had been in the room by himself, and reported him to our quarter-master; his box was searched, and a pair of compasses found there, that exactly fitted the marks on my box lid. The next day, I found my watch at a pawnbrokers. All the men were brought into the same room with the prisoner, and the pawnbroker came down and pointed the prisoner out among them, as the man who had pledged it. I had seen the watch the afternoon before.</p>

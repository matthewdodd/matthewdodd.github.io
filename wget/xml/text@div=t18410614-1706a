                  </hi>. I am a dealer in cattle, and live in Church-street, Kennington. On Friday afternoon, the 21st of May, I purchased a cow, and hired the prisoner to drive it to Mr. Lansdowne's, in Sharp<lb></lb>alley, the other side of Smithfield—he received it from me at the Nag's Head public-house, Battersea—I told him to leave it at Lansdowne's—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184106140178"></xptr>
               <p>for driving it, and gave him some money for some beer—I saw no more of him till last Saturday week, when the policeman took him into custody— in consequence of what I was told, I went to Atchelor's, a horse-slaughterer, which is the next yard past Lansdowne's, on the Sunday following, the 21st, and saw my cow there alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse<lb></lb>slaughterer. On Friday evening, the 21st of May, the prisoner brought a cow to my yard—I asked whether he wanted me or Mr. Lansdowne—he said, No, he did not want Lansdowne, he had orders to take it to the knacker's-yard—he said his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> was coming—it rained very hard, and he waited for three hours—the cow was not fit for a butcher—it was in a dreadful state—he said he knew what it cost, and what he was to sell it for, if he could get a customer on the road, but he did not meet a customer on the road, and so he brought it to ray yard—he said he wanted 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said I would not give any such money as that for it, it was not worth it, I would give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he did not know whether it was right or not, would I return the cow in the morning if his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> did not like to take the money—I said I would—I gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he then left—the cow was in my place about a fortnight, and then died—it was a complete bag of bones—I was not at home when the prosecutor came and saw it—I boiled the carcase for the <hi rend="italic">canine.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live in Angel-gardens, Shadwell. Oh the 26th of April, in the morning, I went with the prisoner as far as the hospital and drank with her once going, and once coming back—we lived in the same house—we got home about two o'clock in the afternoon—she went out again, and returned about three o'clock, and went up to bed—I set about cleaning the hearth—while I was doing it she came down stain sat down by the fire, and began talking, but I never noticed what she was saying; and instantly she <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the fire-shovel, and struck me on the head with it twice—she took it from the fire—I fell down, and was quit senseless for some minutes—I was just getting up when I was coming too when she struck me the second blow—that was after I recovered my senses—I had not had any words with her, when we were drinking together—she was not ill, but in liquor—I was not so—I did not drink as much as she did—the went out afterwards—while I was out I drank at much at her—she appeared more in liquor when she came in after going out—Eliza Coleman was in the room at the time—the prisoner lets out rooms—I never saw her do any work—I go out washing and cleaning, when I can get it-some blood came from my head, but not a great deal.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 26th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon—she appeared to be very stupid, as if she had been drinking a good deal, and had just got out of sleep—I asked her how she could think of using the woman in the way alp had done—she said, "I did it, and will do it again; I will have herb—life"—she got up, and made a rush at her, but I pulled her back, and prevented her—she was very drunk at the time.</p>

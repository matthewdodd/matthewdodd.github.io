               <p>Court. Did you first of all make him any promise? - Not previous to that confession, but afterwards I promised to shew him lenity if he would confess: the first confession that Boot made was, that there were some whole pieces of Irish stole; he said he had stole a whole piece of Irish, and given it to Jenny; in consequence, I went down into the kitchen, and she acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Upon this first examination, what did he say? - I asked him how long it was since the first cloth was stole, and he acknowledged there had been a whole piece of cloth stole, and that he had given a piece to Jenny; I went down to her, and she said there was a whole piece of cloth, and something else in her room, and if I would go with her, she would shew it to me; I believe she said that John had stole it, and given it to her; I went up stairs with her into the room; in searching the bed, before I observed that one side of the bed was open, and I took out a whole piece of Irish, part of a piece of callico, and part of a piece of swan skin, cut off the piece; she said it was distress that had driven her to it; she had two children, and was not capable of maintaining them.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you made any promise to her, or the other? - After some time; I got Mr. Fletcher from the Rotation office to come to our house, and he examined them separately; I took care they never should get together; and after examining them for some time, we made them a promise of lenity on their confession.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not have any thing mentioned after this confession was made? - It is impossible for me to tell the particular time when that promise was made, it was after Mr. Fletcher had examined them some time; the only promise that was made, he told them if they would confess, it was in my power to shew them mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a doubt about the time, I shall not receive it? - I am not positive sure as to the time the promise was made.</p>
               <p>What were those pieces of Irish worth that he owned at first he had taken, and given to the prisoner Edwards? - Twenty-five yards cost three shillings and nine-pence a yard, worth upwards of four pounds; he owned that he gave that to

               <p>Down to this time, you had reason to suppose her an honest woman? - I had no reason to suppose either of them otherwise, till I found them so.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that this woman old you she had some family, is that true? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100024"></xptr>I believe she has three children instead of two, all of them young.</p>

               <p>Was the hinges of it sound or not? - I do not know that it was, I believe it was not; she opened it with a key.</p>
               <p>How long had the man lived with you? - Near eleven months.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of Charlton? - I have seen her, she lived with a lady in Portland-road; she was not a servant of our's; the prisoner was a porter, he had business in the shop; the woman was a maid of all work; we have a nursery maid beside.</p>

This young man was to come to lodge with me on the very day that the house was robbed; and before that, he brought three or four pair of stockings, and desired me to lay them by for him, and some handkerchiefs, and desired me to hem for him, and some he desired me to lay by; he brought these stockings some time before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These stockings are mine, here is a private mark; I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>

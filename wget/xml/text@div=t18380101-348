                  </hi>. I am a hosier and outfitter. I live at No. 78, Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras—I am the house<lb></lb>keeper—the prisoner was in my service about two months—I discharged him—he continued loitering outside my premises after he left—he was constantly seen about the premises—he had been my errand-boy, and lived in die house when in my employment, and had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had a box there which he left—as I suspected him, I would not give it up without first searching it—it was locked—I did not open it in his presence, as he left my house and went to Saffron-Walden the same night—I heard nothing more of it for a week or ten days—his mother then came to me, and wished to see the contents of the box—I told her I was very busy, but if she would call in a week or so I would attend to her—she did call again, and I burst the box open in her presence—I found in it a coat, two pairs of browsers, eighteen yards of silk, and two handkerchiefs, which are mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—I have a private mark on them—I had not sold them—his box was locked—nobody could have put the articles in after he left.</p>

I went to Saffron Walden on Tuesday, the 19th of December, to look for the prisoner—I found him on the 20th of December there, at Mrs. Granger's—I asked him if his name was Miller—he said it was—I asked if he knew Mr. Parnell, of London—he said he did—I said I was come to apprehend him on a charge of felony, for robbing Mr. Parnell—he said he knew nothing of it himself—Mrs. Granger was present, and she said to him, "Jeptha, know nothing of it, you cannot tell who has been at your box, which has been left there this length of time"—I took him into custody, and as I brought him away, he said, "Never mind, they cannot hang me for it this time."</p>

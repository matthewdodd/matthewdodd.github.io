               <p>WAKE'S Defence (written). Joseph Wake confesseth, as follows: That he was at marbles (in the field) with Thomas Gadbury, when Thomas Bransom came up, and took us to Hart's-lane, and shewed us a small black bag, when Thomas Gadbury said, "That's my father's bag," from which Thomas Bransom took 25s., and gave the bag to Thomas Gadbury, who gave me (Joseph Wake) 25s. out of it, and kept the remainder I and Thomas Bransom proposed going together to the play.</p>

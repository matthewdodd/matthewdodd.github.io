                  </hi>. I am a patrol. On the night of the 19th of August I was patrolling at Bedfont-at a quarter before eleven o'clock, my attention was attracted by the prisoner Hibbard passing from the Black Dog-yard with a sack on his back—I said, "Holloa, what is that?"—he did not answer the first time I called—the second time he said it was corn—I asked where he was going with it—he said, to Hibberd's—I accompanied him to his door—I asked where he got it from—he said from Walker's yard, he got it from a man, but did not know his name—I took him back to the yard, and there he threw the sack down, and denied knowing any thing about it—Mr. Walker came down, and Hibberd denied that he knew any thing about it—Mr. Walker said, "You had better tell who it was gave you the corn"—Mr. Walker's men were called, and then Hibberd pointed oat Lewis, and Lewis said that he had lent him the corn.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called up that night, and found Hib<lb></lb>berd in company of the officer with the sack of corn-Lewis was brought down, and Hibberd pointed out Lewis—I saw the corn—I am positive it was some of mine.</p>

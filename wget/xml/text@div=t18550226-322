                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. In consequence of information from Mr. Rider, I went to his counting house, in Bartholomew-close, on Sunday, 4th Feb.—I found a desk broken open—I took Turner into custody at the warehouse, on Monday, 5th Feb.—he gave me an address, and I went there, and found a Cash box, which had been stolen, at Turner's lodging, at No. 2, Maidenhead-court—both Turner and Black lodge there—Black's mother keeps the house—his mother told me, previous to Black coming, that she was his mother—I waited till Black came home—I told him I was a police officer, and I must take him for being concerned with Turner in stealing a cash box from Mr. Rider—I asked him if he had the key of his box—he said, "Yes," and he gave it me—I asked him if the key had been out of his possession—he said, "No"—I found this cash box in Black's box; and these screw drivers, and the ends of the screw driven which had been broken off, I found in the desk which had been broken open—Black denied all knowledge of it, but at the station house he said, "I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Turner, which I have spent."</p>

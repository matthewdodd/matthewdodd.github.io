            . I was servant to Mrs. Porter; I put the goods into the room when the prisoner took the room; I know these things to be the property of Mrs. Porter.</p>

               <p>Wilkinson. There had been words about the work; she worked with my mistress in the making of soldiers clothes; they had words about the work, and about the things; the prisoner and her husband took other people's work, and would not work for my mistress; they worked for my mistress till about two months after she missed the things: she was to work the money out; but as she would work for other people, and not for my mistress, then my mistress call'd upon her for these things.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Porter. How came you, when you knew these things were gone, not to take her up?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Porter. Because she sell a crying, and said she would soon get them out again: I expected they would bring them home, but they did not, and the prisoner abused me so that I could not live in my own house for her.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Porter. When did you first know of her pawning these things?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Porter. I first knew of it about two months ago: I believe I miss'd the tea-kettle about a month ago; the prisoner never made but one coat for me after I miss'd the things.</p>

She said "Yes, I have been with that dirty w----." I threw a beer can at her, and some of the beer went down the children's necks. I said "If you are going to try on that little game I will go out," and I did so. She kicked the panel of the door clean through, I picked one child up to kiss it, and my wife slipped down five stairs into a little nook, I passed her there and she said "Will you go, you b----s----, I will come out and show you up." I said "I will go up stairs with you," and she went up and sat down. I took up one of the children and wiped the beer out of its neck. She then hit me three times over the face with a broom, and said "You shan't be my b----y master." I pulled it out of her hand, and she fell on the landing; I thought she had gone into the back room; I rushed out after her and fell over her as there was no light, and must have kicked her in that way. I did not get up at first because I was stunned. She called Mrs. Abbott, who came up, and said to her "My husband has kicked me. "Mrs. Davis came and said "Have you got any brandy in the house?" I said "Yes, a quartern." I poured out a glass of brandy, and my wife said "I don't want your b----s----brandy." We all three had dinner together at 2 o'clock, and then Mrs. Mitchell told me to fetch a doctor, but my wife motioned for Mrs. Mitchell to go, and as soon as she had gone, my wife said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, help me out of bed" I did so, and helped her in again. We kissed each other, and she said "Don't fret, my dear, it is more my fault than yours, if I had not drank so much rum last night it would not have occurred."</p>

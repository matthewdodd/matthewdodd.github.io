I will run this through his face"—I said that before the Magistrate—she struck me on the back with the poker, and I did not see my husband after that—I did not see him, five minutes after she hit me with the poker, standing perfectly unhurt—I said before the magistrate, that when I came back, I could not see him standing up—I saw him standing all right about a minute after Mahoney had the poker—it was about a minute—I never said five minutes—I did not run far, but round a corner—not twenty yards—I ran after the poker, remained about a minute, and then I came back, and found my husband lying on the ground, bleeding—I did not see who knocked him down—I did not hear Miles say that he would commit wilful murder, but I was told so.

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, of 2, Elizabeth-place—on Christmas eve I was standing up against the door, and saw the female prisoner stoop and pick up something, which she threw at Shea—I cannot say whether. it hit him, but he continued standing—she threw something at him again—I do not know whether she hit him, but he still stood—I did not see her throw a third time—Miles then came up, stooped, picked something up, and threw it at Shea—my mistress was standing by my side—I turned to speak to her, and at that moment I heard them say that the man was dead.</p>

I live at 2, Elizabeth-place—on Christmas eve there was a confusion and disturbance in the house—<hi rend="italic">Pat</hi> Mahoney, the prisoner's husband, was there, and me, and an old gentleman who died, who lived with me, and the two Mahoneys and their wives—an argument was going on between me and <hi rend="italic">Pat</hi> Mahoney, about Bermuda in the West Indies—he asked me if I had been there—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You are a liar"—I said, "I am not," and he hit me a violent blow in the face, which drew blood—I got up and struck him, and Miles and the female prisoner, who lived in the same room, came, and the female prisoner called for her hus<lb></lb>band—they all seized me, and threw me on the ground, and kicked me, and Shea came in to take my part—he asked if I was inside—the answer was that I was not, but I was—Miles ran to the door and said that he should commit murder—he seized Shea, and threw him against the front door, leading to the street, then gave him a violent blow in the centre of the chest with the clenched fist—he would have fallen down, only the wall pre<lb></lb>vented him—Donaher came and brought him out and pacified him—he was followed by Mahoney and his wife—I do not know what occurred after<lb></lb>wards, for I was looked up by the landlord for protection, because Michael Mahoney's wife was going to bring a razor to out my throat—when I was locked in, Miles came to the door, and said, by God, he would commit murder, if I did not come out, but he did not mention my name—that was before the deceased came in at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Alexander-terrace—on 24th December, between 10 and 11, I was sent for, and examined Shea—I found him lying on a bed suffering from a compound fracture of the frontal bone above the right eye—there was a lacerated wound about an inch and a half long, which penetrated to the bone—I could put my finger between the pieces of the bone—there was also a compound fracture of the left lower jaw; that is, a cut as well as a fracture—a brickbat or some hard instrument would cause it—the instrument need not project to drive pieces of bone into the brain; any instrument will do it—he remained insensible till Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning—he gradually sank, but he rallied a little, and I sent him to the hospital, as he could not afford the nourishment he required—I sent him when he could be moved with some amount of safety—an injury to the lungs which had been three weeks in forming, might be caused by a violent push—he had a slight cough three or four days after I first saw him, but I did not pay much attention to the pectoral symptoms, the cerebral symptoms were so severe—I did not see him after I sent him to the hospital—he might have had diseased lungs then; I did not examine them—the injury to the head was decidedly sufficient to cause death—it was compound fracture of the skull.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 14th January, with a wound on his forehead, and a compound fracture of the frontal bone—he was suffering from disease of the chest, and was in a very debilitated state—there was evidence of an old fracture of the jaw, which was partly united—this was three weeks after<lb></lb>wards—he lingered to the 25th January, and then died—after his death, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—he had something the matter with his lungs, which had existed some weeks—that might be occasioned in three weeks at least, possibly more, and possibly not more—I think three weeks would have done it—it is not usual for that kind of disease to be caused by an accident, but an external injury might, by debilitating his system, cause</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260099"></xptr>
               <p>sympathy in that part, so as to cause him to be affected by cold—I found a compound fracture of the frontal bone, with three small pieces driven into the brain, pressing between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the skull, and also a small abscess at the seat of injury, caused by the irritation set up by the pieces of bone—he died of chronic inflammation of the lungs, which was the im<lb></lb>mediate cause—the injury to the brain might, and in all probability would, have occasioned his death, if it had not been caused by the lungs—the injury to the jaw would not do it—the injury to the skull did not accelerate his death; he died from lung disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the skull trepanned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is usual if there is a piece of bone protruding on the brain to raise it—that had not been done—if it had been, he would have had a better chance of his life—I think, if the operation of trepanning had been resorted to, his death would have resulted, because it is a very dangerous operation—the wound itself would not aggravate the lung disease, but it would have a depressing effect on the patient, and might accelerate an existing disease; but it not being trepanned made it much more injurious—there was quite sufficient to cause death in the lungs, even if he had been injured.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a patient died of disease of the lungs, after a three weeks' illness, would not he present appearances of it previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him three weeks previously—if he had had the disease of which I speak previously, I should expect some one to have heard something about it—I cannot say, if he had enjoyed perfectly good health before, that those symptoms were occasioned on that day or afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you say that trepanning would have been a good thing to do to him, but you did not do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not know that these pieces of bone were pressing on the brain—trepanning would have been good if we knew what the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination enabled us to know—he had sufficient chronic inflammation of the lungs to have killed him—he could not have lived for years with that extent of chronic inflammation if he had not met with the injury to the head—I believe the chronic inflammation of the lungs would be aggravated by the injury to the head; it would extend the disease—general depression to the nervous system will affect the functions of all important organs, and render a patient unable to withstand the attacks of disease—when he received the injury to the skull, he might have had some inflammation of the lungs, which might not have been mortal, but which became mortal disease by the injury to the head—he might have had it and not known it, because it was comparatively slight—there was sufficient to cause death without the injury to the head in the condition I found him in—that condition of the lungs was, in all probability, brought about by the injury to the head, more especially when it is borne in mind that the man had not complained of the injury to the lungs before he was struck on the head.</p>

I live with my father, Zachariah Dockrill, at Plais<lb></lb>tow—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of West Ham—on 31st March I had two boxes under my bed, in one of which there were thirty sovereigns, and two in the other—they were both locked—on 6th April I went to the boxes and the sovereigns were all gone—one box had the lock broken, and the other the hinge.</p>

On 3rd April the key of Mr. Dockrill's house was left with me—the prisoner, who I knew before, came that day and told me that his sister Jane had sent him for the key—I knew she was in the habit of having it—Mr. Dockrill is her father-in-law—I gave him the key; he had it, I should say, quite a quarter of an hour—my place is twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Dockrill's—he brought me back the key—he had had the key before, but not lately.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time of the night? - A. About half past five. I heard one say to the other, these things stand very easy to be taken away, now is the time to take them; the prisoner then jumped upon the thing at the door, and got the petticoat from the place where it hung; it hung in the door-way. I pursued the prisoner, took him, and then conveyed him and the petticoat to Marlborough-street office.</p>

             sworn. Q. You look at that petticoat? - A. It is my petticoat, I know it by the similarity with the two others that were left; there were three only that hung up; this was taken 
when I went to the back shop.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Oxford-street; seeing these things hang out at the door, and being much distressed, I took it.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the other man that was with you? - A. He was a sea-faring man too; I was going on board the Winchelsea; this is the first time that ever I was brought in a court.</p>

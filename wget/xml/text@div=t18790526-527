I am a compositor and live at 15, Ever<lb></lb>sholt Street, Oakley Square—on 1st December, at 11.20 at night, I was in Seymour Street, Euston Square, going home—I was overtaken by three men, one of them took hold of my right wrist and one of the left; I thought at first they might be friends of mine—the third man was behind—I received a push somehow or other in the struggle—I had a kick or blow "on the ankle and fell down—I was dragged along the pathway—I felt the hands of the two men in my pockets, and I lost 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a tobacco pouch, and a knife—I became insensible—when I came to I found myself at the hospital—my leg was broken and my foot was afterwards amputated—I saw the two men at my side, I could not see the one behind me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chairmaker and live at 54, Clarendon Street—on the night of 1st December, about 11.30, I was going along Seymour Street—I saw the prisoner and two others standing round Mr. Bacchus, who was lying on the pavement—I gave evidence here in February, when two of the men, Wainwright and Phillips, were tried—I saw Wainwright and Phillips drag Mr. Bacchus across the road, and the prisoner following about 2 yards behind—I saw Wainwright put his hand in Mr. Bacchus's right-hand pocket; some money dropped out—Mr. Bacchus fell down with his foot under him—the prisoner picked up some of the money, and gave a private whistle, and Wainwright left Mr. Bacchus and went down Charles Street with the prisoner—the other two men went down Charles Street—I assisted Mr. Bacchus, and he was taken to the hospital—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was in custody on 26th April—I then saw him at the House of Detention—I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw Mr. Bacchus he was sitting on the ground—I was walking along on the other side of the street—the two men put their hands in his pockets as they dragged him along—I and Phillips</p>

               <p>took him to the hospital—I can't say the day I saw the prisoner in the House of Detention—one of the detectives in the case took me there—I was taken to seven different cells—one of the warders opened the doors for me—the police constables were not near me, they were downstairs—I had no conversation with the constable on the way—when I saw the prisoner in the cell I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The warder took me to the different cells, and opened one at a time; the prisoner was the last of the seven; I recognised him directly—on the night in question I was looking at him about a quarter of an hour, I stared at him quite hard—I thought they looked rather suspicious characters.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 472). I know the prisoner very well—I also knew Phillips, who was convicted in February; he was known as Bob Phillips—I did not know Wainwright till that time—on Sunday night, 1st December, about 11 o'clock, I was on duty in Euston Road, and saw Phillips, Wainwright, and the prisoner standing at the corner of Seymour Street—they went along Seymour Street—I had known Phillips and the prisoner before as companions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence on the trial of Phillips and Wainwright—I then said, "I noticed three men standing at the corner of Seymour Street; I know two of them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The two I knew were Phillips and the prisoner—I was not able to find the prisoner till he was taken into custody. Charles Dodd (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). On 22nd April I took the prisoner into custody at the Grecian Theatre on another charge—as we were in the cab he said, "What do you want me fori is it for that affair with Boh Phillips? if so I don't think you will do much with that; it is too far back"—I said, "No, it is for breaking into dwellings in the parish of Marylebone"—I knew him before, and Phillips also—I have seen them together many times—he also said in the cab, "Mr. Dodd, I have 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; can you be squared? take 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and let us get out of the cab"—I made no reply to that—Otway was with me In the cab, and the prisoner said to him "Take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; won't that do, Otway"—Otway replied, "Not for 80."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Underwood was also in the cab—I took McCall to the House of Detention—I told him the name of the person who was in custody—I did not accompany him to the cell—a warder took him round. John Otway (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant Y</hi>). I was with Inspector Dodd, the prisoner, and Underwood—the prisoner said he had lit, in his pocket, and asked us if we could be squared—Dodd made no answer—he then looked across to me, and said "Will you take 8, Otway?"—I said "Not for 80." William Henry Copley. I was house surgeon at University College Hospital when Mr. Bacchus was brought there with a fractured foot; it. afterwards became necessary to amputate it.</p>

             (my Fellow-Servant ) was waiting for some Bread and Cheese , which the Deceas'd had called for. I sent him to the Gunsmith's , and carried in the Bread and Cheese myself , and leaving it there , I went and dress'd myself : When I was dress'd I went in again and stirred up the Fire . The Prisoner said to the Deceas'd, Turner, Why don't you send for your Sword? the Deceas'd answer'd, You know the Reason why ; 'tis because I have got no Money. And the Prisoner reply'd , Damn your Blood, you know that I have Money enough. The Deceas'd rung the Bell, and called for Pen, Ink, and Paper, which was brought, and I went out. I did not see the Pistols brought, but between 12 and 1, as I was standing at the Street-Door (which is a Pannel distant from the Door of the Room where the Deceas'd and the Prisoner were) I heard a Pistol go off, at which I was startded, and flew from the Door to the Kennel, and presently be thought myself of the Pistols that were sent for about an Hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Council. Before the Pistol went off, did you hear any Noise in the Room like struggling?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I heard a Noise in the Room just before like walking about, but not like struggling. Immediately after the Pistol went off, the Prisoner came out of the Room, and pulled the Door to, twice, to shut it; He look'd as white and as pale as Death, and came hastily out at the Street-Door .</p>
               <p>Council. Did any Body stand in his Way?</p>
               <p>Nichols. There was an Oyster-girl putting up her Oysters at the Door; he pushed her aside, but did not push her down, and then made his Way up Church-Court .</p>
               <p>Council. Did he run?</p>
               <p>Nichols . No; he stagger'd, and seem'd to be so frighted that he could not run. My Master presently came to the Door, and asked which Way he went? I told him, and he order'd the Potter to pursue. My Master and the Porter run up the Court, but return'd and said, they could not see him.</p>
               <p>Council . Do you know why they called for Pen and Ink?</p>
               <p>Nichols . The Porter told me it was to send for a Sword.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did you see in the Room when you first went in?</p>
               <p>Nichols . No Body but the Prisoner and the Deceas'd; but the other Drawer told me there had been a Woman with them before I came.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you go into the Room soon after the Pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; in less than a Minute : The Deceas'd was sitting on the Ground betwixt two Chairs, with his Back against the Window; his right Hand was near his Knee , and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140037"></xptr> the Pistol lying on the Ground, within two or three Inches of his right Hand, with the Cock next his Hand, and the Muzzle from him. I saw Blood run out at his right Ear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The first Time you went into the Room, did you not observe Mr. Turner, the Deceas'd, walking in a melancholly-mad Posture?</p>
               <p>Nichols. When I first went in, he was walking gravely, and the second time he was singing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come out of the Room before you got off of the Steps at the Door?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was by the Kennel-side when I first saw you come out, and pull the Door to, twice.</p>

            , Master of the King's-Arms Tavern . I did not see the Prisoner come into my House, but about 11 o'Clock I saw him come out of the Room and hand Mrs. Falkingham into a Coach, and then return into the Room. I was not in the Room all the Time, till the Deceas'd was Dead. My Drawer told me, that two Gentlemen had order'd a pair of Pistols, and then, and not before, I knew that there were two in the Room. I was in the Kitchen when the Pistol went off, and my Cook said, I'll be hang'd if they have not shot one another. My Cook ran immediately and open'd the Door; I followed and looked in, and seeing the Deceas'd lying on the Ground, I flew after the Prisoner; I run up Church-Court with all Expedition, but could not get Sight of him; when I return'd I found the Deceas'd sitting on the Ground, his Head leaning to the left Side, which was towards that Side of the Room where the Door was, and the Blood was streaming from the Wound.</p>
               <p>Council. When the Prisoner handed Mrs. Falkingham into the Coach, did you see any Sword that she had with her?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently . No.</p>
               <p>Council. Had the Deceas'd any Sword on after he was shot?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently . I saw none; and I don't know of any Alteration that was made in the Room from the Time he was shot to the Time I returned from pursuing the Prisoner, which was but very short; and when I came back I lock'd up that Door, leaving every thing in the same Condition as I found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the Deceas'd's Back close to the Wainscot?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bently. Yes; quite close</p>

The Gunsmith's young Man came with a Pair, and carry'd them in; but I don't know how long he staid, for I did not see him come out again. The Bell was rung again, I went in, and the Deceas'd bid me go and see why the Gunsmith did not make haste with the other Pistols; I went, and met his Man coming down Lancaster-Court with a larger Pair, which he carry'd into the Room .

             . I am 'Prentice with Mrs. Goldfinch, a Child's Coat and Mantua-Maker , in Johnson's Court, in Fleet-Street. Mrs. Falkingham lodges at our House. On Thursday the 6th of this Month, about 2 in the Afternoon, Mr. Hiller and the Deceas'd came to Mrs. Falkingham's ; they went away again, and return'd in about half an Hour. The Deceas'd came about 5; between 5 and 6 Mr. Hiller and he quarrel'd prodigiously, they had very high Words, and talked of going to fight the next Day. The Prisoner desir'd them to be Friends, and not talk of Fighting. With much ado he persuaded them to agree, and they appear'd to be pretty well reconcil'd about Six, and sent for a Bottle of Wine, and drank to one another, and all was like to be well. I went into the Parlour, and soon after Mr. Hiller came down, and went away. It was not long before I heard a fresh Noise above; I went up and found them all 3 standing, the Prisoner, the Deceas'd, and Mrs. Falkingham. The Prisoner said, Sir, (or Damn you, Sir, I don't know which) bring Sword and Pistol; and the Deceas'd answer'd, I'll come ready arm'd. With that I came down, and they all 3 soon follow'd, and the 2 Men went into the Court, and began to quarrel and make a Noise. The Deceas'd was standing near the Door, and the Prisoner walking at a Distance. I desir'd them, if they had any thing to say, that they would come in, and not speak so loud to make a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood. The Deceas'd would not come in, but the Prisoner did, tho' he presently went out again, and then they went together down the Court, and thro' the Arch that leads to Gough's-Square. Neither of them had Sword or Pistol. Mrs. Falkingham said, they were going to fight, and sent me after them to bring them back. I took hold of the Prisoner's Arm, and desir'd him to return, but he forc'd himself from me, and went forward. The Deceas'd follow'd, and in going I heard him Name the Word Whore ; but who he meant I don't know. Between 8 and 9 I went down into the Kitchin, and found the Deceased walking about in great Disorder , and beating his Breast in a violent Passion . I asked him what was the Matter? He struck his Hand very hard upon his Breast , and said, You cannot tell; but it lies here - Damn her! she has done her worst , for she has set two Men to kill me. He named no Names, but I thought by the Word her, he might mean Mrs. Falkingham .</p>
               <p>Council. It seems the Deceased was there late and early, did he lodge at Mrs. Falkingham's ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. No; Mrs. Falkingham is a married Woman, and has lodged at our House 3 quarters of a Year. Mr. Hiller used to come to see her sometimes, but he has not been so long acquainted with her as the other two. The Prisoner used to come oftner than Mr. Hiller, but the Deceased frequented the House more than both of 'em. Mrs. Falkingham hearing what a Passion the Deceased was in, came down. He made a great Noise at her, so that she said she would go out, that she might prevent a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood. He begg'd her to stay, because, he said, Mr. Noakes (the Prisoner) was coming. She told him she'd stay for no Noakes, but go directly. His Sword lay in the Kitchin; she bid me take care of it, and lay it in her Room; and if Mr. Noakes came, to tell him they were gone to the King's-Arms in the Strand. The Prisoner came about an Hour after, and asked-if Mrs. Falkingham was within? I told him, No; she was gone with Mr. Turner (the Deceased) to the King's-Arms Tavern. He said, Very well: And seemed dubious whether he should go to them or not, and did not appear to be resolved when he went away.</p>
               <p>Council. Had the Prisoner a Sword on then?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. I am not certain; but about 11, or later, a Porter brought this Letter to me.</p>

               <p>Council. Did you let the Prisoner know that you had carried the Deceased's Sword into Mrs. Falkingham's Chamber.</p>

Mr. Turner (the Deceased) dined with Mrs. Falkingham, and after Dinner they went out, and return'd with Mr. Hiller, and they were all free and good-humour'd. The Deceased and Mrs. Falkingham order'd me to deny her to the Prisoner, if he came; and so I did. He went from the Door, but turning back presently, said, How could you deny Mrs. Falkingbam ? Says I, She is not within. Who's above in the Dining-Room? says he. Why there's Mr. Turner, says I. And with that the Prisoner went up, and found Mr. Turner and Mr. Hiller, but Mrs. Falkingham was retir'd, because the Prisoner should not see her. The Prisoner and the Deceased were good Friends; they ask'd one another how they did? and the Prisoner sat down. Mrs. Falkingham desir'd me to tell Mr. Hiller to go away, and come again in a little time, that so she might get rid of the Prisoner, who she thought would not stay when Mr. Hiller was gone. I took an Opportunity of letting him know her Mind. He went away; and both the Prisoner and the Deceased followed. Mr. Hiller return'd before Supper, and while he was there the Deceased came up, and flew into a violent Passion; Now, says he, I am a happy Man! I have met my best Friend, Mr. Noakes! (the Prisoner) He's the best Friend I have in the World! for now I have found her out! Then he desired Mr. Hiller to go with him to White's Coffee-house in Chancery Lane. Mrs. Falkingham said that he should not go, and the Deceased said that he should; For, says he, I have given Mr. Noakes my Honour upon it that you was not at Home to day when you was deny'd to him, and I have engaged, on Forfeiture of a Crown (which I have left in his Hands) that I will bring Mr. Hiller to vouch it; and therefore he shall go with me. Well, says Mrs. Falkingham, if you will force Mr. Hiller to go with you, I will go too, and let Mr. Noakes know that I was at home when I was deny'd. This put the Deceased in a violent Passion again; he swore and rav'd, and called her all the ill Words, and abused her at a strange Rate indeed. And he jangled a little with Mr. Hiller; for, says Mrs. Falkingham , you should not make this Noise, if Mr. Falkingham was at home. No, says the Deceased, and if he was, that snotty-nosed Fellow (pointing to Mr. Hiller) should not sit there, neither.</p>
               <p>Council. Where was Mr. Falkingham then?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. In the Country, for his Health. The Deceased was still very uneasy; he swore and made a Noise, and beat himself several Blows on the Breast, and was very angry. And he still insisted on Mr. Hiller's going with him. Mr. Hiller was willing, but Mrs. Falkingham would not let him. At last, a Coach was called, and she went with 'em; and none of 'em came home that Night. On Wednesday Evening, between 4 and 5, Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea; and in about half an hour the Deceased came, and another Man with him. While the Gentleman was talking to me, the Deceased went up Stairs. I heard a Noise, and followed. Mrs. Falkingham strove to shove him out of the Room; but he forced his Way in, and (going up to Mr. Hiller ) said, Damn you, Sir, you are the Man I wanted! Come down this Minute, or I'll lug you out by the Nose. Mr. Hiller was in some Confusion, and the Deceased swore he would have his Will of him; and he swore at Mrs. Falkingham too; but she would not let Mr. Hiller go out with him. The Deceased abused her, and said, I will stay then till he goes; and so sat down, but in the greatest Disorder imaginable, swearing and beating his Breast violently, till at last he had work'd Mr. Hiller up to a Passion , who then got up, and said, Pray, Sir, what Tavern<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140040"></xptr> are you for? The other answer'd, The Horn. Mr. Hiller went down, and was follow'd by the Deceased and the Gentleman who came with him. I afterwards went to enquire for 'em at the Horn, but they were gone. It was past 10, before they came back to Mrs. Falkingham's ; she was sitting with her Apron over her Face when they came up, and pulling it off, she saw Mr. Hiller first, and said, Thank God, you're come home alive; but turning her Head short, and seeing the Deceased, she gave a Shriek, and fell into a sort of a Fit. After she recover'd, Mr. Hiller said to the Deceased, Shall I proceed? and he answer'd, No, not for the World; I will not live to hear it. But, says Hiller, I will tell, and tell the Truth; and so addressing himself to Mrs. Falkingham, Madam, says he, Thank God I am come home alive! for Turner (the Deceased) has wounded me, and it might as well have been my Death as not. Then turning to Mr. Turner, he said again, Shall I proceed? No, not for the World, says Mr. Turner. But Mr. Hiller went on. We have been and fough t, Madam. We have been as far as Hyde-Park. When we were at the Horn Tavern, we sent for Swords, but the Master of the Tavern would not let us have any. But I got two at a Sword-Cutler's. We went to the Park together ; Turner would have had me to have gone on farther ; but I refused. Then draw, says he; and I did. He prick'd me in the Hip, my Foot slip'd, and I fell. He came and stood over me with his Sword. Now, says he, if you don't promise to ask Mrs. Falkingham to pardon me, you are a dead Man. It being dark, and I being frighted, I gave him my Promise; and so we return'd hither in a Coach. And now, Madam, I must desire that you would grant him your Pardon. When Mr. Hiller had spoke this, the Deceased fell on his Knees to Mrs. Falkingham , and begg'd her Pardon, and confess'd that he had injur'd her wrongfully. She said, I'll forgive you as a Christian, if you'll never disturb my Peace any more. He begg'd for leave to visit her, as formerly, she deny'd him. Then he begg'd for leave to come and drink Tea with her at 3 the next Day; which she at last consented to; and then appeared as much over-joyed and elevated as he was passionate before. And will you forgive me, says he, then I am this Night the happiest Man living! How am I obliged to Mr. Hiller for making us Friends! He was subject to very extravagant Passions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you never hear him threaten to kill himself?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. One Sunday I heard him tell Mrs. Falkingham that he would go and hang himself. He went into another Room, and she bid me go and watch him; but I laugh'd and said he had more Wit than that came to.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not the Deceased charge the Prisoner with being too great with Mrs. Falkingham ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. The Night before Mr. Turner was shot, I heard him reflect on Mrs. Falkingham for being too great with the Prisoner; but I never heard him speak to the Prisoner about it, nor never heard that they quarrelled on that account.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you never hear that Mr. Falkingham left Mr. Turner as a Guardian over Mrs. Falkingham ?</p>
               <p>Thrasher. I have heard her say that Mr. Turner said he was left as a sort of a Guardian over her by her Husband.</p>

            , Brother of the Deceased. A Day or two after Mr. Falkingham went out of Town, which, I think, was on the first of January , my Brother (the Deceased) among other Discourse said; Before Mr. Falkingham went, he desired his Wife to see no Man but me. My Brother lodged with me, and, about 9 the Night before he was murder'd, he call'd at the Door, and gave me his Pocket-Book, a Letter, and Haunthal's Overthrow , and bid me take care of 'em, and let no Body see them, and especially the Letter. I asked him, if he would come in? He said, No. I saw one with him, and asked, who it was? He said, Mr. Noakes. I did not know Mr. Noakes; and I never saw my Brother any more.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Whiscard. The Deceased came Home on Monday Night, sate down by the Fire, pulled out a Letter, and stooped down to read it by the Fire-light. When he had read it, he said to his Mother, Can't I take up a Man that threatens my Life? Yes, sure, said his Mother. Why, says he, I am threatned to be shot through the Head. Let me know who it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140041"></xptr> is, Child , said she, and I'll secure him. That would be pretty indeed, says he.</p>

Yes , Child, says his Mother, let me know who it is, and I'll take care of him. Aye! says he, that would be very pretty indeed. But, can't I swear the Peace against him? Yes, to be sure , said she. Pray, Madam, says he, put your Hand in my Bosom, and feel my Heart. She smiled; but he, repeating his Request, she did so, and declared, she never felt any thing flutter so in her Life. He was so out of Order, that he did not go to the Office the next Day, but staid till the Day following. He was Clerk at the East-India-House . We don't know who the Letter came from: But on Thursday, about two a Clock, he was sent for (by Mr. Hiller , as it was said) and he went out gay and lively.</p>

             , Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, after the Deceased was shot, I opened his Head; the Wound entred at the Right Ear, and past neither upward nor downward, but parallel. The Pistol was clapp'd so close to the Head, that no Powder appear'd on the outside, but it all pass'd into the middle of the Brain, and being confined, had split the Skull, and raised the upper-part of it, so that I had no need to make use of a Saw. If the Pistol had been held with a full extended Arm, it might have recoil'd. The two Bullets were lodged close to the Left Side of the Scull, but had not perforated it.</p>
               <p>C. Was the Pistol put into the Ear?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilky. No, but a little higher than the natural Orifice of the Ear: The Bullets split the Flap of the Ear, went thro' the Temporal-Bone, and made but one Orifice in the Skull, and one continued Wound. These are the 2 Bullets; I found 'em thus close together, and one dented against the other. The Instant the Powder enter'd the Brain, the Deceased could have no Sense, or feeling of Pain. It was immediate Death.</p>

            . I lodged White's Coffee-house, in Chancery-lane. The Deceased, and Mr. Hutton came to see me and brought the Prisoner with them. Then began to talk about Mrs. Falkingham. The Prisoner said to the Deceased, Pray was she at Home with I was there to ask for her? The Deceas'd seem'd unwilling to answer at first, but afterwards he gave the Prisoner his Honour the she was not. To which the Prisoner reply'd, If I should find that she was at Home, I hope that you will not refuse - and then mutter'd something which I could not hear. After this, I heard the Prisoner say, I would not value shooting any Man in the Head; and, if it was not for the Law, I would rob all the Company .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not that spoke in a merry Way only?</p>
               <p>Spranger. We were upon a serious Subject - Religion. He spoke of Religion in a merry, ludicrous Way, but , I believe, he was very serious in it. He said, There was no such Thing as a God; and if there was a God, that he himself was Part of the Divine Being. The Deceased went away, and brought a Lady to the Door in a Coach. I would not let her come in, because the House is a civil House, and the Woman that keeps it, will not admit of such Company. The Prisoner hearing she was come, spoke to her in the Coach, and then took his Hat and went away.</p>

             . The Deceased dined with me on Sunday. After Dinner we went together, and called on Mr. Hiller, in Hatton-Garden, and from thence we all 3 went into the City, and returned in the Evening. The Deceased desired, that I might be denied to the Prisoner, and he bid the Maid tell him (if he came) that I was not at Home. He came before Supper. Mrs. Thrasher denied me; he went from the Door, and I coming down at the same Time, I suppose he heard my Voice, for he turned about, and asked Mrs. Thrasher, why she denied me? She insisted upon it. He asked her who was above? She said, Mr. Turner (the Deceased.) He came up, I retired. He staid half an Hour, and then he and the Deceased went together, to White's Coffee-house in Chancery-lane, but Mr. Hiller staid to Supper. The Deceased left Word that he would be back again in half an Hour. He did not stay long, and when he returned, he said to me, that he had told the Prisoner, upon his Honour, that I was gone into the City, and would not be at Home all Night. I said, I was surprized that he should give his Word and Honour upon any Thing that was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140043"></xptr> false, and that I would send the Prisoner Word that I was at home. He swore and called me Bitch, and other ill Names; I asked Mr. Hiller to go with me; we called a Coach: The Deceas'd made such a Noise, and behaved himself so strangely, that he rais'd a Mob in the Street, and while the Coach was driving along, he never called for the Coachman to stop, but forced the Door open, and jump'd in. When we came to the Coffee-House, Mr. Hiller, to avoid Quarrelling, went out and left me with him in the Coach, where he abused me, and called me Names. I sent in for the Prisoner, who came out to know my Business; I told him I came to satisfy him that I was at home when the Maid denied me, and asked him to go with me to the King's-Arms at Charing-Cross, because I would not have a Noise at home to disturb the Neighbours. I desired the Deceas'd to go home to Bed, for he was much disturb'd and not in his Senses, but he would go with us. When we came to the Tavern, the Prisoner called for a Stake, for says he to the Deceas'd, You have supp'd, but I have not. The Deceas'd abused me so there, that I said it was unsufferable, and I would stay no longer, and so I desired the Prisoner to call a Coach.</p>
               <p>About 10 the next Morning, Mr. Hiller called on me, and told me if ever I suffered Turner to come into my Lodgings again I should be very much to blame, and I ordered myself to be deny'd to him. There was no bearing his Company, he made such a Disturbance.</p>
               <p>A Week before this, at Chelsea, he threatened to kill himself, and ask'd me to lend him a Penknife, he said he had ruin'd a Woman in Exeter-Street, and she had ruin'd him; he behav'd himself like a mad Man, and I don't believe he knew what he did.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday, about Four, Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea with me, in half an Hour my Maid came up and told me, the Deceas'd was below. I lock'd the Door; he forced it open. I asked him what he wanted? and why he made such a Disturbance ? he turned to Mr. Hiller, and said, I have found the Villain I wanted; come out this Moment, or I'll pull you out by the Nose. G - d damn you, I have lost my own Peace , and I care for No-body's else. Mr. Hiller slipt down and left his Hat, the Deceas'd follow'd, and they went away together. I took Coach and call'd at several Taverns to enquire after them, but could not find them. They came back after 10, says Mr. Hiller. We have been to fight in Hyde-Park , my Foot slipp'd, and Turner taking the Advantage , made me promise to get his Pardon of you. Turner ask'd Leave to come and drink Tea with me at 4 next Day; I told him, if he behaved himself civilly he might. Next Day they both came to drink Tea; the Deceas'd asked me if we were Friends? I said, Yes . But, says he, I must fight Hiller again; I will have his Blood, or he shall have mine; for I am resolved not to live. Mr. Hiller was then present. The Prisoner came up about 5, I told him I was glad he was come to vindicate me, tho' I wonder'd he should take the Liberty of saying such Things of me to Mr. Turner .</p>
               <p>Council. What Things?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham . Mr. Hiller told me that Mr. Turner said, the Prisoner had told him, that he lay with me all Night.</p>
               <p>Council. That who lay with you?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham . That the Prisoner did, and then told Turner of it, and Turner told Hiller: Upon this Turner said that Hiller had bely'd him in saying so, and Hiller insisted upon it, that Turner did tell him. The Prisoner endeavoured to make them Friends, and at last prevailed with them so far, that Hiller begged Turner's Pardon, and owned that what he had said was false. They appeared to be pretty well pacified; but as Mr. Hiller was going away, Mr. Turner, the Deceas'd, said to him, I expect to see you to-Morrow , or I'll pull you by the Nose in the India-House. I found that the Deceas'd was not yet easy, and therefore I said to the Prisoner, Let us go to the Horn to Supper and avoid him. Upon this the Deceas'd began to swear and rave, and call me Bitch and Whore. We came down to the Door, and he and the Prisoner went into the Court Mrs. Thrasher desired them to come in, and not make a Noise there to disturb all the Neighbours. The Deceas'd says to the Prisoner, If you have any thing to say to me I'll answer you. The Prisoner replies, Sword and Pistol then. With<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140044"></xptr> all my Heart, says t'other, and so away they went. I sent Mrs Thrasher after them to persuade them to come in again , but I saw no more of them till between 12 and 1 that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . In what Manner did I speak when I said Sword and Pistol?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Falkingham. You spoke it laughing, in a joaking Manner . Between 12 and 1, as I lay abed , I thought I heard them quarrelling under my Window, I got up and look'd out, and ask'd them what they meant by making that Disturbance to fright me? They both burst out a laughing and went away. Between 4 and 5 the same Morning they came again, and walked to and fro under my Window; I heard the Prisoner say to the Deceas'd, Turner, This is as bad as walking upon the Quarter-Deck at Sea, at which Turner laugh'd. I look'd out again, and said to them , Why do you disturb the Neighbourhood thus? I thought you bad bad more Sense, Mr. Noakes, tho' Turner has not. Upon this Mr. Noakes , the Prisoner, went away, and Turner sung and tanted , and by and by he fell on his Knees and ask'd me Forgiveness, and said he was the happiest Man living, and Mr. Noakes was his best Friend for reconciling us. I asked him why they came there to fight? he said 'twas only to frighten me, and then he went away. Between 7 and 8 he knock'd at my Door, the Maid let him in; I stepp'd down and ask'd him why he disturb'd me so early? says he, I have been rambling all Night, Mr. Noakes is my best Friend, and now I have no Body to make my Peace with but you. I am surprized , said I, that you behave yourself in this Manner: You have made such a Noise, and a such a Disturbance in the Court, that I must be forced to leave my Lodgings, my Landlady won't let me stay in the House any longer. G - d damn your Landlady, says he, she's an old Bitch; lend me a Knife, and I'll rip her up. I desir'd him to be easy till I was dress'd: I went and dress'd me, and bid the Maid call a Coach; he said he would not go yet, for his dear Friend Noakes was a coming. I told him he might stay if he would, but I would go; with that he threw down his Sword, and I bid the Maid take Care of it. We took Coach together, and drove to the King's-Arms, and were shown into the Fore-Room next the Street; we called for a Pint of Mountain and a French-Roll; says he, Are you sure you are Friends with me? I told him he had ruin'd me, and I must abandon my my Lodgings and go-but I knew not where. Then he cry'd and stamp'd, and pull'd a hot Poker out of the Fire, and run it against his Breast twice or thrice. I call'd the Drawer, and then he laid by the Poker and sat down. I told him I wanted to see Mr. Noakes, the Prisoner, before I went, and d esired him to tell me where he was; he said that he knew, and that Mr. Noakes was his best Friend, but that he would not tell me. I thinking he might go to the Bagnio after he went from my Window that Morning, I wrote a Letter and sent a Porter with it to the Hummums to see if he could find him; the Porter returned, but could not hear of him, and laying the Letter down, the Deceas'd took it up and read it, and then threw it in the Fire. In about half an Hour after, the Prisoner came, asked the Deceas'd how he did, and they shook Hands. Then the Prisoner ask'd me if I wanted him? I said Yes; I am going away, and thought it proper to see you before I went, that if any Reflections should be made on my Conduct, you may give me no worse Character than I deserve. The Deceas'd said, And will you go? Then I am a ruin'd Man; and burst out a crying - and you shall bear of it very soon. Mr. Noakes had on a mourning Sword; the Deceased snatch'd it suddenly from his Side, and run himself into the Breast with it; and had run himself through if we had not prevented him. He pull'd out his Shirt, it was bloody, and said, See - I have not done it effectually yet - but it's no Matter. Then he fell into a great Passion again, and sweated and swore, and behav'd himself like one distracted. Well, says I, 'tis no Time for me to stay; for since you are a mad Man I will be gone. Pray, says the Prisoner, take the Sword with you for Fear of Danger. I went from thence to Mr. Hiller in Hatton-Garden, and about 5 a Clock the same Day, I saw the Prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he take the Poker out himself? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. What sort of a Poker was it? Mrs. F. It was pretty thick, and about 3 quarters of a Yard long. Coun. How did he hold it? Mrs. F. By the middle.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140045"></xptr> Council. Was he standing or sitting? Mrs. F. He sat in a Chair, and taking the Poker, he said, I'll rip my self up with this. His Coat was open, and I think he run the the Poker against his Waistcoat. Council. After he laid the Poker down, did you take it up? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. And how did you hold it? Mrs. F. By the Top. Council. Was it hot? Mrs. F. I don't know how hot it was, I had my Gloves on, and after he had laid down the Poker, he run about the Room, and said, he was damn'd, and nothing but damnation could make him easy. Council. How did he take the Sword? Mrs. F. We were all sitting at the Table. He sat at the Prisoner's Left-Hand, betwixt him and the Fire, and starting up suddenly he snatch'd the Sword, and run round one side of the Table to the Window. He said, He had ruin'd one Woman in Exeter-Street, and now be had ruin'd me, and nothing but his Life would make amends. Council. Did you appoint the Prisoner to meet you in the Evening? Mrs. F. Yes; I desir'd him to be at the India Coffee-House about 5, and I went thither and found him. Council. Did the Deceas'd hear you make that Appointment? Mrs. F. Yes. Council. What great Business had you with the Prisoner, that you made this Assignation to meet him at a precise Time and Place. Mrs. F. Business? I wanted to see him; I did not appoint 5 a Clock precisely, I said, I would call on him in the Evening about 4 or 5, and I knew that he was usually to be found at that Coffee-House. Council. You had seen him but that Morning, why did you want to see him again so soon? Mrs. F. If I had a Mind to see him again, and again, I hope there was no harm in that. Council. To what other Places did you go that Night? Mrs. F. I was that Night with Mr. Hiller and a Relation, at the Vine in Holborn, and at a Friend's House on London-bridge. Council. When you came to the Prisoner at the India Coffee-house, did he tell you presently what had happen'd ? Mrs. F. No; I sent the Sword in by the Coachman. Council. Do you know such a Person as Mr. Falkingham . Mrs. F. Yes; he is my Husband. Council. Where is he now? Mrs. F. In Derby. Council. What Discourse had the Deceased with you about your Husband? Mrs. F. Nothing Material. Council. Did you never hear that your Husband left him to be your Guardian? Mrs. F. I have heard the Girls in the House call him my Guardian, in a merry Way, but no otherwise. Council. Who took those Lodgings for you at Mrs. Goldfinch's ? Mrs. F. My Husband. Council. Did the Deceased never tell you that your Husband had desir'd him to caution you against keeping Company with the Prisoner? Mrs. F. No. Council. You say, that as soon as the Deceased had attempted to stab himself at the King's Arms, you saw that his Shirt was bloody; did you then look in his Bosom to see if there was any Wound? Mrs. F. No. Council. You say, that he frequently behav'd himself like a Madman; How came you to venture yourself to a Tavern with a Madman? Mrs. F. I was not apprehensive that he would hurt me, for he din'd at our House almost every Day.</p>
               <p>Jame Freeman, the Gunsmith's Apprentice. The Drawer of the King's Arms came for a Pair of small Pistols with Powder and Bullets. I went with them into a Room where the Prisoner and the Deceased were. Each of 'em took one. The Deceased said that these were too small; that they wanted a Pair three times as long; and that an old Pair would do; for they only wanted to borrow them, for they were going to Windsor in a Chaise; and then he bid me fetch a larger Pair, and bring Powder and Bullets. I went back, and as I was returning, I met the Drawer coming to hasten me. I carry'd the Pistols in; each of the Gentlemen took one. The Deceased asked the Price, I told him a Guinea; for they were old Pistols. The Prisoner asked if they must leave the full Value; I told him Yes. The Deceased said, that then, one wou'd be sufficient, and gave me half a Guinea; and ask'd me if I brought Powder and Ball? I told him, Yes. He bid me charge it; and when I had put in the Powder, he bade me put in more. The Prisoner try'd with the Rammer, and said there was enough. Then I put in a Ball; the Deceased bid me put in another. The Prisoner said, Why so? Because (says the Deceased) when I do any thing, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140046"></xptr> love to do it to the Purpose; and if they come, I'll pop 'em. I suppose he meant he would pop the Rogues, if he met any. When I had loaded the Pistol, I put it into the Deceased's Hand. He open'd the Pan to see if it was primed, and then shut it again, and laid it down. The Prisoner was then standing on the other Side of the Table; that Side from the Door, and the Deceased near the Window, that Side next the Fire-place, on the Right-Hand of the Fire; I heard of the Accident in about half an hour after .</p>
               <p>Council. How did the Deceased behave himself, did he appear to be any way disordered in his Senses?</p>
               <p>Freeman. I did not see any uncommon Behaviour in him, and I thought he talked rationally.</p>

             . On Thursday Night, or rather Friday Morning, 'twixt 2 and 3; the Prisoner and Deceased, 'Rack Punch were drinking at the Rummer Tavern in Drury-Lane - for then I found 'em there, and sociable they seem'd, and drank and talk'd like Friends, till Watchmen cry'd Past 4 a Clock! The Reckoning was a Crown, Noakes paid it all. From thence we rambled to King's Coffee-house, in Covent-Garden. Ale and Orange there we drank, and still they cordial Friends appear'd - They told me that they had been serenading some Ladies, but they did not tell me who. And what (said they) is your Opinion, Sir, of such Diversion? I assured 'em that I was not fond of Catterwauling Frolicks. At 5 I left 'em, and return'd at 6, and found 'em still together very friendly. 'Twas after 7 when the Deceased arose, and asked the Prisoner if he would go with him? But he refused to go; then the Deceased bad him Good Morrow, and went out alone.</p>
               <p>Council. Did the Deceased appear to be out of his Senses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Penkethman . No, Sir, I did not take him to be mad, but rather thought he was a little silly. For he wou'd laugh at every thing that pass'd, at every Word was spoke, tho' nothing merry, nor fit to raise a Smile; the meerest Trifle imaginable wou'd set him on the twitter - When he was gone I importuned the Prisoner to cross the Water with me and two more who were in Company, to spend the Day in Merriment; (for I had then no Knowledge that I should at the Theatre be wanted) the Prisoner gave Consent, we all agreed, and down Southampton-Street we took our Way; a Servant to the Theatre by chance we met; his Business was at Tavern Doors and City Gates the Play-house Bills to fix. I view'd his Bills, and found, that very Night a Part appointed was for me to act, in Th' Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife; and by His Royal Highness's Command. Our Journey then was stopp'd, and so to the Rummer in Drury-Lane we all return'd, at 9, but did not tarry, for they had no Fire. We to the Play-house went, and breakfasted, and after 10 we parted.</p>
               <p>Council. If you had not met that Man with the Play-house Bills, should you and the Prisoner have gone over the Water together?</p>
               <p>Mr. Penkethman . Yes, we had so agreed; and I believe, had we not thus prevented been, we had spent the whole Day together.</p>

             [Helar.] On Friday Morning Mrs. Falkingham came to me in a Coach. Madam, says I, where are you going? I don't know, says she, I have left Turner and Noakes together. I saw her have a mourning Sword, and was afraid the Deceased had sent it to me as a Challenge, and begg'd her to satisfy me whether it was so or not. She said, No; but she brought it away to prevent Mischief, for Turner was very obstreperous. Several People taking notice of my talking to her at the Coach Door, I stepp'd in, to prevent farther Observation, and bid the Coachman drive on towards the City. We stopp'd at the Fountain at Snow-Hill. There she told me that the Deceased had called on her before she was up, and had made such a Disturbance that she must be forced to leave her Lodgings. The Deceased was always in a great Passion when he saw me, but would give no Reason for it. He would stamp about, and use such violent Expressions -</p>
               <p>Council. Did she tell you that Turner had attempted to kill himself?</p>
               <p>Hiller. Yes, she said he had endeavoured it two or three times.</p>

               <p>Council. Did she tell you in what Place he was when he took the Poker.</p>
               <p>Hiller . No.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you ever hear the Deceased talk of killing himself?</p>
               <p>Hiller. Yes, he has talked of it in my Hearing, and he has desired me to do it for him.</p>
               <p>Council. On what Occasion did he talk thus?</p>
               <p>Hiller. I don't know.</p>

             . I had been at the India Coffee-house, with my Musick-Master, and going out between 1 and 2, I met the Prisoner. He seem'd surprized, and said, He had just seen the Death of a young Fellow. I asked him, how? He answer'd, he shot himself. Do I know him? says I. His Name is Turner, says he, and he belongs to the India-House . Says I, You will infallibly be taken up, and therefore I would advise you to go to your Father's. Was there any Difference betwixt ye? No, says he. What was it about, then? said I. A Woman, says he, and I saw him falling as I came out of the Room, and I hardly know how I got hither. I came down Stairs with the Prisoner, between 2 and 3, and saw a Coachman give him a Mourning Sword. The Prisoner told me, there was a Woman in the Coach, and so he went away.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had felt something before the handkerchief left your pocket? A. Yes; I do not know who were the persons about me - I kept my hand on my pocket from that time till I got to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040088"></xptr>wider part, I then took off my hand, and immediately felt my handkerchief drawn from my pocket; I turned and saw the prisoner ten yards from me, and another boy - the prisoner was farthest from me, and he was shoving my handkerchief into his jacket pocket - the other boy was bigger than the prisoner; the other boy escaped - I saw no one nearer to me than the prisoner, and the other boy at the back of me - I don't know who might be in front of me; I cannot tell whether the prisoner and the other boy were in company, but I think they were; they were close together - the prisoner ran off towards the steam packet wharf; I saw him throw down my handkerchief, and I took it up and pursued him, and gave it to the officer - the prisoner was not out of my sight.</p>

               <p>Nicholas Conne. I am an engraver on glass, and live at No. 33, Princes-street, Leicester-square—the prisoner was an apprentice of mine for about a year—he left me at the end of Feb., without giving me any notice—he returned to work on the 1st March—he had been absent a week—I missed some goblets and claret glasses from my workshop, and afterwards I missed the other glasses.</p>

                  </hi> I am an assistant to George Mitford Young, of Princes-street, Leicester-square. I produce 13 glasses, which have been identified by the last witness—they were pledged with me between the 18th and 23rd Feb.—I received 11 of them from the prisoner—I lent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi> on this claret glass—the sum raised on all the glasses was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>

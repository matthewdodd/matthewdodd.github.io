                  </hi>. I am au auctioneer, living in High Street, Camden Town, and am one of the managers of the Camden Town Savings Bank. On 13th April, in the evening, the prisoner came and produced his ticket of a pre<lb></lb>vious evening, he having given notice; and he came on this night to receive his money—I have not got the ticket, they are always destroyed—it would contain the number of his deposit book—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pass book of depositor No. 5454—here is 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to the depositor—that sum was paid on the copy of the book—he had stated that the book was lost, and applied to have another one made, which was done—the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was till 21st June, but the interest was claimed till Nov. 20th, 1856—I paid him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he represented himself as John Hall—the book produced at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185705110041"></xptr>
               <p>that time was in the hands of the actuary, who handed it over to me—here is his receipt for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), at least he made a cross—I have written, "John Hall, his mark, J.

                  </hi>. I am actuary of the Camden Town Savings Bank. On 6th April, the prisoner came, and said, "I have come to give notice to draw my money out"—he gave the name of John Hall—I asked him whether it was his money, and he said, "yes"—I gave him one of the tickets—I asked him where his book was—he said that his mistress had lost it, that is where he was apprenticed—he said, "Can I have a new book"—said, "Yes, on payment of Is, "—he said, "Very well, I want to have I new book"—a person has merely to state his name, and where he lives, and pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I issue a new book to him—I turned to the declaration book, and found the number—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the declaration book, signed by the depositor when he first comes to deposit—I gave the prisoner a new book, and he signed this book by his mark, for it, in this column, headed, "We, the undersigned, do give notice to withdraw the sums affixed to our names"—it is No. 5454, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. interest—this "John Hall, his mark," is my writing—Mr. Hellender was the manager in attendance this day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Grenville Street, Somers Town, and am the widow of John Hall, a sweep. The prisoner was his apprentice when he died—my husband had an account in the Camden Town Savings Bank, and this was his deposit book—he died on 9th March—this book was in my possession, after his death—I gave it to Mr. King a week after Easter Monday, it having remained under padlock and key ever since my husband's death—I sometimes gave the prisoner money to take to the savings bank, and he brought the book back, and I locked it up—it was my husband's</p>

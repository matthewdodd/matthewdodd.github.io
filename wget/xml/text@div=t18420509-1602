                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Commercial-road. I was going home on Saturday evening, the 30th of April—the prisoner came up to me and asked where I was going—I said home—she asked me for some beer—I pulled out two sovereigns, two sixpences, and a penny, to give her 24.—she snatched the two sovereigns out of my hand—I said, "If you don't give me the two sovereigns I will give you in charge"—she gave me one sovereign back—I said I wanted the other—I saw her put something into her mouth—she would not give me the other, and I gave her in charge—she was searched at the station, and the other sovereign was not found.</p>

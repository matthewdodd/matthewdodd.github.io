            . I am a cow-keeper, and live at Mile End; I know the prisoner perfectly well. On the 9th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw him in Whitechapel-road driving two cows, one was black and white, and the other red - he was crossing the road. I asked him where he was going to with the cows? he said to sell them at Romford-market. I asked him what he would have for the red cow? he said 10 l., and 14 l. for the other. I said if he would drive them into my yard, I would look at them; he drove them in, and I asked him where he came from? he said he came from Camberwell, and his name was

            . I said I would give him 20 l. for them both, but he must call for the money at five o'clock in the afternoon. He said they belonged to his father, who was seized on, and he sold them to make up a sum - he went away. When daylight came, on examining them I found they were worth much more money - I hired a horse, rode over to Camberwell, and enquired for Mr. Smith, but could find no such a man. On my return I found Freeman had been to see me about them. I went to Lambeth-street Office to him, and stated the particulars. By agreement, he came to my house at four o'clock, and waited there till a little after five, when the prisoner came for the money. I told him I had been to Camberwell, and found no such person there as Smith. He asked me why I did not tell him in the morning that I was going, and he would have gone with me to satisfy me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170010"></xptr>Freeman then asked him where he got the cows from? he told the same story, and was taken into custody.</p>

He said he was going to Romford, and told me to drive them through Whitechapel, and if any one asked me where I was going to, I was to say to Romford-market. I met this man, sold them to him for 20 l., and said they belonged to my father. I saw the man again, and he sent me for the money.</p>

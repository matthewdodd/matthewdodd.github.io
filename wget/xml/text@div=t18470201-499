                  </hi>. I am a parchment-maker, and live in Suffolk-cottage. On the afternoon of the 6th of Jan., I met the prisoner in leather-lane—I went with her to a house in a court in Gray's-inn-lane—my watch was in my waistcoat-pocket—she caught hold of it, and got it from me—I had it fastened to a guard round my neck—she broke the guard, and got the watch—I laid hold of her—she began fighting, and scratched me about the face, and bit me very severely on one finger-end—I secured her, and gave her in charge.</p>

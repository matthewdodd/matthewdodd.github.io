            . Amelia Bund has adopted me - I have lived with her as long as I can remember any thing; she told me where to find this money, and I found it in a jar in the corner of a closet, in the first floor front room, where she lays ill; the closet is always open; there were 3 guineas, 3 crowns, 3 half-crowns, 3 shillings, and 3 sixpences - Mrs. Joyce and I counted them; I put them back in the same place; the prisoner had access to the closet - different things were kept there; I have not seen them since - the jar is there now but nothing in it; I looked at it on Saturday, the 29th of April, after the prisoner had cleaned the closet out, and it was gone. The money was in a letter, which was put into a purse, and then into the jar - every thing but the jar was gone.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Saturday, the 29th of April, soon after eight o'clock, I went with a warrant to Bund's house. I found the prisoner there, and told her I was come for the money and purse which she had taken out of the jar in Mrs. Bund's room - she said she had taken none, and seen none - I then told her I had a warrant to take her into custody, and should search her - she then said, "Do you mean that little old purse?" - I said Yes; she then produced this leather purse, and was told that was not it; she opened it, shewed me a guinea, and said that fell out of the jar while she was dusting it, and she meant to give it back again, but she had seen no other money and no purse. I proceeded to search her boxes - she then said, "Do you mean that little old net purse?" she was told Yes - she said it was in her box; I found that purse at the bottom of her box, but nothing in it. I found two half-sovereigns in her box; she said her husband had brought her them that evening; by the time I had done searching the room her husband came. I told him, in her presence, that she was in custody for stealing money, and as it was not all found I must search him; he was very patient while I searched his right-hand breeches pocket, but when I came to the left he resisted - I there found a new crown piece, which he said he had received for his wages; I took them both to the watch-house till Monday. I told the man I should go to his master, and asked if he meant to persist in that account - he then said he had received the 5s. piece from his wife, and she said it fell out of the jar at the time the guinea did. I held out neither threat nor promise to her; she said on Monday that she had changed some of the silver at a silversmith's, in Leicester-square, and bought a gold seal and a gold key, at the same time, and changed one of the guineas there; she had asked me what they would do with her; I said the money was not all found; she then said if I would let her out she would tell the whole of it - that she had taken all the money on that day, Saturday, and could not tell what induced her to do it - that she had also changed a guinea in Sydney's-alley, and bought a brooch; I said nothing whatever to induce her to confess; I asked where the things were which she had bought; she said they were in an old glove in one of the boxes I had searched; I found them, wrapped in a piece of old paper, at the bottom of the box, but not in a glove.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

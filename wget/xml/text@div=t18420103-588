GEORGE WADE</persName>
                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in High-street, Deptford—the prisoner was my shopman. On the 11th of December I told him I had reason to suspect he was robbing me, and asked if he had any objection to be searched—he said "No"—I asked if he had any objection to have his box looked into—he said "No"—he then went up stairs with me and the policeman—I saw him give the policeman the key—the policeman opened his box, and found in it this tobacco, these cigars, and this pencil<lb></lb>case—I know they are mine, as I had taken the precaution that morning to sprinkle a little green tea in my tobacco, and this tobacco has the tea in it.</p>

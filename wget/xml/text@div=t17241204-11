Goodwin soon after went away, and then Mrs. Shepherd call'd the Prisoner, and said, Take your Landlady Mosely aside, and give her a Dram; and in the mean time I'll carry off her Box with the Rings in it: But she would not consent to it. However Shepherd brought out a Bundle of Cloaths: She desired Shepherd to carry them back to the Place she had them from; but instead of that, Shepherd gave them to her Sister, who carry'd them out to Goodwin, from whom the Prisoner Nelson took them, carry'd them to pawn at Mrs. Goodfellow's, and received the Money herself. Nelson in her Defence said, that she accidentally met Hales with a Bundle of Cloaths: Hales desired her to go with her to Goodfellow's, which she did, and there Hales pawn'd the Goods, and took the Money herself.

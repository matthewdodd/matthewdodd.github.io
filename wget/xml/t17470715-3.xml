               <p>Emmons . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the Goods?</p>
               <p>Emmons . The Goods are in Court.</p>
               <p>As the Prisoner could lay no Claim to the Goods they were ordered to the Owners thereof; and the Prisoner desired and claim'd the Benefit of his Majesty's Act of Grace.</p>
               <p>One Ambler, an Officer, appear'd in Court , and gave the Prisoner an exceeding bad Character ; and said , that he had a great many Writs against him at that time , and begg'd leave of the Court to arrest him. There were Counsel employ'd against him, who began to expatiate upon his Wickedness: a marrying several Women with three or four hundred Pounds Fortune and ruining them . But the Court refus'd hearing the Counsel, as the Offence the Prisoner was then charg'd with came within the Limits of the Act of Grace .</p>

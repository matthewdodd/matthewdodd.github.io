                  </hi>. I am one of the assistant messengers of the Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the proceedings in Bankruptcy against Richard Charles Newbury—after his adjudication I went to 4 and 5, President-street, Goswell-road, to take possession—they are two houses communicating one with the other—there is a back door from No. 5 into No. 4—I remained in possession from 17th March till 4th October—the bankrupt lived there the whole of that time and I left him there 3 on 4th October—when we leave the bankrupt in the house, we do not give the key up to anyone, simply go away—I was not aware of the removal of 160 brass plates on 8th April, or of the copper plates—I was not aware that Luck and Welsh and Chambers removed those things—it would be my duty to prevent the removal of goods from the house if I had known it—I remained at No. 4.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Billiter-street, City—I am the solicitor to the trade assignee in this matter, he acts with the official assignee—I am the attesting witness to this deed of assignment, dated 4th March, 1864, made between Richard Charles Newbury of the one part and James Barry, wholesale stationer, Queenhithe, and Henry Hayward of 31, Upper Thames-street—it is an assignment by Newbury for the benefit of his creditors—the arrangement under this deed was not carried out, it was thought right that a petition should be presented, and on 17th March there was a petition for adjudication by Edward Saunders on behalf of himself and partners—I am the attesting witness to that—the adjudication was on the same day—the amount of debts proved are somewhere over 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I rather think 9, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 9, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the property was realized in the ordinary way, by sale by the auctioneers—the amount realized altogether is between 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Messrs. Cutten and Davis sold the whole of the bankrupt's goods—the first sale was on llth May, I think, and the last in October—the bankrupt describes himself as a cardboard maker and a paper-collar manufacturer—he bad two places of business, 4 and 6, President-street, Goswell-road, and Helmet-row, St. Lukes—on 9th April an allowance was made to the bankrupt of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that was at the first meeting under the bankruptcy—on 12th May, when the first sale took place and money was realized, that payment was made to the bankrupt—I wrote a letter to Messrs. Cutten and Davis authorizing them to pay and it was paid—that continued till some day in October—after 12th May I paid it myself, person<lb></lb>ally—they paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to the 12th for arrears, and I or my clerks paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from that date up to October—the bankrupt himself was examined before the Court of Bankruptcy from time to time, I should think three times, since the adjudication in October—on 20th October Chambers and Luck were examined—until a few days before that I was not aware of the removal of these plates—the bankrupt's mother was the landlady of these promises, 4 and 5, President-street—there was a distress in for rent, that was paid either on 23d or 24th March—55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—the mother claimed some of the property in the house—the decision of the Commissioner with regard to the property was, that everything that was not fixed to the free<lb></lb>hold passed to the assignees, and that certain things fixed to the freehold belonged to the landlord—he marked in a schedule what passed to the assignees and what passed to the mother—what passed to the mother did not include these plates, it could not, because at the time the Commissioner gave the decision we had never heard of these plates; no question was raised with regard to them—this prosecution is instituted by the creditors,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By how many of the creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am only instructed by the assignee, Mr. James Barry of the firm of Barry and Hay ward—I am aware also that one other large creditor has approved of the proceedings since they have been commenced—one application was made to the Commissioner for his sanction to these proceedings, that was adjourned for consideration, and once adjourned afterwards—the Commissioner did not refuse his sanction, he said he would make no order at present—at that time the bankrupt had been given in charge and committed by the magistrate—no application was made to the Commissioner till then—he then said that as</p>

               <p>the assignee had taken upon himself to give the man in charge, he would make no order until after the trial—an application was made at Worship-street for a summons, the magistrate said it was not the right Court, I must go to the Clerkenwell Police-court and give the man in charge—these pro<lb></lb>ceedings have never at present had the sanction of the Commissioner—application was made in the proceedings, it would appear here—the comment of the Commissioner would not appear here—my counsel, Mr. Reed, told me it was adjourned, I was not in court at the time—there had been great dispute as to property claimed by the mother—it was fought most vigorously by Mr. Sargood and Mr. Reed—Mr. Sargood, on behalf of the mother, claimed part of the property—the Commissioner did not make an order, he was going out of town, told us to give him the brief and he would mark in the schedule what passed to the assignee and what passed to the mother—it went over some time, as Mr. Commissioner Goulburn was out of town—the decision was given by the Commissioner a day or two before 29th September—from the time of the messenger going into the house and the 29th Sep<lb></lb>tember, this matter, as to whom certain property belonged, was in suspense, and that is why the messenger was so long in possession—I had a copy of the things claimed—it was produced before the Commissioner—it appears in these proceedings—the copy of the schedule is here, I read it through at the time—I have no doubt that it is correct—I find "hydraulic press and plates" as part of the goods claimed by the mother—there was an order for the sale of some horses; that was before the appointment of the trade assignee—the moment an official assignee is appointed, if there is anything that requires an immediate sale, like horses, they are sold immediately without an order—Mr. Saunders is here—there is no one here from Cutten and Davis.</p>

               <p>some samples of these plates down to Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's—Mr. Newbury told me to do that—I was to see what I could get advanced upon them—I showed them to Mr. Cloud, the manager at Mr. Atten<lb></lb>borough's—I won't be sure whether I told him how many I had got—he said how much a pound he would advance on them; I can't say what the price was—I went back and told Mr. Newbury how much I could get upon them, and afterwards, on 8th April I took about 160 of those brass plates and thirty-six copper plates down to the pawnbroker's by his direction—I put them into his horse and cart which he had not sold then—I and Welsh took them to the pawnbroker's—Mr. Cloud had them weighed and made an advance upon them of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he gave me this deposit note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I could not swear this is the one; when I got it I signed this, that is my signature, "William Luck"—I took the deposit note and the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back to Mr. Newbury—this signature on 21st September is not my handwriting—I was examined at the Court of Bankruptcy on 20th October—I had nothing to do with the removal of these things from the pawnbroker's—(<hi rend="italic">The deposit note contained the weight of the plates</hi>, 7<hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">gr., left on security of a loan of</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">with power of sale if not redeemed within</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">months, it was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1864.)</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186501300085"></xptr>
               <p>I did not know who he was—I knew he was not the same party who deposited it, I thought as a matter of course that the transaction was all straight-forward—the plates were redeemed on 20th October, I do not know who fetched them away—there was a horse and a cart and a man—this deposit note was brought to me when they were redeemed—the money was paid and the goods given up—the first I heard of the name of Newbury was when this prosecution was instituted—I don't know bow many copper plates there were—they were all weighed together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Let me look at your memorandum book, the renewal took place by mistake on 21st September, before they were due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were then renewed for a month, and were redeemed on 20th October, just before the month was up—it is very seldom any information is given to me when a renewal is made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to the Ormiston Brass and Copper Company—I keep the day-book and the ledger—I received these two orders dated May 30th and June 4th from the bankrupt for five seta of brass plates—one is a substitution order, for a different sized plate—they were after<lb></lb>wards sent to the bankrupt—the invoice is in my hand writing—the five sets were all delivered at the some time—the invoice price was 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. including 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two cases—I have examined all of these plates—there are five sets of thirty-two each, complete—I believe they are the plates supplied by our firm—I find thirty of each size out of one gauge, and the two others are extra stout, as ordered—the same size, but thicker, there are five sets of five different sizes—I believe they are used for glazing paper—we are creditors of the bankrupt's estate for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are not the only makers of that sort of plate? A. No—there is no mark on any of these plates—we generally mark all our goods, but we can't mark these, because if we did it would leave an impression on the paper—I believe they are ours, and the plates we supplied in 1863, but there is no mark by which I know them—they are useless unless they are kept in a high state of polish—they leave us in that state with a piece of sliver paper between, so that they shall not scratch—I saw them again about two months back—they were then in that condition.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, G</hi> 22). I received instructions to take the prisoner into custody on this charge, and went to his premises in President-street on 27th October—I went upstairs, found the prisoner in the bedroom, and told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of brass plates belonging to the assignees—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—he put on his clothes, we went downstairs into the first floor front room and he sat down for some little time—I commenced searching the place—he said, "Well, I did make away with them, they did not give me my allowance that was ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and I had nothing to live on, but a friend of mine has got them out for me"—I said, "I have searched, but I can't find them"—he said, "Well, I don't know where they are"—I then took him downstairs into the warehouse), and' I found the 37 copper</p>

               <p>plates under some paper cuttings—I then took him to the station, returned to the premises, and after searching some little time, found the 164 brass plates in an iron box in the engine-room—I took possession of them, and have bad them ever since.</p>

I am the trade assignee, and a creditor for over 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—until a few days before Luck and Chambers were examined at the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Court I was not at all aware that any of these plates had been sent to the pawnbroker's—I directed the prosecution in this matter.</p>

Q.</hi> Was it by your authority that an application was made that the costs of this prosecution should be paid out of the estate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to the Commissioner—I believe he made no order—I was not there—Mr. Reed made the application on my behalf, and Mr. Sargood opposed it—I directed Cutten and Davis to go in to sell—the property was sold by public auction—I received the money on account of the sales, from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think, or more than that—the Commissioner told me that any moneys I had I was to pay over into the official assignees' hand—I was not aware that such an application was made—he read the statute to me to show me that I ought to have paid the money into the hands of the official assignee—he might have read some penal clauses—I can't say how long I had it in my possession—I kept it to pay various expenses, the allowance and other things, which I handed over to the solicitor, not for this prosecu<lb></lb>tion—I alone directed this prosecution—I don't know the day at all that Cutten and Davis took possession—I know of a valuation having been made of the property on the premises before the bankruptcy.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Walter. The prisoner had a coat lent him three weeks ago, to go to his father's, but he brought it back again; he told me on the Sunday he was going to his father's, and asked for the coat; I said my husband would be angry, and I would not lend it him; I went into the back kitchen, and he took it off a nail; when I returned into the kitchen, the prisoner, the coat, and the hat, were gone - there was no one else in the house but my little girl.</p>

            . I am a constable. I met the prisoner about a fortnight afterwards in High-street; he came up to me, and surrendered himself; he said, "Have you not got a warrant against me?" I said, "A warrant against you! No;" he said, "My name is Guillis:" I said, "You are my prisoner;" he had this old coat and this hat on - he said he had sold the other coat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

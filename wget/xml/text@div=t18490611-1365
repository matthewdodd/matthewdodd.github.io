                  </hi>. I am a shopkeeper of Woolwich. Hanson was occasionally in my employ—he had been in the habit of coming on Fridays and Saturdays for rather more than twelve months—in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation from a policeman, I marked fourteen shillings, twelve sixpences, and some pence and halfpence—I placed the silver in the silver department of the till, and the copper in the copper department—I then went to my back-room to tea—Hanson served a gentleman with some tea, and bacon, and butter, which came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something odd—the gentleman gave him half a sovereign—after that Hanson came to his tea—after tea Hanson went into the shop, and Green came to the counter—I placed myself on the stairs where I had a hole about the size of my hand, through which I could look down the counter—Green put down what I believe was a sixpence, but I will swear it was not larger than a shilling—Hanson served him with cheese and butter, and then gave him some silver out of the till—I came into the shop, and asked Hanson what that man had had—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "The d—I you don't"—he said, "Do you think he has come to pass bad money?"—I said, "I don't know"—I went to the till, and missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of the marked money—I am quite sure that four marked shillings were gone—the policeman came in, and I gave Hanson in charge—I saw him searched at the station, and three shillings and a penny were brought from his pocket, which I could swear to by the marks on them—I can swear they are mine—I afterwards saw Green at the station, and the policeman produced one shilling, three pence, and two halfpence as being found on him, which I recognize as being marked by myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edwin Crump, of Hawthorne-cottages, Beulah-road—in March, the prisoners came and knocked at the door—I opened it—one stood on each side of the door—they asked if a person lodged there named John Smith, a gardener—Smith was close to me, on my right-hand side, and the other was a little way from me—I had a pocket on my right side, with a purse containing a half-crown, a sixpence, I believe, and three small cards, with my name and address on them, as a dressmaker—I also had a pocket-handkerchief in my pocket—I had felt my purse in my pocket a minute or two before, and missed it about two hours after the prisoner left—I had not taken it out at all—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Walthamstow—about 2 o'clock, on 5th March, I saw the prisoners and another man in a horse and cart in Grove-lane—I saw them drive near a plantation near where I was at work—they drove along the plantation very slowly—I then lost sight of them—on the following Saturday, the 7th, I found this purse and these cards about the middle part of the plantation, about five yards from where the prisoners went—they stopped once just before they got to the plantation, and then they drew along close—they all remained in the cart—I took the purse to the station—there was no money in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you sure it was on 5th March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a Thursday—I was inside the park fence—I could see over the fence, the road bends a little round—I know the prisoners are the men who were in the horse and cart—I had seen them loitering about before—the purse was on my master's premises—I heard that Mrs. Crump had lost a purse on the Saturday morning, and I went along the plantation and found it—I had no suspicion that there was anything wrong when I saw them on Thursday—it was a dog-cart they had—I had seen one man in the horse and cart about five minutes before they came up—the purse was found near the place where I lost sight of them—the place where I was working is in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Crump's.</p>

I am a single woman, and live at Stanley Villas, Beulah-road, Walthamstow—on the afternoon of 5th March, the prisoners came to my house and knocked at the door—I asked them to the gate at the side—they asked me if a gentleman lodged there of the name of John Smith—I told them "No" we did not take in lodgers—they asked me if I could direct them to such a person—I said I could not, as I did not know any one of that name—they wished me good afternoon, and said they were very sorry to trouble me—I went up stairs and looked out of window, and saw Brown speak to a man in a horse and cart, and then saw Smith go to Mrs. Cramp's house, which was a few doors on—I then shut the window, and did not see any more—the prisoners are the two men.</p>

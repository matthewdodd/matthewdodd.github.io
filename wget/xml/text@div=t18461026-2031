                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger. On the evening of the 15th of Sept. I was on the Barking road, and saw several persons collected there to see a foot-race between two men named Hall and Breman—I saw the prisoners there in a four-wheeled carriage with two horses—I did not see the men start—I got up behind the carriage, and saw the deceased come driving up just after we had passed the four-mile-stone—when he was driving up I heard somebody in the body of the chaise say, "Here he comes"—I turned round and saw Mr. Levett driving up—he put his thumb to his nose in this manner, and then Mr. Hey wood struck him with the whip, and he struck back again several blows—when they got near the New Inn Mr. Levett's horse took a start, and Hey wood followed and caught him—I do not-know whether the men ceased to run at the 3 1/2 mile-stone—I saw Mr. Levett with bis cart go beyond the place where the race bad stopped—when I saw Heywood begin to follow Mr. Levett in the phaeton he was from ten to twenty yards from him—it was beyond the 3 1/2 mile-stone, towards London—they followed as fast as they could go, when I saw him come up to Levett and Heywood and strike him again—Levett struck back again—they struck several blows, till Levett dropped his whip and pulled up the rein—Mr. Heywood pulled up too—he had then gone half the carriage length before him—Heywood then turned round on the box and said, "Get out and kill the b—r, I will pay the damage"—Boddy then got out and no one else that I saw—he tried to get into the cart by putting his foot on the wheel and his knee on the shaft, and while in that position Mr. Levett struck him—he pressed himself into the cart, pressed Mr. Levett backwards, and he fell with his head on the back of the cart, and while in that position Boddy took hold of the hair at the back of his head, and struck him several times about the head and body—Levett's feet were in front of the cart—there was a board across the middle of the cart—he was not in a position to make resistance—he was lying right on his back—there were a good many blows given—they were as hard as the position would allow—they were with his fist—Levett moved himself about till he got Boddy on the heel of the cart, and while there Heywood got off the box, ran round to the tail of the cart, and struck Levett with his fist on the head—he only struck him once that I saw—Levett's head was then hanging on the back of the cart—I saw Branch pick up Levett's whip, and strike him about the body with the thong, but not very severely—they then preceded him in the barouche—I got up behind, and we all went back to the Abbey Arms—as they passed the cart they jeered Mr. Levett—he was very much cut, and there was blood from several places.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow. On the 15th of Sept. I was on the Barking road, and saw Mr. Levett in a cart there, coming towards me towards London—the race was then over—while he was so coming I saws britzka following him with some person in it—it had four wheels, and was drawn by two horses—it overtook Levett's chaise, and had not passed him—the driver of the chaise struck at Levett with his whip—Levett parried the blow, dropped his whip, and drew up to recover it—as he drew up the other passed a little in advance of him, and drew up too—several of them got out—one of them got into Levett's cart, and scuffled with him as he was on the stepping iron, and he succeeded in getting in, and pushed Levett backwards over the seat with his head over the tail-board, held him in that position, and struck him while he was so with his fist, and then two of the others went to I the back of the cart, where his head was hanging, and struck him—there were several round the cart—as the driver of the chaise was going from his own chaise, as he was passing Levett's cart, he called out twice, "Kill the b—"—I did not know either of them by name—they were all strangers to me—I know them again—I remember seeing Heywood there—after they left Levett they got into their own chaise, and he sat up on the seat of his cart, and was wiping the blood from his face and front of his breast, and they turned their horses round to the part they came from, and in pasting him struck at him again with the whip—he had several friends round him I was going in an opposite direction, and did not see what became of him after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am also surgeon at the Magdalen Hospital—I attended Mr. Levett after the accident, until his decease—he died on the Sunday night, or very early on Mon-day morning, after the accident—at the time I first saw him his face was very much swollen, particularly the right-side, it was black—there were two wounds on the right-side of the face, one on the upper eyebrow, and the other just below the right lower lid—there were no wounds on the left side—the wounds had been dressed on the preceding evening—I therefore did not disturb the dressing—he appeared extremely agitated, and there was great tremulousness and weakness—he appeared very weak—I prescribed what I thought necessary, and desired to see him next day, when I took off the dressings from the wounds, and found that they were going on very well, both had nearly healed—this was on the Thursday—I continued to attend him till the Monday, when he died—the swelling of the face had considerably subsided on the Thursday, but the constitutional symptoms had increased—there was great tremulousness—I visited him next day, Friday, at his own house—he was then incoherent, and beginning to ramble—if I were to give a name to the disorder I should call it <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he was brought to me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the next day Saturday, not at my request, but I believe he would come, they could not keep him at home—I found him quite as bad as I had found him on the preceding day—on the Sunday I visited him at his own house again, and a few hours after that he died—in my opinion he died of exhaustion, of <hi rend="italic">delirium tre<lb></lb>mens</hi>, which I attribute to the shock that the system had received from the in-juries on the side of the face, at the time of the affray—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Thursday following his death—there was no fracture of the skull, or of the bones of the face, or of any bone whatever, and no rupture of any vessel in that part—the brain itself was not at all affected—the right lung was congested, and there were very numerous and old adhesions between the right lung and the right-side of the chest—I think they were in no way connected with the death, and would not at all account for it—the left Jung was also congested, but there were no adhesions—the heart was large and flabby—the liver and kidneys were not those of a sound person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any injuries that would cause death except those arising from the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination to account for death—my opinion as to the cause of death was the same after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination as it was before, that it was caused by the shock to the nervous system—the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> followed the blows—I was certainly surprised to see so serious a result from such injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you trace any medical connexion between those blows and the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider the blows to be the exciting cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have known <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> result from a very slight blow, but the blows are usually severe which produce it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260038"></xptr>
               <p>I could not say that particularly—the body was in a state of decomposition—I did not find any appearances that would have led me to suppose that death in a healthy man would have followed from the blows—I consider that <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was the cause of the shock received by the system from the affray in which he had been engaged—as he did receive blows, of course I did not look for any other cause, but I should say great excitement at the time would very materially aggravate, and of course cause a greater chance of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> coming on—I think excitement would produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> in a bad subject without any blows whatever—there are such cases on record—the scull of the deceased was the thinnest I ever saw, and if there had been any very aggravated violence I should have expected to find a fracture of something—the blows were about the face—they could not have been about the scull—they were not serious injuries at all, and they gradually got better—I saw no cut on the left side such as I have heard described by one of the witnesses—I cannot positively say whether the inflammation I observed, the slight flush in the membranes of the brain, was new or old, but should infer that it had come on with the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—that is a usual appearance in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—excite-ment and passion in a bad subject will produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, and the two together might have had their separate influence—I think either might have produced it, the excitement and passion without the blow, or the blow without the excitement and passion—there were three gentlemen besides myself at the examination—I cannot undertake to say that death would have arisen if there had been no blow—the blows were the material if not the sole exciting cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but had there not been considerable disorder or diseased state of the system I do not think the result would have been so serious—I consider the blows to be the main exciting cause, to be one of the exciting causes, if there was great excitement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understand you to state, that in speaking of the blows as the cause of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, you do not ascribe that so much to their physical effect as to their moral effect, to a sense of indignation and wrong more than to the mere blows themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Precisely so—I am not in the slightest uncertainty as to <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> causing the death, nor as to the cause which provoked the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, because there were blows, and <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> followed them—if there had been no blows, with very great excitement, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> might have followed—I cannot undertake to say, if there was very great excitement, that that might not have produced all the consequences—it is possible.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of Sept. the deceased was brought to my house—there were injuries from blows apparently over each eye-brow, the one on the right side more severe than that on the left, such an injury as might be inflicted by a blunt instrument, or the fist—that on the left side was so slight that he himself declined to have any application made to it—the other extended about two inches, being deeper in the centre—it was the natural depth of the scull—there was not much swelling—he was not bleeding much when he came to me—I did not see him again till after his death—when I first saw him I had not an idea that serious results would accrue—I examined the body with Mr. Coulson—I have heard his evidence, and agree generally with the opinions he has given.</p>

I conducted this <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but I had pre<lb></lb>viously visited the deceased in conjunction with Mr. Coulson—I first saw him on Sunday, the 20th—he died on the Monday morning, about two o'clock, I believe—when I first saw him he appeared to be labouring under great excitement, and that disease called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he was rambling and incoherent, but perfectly conscious of all around—he did not ramble on any particular subject—he fancied different persons were in the room—I did not hear him make any observations about what they were doing—I have not known <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> occasioned by blows in this country—in my opinion, severe blows occasioning great excitement at the time in a man of weak body would not produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> without some condition of the wounds themselves—that would be papable externally, as to what would be the cause of death—I have met with such instances in the course of my reading, but not in this country—I think I have met with such instances in very hot climates—I have been ten years in practice—I slightly differ with Mr. Coulson as to the symptoms—I think I never saw a body in such a state of decomposition—the examination was made on the Thursday, four days after death—I opened the head—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the membrane covering the internal part of the scull, was of a pinkish cast, but certainly not inflamed, arising from blood stains, the result of appearances which you frequently meet with after death—there was no indi<lb></lb>cation of the cause of death in the brain itself—it was excessively soft, so much so that it fell to pieces on my removing it from the head—the heart was, as Mr. Coulson states, enlarged and flabby, and a quantity of fat was deposited round it, but the liver was diseased.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with Mr. Couison, that <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was the immediate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—I saw him during life—I was called in to assist Mr. Coulson in the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination by his desire—I think a great distinction should be drawn in cases where you have <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> arising from wounds—I should expect to meet with a great degeneration of the ecchymosis, of the swelling externally—it would be pulpy—there would be palpable evidence of the mischief going on inside the brain—where <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is the result of the wounds, the wounds themselves would indicate that things are not going on right within the scull—if the wounds had healed rapidly I should not have expected that they were the cause of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have seen a great many cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—in this country the general exciting cause is drink—if a person who is not an habitual drunkard, but who is constantly sipping and taking large quantities of porter, was engaged in a quarrel, or in a passion, it would be likely to bring it on; but <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is sometimes caused without drinking; if a man had a predisposition to it excitement would be very likely to produce it—the passions of the mind would produce it, totally irrespective of any violence—the state of the liver indicated that, in some degree, the deceased must have drank—the existence of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> in this case is consistent with the fact of its having been induced by the excite<lb></lb>ment of the conflict, irrespective of any blow at all—it is my opinion that if the blow had been at all an exciting cause of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> it would have presented a different external appearance—if the blows had been the cause as blows.</p>

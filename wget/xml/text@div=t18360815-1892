                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in London-street, Rat<lb></lb>cliff. I turned a pig out, on the 4th of August, in an open field at the back of my house, at near eight o'clock in the morning, and about two o'clock the policeman brought it to me—I knew it to be mine by marks on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in London-street. This pig weighed about twenty stone—I was coming from White Horse-street, and saw the prisoner going up Commercial-road, driving the pig before him—he had a string in his hand, and was throwing stones at it, and whipping it with the string—I</p>

Thompson pointed the pri<lb></lb>soner out to me—I spoke to him, and he said a man gave him a pot of beer to drive it to the bottom of the street—I asked if he could point the man out—he said, "No, he could not"—I saw the Magistrate's clerk write down what the prisoner said—no threat or promise was held out to him—I know Mr. Broderip's signature—I believe this to be his writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "The prisoner says what the policeman says is true—coming along Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, just beyond the turnpike, a man called me off the pavement, and asked me to earn a pint of beer, and said, Just drive the pig down any of those turnings by the wooden palings, and wait till I come".</p>

I left nobody in the house (I am rather shy of answering questions, as I believe the other party who was in the house, is in Court, and he will avail himself of what I say, as he had been hovering about the house) I left the door fastened, the street door was locked, and I had the key in my pocket. I left all my property perfectly secure - I returned just about one o'clock in the morning, and found the street door shut, but I have a door at the foot of my stairs very strongly secured by a patent lock, and I found that door split all to pieces. The street door was on the latch just as I had left it, but the inner door was broken - I heard some persons moving up stairs; I immediately went out of the street door - there were two crow-bars by the side of the door. I went out and met only one person in the street (that was Cohen), I said to him, There are housebreakers in my house, will you go in with me; he said, He did not like; I asked him to remain by the street door to seize anybody if they escaped, while I got a policeman, he said, he would. I went about twenty yards round the corner, got a policeman, and when I came back, I found the prisoner in the hands of Cohen struggling; I saw nobody else - he was secured. I went up stairs with the two policemen, and found everything overturned. On the first floor they had broken a box containing women's apparel, and all the things were piled up on the floor ready to be carried away, and two or three portmantua's were put ready to be taken away. A sword had been brought down stairs and laid in the passage - articles to a considerable amount had been moved; the property stated in the indictment was part of it - the party had entered by a false key, and two days before, I found a broken skeleton key in the latch.</p>

            . I keep a grocer's shop, and live within five doors of Disney. He requested me to stand at the door while he went for a policeman - I stood at the door, and in about a minute the prisoner and another rushed out; I seized them both - the other got away from me; the prisoner I held by the coat till the policeman came to my assistance - I could not identify the other man to be certain of him; I held the prisoner - the policeman searched him but found nothing - I saw the crow-bar in the house, and the property on the floor - when the prisoner first came out, he said he was not the man, that he had come round the corner, and why did I hold him- I had seen him come out at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came up to me, I was within seven or eight yards of the door after turning the corner? A. You were on the curb - it was only the breadth of the flag stone from the door - I seized him immediately he came out - I seized them both.</p>
               <p>Q. I told you a man had passed by, and you were mistaken in my person? A. There was not another person in the street.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty in Oxford-street, and heard a noise in Quebec-street - I saw two persons come out of the prosecutor's house - Cohen seized them; a woman called "Police;" I ran across and took the prisoner from Cohen - I had seen him come out of the house. I afterwards went into the house, and found a crow-bar lying on the sideboard, and a dark lanthorn, and a phosphorus box on the floor; and I afterwards found another crow-bar in the house.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty - I had passed the house ten minutes before - the door was then shut; I afterwards went there, just as the prisoner was apprehended; I found on him a knife, a cord, and pocket handkerchief; the inner door of the house was broken to pieces - that had a Bramah's lock on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Chelsea to receive some money. I live at Somerstown; as I came back I crossed Oxford-street into Quebec-street, and then the gentleman seized me, and said I had robbed the house - I said he was mistaken, the party had just passed; I was dragged into the house, and finding nobody else, they detained me.</p>

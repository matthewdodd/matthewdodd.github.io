                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Alfred Cole. We keep a chandler's shop at Hounslow—on 27th April, M'Carthy came and asked if my husband was at home—I said he was not—he then said he had brought some tobacco down by the train for a gentleman at the large shop above, unfortunately he was gone out, and if I would purchase it I should have it cheap—I asked what tobacco it was; he said, "Shag"—there was 27 lbs. of it, and it was then at the railway station—he wished me to go there and see it—I agreed to do so—he went away—I went afterwards, and when I had got nearly there I saw him coming to bring it to my house—he then had a parcel—I lost sight of him for half an hour, and he then brought it to my shop—this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel—it was wrapped in brown paper, with string round it, and sealed at each end—I told him I was not a judge of tobacco, I was not accustomed to buy it—he said any one could tell whether it was good tobacco or not—he opened the top of the parcel on the counter, and I saw some tobacco, examined it with some of my own, and it looked much the same—I told him I would not buy it without seeing it weighed; he put it on the scale, and it weighed 24 lbs. with the wrapper—he said he did not know how he had made the mistake about the weight—he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it by taking the quantity—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he must go and see the per<lb></lb>son who was in partnership with him, and if I would come up to the station he would tell me whether they would give credit for the other 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said</p>

               <p>they were partners in a vessel, and had brought it over from Jersey free of expense—he left, taking the parcel with him—I went up and met him at the back of the street by the station, paid him the two sovereigns for the parcel, and he told me to be sure to get the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ready by the Friday—I took the parcel and asked him to come home with me for the wrapper; he said that would do on the Friday, and told me I bad better keep it cool—I took the parcel home, opened it, and found some tobacco on the top, and I then saw a white bag, I opened that with a knife, and found it was sawdust—there was only a very small quantity of tobacco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had asked him particularly if it was throughout like the top, and he said yes—I went directly down to the railway station to make inquiries for the man, and I saw the female prisoner about ten minutes after—she was alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Ship Inn, Hounslow. On 27th April both the prisoners came to my house—the woman asked if there was any house where they took in travellers—I said I could accommodate them, and they agreed to take a room—they had two of three different parcels—I do not know who carried them in, I was at the back part of the house when they came—the man afterwards went out and returned in half an hour, or twenty minutes—he was then in the house some time, and left again—I did not see him come in again, but I afterwards saw him in the house again—the woman took a large bundle away with her, larger than the one produced.</p>

I was standing at my door, and saw the male prisoner go in to Mrs. Cole's with such a bundle as this under his arm—I bad never seen him before—I did not see him come out—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, I was standing opposite the Rose and Crown, and saw a man come out of a lane with a bundle under his arm, and buttoning his coat in a hurry—I turned round and saw the female prisoner come out of the same lane—I noticed her, because she had a black eye—I had not seen her before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Gardner to the prisoner's house, in Devizes-street - I found some timber there, and one particular piece, which they call pine. I asked if he had any more of his master's property in the house - he clasped his hands, and said, "I have - I have." I then went up stairs, and found about fifty pieces of timber - he said afterwards that it was his poor family who would suffer - he should be transported.</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

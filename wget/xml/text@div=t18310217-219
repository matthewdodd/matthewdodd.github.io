On the 12th of February I saw the prisoner at our shop; he looked at a pair of boots and a pair of shoes also - he desired me to put up the shoes in the window; while I was doing that he ran out - I looked, and missed the boots immediately; in consequence of information I went on the following morning to Ironmonger-row, where I saw him at work; I knew him to be the man, and I asked him for the money for the boots which he took away on the Saturday; he said he was not looking at boots, he was looking at shoes - I said he had taken away the boots which he had on: I knew they were the boots which had been in my window - he said he had bought them in Gravel-lane; he first said at a house, and then he said of a man - I got an officer, and he was taken - I know the boots by a mark inside them.</p>

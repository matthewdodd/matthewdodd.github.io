On the 19th of last month I was sitting in the parlour, there came a woman knocking at the door, she gave a double knock, and we came out; and I came out and observed the shop window up, and best part of the linen that lay near that place was gone; fifteen shirts in the whole, and six or seven linen shifts, half a dozen plated handled knives and forks, and one half shawl; I made enquiry to all the shops near, and I was gone about half an hour and returned.

After he had gone out, I had not a good opinion of him; I told him he should come back and take the articles, as I went after him to call him back, I saw the transaction at my neighbour's.</p>

About two years ago I was coming from Stepney-fields, and I saw a great mob of people-</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure it was the prisoner? - I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be linen of any kind? - It appeared to be white linen; I went directly to the door, and knocked at the door, to let Mr. Joseph know of their being robbed; the two doors being shut, they did not come immediately to open the door, but when he see me be ran away, I never see him again till I see him the next day before the justice, and there I fixed on him among them all.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he been pointed out to you? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you been servant to Mrs. Jacobs? - About five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not of the same persuasion with them? - I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he any thing else? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. So Jacobs came home? - Yes, he came home, and with these words, that the jew over the way was being robbed, and I was frightened, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. So being alarmed, and frightened to death, you ran into the way of it. There were lights about Joseph's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Lamps? - Yes, there is a lamp at the corner, and lights of each side of his house, and a lamp opposite, it was as light as day.</p>
               <p>Q. Stay then; it was as light as day? - It was light enough that I could discern the prisoner, to take notice of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. We will talk about that by and by. There were lights about? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body has stated that there were no lights about Mr. Joseph's house, according to your evidence it cannot be true? - There were lights; Ratcliffe-highway is always lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us see a little about the prisoner Collings; you never see him before? - Never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out considerably frightened and alarmed? - I went out with intention of alarming the people.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 19th of November; when did you attend the magistrate's? - The next day.</p>

               <p>Q. The subject of this felony has never been introduced in discourse? - Not to speak about it materially, it may be said that we shall have to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it may have been said that when you was to attend, you was to be sure to say that you recollected Collings? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said so to Jacobs? - I never converse with my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been attending? - Ever since Monday; now it is Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Has not Jacobs said, mind you swear to Collings, or be sure that Collings is the person? - On my oath he never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a reward? - No, I never heard of a reward depending on it, I did it for the good of the people.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 19th of last month I was at the house of Mr. Jacobs, in Ratcliffe-highway; I drank tea there, and after tea we were sitting talking, and suddenly, the witness, Mr. Jacobs came in, in a kind of a fright, signifying that there were robbing his neighbours; he said they were robbing the shop over the way; in consequence of that I went out, following Mrs. Jacobs's servant, she went before me; when I came across the way, there is a public house next to the shop that was robbed; I saw the prisoner, which answers to the name of Young; he seemed as if coming from there; as I knew the shop was robbed, I took that notice of him, supposing him to be concerned with it, his bosom appeared to be full, with some shirts or shirts, it appeared very full. Mr. Jacobs's servant by this time was at the door, knocking at it, and I came up to her; it was some little difficulty before we could make them hear in the house inside, I perceived the window was open of the shop, it seemed to be a kind of a sash window; when we gained admission we found that they were inside of the parlour, which had a separate partition to it, and the door of that parlour was shut; the young man, an old man, and little girl, they all exclaimed with a great surprize.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoners? - I met Collings with the appearance of something in his breast, it appeared to be one or two shirts, it was white; but during the time I was knocking at the door, I observed one of them coming up to the door again, and on the maid saying here they come again, he turned off again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you see something peeping out from the breast, it might be an handkerchief or a shirt? - It was to appearance, one or two shirts, by the resemblance on the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that the part of the charge is stealing shirts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any thing of bulk enough to have the same appearance, would you attempt to swear at about eight o'clock at night, merely by his passing you, that that was shirts, any more than it might be any thing of the same sort of bulk? - I do not say it was shirts, but I had every idea of thinking it was shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it had been shirts, would you have known the difference? - I cannot swear it was shirts, I can only say it was the appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080175"></xptr>Q. So, whether he had shirts, pocket handkerchiefs, or any thing else, you cannot say; you did not know Young before? - No, never in my life, either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that person that passed you was Young? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him previous to the time? - Never in my life, that I know of, I am a stranger here, I live at Portsmouth, seventy-two miles from here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing of his countenance when he passed you from the public house? - He did not come out of the public house, but his passing by the light of the passage in the public house, it gave me an opportunity of seeing him distinctly; I identified him immediately at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether you will swear to him now? - Yes, I will, as far as a man can with certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. Every man is liable to mistake. - Certainly; I see an instance of that at the office that night I was there.</p>
               <p>Court. I remember I tried three persons for a robbery and burglary and at the house of justice Penleaze, Mrs. Penleaze swore positively against two of these persons; there were six of them indicted at different times; all the opportunity she had of swearing to them, was, when she put aside the bed clothes, to enable her to breathe, and from that aperture she swore positively to these persons, the consequence of which was, the jury found them guilty of the robbery; I was not at all satisfied with the verdict, and I respited their execution, and it was from time to time postponed, until the six persons that had committed this robbery, were taken up for another offence, at Chester, and they were committed; and they confessed that they robbed this first house. Now that woman in that situation, swore positively to their persons, and she had an opportunity of observing their faces for a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts; and it was afterwards found that she was mistaken, and their lives were spared; here you had not the opportunity of observation that this woman had, and yet you positively swear that this was Young, that past you with something in his breast, but whether it was or no, it does not follow, that he had in his breast any part of this property.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Josephs on Wednesday night, between seven and eight o'clock; and as I was crossing over the way I saw two young men at the window as if they were looking at the shew glasses; I went and stood by them a little time, and then I knocked at the door, and went in to deliver some clean clothes, and get some dirty ones; while I was up stairs, I heard the child say, mammy, we are robbed; when I came down stairs Mr. Joseph said he was robbed of between three and four pounds worth of goods. I went home with my dirty linen, and I see no more that night; the next day I went to the justice's at Goodman's-fields, and I looked about, and I said this is the young man that stood at the window last night, only he had a red waistcoat on; and they said he has got it on now, but he has tucked it in.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him take nothing? - No, nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Stoke Newington. On the 15th of Oct., about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Lee come out of Mr. Gray's shop, and run to Brown and another boy, who was discharged, and they all ran together—I had known Lee before—I called out, and went into Mr. Gray's shop, and he went after the prisoner—I live close by there—I had not seen either of the prisoners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an oil-shop in Church-street, Stoke Newington. On the 15th Oct. Brown came into my shop, and asked for a person named Simmons, a shoemaker—I said I had not the pleasure of knowing the name—he went out, and in about five minutes Blaxter came in, and, in consequence of what he said, I looked, and found my till open, and all the money gone—my money had been in it not five minutes before—there might have been 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there were half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—the till was closed when Brown came in—I had occasion to go to it just before, when a little girl came in, and I observed the money was quite safe then—Brown followed the little girl in, and he went out about the same time—he got out first, and she followed him—no other person had come into the shop before Blaxter—I was behind the counter when Brown came in, and then I went into the parlour adjoining the shop—Blaxter pointed to Lee, Brown, and another, who were running up the street as hard as they could, I pursued—there was a phaeton going by—I jumped into that, and did not lose sight of them—while I was chasing them, Brown threw away some money—I saw it roll on the pavement—when I got out of the phaeton, the prisoners were taking some money out of their pockets—I made a spring, and they ran away—I gave chase, and the policeman took Brown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the little girl purchase anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had closed my till when Brown went out, and all was safe—I never lost sight of the prisoners, only for a moment at the bend of the street—the other boy was taken in the chase—he was discharged by the Magistrate—it could not be more than five minutes from the time Brown went out of the shop till Blaxter called to me—I do not know that any one came in after the little girl left—when I came into the shop the till was half open—a person would have to come round, or to reach over the counter, to do that—there was no silver left in it—there were coppers—there were no other persons running except the three boys—I might go a quarter of a mile before I came up to them—I was not in the phaeton when I saw the money thrown away—I got out and made chase, and during the chase he threw the money away—a gentleman found some, and I had it given to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Newington. On the 15th of Oct. I was in my garden, and heard some one shouting out, "Stop him! stop him!"—I looked out at my garden gate, but, there being an angle in the road, I could not see any one—I saw some money on the pavement and in the road—in two or three minutes I saw Mr. Gray return round the angle, and the policeman, with Brown in custody—I said, "What is the matter?"—Mr. Gray said, "I have had my till robbed"—I said, "I have picked the money up"—I handed it to him—there were shillings, six-pences, and one or two half-crowns—there was about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

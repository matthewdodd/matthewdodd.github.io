               <p>At that time you thought it a fair bargain? - I said if you do not meet with a person that buys it for his own wear, you will not make your money of it.</p>

               <p>At about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I was coming past Chancery-lane, I met an acquaintance, a Mr. White. I said to him, how do you do; he said, Lazarus, I am glad to see you, if you will go home with me I have a suit of clothes to sell you. I went along with him; a man came to me and said you buy old clothes; I said yes; he said he had a watch in his pocket, he wanted money, and would sell it; I asked Mr. White, might I buy this watch; he said yes, I think you may venture to buy it of him if you can get a shilling by it. I gave him 23 s. for it, and a laced hat that stood me in 9 s.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>


               <p>- WHITE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he buy some clothes of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day? - Not exactly; it was sometime about November, I believe; I overtook the prisoner with this bag, he had some hats and clothes; I told him I had got a suit of second mourning clothes to dispose of; he might see them, if we could agree for them. I knew him when I was in the publick way. I kept a publick-house between Chancery-lane and Shoe-lane, on the right-hand side, near the bar. A man met him and said I think you are in the dealing way; I have got a watch to dispose of, let me look at it; he pulled it out; they had some little talk together; he bought the watch of him, and the man took a hat in change.</p>
               <p>What was the money? - 23 s.</p>
               <p>You are not a Jew? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. What age might the man be that he bought the watch of? - He appeared to be about thirty-five.</p>

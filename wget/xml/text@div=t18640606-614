I am the wife of the last witness—I was with him, and saw Holmes sitting on the step—he used some blackguard language—I turned my head and looked at him—he made a rush to hit me, and my husband came back—Bush and Cave then rushed out of the Salisbury public-house and knocked my husband partly into the baker's shop—they got him down—I screamed out, and Bush returned, and gave me an awful black eye with something he had in his hand, and smashed the side of my nose right in—it bled, and I lost above two quarts of blood—the prisoner is the man who struck me—I feel pain still, but not so much as I did—I had no old wound on my nose before.</p>

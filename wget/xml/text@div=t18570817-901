                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Lovegrove Place, East Greenwich. On Saturday night, 8th Aug., I went to a coffee shop in Church Street, Greenwich, about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock—I called for a cup of coffee—I went to sleep there—I had in my pocket a sovereign, one 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, two half crowns, two 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in small silver—I had counted it not ten minutes before I entered the house, and secured it in my right hand breeches pocket—I was quite sober—I went to that house because I thought my wife would be gone to bed, and I thought I would have a cup of coffee—it was on my way home—I was tired with walking—I had taken change for a sovereign of Mr. Wood, at the Lord Nelson public house on that Saturday morning, and I particularly noticed one half crown that I received of him, it had the letter J under the word Rex—I had that coin before I went into the coffee shop—that coin has been since shown to me by the constable—this is it—I had not bought anything of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said in his deposition that he did not recollect whether he had bought any pears of me or not—he had bought a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of pears, and he gave me that half crown. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not; I have not bought a pear of him or of any one since I have been at Greenwich, which is six years—I do not like them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Road, Greenwich—the last witness called on me on Saturday, 8th Aug.; he was going to Sheerness—he asked for change for a sovereign, which I gave him; it con<lb></lb>sisted of large money; there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and several half crowns—this half crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I know to be one that I had in my possession; and I believe I gave it to the prosecutor in change for the sovereign—I have</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in a dust yard—I went into the coffee shop in Church Street, Greenwich, on Saturday night, 8th Aug., about half past 12 o'clock—I saw Mr. Gibbons there; he was asleep, with his head lying on the table; I saw the prisoner sitting opposite to him on the same seat—there were other persons there who seemed to be friends of the prisoner—the prisoner got under the table, and unbuttoned the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's trowsers, and took the money out of his right hand pocket, and I saw him get from under the table with the money in his mouth—the other persons who were there appeared to know the prisoner; they spoke to him, and they all walked out—I had not an opportunity of doing anything, as the coffee shop was full, and I was afraid of their knocking me about—they threatened to kill me on the Sunday night—they were hunting me all about the place—I was afraid to say anything at the time—I could not speak to the keeper of the coffee shop, because there were so many in the coffee shop—I gave information in the morning, when the prosecutor awoke; I told him himself when he was inquiring of the coffee shop man.</p>

            ; she lives there - it is a public-house; we have only one room. On the 23rd of January I left the room about five minutes to nine o'clock, leaving nobody in the room - my father went out at eight o'clock; the door on the stairs was fastened with a bolt - the street door was shut, and fastened with a spring lock; our room door was only on the latch - the door on the stairs opens by undoing the bolt with a wire; I went to meet a society at the Fox and Hounds, Hare-street, and returned at a quarter to twelve o'clock; I came home first - the street door was fast, as I had left it: I went into the public-house, part of the house, and asked them to unlock the street door for me, which they did; the street door leads up to our room, without going through the public part of the house - there is a private door to the house; they opened the door, and I went in - I went up to the door on the stairs, tried to undo it, and found the bolt was not there; I went down stairs for a light, went up again, and found the bolt and staple laying on the stairs inside the door - the staple and bolt had been forced off; I found no instrument there which could have done it: I went into our room, and the first thing I saw was my box wrenched open, and all my things taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get to that room if the street door was fast? A. They must have come through the public-house - there was no other way, except through the street door, which was on the spring lock; that might be opened with a key: I missed all my clothes out of my box - my father's box and drawer were opened; I missed two coats, worth 3l. - one of them was nearly new - two pairs of trousers, worth 2l.; I had only worn one pair twice - they cost me 36s. - two waistcoats, worth 1l. and a shirt, worth 3s.; my box had been locked - I found it broken open - the further part of the room was covered with handkerchiefs and things taken out of the drawer and boxes and strewed about; I missed a suit of black clothes and other things of my father's - I had not seen them myself; the box was open, and every thing taken out - that box was not locked before: I sent for my father, who came in a few minutes - I have seen a pair of trousers, a shirt, and a handkerchief since.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street office. In consequence of information I went with Waters after the prisoners to No. 1, Scott-street, Bethnalgreen, and in the back parlour I found, hanging on a line, these trousers, which I produce, and laying on the table was a great quantity of housebreaking implements, and among them a small crow-bar - we brought them away, and went to Mrs. Honson's house; I examined the door which had been forced - it appeared to have been done by a small crow-bar; I fitted the crow-bar which I found in the room to the marks, and to the edge of the door, and it fitted exactly - it also fitted the marks on the box up stairs - Lamey, Jun. identified the trousers; after that we received further information, in the evening, from nine to ten o'clock (this was Monday, the 25th), went to the White Hart and Fountain, Rosemary-lane, and found Richards in company with about one hundred persons, and from the description we had received we took him down to the bar parlour, and told him he was charged on suspicion of breaking open the house of Mr. Lamey, No. 8, Nichol-street, Bethnal-green; I did not say it would be better or worse for him to confess - he said he was very sorry, it was nothing but distress caused him to do it, and being over persuaded by other persons; I told him we had found a pair of trousers at his lodging, No. 1, Scott-street, Bethnalgreen (I am sure I said his lodging.) which had been identified by young Lamey; he said nothing to that; I asked how long he had lived there, and he said nearly five years; we took him in a coach to the office - the landlord of the house gave us every assistance, and behaved very well. On the Monday following, the 1st of February, Burdett was brought to the office by a constable of Spitalfields parish, and having received information, I detained him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and went with Attfield to No. 1, Scott-street; the street door was fastened - we knocked, and a person named Riches, who lived up stairs, let us in; she pointed out a room to us, which we went into - I found on the table these skeletonkeys and these picklock-keys (producing two large bunches) - I also found this crow-bar, which I fitted to the door myself, and Attfield fitted it to the boxes; the marks exactly corresponded - I do not swear it was done with that crow; I also found this lantern, covered with a piece of leather, a centre-bit, and a great quantity of other tools - I was searching in the room when Attfield took the trousers off the line; I afterwards went to the White Hart public-house, and found the prisoner Richards, in company with about a hundred persons; I am certain nothing was said to induce him to say any thing; Attfield told him he was charged with robbing the house of Mr. Lamey, No. 8, Nichol-street - he said it was distress, and he had been led into it by others; I told him we had been to his house, No. 1, Scott-street, and found a quantity of housebreaking implements on the table; he made no answer - Attfield asked him if he lived there, and in my presence he said he had lived there five years.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I apprehended Burdett on Saturday, the 30th of January, at the Frying-pan, Brick-lane - Cox was with me; we took him to Spitalfields watch-house, and searched him - he pulled 4s. and a duplicate of a shirt out of his pocket, with the name of Bradley, Brown's-lane, on it; I went there, and found a shirt pawned for 3s. - Lamey's son claimed it; I went to Bullock's, and found a silk handkerchief, which I have here; I took him to the office on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am a horn-presser, and live at No. 6, Osborne-place. I know the prisoners - I bought a handkerchief of Burdett on the 30th of January, at the Frying-pan, Brick-lane, Spitalfields; he asked 4s. for it, said it was his own property, and his own manufacture - I gave him 4s. for it; I delivered it to the officer: before that I had pawned it at Williamson's, for 2s. 6d. - I went with the officer, and got it back; (looking at it) this is it- I know it by a bit of white thread in the corner.</p>

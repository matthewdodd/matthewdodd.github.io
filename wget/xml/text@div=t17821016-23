               <p>Court. How do you know it was her? - She picked it out before my eyes, she put it into her bosom; then I immediately took my watch from her by force and after I had taken it from her, she cryed out Stop thief, and murder! Mr.

               <p>Court. So you saw her take your watch out of your pocket, and put it into her bosom, and you took it away? - Yes. </p>
               <p>Did she claim the watch, because she called Stop thief? - No.</p>
               <p>What was her reason for calling Stop thief? - She had no reason at all.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing but conversation passed between you and this woman? - Nothing, my Lord, I had no connection with the woman, nor never meant it, so help me God I have nothing more to say.</p>

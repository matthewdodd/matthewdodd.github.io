                  </hi> I am a constable. Mason was an overlooker in the tea department at Nicholson's wharf. On Saturday, 21st April, about two o'clock, I was on the wharf and saw Mason come out of the warehouse—I followed him into the Queen's Head public-house, which adjoins the premises—I went in and saw him there, sitting on the settle, close to Batishall—I staid there about five minutes and then left—I saw Mason come out and go into the warehouse—he came out again, and I asked him who the man was that I had seen in the parlour at Howard's (the Queen's Head) with him—he said that it was only a man that his brother <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> knew—I asked if he had any tea about him—he said, "No"—I felt in his apron and there found 3lbs. of tea in the pocket—I said he had better come and see Mr. Besley, one of the part<lb></lb>ners—he said that if I would let him go he would give me a sovereign; that he had a wife who was nearly dead, and a large family; that he would give me anything if I would let him go—I then sent for Mr. Besley and went to the Queen's Head and looked where the two prisoners had been sitting, and found a small quantity of tea on the settle, and a little on the ground where they had been sitting—I afterwards went after Batishall; I found him in Botolph-lane, with a bundle in his hand—I asked if he had any tea about him—he said, "No"—I examined the bundle and found that it contained 4 or 5lbs. of tea—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes elapsed between my seeing the prisoners together and finding the tea on Batishall—when I stopped Mason he was turning up the gateway to go into Thames-street, which would have brought him into Botolph-lane; it would not take him to the Queen's Head.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Nicholson and an<lb></lb>other. Mason was in our employ as an overlooker in the tea floor; a brother of his was also in our employ—in his absence, Mason would have <hi rend="italic">to go</hi> to the public-house to get refreshment for the men—he would have no authority whatever to take tea out of the warehouse—he was there to prevent others from doing so—this tea was in bond—I found Mason with the officer on the stair<lb></lb>case of the warehouse and saw this tea in the apron—Lloyd told me he had found it on him—I then gave him in charge—on our way to the station we met Batishall coming down Botolph-lane—Lloyd asked him if he had any tea about him—he said "No"—Lloyd took a bundle from him which contained about 5lbs. of tea—I think it consisted of two or three different sorts—we have every kind of tea at our warehouse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the tea</hi>) this appears to be all of the same kind, but I am not a judge of tea myself.</p>

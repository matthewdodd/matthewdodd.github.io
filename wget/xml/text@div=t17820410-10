             sworn.</p>
               <p>Last Saturday evening I lost three teaspoons out of a drawer in the parlour. I went between five and six on Sunday evening to look for the spoons, and I missed three; on the monday evening we heard of one being pledged in my wife's name for two shillings, the prisoner lodged in the one pair of stairs, I saw her in the house that day, we found one spoon on the Monday, at Mr. Cottrel's, a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The prisoner lodged with us, always behaved well before, has lived in the house eight years, I have kept it four years, and she has lived with me ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cottrell, a pawnbroker, produced a tea-spoon which the prisoner came and offered to pledge with him for two shillings and told me her name was 
               <persName id="t17820410-10-person205">

            . On Monday evening Mrs. Esther came and enquired after some spoons, the prisoner came between nine and ten in the evening on the Saturday to pledge it. I am certain the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esther deposed the spoon was his, it had his and wife's name upon it S. E. C. that he never found the other two, that the prisoner denied the fact, that Mr. Cottrel knew her directly, she absconded, and was found yesterday morning; there were six spoons in the drawer, and a guinea and an half were there in this case, some chairs stood against the drawers, and it was impossible to open the drawer wide enough to get her hands in far enough to take more than three.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner—I have lately removed from 15, Alexandra Terrace, Clapham—on 25th February, a little after 7 o'clock p.m., I was walking in the Mile End Road with my wife—when I came to the corner of St. Peter's Road, next the brewery, Parker made a snatch at my watch chain, he gave it a twist, the chain broke at the swivel, and he ran away with the chain as fast as he could up St. Peter's Road—I ran after him—a man came and tripped me up with his foot and sent me right on my face and hands; I hurt my shoulder very much—I believe by his dress and stature that Wortley is that man, but I could not swear to him, I did not see his face—I got up and called "Stop thief!"and ran as fast as I could, and my wife also—Parker was stopped by the witness Dixon—I came up and said "You vagabond, where is my chain?"—he said "I have not got it"—he began to cry, or appeared to do so, and said if I would let him go he would go on his knees and beg my pardon—he dropped the chain—my wife pointed to it at his feet in the gutter and she picked it up—I am perfectly sure he is the man that snatched it.</p>

It was done very quickly, indeed—there were people about, but that was rather a bye place and rather dark—there was a lamp, just at the corner—Parker was stopped within 20 or 30 yards—when I said where his my chain, he looked on the ground and said "Why, there's your chain."</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my husband, and saw Parker snatch at his watch—I am positive he is the man, he ran as fast as he could up St. Peter's Road, my husband followed him—Wortley tripped him up, I am quite certain of him; I ran and called stop thief; Parker was caught by Mr. Dixon—I came up and asked him for my husband's watch and chain—he said "I have not got his watch"—I said "If you have not got his watch, you have got his chain"—after a little time he said if I would let him go he would tell me where the chain was—he afterwards said it was in the gutter; I saw it and picked it up—I did not see him drop it—a constable was fetched, and he was taken to the station—Wortley followed and asked</p>

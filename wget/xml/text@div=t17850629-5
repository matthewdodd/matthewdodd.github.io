               <p>Court. Is there a possibility of getting to the window but by a ladder? - I looked over the bannisters and saw the back yard door wide open, upon that, I imagined somebody had broke into the house, I went and called the house maid, the spoons were kept on a side-board in the knife case in the fore parlour, which is on the ground floor, it shuts with a pulley; we then went into the garden, and looking up to the window, which I saw open up stairs, there was a ladder fixed against it, our own ladder, all the things mentioned in the indictment were missing from the side-board; I saw the things a very little while before, but I cannot recollect whether I saw them the day before, I saw them at the justices, and I knew them to be the prosecutor's property.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the sash was down before you put the shutters to? - Yes, there was no fastening at all upon it, it was only down; then I put to the shutter, there are no others windows of this room, all the other windows were shut up, I cannot say that I shut them all up, but I saw them all shut up at the lower part of the house, I saw the doors all fastened, and the door of the back yard was locked that night and bolted; but I cannot speak to the upper part of the house, these things were kept on the side board in the fore parlour .</p>
               <p>When did you see them last ? - I cannot tell in particular, I saw them very lately so far as my knowledge, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290016"></xptr> they are my master's property, I cannot judge of the mark because I am no scholar.</p>

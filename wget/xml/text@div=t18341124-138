                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Levall, and live in Burn's-place, Chapel-street, Edgware-road. On Thursday, the 20th of November, at eight o'clock in the morning, I and my husband went out—the street door opens by a string, which I pulled down—we occupy the first floor back room—I locked my room door, I am confident, and left every thing secure—I re<lb></lb>turned at half-past eight o'clock at night—I know the prisoner—she lodged at No. 4, opposite—she had told me she was going to Ireland—she knew my room—when I returned, I found my room door burst open, my trunks opened, and this property gone—I went and told my husband, who gave information at the office.</p>

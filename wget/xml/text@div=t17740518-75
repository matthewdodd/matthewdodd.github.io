On the Wednesday this happened between nine and ten in the morning I heard the nurse of the foul ward cry murder; I found the prisoner trying to get in at the window of the foul ward; I heard her say they were a parcel of pocky whores and she would kill them all; I took her at that time from the window, and sent her about her business, but she said she would get in and beat them all, for that she would get to the fire; but there was no further disturbance till about an hour after; then I heard the cry of murder again; I went and found the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180042"></xptr> prisoner in the soul ward; there were Gogan, the deceased, and two other persons, and Jones the nurse of the ward was standing at the door; I saw the prisoner by the fire-place, with a poker in her hand, with which I saw her strike the deceased upon the right side of her face: I ran up to her and took the poker out of her hand; I asked her what she meant, and said she had killed the woman; she said I was a street-walking bitch, and she would serve me in the same manner; with assistance I tied her hands, she abusing me me all the time; we got her away and put her into the dead house; the deceased bled at the mouth directly and said that Holding had murdered her; it was a short bit of a poker that belonged to the ward; the deceased lived four weeks and two days and then died; the prisoner was not in her senses as I thought like another woman; she had had fits and they had much affected her.</p>

            . I was in bed in the room where this happened; I was in a salivation; my bed stood with the back towards the fire-place, so that unless I got up I could not see what passed; there was first a dispute between the deceased and the prisoner about the fire; the deceased got up, and the prisoner having rose up out of her chair to get at some coals to put on the fire, the deceased sat down in her place, upon this the prisoner struck the deceased a blow on the forehead upon the right side of her cheek with the poker; her mouth immediately started out with blood, and she bled continually from that time to her death; with some difficulty the prisoner was put out of doors, and then she wanted to come in again through the window and threatened me because I had endeavoured to take the deceased's part; the mistress of the workhouse put the prisoner then into the dead house, where she continued some time; the room where they were is a long narrow room; my head was towards the fire place; I fate up in order to take the deceased's part.</p>

            . I am master of the workhouse; I was not at home at the time; when I came home I understood the woman had been hurt: the prisoner was the person accused; she was not in any custody; when the woman was dead I thought it necessary the committee should know it; they issued their orders to have her confined and then she was not to be found; she voluntarily surrendered herself afterwards to take her trial.</p>
               <p>- Tyrrell. I am a surgeon; I attend this workhouse: the deceased, who had been in a course of salivation under my care, was perfectly recovered and was fit to be discharged; she was kept in the house a week longer only out of greater caution; I saw her the next day after this accident happened; I found a wound in her right cheek, which was only a quarter of an inch each way; there was a violent contusion and inflammation, and I judged from its appearing to have bruised the maxillary glands, that it would prove mortal, because being just come out of a salivation the parts were very tender, and though she was perfectly recovered, yet a wound there might produce those consequences, and be mortal: this wound was the cause of her death.</p>

             Hawkshaw, a widow, who lives at Mr. Ashbee's house in the parish of Marylebone. On Tuesday, the 22d of May, I lost two silver table-spoons, and three silver forks, from the kitchen, the persons had got in by lifting up the window sash; I had shut the window myself about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060011"></xptr>o'clock, and missed the things about half-past one. I found the window wide open - it leads into the area - the area gate was shut, but not locked; the area door was bolted, but the kitchen inner door was open. I was in the back yard at the time, and heard nobody in the house; Mrs.

               <p>"If you will tell where the tea-pot and bason are, I will do all I can for you." He said he did it all himself, and would shew where he threw them.

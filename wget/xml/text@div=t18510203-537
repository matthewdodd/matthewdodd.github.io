                  </hi>. I am porter to the College attached to St. Bar<lb></lb>nabas Church, Pimlico. On Saturday, 2nd Feb., at half-past nine o'clock at night, I saw the Church window safe—I saw it at a quarter to eight next morning, but did not examine it—at nine I missed the copper<lb></lb>wire guard which was fastened to the window the night before—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I afterwards found it in an unfinished house in Ranelagh-grove—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the property of William James Early Bennett and the Churchwardens' jointly—the Churchwardens are Sir John Harrington and Mr. Charles Briscoe.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 96). I found the guard behind the door of an unfinished building in Ranelagh-row, about thirty yards from the Church, last Sunday—I watched, and about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner came, picked it up, put it on his shoulder, and was going away with it, when I stopped and asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "All right, I am after nothing"—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the post-office—In consequence of complaints I went on 1st August to Mr. Elphinston's and placed myself in a position to watch the cupboard—the prisoner went to the cupboard soon after four o'clock, opened the door, looked in, and went away—the cupboard is a considerable distance inside the shop—the post-office business is done at the end—there is a counter the length of the shop, which would prevent the prisoner being seen at the cupboard—he came again at about twenty minutes past five, opened the door, took a quantity of letters out, placed them under his arm, and shut the door—I immediately went into the street and met him. leaving the shop—I asked him what he had got there, and exposed the letters, by moving his coat—he began to cry and begged for forgiveness, saying that it was the first time he had taken any—I took him into a private room and sent for his master, Mr. Tuckett, of 76, Old Broad-street, who came, and the, prisoner took from his waistcoat a quantity of fresh stamps and portions of addressed envelopes, and said that they were from letters which he had taken from that place—here are portions of about sixty envelopes—I took him to the post-office and was about searching him when he took a lot more stamps from his pocket, altogether there were about 100, there were twenty-two letters—he also gave me this little case which he said he had taken from a letter—these stamps which are in it he said he had taken from other letters—he was asked what he had done with the letters, and said that he had torn them up, and also two or three crossed cheques which were in them which he</p>

                  </hi>. I assist Mr. Elphinston in making up the bag—most of the commercial letters come in between 4 o'clock and 6—this cupboard has been in the shop these twenty years, and I have assisted all that time—it is five or six feet from where we register letters—you can put in a bundle without putting them in one at a time.</p>

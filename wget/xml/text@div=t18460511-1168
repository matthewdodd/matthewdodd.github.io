                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Coles Child, a coal-merchant—I had a number of metal taps of his in my room at the office, in Camomile-buildings, East Greenwich—I saw them safe on the 11th of April—I did not miss them till Rawlinson came and told me on the Wednesday following that she had stolen them—she said she was in great distress, and asked if I would go to the man, and say I had given them to her—I said, "Certainly not; I am ashamed of you; go about your business"—I counted the taps, and there were two deficient—the officer came to me afterwards—I believe these are the taps—I had thirteen of the same kind, and missed two of them.</p>

On the 11th of November, about a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I was going to the Owen's Arms, public-house, three doors from my house - it was one of the illumination nights, and as light as at any time of the day; I was lame, and had a stick. My arms were pinioned by two persons - Robinson was one of them - and at that moment Sack came up and drew my watch from my fob - he pulled it twice; I turned round, and knocked him down with my stick, he got up and ran down Owen's-court, alone. I then struck at Robinson, and called out Stop thief! There were fourteen or fifteen in the gang - they all made off. On Tuesday, the 14th, I went to the Swan, with Phipps, and saw twenty or twenty-five men, apparently of the same gang, I saw the prisoners among them, and pointed them out. I have no doubt of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you dined at the Owen's Arms - A. No; three of us had two pints of wine there. I struck Sack as soon as I had lost my watch. It was a glaring light, and I could see plainly.</p>

            . On the Saturday night of the illumination I was at the Swan, at Islington, mending stockings in the taproom. I live there. Sack came in between five and six o'clock in the evening - it was very wet all day - he was eating some bread and cheese; he called for a pint of beer, and stood before the fire to dry himself; he afterwards laid down in a box in the taproom, and went to sleep; he remained asleep until half-past ten o'clock, and never went out until he went home when the landlord cleared the house. Robinson came in about half an hour after him - I knew him before - he remained in the taproom till about six o'clock, and then went into the parlour, I did not see him after.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Are you married - A. Yes. I did not go out to see the illuminations - I am sure it was rainy. I saw them both there on Monday evening also. The landlord saw them, he is not here.</p>

Robinson came in first, it was about five o'clock, and Sack came about half-past five. I will swear it. He was very wet, and stood before the fire, eating some bread and meat. He went to sleep in a box, and did not awake until the young woman awoke him by the landlord's order to go home. I saw Robinson in the parlour, drinking with Wilmot, at six o'clock. Robinson came in first. Owen's-place is a quarter of a mile off. I was in and out of the room snuffing candles.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there then? - A. Yes; they both spoke together; I do not know what they said then; he said I had got a man's watch in my pocket, and if I did not deliver it to him he would take me to the watch-house; I told him he might take me, and then I would not give it him; the prisoner desired me to call the young woman down to him; I went into the passage to call this young woman down, and the young man struck me; at the time I was struck, I had the man's watch in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had it in your pocket then; you had it in your pocket when you went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not particularly observe that you had it in your pocket at that time? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the young man struck at you; you did not perceive that any person took the watch at that time? - A. No, I was very much in liquor at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you to the Justice? - A. The constable; that was on the Tuesday or Wednesday following; the man that owned the watch sent for the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after you received this blow? - A. I went up stairs to my own room, after I recovered myself; the young man I received the watch from was asleep, and when he awaked he missed his watch; he asked for his watch, and I told him, as well as I could, how I had lost it; he said he would take me to a Justice; I said I was very willing to go; on Tuesday, I think it was, he took me to the Justice; I have seen the watch since at Marlborough-street, but I did not know the watch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You live in St. Giles's; you never had the good luck to be married in this country? - A. I have been married in Ireland.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You were in company with the last witness on the morning of the 26th of June? - A. I was; I went home with her to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much in liquor? - A. I was not so much in liquor, but I knew very well what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge of your watch to any body? - A. I gave it to the girl and desired her to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the girl for any liquor? - A. I said if she wanted any thing here was a shilling, that was all; I wanted to go to sleep; she said, let us have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your intention to go to sleep when you parted with your watch? - A. Yes, I had been out in the country, and had spent the evening with some friends, who had kept me late.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you awake when she returned? - A. No, I awoke in the morning, and desired her to give me the watch; I was in a hurry to go to work; she told me she had not got it; she told me two men took it: they knocked her down in the passage, and took it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since? - A. Yes, I saw it again on the 25th of July, I believe, in the possession of Mr. Dobree; I found it out by a hand-bill I got printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the watch? - A. Yes, 111; and there were the two initials(TR)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120056"></xptr>of my name on the swivel; the wife of the prisoner offered me money to make it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had not been acquainted with that girl before that night? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were sober enough to know what you were about? - A. I know that I delivered the watch to her.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was very drunk, she told me so herself, and you gave her, who was then drunk, and was going out, a watch to take care of? - A. I cannot say I was sober, but I knew what I was about; and she did not seem to me to be quite drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was quite a stranger to you; and there was another girl in the room? - A. Yes; she told me she was an acquaintance of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw a man in the room when you lost your watch; the girl was out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her a shilling to bring home liquor, for her and you to drink together? - A. I did not want any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she to bring it home? - A. I expected it so.</p>
               <p>Q. She staid some time; you knew nothing of her till the morning when you awoke? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She said you charged her with stealing it? - A. I took her to the office, that I might have a good understanding.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with her that she should have two guineas? - A. I offered a guinea to any one that would bring the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a highway-robber; do you know any thing of a forty pounds reward? - A. I have heard of such a thing, but I do not know the truth of it; I know no more than by hear-say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You told me the girl asked for liquor, and that you gave her the shilling to get what she liked with it; you told me that you did not want the liquor yourself, you wanted only to sleep; and now you say you expected the liquor? - A. I expected the liquor, but I did not want any of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Payne, pawnbroker, in Bow-street, Bloomsbury; I took in a watch on the 3d of July last, I lent ten shillings and seven-pence on it, the maker's name is Young.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive it? - A. I cannot tell, it was a man; it was pledge in the name of Shaw. On the 13th following, the prisoner, Shaw, brought me the ticket, and asked me five shillings more on the watch, to the best of my knowledge it was him; after he had asked for five shillings more on the watch, he hesitated for a time, and took a pound note out, and took the watch out.</p>

             sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Dobree, No. 135, Holborn: On Friday, the 13th day of July, the prisoner brought a watch, and asked a guinea on it; I looked at the watch, and found it was worth a good deal more, I know the prisoner by pledging the watch; I asked him if it was his own watch; he said, it is, I only want a guinea on it; I lent him the guinea; I looked at him, I could not challenge him with it; when he was gone, I saw T R on the swivel, the name that he gave was

There was a printed hand-bill delivered to me on the 26th of July, and finding the T R mentioned in the hand-bill, I remembered taking in a watch with T R on the swivel; and, in my own opinion, I conceived I should be able to tell the person that pledged it when I was asked; I went to Marlborough-street, and was taken to a place where several people were locked up, I desired the officer not to point out any person to me, and I pointed to the prisoner at the bar; I firmly believe him to be the man that pledged the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed-victualler, but am now out of business, and live at 3, James-street, Bethnal-green. I cohabited with the prisoner—on Thursday, 20th July, I was out all day at my daughter's to dinner—I left there about half-past twelve o'clock, and got home about one—I walked home—it is two miles—I had a little to drink, but I was quite sober—I knocked at the door—I occupy the parlours—I was kept knocking ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was not raining—the prisoner said I should not come in, I might go to my whores, where I was in the habit of going, that she knew my appoint<lb></lb>ments, and where I had been; and a great deal of very aggravating language, if I came in there she would murder me, for I should never sleep in the house that night, but I said I could not go elsewhere at that time in the morn<lb></lb>ing—she opened the door to me at last, and began to abuse me just in the same way, and told me where and who I had been with—I told her not to bother me, I wished to go to bed—she was entirely dressed—the bed, which is a turn<lb></lb>up one, was not down, and the drawers in front were not removed, and the bed can't be let down till they are—I had to go through the front room to the bed room, and she said she would murder me before I should go—I said, "Don't bother me, I mean to go to bed, that is all about it"—as I was taking hold of the door, she took up the poker, struck me a blow, and said, "I will murder you if you attempt to go into that room"—I said, "Don't say you will murder me, for you have already done that"—I put up my hand and caught another blow on my thumb—had I not caught it, no doubt it would have killed me—my hand was full of blood directly, and directly she saw the blood, she walked out into the passage and called out "Murder!"—I went into the street and called for the police—I bled very much—I gave her in charge that</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 210 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). I saw the prosecutor going home on the morning in question—he was drunk—he was about 300 yards from his home—I walked by his side, assisting him, at least, I put him inside the pavement away from the kerb as he slipped twice, and left him knocking at his door—about half-an-hour after, hearing cries of murder, I went and found him bleeding profusely—he said "she had done it with a poker, or some<lb></lb>thing"—I got assistance, and went into the prisoner's room—I found her undressed—I saw two pokers there, both in their right places—the little one was on the hob—I produce the other—which he says it was done with—I examined it, but found no blood on it—I saw blood on the floor of the room, and a considerable quantity at the street door—I sent him to the doc<lb></lb>tor's, and took the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house with my wife. I heard the pro<lb></lb>secutor knocking at the door about one o'clock in the morning, and I heard the prisoner call him an old whoremonger, and say he should not come in, that her life was in danger—after he came in I heard him accuse her of starv<lb></lb>ing her apprentice—she said, "If you say that again I will murder you"—I did not hear any blow struck—I afterwards went down stairs, and saw a pool of blood on the threshold, and some spots in the room—there was a good fire in Mrs. Burn's bedroom—there are two rooms, and I believe a bed in each.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the London Hospital, on the morning of 20th July, when Culf was brought there; he was tipsy—he had a contused wound on the left side of the forehead, about an inch and a half above the eyebrow, about three-quarters of an inch long, and extending to the bone—it might have been inflicted by the poker—it was serious from its consequences, for erysipelas came on—I attended him as an out-patient for six days—he did not come after—I do not believe the wound could be occasioned by a fall—it might be caused by a fall on a fender—the wound was not one of that shape—I did not see this fender.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he fell against a fender, the same effects would have been produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if he had fallen with the whole weight of his body, but then I think he would have had contusions about his face—the blow might be inflicted by a poker without leaving any marks of blood on it, because all the vessels would be compressed when the blow was inflicted, and the blood would be squeezed out of them before it got to the poker—some short time would elapse before the blood flowed.</p>

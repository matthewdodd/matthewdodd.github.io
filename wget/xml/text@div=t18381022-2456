On Sunday morning, the 23rd of September, during church time, I was sitting at my window, which com<lb></lb>mands a view of the road, and of Mr. Booth's house and of Floyd's garden sideways—I saw Cunliffe cross the road into the prisoner's gate—she stopped there from five to ten minutes—I saw the prisoner at the gate during that time, opposite the door of Mr. Booth's house—I could not we whether he was watching the door—he was about five yards distant, looking down the road, not towards the door—I could not see Mr. Booth's door, because it is on the side—I saw a man enter the house—he came from the church-yard on the left of the house—the prisoner was looking down the road from the way the man went up—he was looking up in the direction the man came—I cannot say he must have seen him, but I saw him—the man entered at the front door—he must have passed within five yards of the prisoner to enter the door—I saw him come out of the house in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

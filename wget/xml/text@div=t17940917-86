               <p>Q. What time of the night was it? - Between ten and eleven, I suppose half after ten; I took off my coat, and waistcoat, and put it at the back of the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a great coat? - No, it was not; in my waistcoat pocket were four guineas; my watch was in my coat pocket, I cannot exactly say whether my watch was in my waistcoat pocket, or coat pocket; I had no great coat on at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean four guineas in gold, or three guineas and two half guineas? - Three guineas and a half in gold, and twelve shillings in silver; the linen handkerchief was in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your watch in your coat pocket? - As I was going up stairs I took my watch out of my fob, and put it in my coat, or waistcoat pocket, I cannot say which; the prisoner went to my coat and waistcoat pocket, and carried off my watch, money and handkerchief; the handkerchief I see in her hand, the watch and money I heard rattle, when she went to my coat, I had no idea at that moment, that she had taken my watch or money; she went down stairs, and in the course of a minute after, I went to my coat, and on searching for my watch and money, I found they were carried off, and I went down stairs, and took the light in my hand, that was in the room, and on looking up the court, I perceived a watchman at the head of the court; I called him, and told him what had happened, I described the woman to him, and he told me that he had seen a person of that description, at the time I mentioned, passing up the court; the woman I found in the same house, in the evening; I am certain it was the same woman; on searching that evening after wards I found my handkerchief, the evening I saw the woman; I brought her to the watch-house, and returned with some of the watchmen; and on searching the prisoner's room, I found the handkerchief that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at any time in that room but herself? - No; at the time I took her, she had another person with her, her husband, or some friend of her's; I found the handkerchief in a small cupboard in the room; nothing else has never been found.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.

The house were I was taken was a common lodging house, and any body goes in that will, that can pay so much a night for sleeping in it; therefore that night I was taken, I had a lodging, and being distressed, I paid a shilling for to sleep there along with the man that was taken with me. I have no friend on earth that I know of.</p>

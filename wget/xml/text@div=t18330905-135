I took the prisoner into my service from the workhouse - on the 17th of August I was going to bed about eleven o'clock; the prisoner told my wife in my presence, that she had left the child's frock in the yard; I told her to go and fetch it - she went, and came back, and said she could not find it - I then accused her of pawning it; she said she had, and gave me the duplicate - I then asked her what else she had of my property, and she handed me over eighteen more duplicates; I told her she could not deceive me, but I made her no promise nor threat - she gave me the duplicates, and said she hoped I would not be hard with her - I made no reply, but took her to the station-house, and gave the duplicates to the officer.</p>

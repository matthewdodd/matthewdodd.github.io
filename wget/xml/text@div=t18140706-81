            . On the 7th of June, I was in the park; I saw the prisoner and two more; by seeing their motions I followed them a length of time with Barrett, another officer, and when they got to the King's palace. Lions took from the gentleman this silk handkerchief. The prisoner, Taylor, was in company with Lions. We had followed the prisoner and two others to and from in the park. The three men were in company together all the time in the park. It was as much as we could do to take Lions and Taylor. We could not get at the prosecutor, I took Taylor; Barrett took Lions; he rushed out of his hands.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Johnson at the time. I saw the prisoner in company with two others. The prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's right hand coat pocket, and took out a piece of paper; he chucked the paper down, and said it was no chance. The person not in custody took this handkerchief out of his gentleman's pocket. I took him. He rushed out of my hands. Out of Taylor's pocket we found two handkerchiefs. I am positive they were all together. I am positive to the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Them two handkerchiefs. I bought in Petticoat-lane. I was bailed out, and attended here last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

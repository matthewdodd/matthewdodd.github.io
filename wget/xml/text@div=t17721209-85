             ave me a note to carry for acceptance to Smith, Wright, and Gray, in Lombard-street, some time in April 1771. about the 20th. Bird was in the parlour when I came in with the note in my hand; I said I did not rightly know the house; Mr. Bird offered to take it, and get it accepted, to save me the trouble of going into the city, and as there was no indorsement upon the bill I gave it him: he lodged at my house; and passed for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Neale. In Parliament-street. As he appeared like a gentleman, I had no doubt of him? the bill had 21 days to run after acceptance; he went out, and returned about three to dinner, and told me he had left the note for acceptance at the bankers; I enquired if that was common, and was told it was; he lay at my house that night, and went away in the morning, and I never saw him again till he was brought to Sir

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Thompson, a hosier, in Newgate-street; the prisoner came to my master's, and looked out some stockings, on the 22d of April 1771, to the amount of 40 s. he presented this bill, and desired to have cash for it: I took it to Mr. Thompson; he desired me to tell the gentleman he would have nothing to do with it; which I did; he said if we had any doubt, he was willing to stay till we enquired at the bankers whether it was a good bill, and their acceptance accordingly; I went to Messrs. Smith, Wright, and Gray; they said it was a good bill, and their acceptance; they asked me the reason why I brought it; I told them because it was offered by a stranger; Mr. Thompson gave him change for it; I told them because it was offered by a stranger; the next day Mrs. Neale came to out house, and said the bill was forged; he brought it the same day it was accepted.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose Smith, Wright, and Gray are Quakers, because it is accepted the 22d day of the 4th month.</p>
               <p>Read. They are Quakers.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of February, I was in Lower Thames street, and saw a wagon in Upper Thames-street, loaded with boxes—I went towards it, and saw Munroe about ten or fifteen yards from the wagon, carrying away two boxes, one in each hand—I did not see him take them from the wagon—they were the same sort of boxes as were on it—I have since discovered that they contain prepared oil—he went up Miles's-lane—I followed him, and Grove, the other policeman, was before me—I stopped Munroe with the two boxes, and asked where he was going with them—he said it was all right, he was going to take then to the White Lion cellar in Gracechurch-street, to book them—I asked where he brought them from—he could not answer—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody—he said he had had them given him by some man.</p>

I was in company with Russell, and saw Munroe taken into custody—I followed him up Miles's-lane—when he was stopped, he was about to go into a beer-shop with the boxes—I asked where he was going—he said, "It is all right—it is all right"—I let Russell go on with Munroe, while I went back to take the address of the wagon—I found Davey, who was the driver of the wagon, stopping close against the Black Bull public-house in Upper Thames-street—I took the address of' the wagon, and asked Davey what he was waiting for—he said, "To get half-a-pint of beer"—I asked where he came from—he said, "From Lower Thames-street," and mentioned the name of Alley—I said, did they belong to any of the wharfs—he said, "Yes, Cox's Quay"—I asked how many boxes he had got—he said, "Fifty"—I said, "Are you sure there are fifty?"—he said, "There to be fifty, or else I have had two stolen"—I had not said any to him about two—I allowed him to go on—I went to the station to know what to do about taking Davey—the sergeant and I had orders to go and stop the wagon—we stopped it in Bartholomew-close—the cases were counted, and there were but forty-eight.</p>

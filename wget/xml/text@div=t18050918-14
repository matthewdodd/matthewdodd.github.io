               <p>Q. What time was it that you saw him? - A. About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to Snaith and Co's? - A. Yes, I believe it was him.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when he came? - A. He came and asked for a check for Mr. Littledale, and said that he was at a neighbouring coffee-house; I was going to give him a bundle of checks, they contain about twenty-one in number; he said, he did not want that, but merely a single check, which I gave him; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again? - A. Some little time afterwards, on the same day, a person, whom I believe to be the same, came back, and that person I believe to be the prisoner, came back, and said he had made a mistake, that Mr. Littledale wanted a bundle of checks; we have two sorts of checks, one that is in slips, and one that is in sheets; I gave him two of the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Which contained how many checks? - A. I do not know, several; they should and generally do contain about an hundred, but they sometimes fall short; I gave him two sheets, and then he went away.</p>

            , coming to your house on the 22d of June? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to the shop for? - A. He came with this check on purpose to receive payment for it; this is the check that I have now in my hand, and he presented it for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it? - A. I did; as soon as I saw it, I suspected the hand-writing of the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the signature, or the body? - A. The signature; I asked him who he received it from, he said Mr. Foy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You suspected the signature? - A. Yes; I then took and compared this check, which was in my hand, with some others in the house which we had paid, I was then satisfied it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you shewed it to Mr. Watson, one of the partners? - A. I did; then Mr. Watson came round and asked the person where he received it, and he said he received it from a person at the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I object to your saying one word what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In point of fact, that was the man that gave you the check? - A. Yes, he went out, and he returned with the prisoner in about a quarter of an hour; the check I gave to Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did Mr. Watson afterwards return it to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same check, that Mr. Watson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180011"></xptr>returned to you, that you received from the porter? - A. I have no doubt of it, I marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the person that presented the check and the prisoner came in afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what distance of time? - A. In about fifteen minutes afterwards the porter and the prisoner came in, they then went into the back office, and what past then was not in my hearing, and Mr. Watson went with the porter and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You still remain of the opinion, as you were at first, that is not the hand-writing of Mr. Littledale? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Messrs. Littledale and Foy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them write? - A. Yes, frequently</p>
               <p>Q. You having an opportunity of knowing both their hand-writing, having seen them write frequently, are you of opinion that it is not the handwriting of either Mr. Littledale or Mr. Foy? - A. I am perfectly of the opinion that it is not the hand-writing of either.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you are perfectly satisfied that it is not his hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not perfectly satisfied at first that it was not their hand-writing? - A. Yes I was perfectly sure, else I should have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you compared it with other checks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should you have compared it if you were of the opinion before that it was not their hand-writing? - A There was no doubt in my own mind when I compared it.</p>
               <p>Q. One would think when a man was satisfied he would not have compared it - do you mean to say you were perfectly satisfied when you first saw it? - A. Yes, I would not have paid it if I was not perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this check was out of your hands, did you mark it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you marked it after you got it from Mr. Watson? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You received it back from Mr. Watson, and you marked it then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Then after Mr. Watson tendered it you, in order that you should know it at a future time, you put a mark on it, you put no mark on it before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you undertake to swear to it unless you had marked it before, you only know that Mr. Watson told you it was the same check? - A. I will swear that I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that it is the same check.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have said that you were quite satisfied that the signature of that check was not the hand-writing of Littledale and Foy - are there any other persons in that house authorised to sign checks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN WATSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are partner in the house of Littledale and Co. I find, Mr. Watson? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You afterwards returned it to Mr. Liall? - A. Yes, in about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the draft that you returned to him was, to your knowledge, the same that you received from him? - A. Yes, I am sure it was; it was never out of my sight till I returned it to him to make a mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the hand-writing of Messrs. Foy and Littledale? - A. I do. (The note handed to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the hand-writing of either of them? - A. It is not the hand-writing of either of them, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not authorised to pay to any other signature in their name than their own? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You waited a few minutes, and the prisoner did not return? - A. Yes; then I went to the front door of the coffee-house, and there I saw the prisoner running away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he running? - A. Running up Cornhill; he was in the street, I ran after him, and cried out stop him; he turned round, and came up to me; he asked me what I meant by calling after him; I asked him what he meant by running away; he said, he was going to Bishopsgate-street; I said, I would go with him to Bishopsgate-street; when we came to Bishopsgate-street, I asked him where he was going; he said, to Winchester-street; I told him that was not his way to Winchester-street; then I told him if he did not submit to go with me to the banking-house, that I should call for assistance; then I laid hold of his arm, and brought him to the banking-house, and then I delivered him into the hands of the gentlemen of the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to swear positively that that young man is the young man from whom you had the draft? - A. No, I cannot swear positively.</p>

               <p>Q. You will not swear that he is the man? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. When you went from the banking-house to fetch the person who gave you the draft, you say you met this gentleman in the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the man you met in the street the prisoner? - A. I believe it to be the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt of it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. It was the same person that came out and told you the gentleman was writing a letter - he was the same person that went with you to the John and Turkey coffee-house, have you any doubt about that? - A. No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no doubt of the person that came out of the coffee-house, and told you the gentleman was writing a letter, was the same person you brought back to the banking-house - is that so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether the person you saw running away up Cornhill was the same person that went with you to the John and Turkey coffee-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.

No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are one of the Marshals of this City? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for in June last to the banking-house of Messrs. Sikes, Snaith, and Co.? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day did you go to Messrs. Sikes, Snaith, and Co.? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. I did, in the back accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner given to you in charge? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what conversation took place between the prisoner and any body you heard? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nalder. Mr. Watson informed me, in the presence of the prisoner, that the young man, meaning the prisoner, had been guilty of a forgery; he told me to stay a little while, for he had sent for one of his partners who had signed the check; I remained there for some little space of time, and presently the gentleman who is in Court came.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Littledale then presently came? - A. Yes; and at the time the conversation took place between Mr. Littledale and Mr. Watson, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180013"></xptr>was not present; Mr. Watson came back to me in the presence of the prisoner, and said that I must take him into custody, and said that he was satisfied that he was guilty of the forgery; I immediately went to search him, and in his pocket I found these checks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheets are there? - A. Here are two, (they are termed quires,) and one half sheet; they appear to be checks of Messrs. Snaith, Sikes, and Co. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he had done with the other checks? - A. He told me that Wilmott had the other checks, and he was the person who had drawn the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you found them on him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He told you before the search that Wilmott had the checks? - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to state that Wilmott had the checks? - A. Mr. Watson asked him what became of the other checks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. And then afterwards you searched and found the checks which you now produce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which he said Wilmott had? - A. Yes, he said Wilmott had the rest of the checks, and in the origin of the business I understood from him that he had the draft in question from a man of the name of Wilmott.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You say that he stated to you, or that you understood, that he had the check from a person of the name of Wilmott? - A. He did, when I asked him the question how he came by the checks, he repeated that he had the checks in question of a man of the name of Wilmott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Elliott.) Q. Do they appear to be checks from your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be the same checks that you gave to the prisoner? - A. I delivered some checks of the same description as these to the prisoner, I believe; they seem to be the same quantity of checks, I gave him two quires.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there? - A. Here seems to be two quires, excepting the half sheet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Mr. Watson.) Q. What conversation had you with the prisoner respecting the check? - A. When the porter came back with the prisoner, I desired them both to walk into the back accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say it would be better for him to tell? - A. I said nothing at all about it; I then asked the prisoner where he had got that check; he said he had got it from Mr. Foy, who was at John's coffee-house; I thought it right to send a person immediately to John's coffee-house to see; he did not appear to be there, and after some time I sent to Mr. Littledale to satisfy myself; I questioned the prisoner again; he then said he had it of a Mr. Wilmott, or some name like that, who lived in Goodman's fields; I then enquired of him about the quires of checks that were supposed he had taken in the morning; he said he had given those to Mr. Wilmott; the City-marshal found them, as he has stated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called ten witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

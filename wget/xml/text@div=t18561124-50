                  </hi>. I am the wife of Ashley Adam Clifford, a grocer, of No. 5, London-terrace, Hackney-road. On Wednesday, 5th Nov., I got into an omnibus at Shoreditch to go to London-bridge—I sat on the left hand side, in the middle—there was no one above me, two or three gentle<lb></lb>men were below me, nearer to the door, on each side—the prisoners got in near the Eastern Counties Railway—Reynolds sat opposite me, and I made room for Hasletine to pass; she wished to sit on my right side, and I went to the top of the omnibus—I do not think they spoke together, and I did not notice that they were acquainted—Reynolds had a check shawl folded over her arm—when we were near Camomile-street one of the horses stumbled, and the omnibus was brought to a stand—I looked through the small window in front, which was on my left, to see what was the matter, and on turning round Hasletine was much nearer to me than she was before; not uncomfortably close, but there had been space for two people between us before—the omnibus went on almost directly—the prisoners got out at Cornhill—the conductor then beckoned me from the top of the omni<lb></lb>bus, and in consequence of what he said to me, I felt in my pocket, and missed my purse, containing 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but I did not know how much there. was till it was counted at the station—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produeed</hi>)—it was safe when I left home, and I had not had occasion to use it once—the conductor went after the prisoners, and I remained in the omnibus till he came back—I then followed a beadle, who had the prisoners in custody, to the station house, where I identified my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I was conductor of this omnibus on 5th Nov.—Mrs. Clifford was in it—one of the horses stumbled, and I got off the monkey board to assist the coachman, as was my duty—as I was in the act of getting down, I saw Hasletine close to Mrs. Clifford, with her mantle thrown over her hip—I thought it was rather close to be comfortable, considering that the omnibus was not full, and my suspicions were aroused—I had seen the prisoners get in one after the other; they came up to the omnibus at the same time, between Shoreditch Church and Hackney—they got out at the corner of Cornhill—the fare is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each person, and Reynolds paid me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, which I concluded was for the two, and let the other pass with<lb></lb>out payment, as they had both got in together—directly they got off the step, I said to Mrs. Clifford, "Have you lost anything?"—she felt in her pocket, and said, "Oh! dear, yes, and I shall not be able to pay my fare"—I caught sight of the prisoners' cloaks going round Leadenhall-street—I went through the market, and saw them together close to the pump, touched them on the shoulders, and said, "You have been robbing a lady in my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>"—I took hold of one of them, and the other swung herself away, and walked towards the pump again—I am sure of their being the persons—Hasletine said, "Let us go, do not expose us"—I said, "I must give you in charge of a policeman"—I did so, and returned to the omnibus, and informed Mrs. Clifford.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">seaman, Greenhithe.</hi> On the 4th of Nov. I was at the Har<lb></lb>row public-house, at Poplar—the prisoner was potman there—I went to bed—my shoe was tied in a knot—I got the prisoner to untie it—I had my watch and guard—the prisoner said he would take them for me till the morning, and said he was going to get <hi rend="italic">spliced</hi>—he took off my shoes, and I took off my trow<lb></lb>sers—he assisted me—I shook the trowsers, and the money was in the pocket—he bid me good night, and closed the door—I awoke in the morning, went to the prisoner's bed-room, and called to him for my watch—he was not to be found—this is my watch.</p>

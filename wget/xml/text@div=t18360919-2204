                  </hi>, about four o'clock on the 4th of September, I went on board the steamer coming from Gravesend to London—I had a watch at that time—I missed it in the course of three quarters of an hour—this is it.</p>

I was on board the Diamond steamer about five minutes before four o'clock on the Sunday—I go down on Saturdays with straw bonnets, and on Saturday night it rained, and I could not return—I came home on the Sunday, and saw the prosecutor on board, and the prisoner, and a woman—it began to rain, and we went into the cabin—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor was down, and the prisoner, and the woman, and I went down; and there was another person, who attends Gravesend-market with clothes—we sat on one side, and the prosecutor, the prisoner, and the woman on the other—they had a glass of rum—the prosecutor then said it was not raining, and he would rather be on deck—he went, and the woman and the prisoner followed him—I then followed—the prosecutor, not being ac<lb></lb>customed to be on board, fell—the woman stumbled over him; and, upon their getting on their feet again, the prosecutor treated them with a glass of rum, and said he was very sorry to be the cause of her falling—a few minutes afterwards the prosecutor was going about the vessel, lamenting that he had lost his watch—several gentlemen asked him who he had been with—he said he did not know—I said there was a man and woman on board who he had been with, and I should know them again—I pointed them out—the</p>

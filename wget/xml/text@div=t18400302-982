                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins, and live in King-street, New Town, Deptford, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford. I em<lb></lb>ployed the prisoner on the 25th of November to make some winter dresses for my family—she remained with me till the 29th—she came every morning, about half-past nine o'clock, and went home every night about half-past nine, or a quarter to ten o'clock—on the day she came I had a child come home from school ill with the scarlet fever—four more after<lb></lb>wards sickened with it, and the prisoner said she was ill, and could not stop—she seemed ill, and went away about half-past four o'clock—I did not</p>

C," and I had scratched it several times in the face with the key, in winding it up.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You employed the prisoner to make dresses for your family, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for which I paid her—I had known her three years—she had taught me the straw bonnet making,—she did not lodge in my house before this, not to live in it—she cer<lb></lb>tainly slept there sometimes, when she had been at work—she slept there to the time the Queen was crowned, perhaps two or three nights—she came to my house to work, and slept there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she come there with your knowledge innocently and morally to sleep in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she was not an innocent girl when she came to my house—she said she had Been in the habit of seeing different gentlemen—I certainly knew her to be a gay girl when she came to my house, and I felt for her—I cannot exactly say how often she slept at my house after she told me that—she might come many times and I not know it—I am not going to tell you I do not keep a lodging-house—I do, and am not ashamed to own it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is yours a house of such a description that young women may come into it without your knowledge, and sleep in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I might not have always been up when she came in—I allow persons to sleep there without my knowledge, if I know them—I do not make money by it—I do not mean to swear that I do not—I do not consider mine a proper moral house—I am asked for the truth, and shall not deny it—I was never paid any thing by her for sleeping there—the men that came with her paid me—I cannot tell who they were—I once sold the prisoner a small amethyst brooch and a ring—she was never in the habit of pledging things for me—I am not in the habit of letting strangers sleep at my house, and do not let a bed perhaps once in a month sometimes—my husband is a commercial traveller, and is away two or three months at a time—he is on his journey now, and is at Liverpool I believe—I cannot say exactly where he is—he left me on Saturday to go his journey—I was married to him at St. Margaret's, Westminster, and shall have been married thirteen years on the 11th of July next—I do not let lodgings in this way while he is at home, but I have eleven children, and I must do the best I can—they are not all living with me—I have two at school—I bring them up in a respectable way—they see no bad example in my house.</p>

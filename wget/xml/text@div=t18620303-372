                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and carry on business at 2, Westminster-road—on Saturday, 15th February, the prisoner came into my shop and asked for a cake of Windsor soap—I, being on the other side of the counter, took it out of a glass case, gave it to my son, he gave it to her, and she gave him in payment a florin—he brought it round to me, I examined it, and found it was bad—I took a pair of ordinary scissors and cut it in two pieces—I said to the prisoner, "This is a bad one"—she said, "Oh, is it," and tendered a shilling which I found to be bad also—I broke that also, and said, "This is bad too"—I then sent for a policeman and gave the pieces of the shilling and florin to him, and the prisoner into custody—when she went down to the station she said she got them from some gentle<lb></lb>man; she gave no name.</p>

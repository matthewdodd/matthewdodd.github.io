                  </hi>. I live in Charles-street, Bethnal-green, with my brother, James Young—my brother, my sister Mary Ann, and my younger brother John lived there. On the 30th of November, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I went out along with my sister, leaving my youngest brother in the house—I bolted the back-door and shut the street door—I came home at twenty minutes to nine o'clock at night, and found the outer door and the back door open—I missed the property stated—I had seen it when I went out—I left my dresses up stairs and my cloak hanging behind the front bed-room door—when I went into my bed-room there was a parcel of cuttings and things about, and a box broken open by a poker, and things strewed about.</p>

I live in my brother James's house—I went out on the morning of the 30th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, leav<lb></lb>ing no one in the house—I saw the back door and the middle door bolted—I shut the front door—I did not lock it—it is a spring lock—it could not be opened from the outside without a key—I came home between eleven and twelve o'clock at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk weaver, and live in Coventry-street, which is round the corner from Parliament-street. I cannot see from my house-door into Parliament-street. On the 30th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw three persons pass my door, one of whom, which was the prisoner, I knew—I have known him by light for twelve or fourteen years—I was still at my own door when they passed—it was not raining at that time—the prisoner was not above two feet, at the farthest away from me—there is a gas-lamp at the opposite corner of the street where the shop is—I walked close behind them, and saw them knock at the first door in Parliament-street, on the left-hand side—I knew who lived there, but I did not know their names—it was the first door after you pass the dead wall—I stood at the corner—when I saw him knock there, two went in—I cannot say whether the door was opened to them or not—the prisoner and another with a Petersham coat on, went in—the other stopped outside—after he had been there five or ten minutes, the one in the Petersham coat came out and came to the corner, and stood facing my door, for nearly a minute and a half—when I saw him coming, I went to my door, and he stood facing me—he went back again and went in—when he went back, I went from my door to the corner—he stopped in five minutes, and two women came along with an umbrella. and the one that was out with a velveteen shooting coat on, crossed over and whistled, and when the women had come by, he went back to the door and whistled again—when the women came by he was standing nearly oppo<lb></lb>site the door, by the dead wall, which is on the same side as Young's door—he was on the opposite side—after that, in about five minutes, Clark came out—I saw him coming towards the corner, and went back to my</p>

               <p>own door—I saw him come past my door, he went round, I do not know the name of the street, and went through a little court, where there are some posts, he then went into Parliament-street, and went into the house again—they stopped in for about five minutes, and then they came out and went to the one that was on the watch, and went towards the Cambridge Heath-road—I did not perceive any thing upon them—I took no steps to interrupt them—I do not know whether they left the door open or shut—it might be five or ten minutes after eight o'clock when they went up the Cambridge Heath-road—I first gave information of this at about half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you get your living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By working for Mr. Clough—I was working for him on that day—I was standing at my door, smoking my pipe—I worked for Messrs. Jonas and Martin eighteen months—I never followed the occupation of a bullock-drover in Whitechapel or any where else—I have seen plenty of it—I live in the heart of it, but never took any part in it—I only knew the prisoner by sight—I did not go to the house and see if there was any thing wrong, because I did not know exactly at the time whether they intended to rob it or not—if I had found a policeman I should have sent him to the place to see—I was rather flurried at their coming, because I had no one at home at my own place to take care of it—I did not go any further than the corner—I looked for a policeman—I did not say a word about it till I heard there had been a robbery—I will not swear it is not thirty-six feet from Young's door to the corner—I never measured it—I did not speak to the prisoner—I told no one about this till half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 278.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 2nd of December, in the house that he was living in, in Grey Eagle-street, Spitalfields—I searched his lodgings, but found nothing re<lb></lb>lating to this—he stated that he was at Paddington with his wife and some friends on the 30th of November—I told him I wanted him for being a party concerned in a robbery in Christopher-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

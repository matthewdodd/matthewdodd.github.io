               <p>I was at work on the keys the 20th of December, some time in the forenoon, weighing sugar for the King; when I was weighing the sugar, I turned my eyes to a lighter that lay alongside the key, and I saw a man's head appear now and then from the lighter which was loaded with sugar, and I suspected something that was wrong was going forward; and I told the cooper, and he called, come out you Sir, and he walked away: I jumped down and took him; he said, a watchman told him to take it.</p>

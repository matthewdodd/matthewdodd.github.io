                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Fitzroy-place, New-road. The prisoner has been with me between five and six months, as a helper—he lodged with me—on Saturday, the 8th of Nov., I came home, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I had my supper, and then went and lay down on the bed, with my clothes on—that was about half-past one, or two o'clock—the prisoner was in the same room—he laid by my side—about ten o'clock on the Sunday morning I awoke, and found his hand in my jacket pocket—I had my jacket on—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, in silver and halfpence, not gold—there were four half-crowns, I believe, also shillings, sixpences, and half<lb></lb>pence—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "I am only putting the clothes over you"—I got up, went into my mother's, and had my breakfast—I took no more notice to him till the Monday morning—I went to market with Hooper, and boughtbushels of apples, and when I went to pay for them I missed my money—the prisoner was there minding the cart—I then said to the prisoner, "You had your hand in my pocket yesterday morning"—he strongly denied it—we went home together—he was quarrelling with me all the way home—he said he never saw it—I told Hooper to go in and see what he said, and try and get the money back—he sent for me to come in, and I went—the prisoner then said he had taken two half-crowns out of my pocket when I was asleep, but he took none when I was awake—he told me</p>

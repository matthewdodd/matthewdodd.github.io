                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 35, Crown-street—on the night in question I left my premises, about half-past 11, in charge of a man in my employ—next morning I missed a stone bottle, a clock, and other things—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle; and this glass globe, which has rum in it, I left standing on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I was left in charge of the house by Mr. Ellis—it was closed between two and three hours before we went to bed—it was a little before 12 when we retired to rest—this jar and glass bottle were then quite safe in the bar—the shutter and the cellar flap were secure, to the best of my knowledge; I am certain the shutter was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 114). On the morning of 10th October, I was on duty, about half-past 12—I saw the shutter of 35, Crown-street half-way open—I went and pulled it quite open, and saw the prisoner inside, with his left leg up, just in the act of coming out—I said, "What do you do there?"—he said, "All right; I have only looked in, as I know the land<lb></lb>lord, and have used the house"—he then stepped outside, and I took him into custody, and sprang my rattle for assistance—another constable came—I placed him at the window, and took the prisoner to the station—I then returned to the premises, and just inside the sash, where I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soner standing I found this bottle and glass—the clock was found in a dust-bin, in the cellar—I found the witness, Rose, and another man, asleep, upstairs; whether they were drank, or not, I could not say, but I thought they were.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, C</hi> 33). I went to the public-house—I examined the shutters, and found they had been forced open from the out<lb></lb>side—I found the house in a very disorderly state—they appear to have had a distress in that day, and the furniture had been removed, but some few things remained in the bar—I went upstairs, and found the two men lying on a bench asleep, and certainly the worse for liquor—I found the clock in the dust-bin in the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About twenty minutes past 11 I went home, intending to go to bed, as I do every night at half-past 10, only I was rather late that night; when I got home they were sitting at work, my parents having an order to get out. I sat there about half an hour seeing them work, and then</p>

               <p>went out to have a smoke, because they don't like my smoking at home. I went into Brewer-street, intending to come home round Oxford-street I thought I would go and see if Mr. Ellis was gone altogether. When I got to the skittle-ground by the back window I saw the shutter was open I looked in; it was all dark, I could not see anything. I put one leg inside, and was just coming out again, when the policeman came up. I could have got away from the policeman easily. Just as he caught me there was a scuffle in the front bar. He said there was somebody else inside, and just as he said it a door banged up the court. They could have got over Mr. Ellis's wall and got away. I declare that I am quite innocent; I am a respectable tradesman's son, and have witnesses here for my character. The sergeant went round to my last master and got my character, and he can speak about it.</p>

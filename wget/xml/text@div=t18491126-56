                  </hi>. I am the wife of William West. On Saturday night, 24th Nov., between seven and nine o'clock, I went with the prisoner and Mary Ann Allerton from Newgate-market to Fleet-street—I there waited for the prisoner while she went up Johnson'scourt, where she lives—she came back, and we all three went and had some spirits—Allerton then left us, and the prisoner was taking me up a court to a water-closet, and she there pushed or pulled me down—I fell to the ground—I had a black cloth bag, tied with twine, in my basket, with seventy-odd sovereigns in it—she then tried to pull the basket from my arm—I said, "Oh! Mrs. Smith, what are you doing with my basket?"—the handle broke, and I heard the money drop—I said, "Help me look for it down the area," and a woman present said the prisoner had got it—she was given in charge, and taken to the station—the prisoner worked with me at 103, Wood-street, at bonnet-sewing—my husband had given me the money in the morning to take care of, as he was going into the country—there are from twenty to twenty-three persons working in the same place as us—it was the prisoner who wanted to go to the water-closet—my money was safe till we got to the court—I had not seen it from seven or half-past, when I left my work; I cannot say what time it was—we went to more than one public-house—I recollect nothing after I had the second glass of gin in Fleet-street—I was offered brandy, but I cannot say whether I had it or not—I cannot tell whether it was a freak, or whether she meant to steal it—she tried to take the basket from me, but could not, and then she took the bag—the basket was tied with twine—I heard the money <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>, and thought it fell on the iron grating and through the area—I saw her take it from my basket—I cannot tell whether she was sober—we searched the area—none of the money came out of the bag.</p>

I was called by Mr. Oddy; I went to the Court, and saw the prisoner and West, who was crying, and said she had lost her money, and asked me to go down the area and look for it—Mr. Oddy said, "Never mind, this woman (the prisoner) has got her money; take her away to the station"—the prisoner said she knew nothing of it—West was much the worse for liquor, and did not know very well what was going on—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not near so bad as West.</p>

Mrs. West, give me the basket, or you will do something wrong"—that was before she got the basket—West kept crying out, "Mind my money!" and I then saw the prisoner open the basket and take the money out—I said "You have got the woman's money," and then I heard it knock against some place, and I thought it had gone down the area—we got a light, and searched, but could not find it, and Mr. Oddy got a policeman.</p>

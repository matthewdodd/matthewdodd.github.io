            . I live in Cumberland-street, and am a boot and shoemaker - I have known the prisoner about nine weeks. On Sunday morning, the 6th of November, I saw him at his lodgings at the Masons' Arms, at the corner of Titchfield-street, between ten and eleven o'clock - George Piercy was with me; I took him there to look at a time-piece, as the prisoner had asked me if I was in want of such a thing - I said No, but I thought I knew a friend who did, and I took Piercy to look at it at the Masons' Arms; Piercy said he could not afford to buy it, and we parted - the prisoner owed me 11s. for a pair of shoes; he told me if I could sell the time-piece I should have my money, and asked me to try and find somebody or to buy it; I went on the Sunday evening, and asked if he objected to let me have the time-piece in my possession; he said none whatever - he went to the landlady at the bar, and asked if she had any objection to let me have it; she said she would ask her husband; she at last let me have it; I left a half-sovereign as security with her, that I should bring it back if I did not find a purchaser: I took it home to my own house, took it to several persons, and sold it on the following Wednesday to Mr. Baldock, in Hanway-yard, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning; the prisoner and a man named Smith went with me - they waited in Tottenham-court-road, and I went into the shop alone; Baldock was not at home - I saw his shopman, who knew me well; he desired me to call again, and to leave the clock - I told the prisoner this, and called between one and two o'clock; the prisoner went with me, but not Smith- the prisoner did not go into the shop, he waited in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010006"></xptr>public-house in Hanway-yard; I saw Mr. Baldock, and offered it for sale to him - I came out, and asked the prisoner if he was agreeable to take 2l. for the clock, that was including my 11s.; he said Yes: I went back to Mr. Baldock, and sold it to him for 50s.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask the prisoner to take 2l.? A. Because I had had so much trouble about it; I received 50s. for it, and went to the prisoner - I deducted 10s. for myself, 10s. I left as security, and 11s. for the shoes - and paid him 19s.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Why did you go to the prisoner's lodging on the Sunday morning - had you seen him before that? A. Yes, on the Saturday night I took the shoes home to him, and he asked me to come the next morning, and look at the clock; I asked him how he got it, and he said he took it for a bad debt.</p>

            . I keep the Massons' Arms. The prisoner came to lodge at my house about ten weeks ago; he brought a clock to my house on Sunday, the 30th of October - he asked me if he might leave it there, and said it was an old family affair, and he wished to sell it - it remained with me till the Sunday following, the 6th of November, when he brought Tucker and a friend to look at it; about seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner and Tucker fetched it away in a basket - I saw no more of it; I should know it again: he left a china ornament with me when he fetched the clock away - he brought it with him the evening he fetched the clock; I gave it to the officer on the Thursday evening.</p>

I knew the prisoner as my husband's shopmate - he is also a plumber and glazier- he called on us on Friday, the 28th of October, with the time-piece, and asked if my husband was at home; I said No; he said he had something to show him, if I would let him leave it - he produced this time-piece, and left it: and the same evening he brought an ornament - he left it there till Sunday morning, the 30th, when he took the time-piece away, about ten o'clock, and the next Sunday he took the ornament away.</p>

On Wednesday, the 9th of November, Tucker brought this time-piece to my master's, to be looked at; I desired him to leave it till Mr. Baldock returned, which he did - he was paid 50s. for it; this is it - it is a French clock, and worth about 6l. or 7l. - the ornament is English manufacture; I have known Tucker many years, and had a good opinion of him - when he brought it he said he thought it could be got for 50s.</p>

            . I live in Hanway-yard, and am a dealer in French goods. This clock was offered to me for sale; the value of it, in the state it was produced to me, was 2l. 10s. or 3l.; I do not understand the movement of a clock - my foreman is very imperfectly acquainted with the value; I should not know the value of a movement if I looked at it - it has not been examined since; the regular market price which it would fetch from a person who is not a judge of movements, in 2l. 10s. - it is certainly not worth more than 3l.; the ornament is worth 10s.</p>

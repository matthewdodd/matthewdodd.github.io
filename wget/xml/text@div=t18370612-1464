On the 4th of June I was on the London and Birming<lb></lb>ham railway, on the way to Primrose Hill, and lost my handkerchief which I had safe five minutes before—the prisoner was pointed out to me—I took hold of him, and asked if he had not got my handkerchief—he said he had not—I desired him to unbutton his coat, and show me what he had in his pocket—he produced a cotton handkerchief which was not mine, and then either my friend or the policeman put his hand into his pocket and took out my handkerchief, which was a silk one.</p>

I was on the railway on the 4th of June, and saw the prisoner and another walking behind the prosecutor, who was with a young woman—the pri<lb></lb>soner took a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his own left-hand pocket—he took one out of his own right-hand coat pocket, and placed over it—I told the prosecutor, who secured him—I did not see his handkerchief hanging out.</p>

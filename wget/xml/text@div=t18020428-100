Isherwood, at Highgate: On Saturday night, the 24th of April, about a quarter past ten at night, I went into the coach-yard, and found the door, leading into the coach-yard, open; I saw the prisoner put a shovel and a hod over a wall above eight feet high; I called out to him; he made no answer, but got over the wall, by means of a pile of horse-dung; I unlocked the yard-door; he was picking up the hod and shovel, and setting off with them; I immediately attacked him; he said they belonged to his countryman, that he had sent him after them; he said he was at the Rose and Crown; I took him to the Rose and Crown, there was no countryman of his there; Parrott then said, that is my hod and shovel, and he was secured.(The property was produced, and identified by Parrott.)</p>

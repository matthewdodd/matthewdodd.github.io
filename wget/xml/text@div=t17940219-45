I picked up the bag and hallooed out stop thief! a man on the other side of the way catched hold of him by the breast, and held him till I came to him and seized him.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you swear you never lost sight of the prisoner from the time that you saw him with his companions, and from the time that he dropped the bag, till he was collared? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are very sure that the man that you took from the public house, was the man that dropped the bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of his companion? - I never see any thing of him after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bag opened afterwards? - It has never been opened from that time to this; the bag was delivered to the officer.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100039"></xptr>
               <p>On Wednesday morning, 14th April, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was, with my wife, on my way home along High Street, Whitechapel—I stepped into a public house to get a bottle of ginger beer—while I was at the bar, the pri<lb></lb>soner White put his hand into my waistcoat pocket—I told him it was no use, and he had better go out as soon as he possibly could, or I should give him into custody—I did not wait for the ginger beer I had ordered, but left at once, seeing the company I was in—I had hardly got into the street, when I was surrounded by five men—the prisoners were four of them—Thompson placed his arms round my neck, and almost strangled me; and if it had not been for my wife, I think they would have murdered me; I have felt the effects of it ever since; the water ran out of my eyes, as he squeezed my neck—whilst Thompson was doing this, Kay struck me on the head; Thomp<lb></lb>son let me go, and I turned round and saw Kay; they hustled me, and tried to get at my pockets—I buttoned up my coat as I came out of the public house—after I received the blow at the back of the neck, they all ran away—theydid not succeed in getting anything—I am quite positive they are the four men that attacked me, and ill treated me—when I recovered myself a little, I saw my wife and the policeman together—we went in pursuit of the prisoners, and met with two of them; they were secured in less than twenty minutes; I identified them immediately—I saw the other one when the policeman brought him to the station the same morning, and next morning after they were remanded, my wife recognized Hart—I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Where was it that you say I caught you by the throat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Outside the public house door—I cannot say how long you held me by the throat—I saw you when I went into the public house; I was not insensible—I did not say, when I gave you in charge, that I thought you were one of them—I said, "That is one of the men; and that is the other"—I did not know anything about your characters at that time—I pointed you out immediately to the policeman when I came out—I did not offer to fight any one in the public house, nor when I came out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Which pocket did I put my hand into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My waistcoat pocket—I did not tell the Magistrate that you tried to put your handinto my coat pocket—I did not say that I was insensible, and could not say who it was that assaulted me, nor, when I heard the Magistrate say that Thompson had been in prison, did I say, "Then I will prosecute him"—I have been in prison myself for striking my wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kay. Q.</hi> You say I struck you at the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you were behind me—I turned round to see who struck me, and there was no one near me but you—I never said that I heard you say to the other pri<lb></lb>soner in the public house, "Come away; let the man alone; I know him"—Ido not know whether you bad a weapon in your hand—I have no marks to show from the blow—I did not feel that long, but my throat I did; I can hardly swallow now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart.</hi> I do not know these young men, only as friends; I am not guilty. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I do not speak to Hart with certainty, but since I have seen him, I am almost positive he was one of them—I would not swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I was with him on the night of the 14th—he went into a public house in Whitechapel—I remained outside—I saw him come out—he said that his pocket had been attempted to be picked, and he came out without any refreshment—we were coming away at quickly as possible; he buttoned his coat up, and we were surrounded, and his pocket was attempted to be picked—the prisoners are four of the men,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100040"></xptr>
               <p>and there was one more—Thompson took my husband by the throat, I believe with both hands, but it was done so very quickly that I could not positively say—Kay came behind him, and hit him a blow—I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand—it was a violent blow; my husband almost staggered—I screamed out—they attempted to pick my pocket, and it was torn almost from my dress; that was done by White and Hart and another—they did not get anything—I called for the police, and the police<lb></lb>man was up so quickly, they all ran away—my husband was quite sober; he was quite exhausted—I saw Hart quite perfectly and plainly; he was trying to pick my pocket—it was turned right out of my dress—they tried to pick my husband's pocket, and he was surrounded—I saw their bands towards his pocket; I cannot say in his pocket—they were feeling all round his pockets, but he had not got anything in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> When your husband came out of the public nouse, did he offer to fight any men that were out there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear anything of the sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Are you certain that I put my hand in your husband's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not certain; you attempted; I did not say you did it—Hart is the one that turned my pocket out, but I had nothing in it—the police came up so quickly, they all ran away directly—my husband was almost insensible; I would not have called out for assistance if they would have let him alone—Idid not say at the station that I was so frightened that I knew nothing of what occurred—I did not notice any more persons about but you four and another—they were surrounding my husband and me at the same time—I know your face well; I had never seen you before—there were two gas<lb></lb>lights there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hart.</hi> You said at first you did not know me, and after the constable had been talking to you a little while, you said you did. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I knew you directly I saw you the next morning—I have not the least doubt about you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you see him first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Outside the Court, in Worship Street—I do not know whether that was the day after the occur<lb></lb>rence, or a week after; it was the next time I had to go and appear against them—I was only at the Court once—the constable did not point kirn out to me; I saw him myself opposite, and knew him directly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 129). On Wednesday morning, the 14th, I heard the cry of police in Whitechapel—I went to the spot, and saw the prosecutor there—I saw the prisoners running away from the spot where he was—he could scarcely speak; water was running out of his eyes very fast—assoon as he got over it a little, he said something to me—he was so exhausted, that, before going after the prisoners, I took him up to Whitechapel Church, and stopped with him until he got a bit round, and then we went to Spectacle Alley—I had known all the prisoners before, well—I apprehended Thompson and White about half an hour afterwards, in Spectacle Alley—Whitewas without his hat; the prosecutor said that was two of them—I took hold of Thompson, and said, "I must take you into custody for assaulting and attempting to rob this man"—White immediately ran away—the prosecutor cried out, "Stop thief," and pursued him; he was stopped by another constable—Kay was taken about an hour afterwards, in Keate Street—I said to him, "I want you;" he said "What for?" I said, "For being con<lb></lb>cerned, with two others, in assaulting and attempting to rob a man;" he said, "Oh, Mr. Dunaway, don't take me, don't take me I am innocent;" I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185805100041"></xptr>
               <p>"I must take you;" I then handed him over to two other constables, and then went and searched for another one—when I got to the station Kay said, "What am I charged with?" I said, "You are charged with being con<lb></lb>cerned, with Thompson and White; do you know them?" he said, "Yes, I do, and I told them to have nothing to do with the man, but they would"—Hartwas taken on the Wednesday morning week, the day they were remanded to, he was at the Court—I had been looking out for him during the the week, and also for another one, a man of the name of King—I did not take Hart into custody until I went and spoke to the prosecutor and his wife—Itook him eventually, in consequence of what the prosecutor said to me—Hartis one of those that I had seen running away that night—he asked at the station what he was charged with—I said, "You know; with being concerned, with others;" he said, "I was standing there; I saw them at it; I am innocent of it, but I was not such a <hi rend="italic">flat,"</hi> or "such a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, to stand there to be collared."</p>
               <p>

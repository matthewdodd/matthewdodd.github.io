I am the wife of Henry Wickes, and live at 4, George Street, Hackney—on the 9th October I was walking with a friend, Mrs. Jacobs, in Osborn Street, Whitechapel—Tukey came up and pushed her on one side—he then punched me in the chest and snatched my chain, it broke, and he took only a part of it—Fitzgerald was standing by at the time—they both ran away together—it was a gold chain, and worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the station, and shortly after I saw them both in custody—I am sure they are the men—they were put with other men and I picked them out—Tukey had no jacket on—I saw his face and can swear to him.</p>

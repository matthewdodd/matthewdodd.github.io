On the 26th of June, about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I had just left my counting-house, and missed my handkerchief in <placeName id="t18320705-19-crimeloc91">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe many persons about the street? A. There were many about their business; the handkerchief was found in an area - I was quite satisfied it was mine, but if mixed with others of the same pattern I should not be able to identify it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear it was the same handkerchief? A. No; I saw nobody in the court till after the robbery - I am confident I am not mistaken in the prisoner's person; fifty or sixty people came up before he was taken away.</p>

I saw the prisoner cross the street, and run up Fen-court; I pursued, and saw him drop the handkerchief down the grating; I saw a woman in the house put her hand through the window, and take it up - it was shown to the prosecutor, who claimed it; the prisoner at first said it was not him, but afterwards begged Mr. Lecesne to forgive him.</p>

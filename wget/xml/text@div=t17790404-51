Once, when I had put in a number of halfpence that covered three silver-spoons, the next morning I found them very bare, which raised my suspicion that I was robbed, and that the robber was in my house. I went to a friend, an optical-instrument maker, and got him to mark twenty-four pennyworth of halfpence with a mark on the head of the Britannia; those halfpence I put into the till, among a great many more. The next morning I missed seventeen pence. I suspected that my boy, the prisoner, was the person who stole them; but, to be certain of it, I sent for

            , and told him my suspicions. We agreed that the boy should be sent to his house that morning with a quartern of gin, and Tanner was to give the boy sixpence to change, in order to discover whether the boy had any of the marked halfpence in his possession. He took the gin, and gave Tanner seven halfpence in change, among which was one of the marked ones. I then sent for a constable, and charged him with robbing me. He said, I rob you! what do you mean! Do you want to take away my character? We asked him for the key of his box; he pulled out another key by mistake, which he endeavoured to conceal. The constable took it from him, tried it, and found it would open my till as well as my key. We went and searched his box, and found a guinea in gold, five pounds nineteen shillings in silver, two shillings worth of halfpence, and a medal which I kept in my till.</p>

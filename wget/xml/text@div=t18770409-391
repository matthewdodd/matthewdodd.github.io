                  </hi>. I am a printer at 12, Elder Street, Edinburgh—in August, 1876, I received a letter signed Hawkins—I have lost the letter—I have searched for it and cannot find it—I replied to the letter—that is also lost—the letter I received inclosed an order, and in consequence of its receipt I prepared a number of a newspaper, called "Sport"—on the llth of August I received the letter of the 10th—on the 11th I also received a tele gram—on Monday, the 14th, a Mr. Hawkins called on me; he is one of the prisoners, Frederick Kurr—he asked me if I had received the telegram from Mr. Hawkins—I said "Yes"—from that I concluded he was Hawkins—he then asked me how the newspaper was getting on—I told him we were pushing on with it—he told me to hurry on with it—I said I would—he then asked me about a cheque plate—I had 1,000 cheques to print from this plate—I told him in substance the plate was in the lithographer's hands—I saw Hawkins every day afterwards for a number of days till about the 19th—I prepared the cheque plate—I do not think I showed it to him—I sent it to London—I printed 1,000 cheques, and sent them to 324, Essex Road, Islington, London—I did not print the cheques before Hawkins left—I did print a number of the newspaper before he left—I showed him the newspaper—he took away a proof, and brought it back another day—I printed 500 copies, and he took them away—I told him I required the publisher's name—he gave the name that is on it, "Ralph Henderson, "and the address "Newcastle Street, St. Clement's, London"—the matter from which we printed was sent from London, some in print, and some in manu<lb></lb>script—the leading article, which is the first article, was in manuscript—the cheques were stamped by the Inland Revenue Department before being sent to London—Hawkins told me to get them stamped—the two copies produced are two of the cheques—the other papers are proofs of the cheques—they were given to the lithographer as a voucher for printing—the plate produced is the plate from which the cheques were printed—I gave up the possession of it—I asked first of all for a deposit, and I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which was sent in two letters, half in each, one of the letters containing copy for the newspaper—my bill came to 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a second payment for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these payments came by post—they overpaid my account—they are all the payments I received—on August 20th I received a telegram—I then sent off 250 more copies of the paper to the same address as before—I also prepared a coloured die for an envelope and a head plate and die for the paper—the die was lettered "Royal Bank of London" originally, and the head-plate was "Agar Chambers, Charing Cross, London"—the plate was altered to "The Royal British Bank—all my instructions came from London—I printed 500 headings and stamped</p>

               <p>500 envelopes, and sent them to Essex Road—I did not print any after the alteration—the envelope die contained the letters "R. B. L."—they were sent in one parcel—I saw Hawkins or Kurr again on Friday, 3rd November, when be came to my office in Edinburgh, and brought copy for another news<lb></lb>paper, the "Racing News"—he also came on November 6th and told me to get on with the copy—a gentleman called Harry Street was with him, who I was a clerk to betting agents—he then left a die and ordered some cards to be engraved with the monogram "C. H."—I did not print it, because the police-called upon me on the 9th November—I had never known Kurr befora—I bad known Murray in Edinburgh four years ago as Williams—I also knew' William Kurr as Anderson four years ago at No. 3, Elder Street, Edinburgh.—they were betting agents, and in partnership as Gardiner and Co.—I then printed for them—I received these five telegrams, dated August 9th, llth, 17th, 20th, and 22nd, from Hawkins—before Frederick Kurr called on me I re<lb></lb>ceived two letters from Hawkins, which I have searched for and lost—I had a conversation with Frederick Kurr about the contents of the letters con<lb></lb>taining the order—when he first called he asked me if I had received a telegram about his coming—that was a telegram stating that on Saturday or Monday Mr. Hawkins would be with me; he did not say anything about' tie letters—I afterwards saw him on 3rd November—he did not then refer to those letters—he spoke about what they contained, about a French prospectus—there were 1,000 copies of it printed; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is one that I printed—he never got them—I have not got the copy from which I printed them, I got it from Hawkins—also this letter for a card-plate—he wrote it in the office on one of my envelopes—it is "Henry Cuthbert, 4, Oxford Street, &amp;c, Ecosse."</p>

It is about four or five years ago that I knew William Kurr, in Edinburgh—it is about a twelvemonth ago that he was carrying on the business of a betting agent as Gardiner and Co. I did not know Mr. Gardiner—there are not other betting agents in Edinburgh now; there were before the Act came into operation that did away with betting in Scotland—it is supposed that betting agents are now altogether abolished in Scotland—before the Act there were numbers of betting agents in Edinburgh—I don't know whether they were Englishmen or not, they came from England.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 324,. Essex Street, Islington, and keep a tobacconist's shop—I think I know Frederick Kurr, I only saw him on one occasion—there was permission asked if a letter might be left there—I was not present at the time, the permission was asked of my sister—he came in the evening—I had not the slightest knowledge of who or what he was—I believe him to be the man—he asked for something, a cigar or tobacco, or something of that description—and then asked for a letter that was on the shelf for him in the name of Hawkins—he asked if I would give him that letter, he could see it on the shelf; it was addressed to Mr. Hawkins—I asked him what name—he said Hawkins—I did not ask him his name—I asked him what name the letter was sent in and he said Hawkins, and I passed the letter to him and he went away—I believe I re<lb></lb>ceived other letters in the same name, I think this was the first—I know that other letters were left there in the name of Hawkins—I think it must have been near about the middle of August—I think I went away about 20th of August—it was some day in August that the man came—I can't say more than that I took no notice of the matter—besides the letters there were several telegrams came to the same name they were to be left till called for; they were called for.</p>

M. Young, 22, Medina Square, Glasgow"—he brought a little luggage with him; Captain Gifford used to dine with him—the others came in and out very frequently—I could not say how frequently, they were there very much in the morning and afternoon part—I don't know what they were doing; I did not see them doing any<lb></lb>thing, they went upstairs in the drawing-room—Mr. Young did not go out very much, he went out on one or two Sundays, and several times besides.</p>

The newspaper called "The Sport" purported to be the</hi> 1,711<hi rend="italic">th number, and contained a leading article in commendation of the skill and knowledge of Montgomery in all racing matters; and the letter con<lb></lb>tained a glowing account of the profits to be realized in the transactions in which the writer was engaged</hi>.) I received the circular at the same time, and inside was a translation into French of the article in the English newspaper—I read the circular and the letter—on 2nd August I wrote a letter to A.

Montgomery" were written by the Montgomery mentioned in that paper, and that he resided in King Street, Piccadilly, and that what the newspaper said about him was true; and that the telegram purporting to come from him, in reality did so—I believed that the cheques George Simpson were genuine; that Thomas Ellerton lived at 4, King Street, St. James's, and was a sworn book-maker; that all the documents were genuine and came from the persons whose names were affixed to them; and that the statements made in them were correct; it was in consequence of that that I sent my drafts—I obtained this draft (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Credit Lyon<lb></lb>aise from my bankers, Messrs. Vallet, at Vitry le Franchise—in one of the later letters I was asked for a further sum of 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I went to my bankers, at Vitry, to obtain it—they had not got that sum in their posses<lb></lb>sion, and at that time I commenced to see by the signatures that the whole thing was fictitious, and it was in consequence of what passed between me and them that I consulted my notary, M. Chavance, at Vitry, and my bankers sent the documents to the office of the Credit Lyonaise, in London, and they were placed in the hands of Mr. Abrahams, the solicitor, about 23rd September.</p>

Coster"—he said that he was staying at McCrae's Hotel but intended to go to some lodgings which he had taken—the cheque clerk wrote this address—I took Benson to the teller and he got this pass-book to take to the telling table that the money he paid might be entered in it—he put his initials "M. C." on the notes at my suggestion and deposited 1,735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the notes were sent to our head office in Manchester—on 30th September he presented this cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I expressed my astonishment at his sending in a cheque for so large an amount so soon after opening the account, as it is unusual for a stranger to open an account and the very next morning to take away the major part of it so early in the morning, and I said that I had omitted to have a reference from his firm in London—he then wrote "M. Costa and Co., Austin Friars, London," and said that his bankers were Rothschilds—he said that the cheque was for a parcel of diamonds which were offered to him and he required the money to pay for them—I asked him to come again at 12 o'clock that we might have a communication with Manchester, as it was Saturday—I also communicated with the head office, Glasgow—on 3rd October he sent his servant, Frederick Kurr, with this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was doled Glasgow, October 3rd, and signed W.

Elliott"—I asked him to do so—he signed the signature-book, and I gave him two books of thirty cheques each, payable to bearer, and told him I would place the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his credit and send the cheque to London for collection—I filled up this paying in slip, which he signed—he called again next day and said that he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had some small payments to make—I had not received any advice about the large cheque, and I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, for which he wrote this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called again next day, October 4th, and I told him we had got an acknowledgment of our letter by post-card, but that it would be another day or two before we heard—he said that he would call again, but did not, and the balance is still in our hands—this "I per cent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." is the interest we allow on private accounts.</p>

I keep the Queen's Hotel, at the Bridge of Allan—on 3rd November last, about 8 o'clock a.m., Benson and William Kurr came there, Benson came first with a servant who was called Penchant or some name like that, Benson gave the name of Young, he brought some luggage with him—he had a private parlour and two bedrooms., he com<lb></lb>plained of missing a large deal box which had been left at King's Cross, marked P P—on 4th November, I went to the station with the servant and sent a telegram to the stationmaster at Edinburgh about the box—on that afternoon William Kurr came, a bedroom had been taken for him by Benson—he used the same sitting room as Benson, they dined together—Kurr went by the name of Captain Gifford, I know Mr. Monteith, the manager of the Alloa branch of the Clydesdale Bank—Benson wished to know if I knew where he lived; I said I would find out, I did not know—I did find out and Benson gave me a card to send to Mr. Monteith—at that time or shortly afterwards I was introduced to a gentleman named Meikle<lb></lb>john; Benson gave me this card on which is written "Mr. John Meiklejohn, inspector of detective police, Great Scotland Yard, S.W. Mr. Monteith will be kind enough to come to the Queen's Hotel as soon as possible"—I did not know before who Meiklejohn was, no doubt he was there, but I did not know him, he introduced these persons to the manager of the bank—by Benson's desire I telegraphed to the Stirling Arms, at Dumblane, to have dinner—ready prepared at 2 o'clock on Sunday for five persons—two men came and visited Benson in the morning, they were supposed to be Goller and Wilson from Glasgow—on Thursday, 9th of November, Benson ordered a carriage to go to Alloa, that is 7 miles from the Bridge of Allan—he went in the carriage, I think two persons went with him, but I could not be quite sure,</p>

               <p>Captain Gifford was with him, I believe in the carriage, but I won't be certain—they both came back in the afternoon—while they were at my hotel a good many telegrams came for them—on the 10th, about 6.30 p.m., Mr. Monteith came and dined with them—about 8 o'clock, a telegram came which was handed to William Kurr; he went upstairs with it; he showed it to a youngman in the front hall of the hotel, I don't know who he was, he did not dine in the parlour with them, he dined in the coffee-room—Kurr, walked upstairs to the sitting-room, that he had occupied with Benson, where the dinner was—up to that time I had no notion that they were going to leave—previous to that, Pierre the servant said they were going to stay a good deal longer—they got ready to go, Gifford and the youngman went south by the 9.9 train at night, and Benson went at 10.40 north to Inverness, with his servant—before he left he paid his bill with a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Clydesdale note—he paid the bill for the whole, the young man, the servant, and all—the young man came that evening, he might have been there before, but that was take time I saw him—Benson told me to keep his rooms till Monday—the box that was telegraphed for came before they left—Benson told me if any letters or telegrams came to keep them till Monday, till they came to occupy the rooms again—someone came for the letters on Saturday afternoon; I could not be certain who it was; Bale is a little like him, but I could not be certain—I have no belief on the subject—he looked much stouter than this man does now—letters and telegrams did come for them after they left, I gave them to Inspector Druscovitch, I refused to give them to the man.</p>

I remember a man named Young coming to our hotel on the 3rd of November. Ben<lb></lb>son is the man whom I knew as Mr. Young. His servant came with him. The photograph produced is that of his servant. He said he expected some friends, and would require one or two more rooms—he did not men<lb></lb>tion their names. On the following day a gentleman came by the 3 o'clock train from the south; he was called by Young, Mr., and by the servant, Captain, Gifford. He occupied the same sitting-room as Young until the evening of the 10th, when all three left. I saw them mostly every day. I have no doubt about Benson being Young. Kurr is very like Gifford, but I did not see him so often. I have very little doubt as to his identity; I don't think I have any doubt. I never saw Meiklejohn to my know<lb></lb>ledge; I did not know him. I remember their going out on the Sunday.

I am accountant in the Clydesdale Bank, Alloa branch—on Nth November the prisoner Murray presented this cheque for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this cherub to William Gifford for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I cannot pay them," and I think I said I had received a telegram telling me not to pay them—he went away, taking the chouse with him—I sent a clerk to bring him back, and he came back with the clerk and presented the chouse again—I then took down the numbers and dates, and to whom payable—while I was doing so he endeavoured to take them from under my hand, saying that he did not want the money—I gave them back to him and he left, after which I had a communication with the superintendent of police, Mc. Donald, who brought Murray back to the bank—I told the superin<lb></lb>tendent that I had heard from Glasgow—they remained for a short time in the office, and came back again and made further inquiries—I showed him the telegram I had received—we asked Murray his name; he said Henry Munro, 9, Amos Terrace, Victoria Road, Leytonstone, Essex—I asked him who Mr. Carsons was, to whom the cheques were made payable; he said a Liverpool merchant, a friend of his who had asked him to come to Alloa for the money—I asked him why Mr. Carsons did not get the money in Liver<lb></lb>pool himself—he said that Mr. Carsons considered it better that he should send direct for it—I allowed him to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendant of police at Alloa—on 14th November, I took Murray into custody as he was going to the Commercial Hotel—he wore a beard at the time—I said that I wanted to speak to him as I understood he had presented a cheque on the Clydesdale Bank, and I must detain him—he asked who I was—I told him I was a superintendent of police—he said that it was all right—I asked him for the cheques, he produced them, and I asked for them into my hands—he asked if it was necessary, I said "Yes" and I got them and said that I should keep them—he said "Is there anything wrong?" and asked me who Gifford and Yonge the drawers of the cheques were as they were unknown to him, and said that he got the cheques from Mr. Carsons a friend of his in Liverpool—I asked him who Carsons was; he said a speculator in bonds who asked him to go to Scotland for the money and he would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—I asked his name—he said Henry Munro, 9, Amos Terrace, Victoria Road, Leytonstone—I took him to the bank and had a conversation with Mr. Murray—I have heard what Murey has said to-day, he is accurate—Murray wanted me in the bank to cross the cheques, I handed them to him—he crossed them and re<lb></lb>turned them to me—he went to his hotel and I saw him leave for Stirling—at 1.40 p.m.—I let him go because a telegram came from the bank at Glasgow not to detain him on their account—I kept the cheques.</p>

He said that he received the notes from Walters and another man, but I will not swear who the other man was—I had seen Murray above twice before in my life—I gathered from him that the notes were improperly obtained—the two interviews I had with him were very short, and he suggested this to me, almost a perfect stranger—I had never had such a thing suggested to me before, but I was not intensely surprised—I am not in any business since I lost my sight—I was an accountant up to June last when I gave up my chambers, as I was ill—I was in the same chambers in Marlborough Street as Chidley and Morris, the attornies, and did business for them; I acted as an attorney's clerk—they used one of the rooms and I used the other two—I bought the business of Mr. Chidley; I bought the chambers and furniture; I did not buy Chidley with the chairs and tables, but he had the right to use them, he did not pay rent for them—Morris used them too, he paid a very small sum for them—I was not Chidley and Morris; Morris was another solicitor—I do not call my<lb></lb>self a solicitor's clerk—Chidley gave up the chambers to me, but he continued to use them only for a very short time—I let part of them to Morris, he is not there still; they are all cleared out now—Chidley and Morris did not act as my solicitors, they did their own business, but I did not have any of it—I gave them the place for nothing, because I had the use of their clerk when I wanted him—there were two clerks, one was named Dear, I forget the other; they conducted no law business for me, but I will not swear that they did not do some business which I introduced to the firm, but I never had any money for it, it was a job for anybody to get any money out of them—I know Mr. Pulley, another attorney; I have not been clerk to him; I had something to do with conducting a Chancery suit for him with Madame Louise and a man named Britten, but I had very little to do with it and did not have a shilling out of it—I do not know where Chidley is—Morris is to be found at his chambers, where he has been for twenty years unin<lb></lb>terruptedly for what I know; I never heard that he retired temporarily—I</p>

The moment I lost sight of Murray I went to Scotland Yard and gave information—it was a little before June, 1875, that a man named Woods, who was at the Mansion House, called upon me to get bail; I did not know his name till the police called on me—I procured him bail and he ought to have surrendered on June 7th, but did not—the only interview I had with him was for two minutes at the Mansion House when he was released—there was a criminal charge against Murray; I was asked to get him bail, I did so and he did not surrender—I did not know him when he came to me, but he reminded me who he was—I knew him as Murray in 1875, but when he called on me in November he said that he had been going by the name of Wells—I was not one of his bail; I was promised 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. For getting bail, which was not paid—I did not know till I went to the police that a reward had been offered, Inspector Clark first told me of it.</p>

Ellerton," on this draft for 25,000 francs on the Credit Lyonnais is Bale's, and the other endorsement, Jacob Francis, is Frederick Kurr's—the endorsement, Thomas Ellerton, on the draft of Madame de Goncourt's (A.1) is Frederick Kurr's—the endorse<lb></lb>ment, "Jacob Francis," to this draft for 3,000 francs on the Society de Depot et Grand Couronne (A 3), is in Frederick Kurr's writing—this letter (F 1) from Montgomery to Madame de Goncourt is in Benson's writing—I do not speak to these letters from Ellerton of 19th and 20th September (G 1 and M 1), they are in a disguised hand—this letter and envelope from Francis of 19th September (H 1) is Frederick Kurr's, so is this memorandum from Francis, of 22nd September (R 1)—the memorandum from Jackson to Madame de Goncourt, of 22nd September (S 1) is, to the best of my belief, William Kurr's—this letter of 22nd September, from Montgomery (T 1), is undoubtedly Benson's writing, and the envelope also—this Royal Bank of London cheque for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Charles Jackson, or order; (<hi rend="italic">the sub<lb></lb>ject of the indictment</hi>), is Bale's writing, and the signature also; and so is this other cheque for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of the same date, payable to Jacob Francis—the letter from Ellerton, of 23rd September (A 1), is in the same writing as the others which are in a disguised hand—this envelope marked B 3, number 2 is Benson's writing—this telegram from Ellerton to Monsieur de Goncourt "Francis has remitted to your account 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling," &amp;c. (T), is in Bale's writing, except some words written in French; I believe he does not under<lb></lb>stand French—these telegrams V 1 and X, from Montgomery to Goncourt, are Frederick Kurr's writing to the best of my belief—W 1, a telegram from Ellerton to Goncourt, containing the words "St. James's" at the bottom, is Benson's writing in a made up hand—the first letter of S. Hawkins to Brydone, from 324, Essex Road, is I am sure in Frederick Kurr's writing—, number 6, Brooks and Co. to Brydone, is to the best of ray belief Bale's. writing—all the writing in this proof sheet of the "Racing News "(8) is Benson's—this letter from S. Benson to Bridone is to the best of my belief William Kurr's, but I cannot give a positive opinion, as he varies his hand very much in his admitted letters; it is difficult to identify one with another, and therefore I cannot give an absolute opinion—number 10, from S. Brooks</p>

               <p>and Co., is precisely the same, by whomsoever written—this paper contain<lb></lb>ing the words in pencil "Henry Cuthbert, 4, Oxford Street, Edinburgh" (12), is Frederick Kurr's—the signature "Arthur Chapman, for Brooks and Co." to this agreement with Flintoff, is Frederick Kurr's I believe—I can<lb></lb>not identify letters 15 and 16 as Benson's, but they possess several points of similarity to his writing; they are not disguised, and there is a strong family likeness between them and Benson's writing—I find in my experience a similarly of writing in families, and after the time I have expended in examining the letters to identify them if possible with Benson's writing, I have strained my energies to do it and cannot do it; I cannot say that they are his—this letter from Jacob Francis "Please give bearer an open cheque," &amp;c. is Frederick Kurr's writing, and so are these letters of "11th and 15th September, 1876, and this cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the London and County Bank, signed Jacob Francis (28 and 29), and this letter of Jacob Francis of 23rd September—number 44 is a paying-in slip of the Bank of Scotland, which is in Bale's writing—this paying-in slip of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th September, to the London and County Bank, is Frederick Kurr's writing, and so is the en<lb></lb>dorsement "W.

(59)—this cheque of 14th November on the Clydesdale Bank, which the clerk would not cash, is in William Kurr's writing—these two envelopes (66 and 67) ad<lb></lb>dressed to Morton at Rotterdam are both in the same hand, somewhat dis<lb></lb>guised; I think they are William Kurr's writing, and the same observation applies to number 70—number 80 is a cheque of the Clydesdale Bank, W. Gifford to W. Kurr, that is William Kurr's writing—those orders written by Chaplin (84, 85, and 86) are I believe William Kurr's, and 89 too, but I have to look at some of them a considerable time before being certain—they are the same as 88, but on the face of them there is an apparent difference, no one could recognise them, except as experienced a person as myself—I can trace similarity between certain formations of the letters—letters 91 and 92 are Benson's—I have this morning examined one of the letters found on Benson in Newgate, and it is Benson's writing—I do not speak to three of these five telegrams from Hawkins to Brydone; two of them are in French and are F. Kurr's—number" 105 is a telegram from Gifford to Wilson; I believe that to be William Kurr's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. Nearly all my evidence is embodied in my report—I have not seen the documents since March 2nd, I had them in my hands two or three days at three different times—I did not strain my mind to come to the conclusion that some of them were Benson's, I said that I could not do it in fairness; I do my utmost to come to a correct conclu<lb></lb>sion—I daresay I was half a day sometimes in coming to a conclusion upon it and then found that I was not examined upon some of these documents—I was told before I got them that some were said to be Benson's, not all—I accidentally heard Mr. James give evidence on one document only, but I had formed my opinion before and I was rather annoyed at Mr. Abrahams giving it to me to determine, when it had been determined by somebody else, I had expended a great deal of trouble upon it; that was the corrections to the proof sheet of the "Racing News"—one or two of the papers I had net seen till I was in the witness-box—some of Benson's writing is very studiously disguised—the first of these yellow tele<lb></lb>grams is slightly disguised; the last is also disguised, but less than these other two; there are various grades of disguise—you will see the word</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT PARRY</hi>. I have given my opinion in a great many instances in Courts of Justice—I do not believe that I am infallible—I daresay I have found out that I have made mistakes on two or three occa<lb></lb>sions—you want to know whether I sometimes alter my mind—I am some<lb></lb>times wrong if I am asked to come to a hasty conclusion or before I have studied the whole matter; I afterwards come to a different conclusion and it is generally the right one—there was the case of Miss Faithful when the jury and the Judge both thought that I was wrong—I was engaged in one most important case where the jury on the first trial gave a verdict contrary to my opinion and two other juries afterwards approved my opinion; you ask me whether I was not wrong because a jury said so, but six judges gave an opinion one way in the Franconia matter and seven the other; that was a matter of law, but mine is a matter of opinion—I believe I have in one or two instances after forming a particular opinion found afterwards that I was in error; not that it has been proved, but I have weighed it in my mind and I have said "Well, I think I must be wrong"—I am quite certain that the two letters from Northumberland Street! and the letter signed William Harrison, in 1874, were written by William Kurr—it is necessary for me to have a genuine known writing to form an opinion from and that is the reason I have found myself wrong-sometimes in the witness-box, because the standard of comparison is mis<lb></lb>leading—from the examinations I have made I have conscientiously formed the impressions I have told you—in some instances the opinions of banker's clerks and persons who know the writing would be better than mine, but in very many instances I should not surrender my judgment to anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I have not heard Mr. Cherry examined—this paying-in slip signed Ellerton is in Bale's writing; I do not see any palpable disguise—this signature "Roberts, for J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. These are instances where several papers are put before me, and I have to state my opinion, not being told whether I am for the defence or the prosecution, and I form my judgment quite inde<lb></lb>pendently—certain documents were placed in my hands as being in F. Kurr's writing, there were signatures, there was an entire letter number 75, and the little pocket-book number 83—my opinion has been formed under the belief that those were Collings' writing—I did not suggest that the book should be obtained, it came quite unawares—it was shown to me at the police-court; I did not have it in the first instance—I used it to confirm my opinion, but I did not make much use of it as I was quite satisfied with What I had got, and it has nothing to do with my evidence to-day; I have relied upon the letter and the memorandum-book and other documents mentioned here—I quite relied upon letter 75, being Collings' writing, and I believed that it had been proved to be so when I stepped into the box yesterday; it was intimated that the letter would not be proved, and I said "Then I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090106"></xptr>
               <p>shall have some difficulty in proving Collings' writing"—I firmly believe that it is Colling's writing—that very document was partly the foundation of my belief, but there are cheques proved to be in his writing as well, and there is the little pocket-book, no use has been made of it, but I do not exclude it, I have compared the writing in it with the letters, and they appear to be the same; I put it aside finding I had got quite sufficient without it—the capital H in the book you will find is the same as the "H" in H. Cuthbert, in number 12—the "H "in Harris, at the bottom of this page is not Collins' writing—my attention has not been called to it before I should exclude it at once—I noticed it when I had the book—this is all F. Kerr's writing down to the words "One bottle short allowed"—bankers become very familiar with signatures by large practice; I do not think they are much more qualified to speak to signatures than myself, for this reason, that I often know them to be wrong, and they do not go by the signature book, and they very often pay forged cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I have been engaged in the study of handwriting between twenty and twenty-five years, and have been very often-examined in courts of justice, besides which many cases come before me which never come into Court; I do not think I come into Court once in nine times—I tell the parties whether they are right or wrong, and I am as often against them as for them—apart from the desire which I make to be right, every mistake I make is an injury to my reputation.</p>

Although most people write differently, there are still some characters which are uniform and there is something in the writing which you cannot get rid of and which comes out in various degrees if a person writes with his right hand, even if in trying to disguise his writing he actually prints it; I had an instance where in fifty letters I could not identify one, but there was a peculiarity in under scoring by which I iden<lb></lb>tified the writing—I sift documents through mentally to find what minute points are likely to escape the writer's attention—in writing at a certain pace it is impossible to avoid doing certain things—some persons dot their "is" before and some behind, some make an up stroke and some a down stroke, some cross a "t" from the line, or across it, or upwards or down<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">called attention to the evidence affecting Murray, which he submitted was not sufficient to constitute him an accessory after the fact</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in replying to the objections, contended that as to the reality of the name of the person drawing the cheque, or the existence or non-existence of the bank, these were questions of fact for the Jury.

The intent contemplated by the law was to make a false instrument pass as true. The question as to the uttering was raised on the Extradition Treaty.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">entertained no doubt whatever that the instrument in question purported to be an order for the payment of money; the old definition of forgery was "The false making of a written instrument for the purpose of fraud and deceit," and the offence was complete as soon as the docu<lb></lb>ment was made, whether anything was obtained upon it or not. With regard to like uttering, there was some difficulty; it was obvious here that the utter<lb></lb>ing was not intended to be in this country, and if upon consideration it became necessary he would reserve that question, but the argument might be met in this way, that as the intent was to have the instrument returned to this country, that might constitute an uttering here. As to the Extradition Treaty, he should feel justified in acting upon the bill found by the Grand Jury, and leave the question of uttering to the Jury.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 38, Walbrook—I knew William Kurr's father some seven or eight years ago, and did business for him on several occasions—I transacted professional business for William Kurr on two occasions with reference to giving up the house in Marquis Road, that was three or four years ago, because he thought it was danger<lb></lb>ous to health to live in it, and I endeavoured to put an end to the agree<lb></lb>ment for him—I recollect receiving a letter from William Kurr about 13th August last year, I gave it to Mr. Humphrey's clerk; this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "29, Marquis Road, Canonbury, 13, August, 1876, to S. Price, Esq., Liver<lb></lb>pool Road. Dear Sir,—Will you kindly let me know by bearer at what time to-morrow morning you can oblige me by calling here; the matter I wish to see you about is some business I wish to introduce to you It is "important I should see you before going into the City. Wm. Kurr." I live at Barnsbury, two stations beyond Canonbury, on the North. London line—in consequence of that letter I called at the private house a day or two afterwards; I there saw William Kurr—I then went in his company to 55, Beresford Road, and was there introduced to a Mr. Yonge, that is Benson—I had a conversation with him in William Kurr's presence, it was about a bankruptcy petition—I was then engaged professionally for Yonge; I attended at the Court on three or four occasions, and acted in the matter—my first instructions were to avoid an adjudication, there had not been any adjudication then; from that time and "during September I had constant interviews with Kurr with reference to Yonge's bankruptcy petition—you may take it from 15th August till the end of October—I had interviews with Kurr to about the middle of October, occasionally with Benson, more frequently Kurr—the interviews I had with reference to Youge's petition were almost invariably on Yonge's behalf; I insisted on it, in fact, because it took the shape of negotiation for payment of the petitioning creditors debt, and a friend was to find the money for the purpose, and I said on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090110"></xptr>
               <p>more than one occasion Benson should not send me instructions personally, I would rather take them through Kurr, who I knew—I knew nothing of Benson before that day—I took my instructions from William Kurr as I understood it was through him that the money was to be found—I think I had from twenty to thirty interviews with Kurr, some of them were at his private house, he called at my house on some few occasions, and I think at my office three or four times, 38, Walbrook—when I called at his house in Marquis Road, it was generally in the morning, on my way to the city, from 9 o'clock to 9.30—the negotiations were unsuccessful and Benson was adjudicated I think on 23rd September—on the day before I received in<lb></lb>structions from Benson to offer 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the receiver who had been appointed by the Court of Bankruptcy, in addition to the assets they discovered and had in hand, in order to satisfy his creditors, so that he should not be ad<lb></lb>judicated—on the morning of the 23rd I called at Marquis Road, and saw both Kurr and Benson there; Benson, I think it was on that occasion who particularly instructed me to offer 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to the assets, for the purpose I have told you—I said "I think it would strengthen my hands if you were to give me the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that I should not make an empty offer—I asked for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson said to William Kurr "Will you get it for him," or "for me," I don't know which—William Kurr accordingly left the room and brought in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—I ultimately returned them—I made the offer, but it was unsucessful—on my way back that afternoon I called to report what I had done, or rather what I had not done, and I returned to them the same notes—to the best of my belief I put them on the table and Benson took them up and counted them—I can't remember what notes they were; I should think they were old notes, notes that had been in use, not new notes—I should think altogether there were ten or twelve of them—I don't remember what Benson did with them, he seemed to take possession of them—after that there were still further attempts to negotiate with the creditors—I think I saw Benson up to about the middle of October, not daily, I only saw him at intervals—I have a call-book—I have been through my letter's out as far as I could, to ascertain this date, my call-book will not show much about it—I saw William Kurr from time to time in reference to these further negociation—he did not hand me a draft for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Smith, Payne, and Smith—it was sent to me by Kurr—I was out of town at the time—it was to take the proceedings off the file—I received a letter of credit for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Yonge or order—it came by post from Brighton—I returned it to Kurr and Benson—I paid it in to my bankers, at least the proceeds, on 13th October—I subsequently saw Kurr and Benson with reference to it and had a con<lb></lb>versation with them—that was somewhere about 13th October—I think it was at the Stoke Newington Road—it was either there or the Marquis Road; I forget which—I then handed the money back to them—I have my sons letter out acknowledging the receipt of it, in my letter book—I said that I could not take that money as from Yonge, I could only take any money for the purpose of settling with the creditors—I received the draft for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of settling with Yonge's creditors—I did not like the notion of taking money from a bankrupt for the purpose of settling with his creditors, because the bankrupt ought to have given up every thing to his creditors—what I did was to find some disinterested friend to advance it—my instructions were that he would find funds to advance it—I declined to take the draft as coming from the bankrupt because I knew that it ought by rights to belong to his creditors, and that he was only giving them what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090111"></xptr>
               <p>he ought—I said "I will not take this from you, but if I may take it as coming from William Kurr I will do so"—I preferred that it should appear to come from some one else and not from the bankrupt himself—there was also this reason, that I had known William Kurr and his father, and I did not know Benson—the result of the conversation was I think that the money was taken as a payment—T was told I might take it as a payment by William Kurr—ultimately I think I paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and bought up some securities; the debt of the petitioning creditor—I discussed the mode in which it should be done with the petitioning creditor's solicitors, and I took an assignment of the debt, not to myself, to William Kurr originally—Kurr called at my office and asked me what the mode was in which it was to be carried out—I told him—he said was there any liability about this—I said "No practical liability, you buy the man's debt and become the assignee, the only thing I can see about it is that you may be summoned before the Bankruptcy Court to give some account of this transaction"—he said "Well I have had enough bother about him, I shall have no more, he must get somebody else"—there-upon a man named Street was found who became the assignee—I paid the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Street became the assignee—the bankruptcy was not settled then; it is pending still.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The object of getting the assignee was to buy up the bankruptcy—the debt was 1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expect the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ultimately gave Street back the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had left of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson instructed me that Street would become the assignee—and I paid' Street my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the balance I had, and he handed me a cheque for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I assumed that Street was acting as one of the friends of Benson at that time—in fact it was the bankrupt buying up that particular debt—he or his friends were going to buy up the whole of his debts—Street had been sent to me by Benson at the first meeting to make proof of a debt due by him to Street—I don't know who Street was, except that he gave me his name—I can give you his address from the draft assignment—I had previously sent the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Kurr at Brighton—I did not make out any bill of costs—I have been paid by Benson; that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked for costs—I was paid fifty guineas in a lump sum—I paid 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purchase money—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for my costs and I was afterwards paid two guineas for my disbursements by Benson—I really can't say that the money came out of Benson's pocket—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say did—but I really have no knowledge of it—I suppose the fact is that it did; but I have no knowledge about it—I expect that Street and William Kurr were nominees of Benson.</p>

I only saw William Kurr, I think when his father's estate was divided—I heard at that time that he was employed by Deben<lb></lb>ara and Storr—after leaving them he wrote to me to ask me to give him Borne law copying; I think that was about eighteen months ago—I don't know of either of them having any knowledge of betting transactions—at the time the father died Frederick Kurr was not quite of age, and was a clerk in Debenham and Storr's office—I made efforts to get employment for him as a law writer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOWEN</hi>. I never saw Street but twice in my life, he is a dark man, about thirty years of age, as near as I can remember, I saw him at my office, he came to me by appointment, Benson made the appointments—I have not the slightest idea where he is now—he gave me his address, 25, Devonshire Street, Islington; I am looking at the draft assignment of the debt: he gave me that address on the second occasion;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090112"></xptr>
               <p>he gave me an address on the first occasion, I don't remember whether it was the same, I think it was, I am pretty well sure of it—I think the first occasion that I saw him was about the 21st September—Mr. Hamilton, the petitioning creditor, is a merchant in Mincing Lane, the amount of debts was about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Robinson, a clerk from the Court of Bankruptcy, stated that the petitioning creditor's debt was</hi> 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that the debtor had not filed any accounts</hi>.) May I refer to my pass-book for the second occasion that Street came to me; because on that occasion he gave me the cheque for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was the last day of October, or the 29th of October, I cannot give the exact date, the bottom entry in the book, 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I handed to Street, there is no entry of the 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Benson said that Street was indebted to him in a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he came on 21st September, to make a proof, and when I found what it was, I would not take it; it was for money lost on a betting transaction—I received from Street, on the second occasion 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque, on the Holborn Circus Branch of the Union Bank of London, it was a cheque drawn in Street's name, signed by him, and payable to me, or order; that does not appear in my book for this reason, my appointment was for the 4th November, to complete the pay<lb></lb>ment of this cheque, he gave me a post dated cheque of that date in exchange for my cheque of 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had in hand payable to me by Kurr, who declined to become assignee, and Street took that money and found the balance for the assignment—I never saw Street excepting on those occasions, or heard from him or of him; I never knew any<lb></lb>thing of the man before or since—I have not inquired after him since, nor after any of them—I gave Street my cheque for 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I got the 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was careful to get the consent both of Benson and Kurr, together to the giving of this 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over—I said "Am I to understand that Street is a man of respectability, and that I am to hand over this balance," and they said "Yes"—Benson I believe said it, but it was in Kurr's presence; the bankrupt authorised me to pay over 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the assignee who was going to take an assignment of the petitioning creditor's debt; all I wanted was a good discharge for the money—Benson said that the creditors were all personal friends of the bankrupts, except three, and if the debts of those three were purchased he could arrange with all the others himself—no doubt the object was to get those three creditors paid; first I offered to pay the trustee, he declined, and then I was going to buy the other creditors in detail—I do not think I should know Street's handwriting—I saw the cheque, and I have his endorsement to the 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—the first time I saw Benson was at Beresford Road I went there with William Kurr—I don't think I have here any entry of the dates of my interviews with Benson—these are the whole of the entries 1 have in the matter—these are my shorthand clerk's transcripts of entries taken by him—I have none in my own handwriting; these are what I dictated to my clerk from the call-book, and he took it down in shorthand and transcribed it—the first time I received money from William Kurr was in Bank of England notes, which he fetched from another room; they were handed back to Benson—on the second occasion I received a bank bill or a letter of credit—I have never seen that since; I cashed it at Smith, Payne, and Smiths; I should say it was a letter of credit—it was on a sheet of letter paper; I think I cashed it on 13th October—I received Bank of England notes for it—I don't know that Benson knew I was going to cash it, or what was to be done with it—it was received by my son; it was directed to my office and received by me in a letter from Benson—the most</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090113"></xptr>
               <p>ordinary thing would have been for me to pay it in to my own account—I was not asked to get bank-notes for it; I was not asked to do anything with it; I was to keep it for the purpose of purchasing these debts—I "have not got the letter I received from Benson; I returned it perhaps immediately afterwards, because I refused to take the payment as from Benson; I treated it as a withdrawal of the payment by Benson to me—I paid the bank-notes into my own bank immediately—I did not pay Street's cheque in to my bank for the reason I gave before, that he had post dated it—when the purchase was completed I had to send and get the cheque cashed into notes, and I took the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes with me, and paid it there and then as the purchase-money for the debt—I paid the cash into my own bank, the Chancery Lane branch of the Union Bank, and here is my pass-book with the entry of the payment in (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I think I paid it in before I had the interview with Benson and Kurr, at which I said I could not receive it from Benson—I think I kept it about six days,' until I could see them; I received it on 6th October; I can tell by a letter out—I never knew William Kurr by any other name—I have seen him both at Beresford Road and Stoke Newington, but I never went with him but to Beresford Road; he took me there, that was the first interview I had with him—I don't think he had occasion to give any name there—when I went to both places I asked for Yonge—Mr. Hamilton was the petitioning creditor who was to assign the debt to Street—1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the debt, 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had proved for, and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had not proved for, 1,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all was due to him; the whole of that was to be assigned to Street—the security that Hamilton held was two letters of guarantee signed by Benson; it was rather an intricate case, there were two creditors in fact, the letters are here, one was to Hamilton, and one to Matheson, another creditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The debt arose in this way: Hamilton and Matheson had become security for a man named Andrews for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Scotch Insurance Company, and in consideration of their becoming bound Benson was to cover them with these letters of guarantee, and they were to have certain securi<lb></lb>ties deposited with them, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. actual value in Portuguese Government stock—it was Andrews who had deposited the securities—he was to have Hamilton's debts and securities; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese stock was not among those securities—the security Street was to have was simply some shares in the Bartrup Coal Company; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Portuguese Government shares were given to Matheson, who kept those; but with regard to the Bartrup shares, they put them at less value, and those were the shares that were assigned to Street; it was a very complicated thing—as near as I recollect the last time I saw Benson was late one evening, about the middle of October, when he came to my house—the last time I saw William Kurr was about the middle or the 20th November—he came to me after this fraud had become exposed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He came to my house one evening and I had a converses<lb></lb>ation with him, he came to me among other things for advice—I should think I saw him two or three times a week in September, it was always about this bankruptcy and nothing else, I had no other business with either of them than that—where some creditors are bitterly hostile and others not the only thing you can do is to conciliate the hostile creditors; I did not think there was anything wrong in that, or I should not have done it; I should not have lent myself to the transaction if it had been palpably brought before me that that the bankrupt was finding money belonging to his cre<lb></lb>ditors;</p>

               <p>if I had known the status of the parties then as I do now I would have had nothing to do with it—really and truly I thought he had borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Kurr, I have no reason now to doubt that; I have very little doubt now that the money came from Benson.</p>

I am a clerk in the Holborn Circus branch of the Union Bank—William Kurr opened an account there in 1870 and has kept it ever since—I have become acquainted with his writing by his signatures and by acting upon his cheques—I can say to a certainty that 100 of them have passed through my hands—I have seen these documents before—I cannot recognise the writing of these two documents P and S 1, dated 11th and 22nd December; to the best of my belief they are not William Kurr's writing, nor are these two letters his (9 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 10)—the first and second of these (<hi rend="italic">packet</hi> 105) resemble William Kurr's writing, but the others I do not recognise at all, and I believe them not to be his—I do not believe these three envelopes to be his writing—I do not see any resemblance.</p>

I do not know William Kurr, except as receiving his cheques as cashier—I do not know this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I do not believe it to be his writing—I believe 88 to be his, but I do not think 89 is, nor this other—I do not believe these letters, from Kurr to Goad about the house in Marquis Road to be his—I do not think the four are written by the same person who wrote the one—these signatures (<hi rend="italic">to two other documents</hi>) are his, I can see a resemblance—the first and third of these telegrams resemble his writing, but one is in pencil and one not—I do not give an opinion whether this "Wilson, Waverley Hotel, Prince's Street, Edinburgh "was written by the same person who wrote the other—I notice the formation of the "W "in Wilson and in Waverley—as a cashier if this was brought to me as a signature I should refuse to pay it—I think the other is written in the natural writing and not in a sort of back hand, it is upright—the, "H "in "Hotel" in telegram number 1 and in "Harrison" in number 5 are made in the same manner, but one is upright and one not, and in my capacity as cashier I should decline paying it from the signature—I see a difference between the two "H's "in the curl in the centre, it is larger—they are both made with two strokes and a loop, only one loop is carried to the bottom of the second stroke, but not in the other—the two down strokes are made in the same way, but one is in ink and the other in pencil, one slanting and the other upright—the "R" in Marquis Road in number 2 and the "R" in Rutland "in number 8 are made by beginning at the top, but in my opinion</p>

               <p>they are written by two different writers—in my opinion the "W" in William Gifford in this cheque and the "W" in "William Gifford in this second telegram were not written by the same hand—the "W's" certainly are not made in the same way, nor the "G's."</p>

               <p>and we left about half an hour after; there are only two day's racing there—I have known Rowe about fifteen or eighteen months, he went down to Newmarket to buy a horse; I don't believe he has been turned off the race<lb></lb>course, I believe he has been suspended from riding, I think he is a steeple<lb></lb>chase jockey—we did not dine at the house where we put up, I had some<lb></lb>thing to drink in the house, nothing to eat; I could not say whether Kurr had anything, he might, not in my company—Rowe was there and Griffin, I don't know that we were all in the house together, we were there, in the yard, if not in the house; it is some time ago, I can't say whether we were all four in the house together or not—I had dinner on the racecourse, if you call it a dinner; I took something with me, I frequently do when I go to races-William Kurr was not with me after we came on the racecourse till we came away again, he went into Tattersall's ring, he was a member, I was not—we separated about 1.30 if the races began at 2 o'clock and we met after the race was over, at 5 o'clock or 5.30; I can't say, sometimes races are over at 4 o'clock and sometimes at 6 o'clock—I was in company with several persons in the interval, when I say in company I suppose I had a chat with a lot of bookmakers and others, passing the day and that sort of thing—I saw Rowe on the racecourse—if there had been any horses there that Mr. Kurr had bought, or had a chance of buying, I dare say I should have had to examine them for him—I have attended many meetings for him; that was ray purpose in going there, I went as much as a friend; if he had bought a horse I should have been paid for examining it; I was not to be paid unless he bought a horse—the arrangement to go down was made the evening previous in Islington near the Angel and we had a cigar together at the Angel; there was no one else there that I know of—I dare say we were at the Angel twenty minutes, perhaps a little more; we were standing at the corner bar—I had some cold brandy and water—I am positive I have been speaking of the first day of the races and not the second, because I did not go on the second; I told Kurr that I should not come the next day and he said "I don't know whether I shall, I shan't drive down at any rate"—I did see him afterwards; I did not know from him whether he was there the second day, I never inquired, I took no interest in it—I can't prove what day it was that I saw him next, I saw him so frequently; I can't say how many times I saw him during September, I have nothing to go by—it might be October; I am sure I saw him during September; I saw him at Collins' Music hall once or twice, between 8 and 12 o'clock at night—I can only remember seeing him in the day time in September on the St. Leger day when he drove by; I dare say that was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, that is the only day I can swear to—I have not the slightest idea how he was engaged at that time, any more than racing—I have had correspondence with him; I have not any of his letters now, I don't think I ever had above one letter from him in my life; that is some time ago, three or four years, I should think, I can't tell you what it was about—I have not been asked to look at his handwriting, no documents have been shown to me with that object—I have seen him writ<lb></lb>ing letters at his own house—I should not know his handwriting if I saw it, I should not like to pass an opinion upon it; I might have an opinion, but it would not be worth much—I should think the signature "William Harrison "to this cheque was not his writing—as to the pistol, he said it was well for people to know that he had one for fear somebody should inter<lb></lb>fere with him going home at night—I said "What is the good of carrying it</p>

I have never seen any writing of his to notice; I don't know anything about his handwriting, we had some refreshment at the Griffin, at Kineston, we stayed there twenty minutes or half an hour, I dare say—I have frequently met him at the Angel, latterly I generally met him somewhere about the High Street, or at Collins'; I used to meet him generally at the Oxford—it is part of the business of a veterinary surgeon to go to races, and give advice about a horse if a person wishes to buy it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Angel Inn, Farringdon-street. On the 31st of December I saw the prisoner there—he said Mr. Beeson had sent him to borrow my bridle and saddle—he formerly lived with Mr. Beeson, which I knew, and let him have them.</p>

Did you speak to me in your yard, or was it your clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I was in the counting-house—he said, "Will you lend Mr. Beeson a bridle and saddle?"—I am positive he used Mr. Beeson's name—the saddle belongs to me—I only intended to lend it, and that to Mr. Beeson—he promised to return it in an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, and live in Windmill-court, Giltspur-street. I did not send the prisoner to borrow a bridle and saddle of Mr. Harms—he left my service on the 14th December—I had nothing to do with him after that—I never had any transaction with the prisoner respecting a horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a saddler, and live in Long-lane. On the 31st of December or 1st of January the prisoner brought this saddle to me, and said Mr. Beeson and him had bought it with a horse; that Beeson had sold the horse that morning, and had sent him with the saddle—that it partly belonged to him and partly to the prisoner—I asked him why Beeson did not keep it himself—he said he had a great quantity of his own, and if Beeson kept it, he did not suppose he should get his share of it—I asked what he wanted for it—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Did I mention Mr. Beeson's name to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you did. I afterwards, upon examination, found the saddle was my own manufacture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gaoler at the Thames Police Court, Stepney, and reside at No. 35, Grosvenor-street, Stepney. The prisoner and John Charl<lb></lb>ton, who has just been tried, came to reside at my house, some time in Jan. last; they took one room only, the front room first floor; they lived together as man and wife—I cannot say whether there was any place in the room in which the man could have locked up anything without the prisoner knowing it, or having access to it; there may have been a trunk, or small thing of that sort, but nothing as a fixture in the room, which could be locked up—John Charlton resided there nearly the whole of the time, with the exception of his being away, as he said, on board a vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Annie Logan</hi>—he was absent for a week, or a fortnight; he left the prisoner in the room; she resided there during his absence—they always passed as man and wife; I took them into the house as such; they had no children.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, K</hi> 28). I was at the police station in Arbour-square on 3rd May, when John Charlton was brought there in custody—in consequence of what I learned about where he lodged, I went to No. 35, Grosvenor-street, Stepney, accompanied by Woodhouse—he was in his uniform; I was in plain clothes—we went to the first floor front room; I found the prisoner standing by a table in the centre of the room—there was a fire in the room; it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—when we got into the room she said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "Wait a moment"—she said, "Tell me, oh, do tell me, and let me know the worst of it!"—I then said, "Your husband is locked up at Arbour-square police station, charged with uttering a forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—she then appeared very faint and ill; I thought she would be likely to fall, and I cleared an easy arm chair that was near her, and requested her several times to sit down, but she would not do so—I and Woodhouse then commenced searching the room, and while we were doing so, she hurriedly left the table where she was standing, went towards the fire, lifted up her right arm, in the hand of which was some paper; she attempted to throw it towards the fire, when I caught hold of her arm, and prevented her from doing so—I took the paper from her hand, and upon examining it, I found it to contain three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; they were wrapped up in this piece of paper—I marked the notes with the initials "W. S."—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the same—I took them from her, and we went on searching the room—she did not say anything, but appeared very faint and ill, and walked about the room—some short time afterwards, perhaps two or three minutes, she went to a sideboard in the same room and took from a metal vessel, a sort of teapot or coffee pot, this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I now produce—she gave it to me, and said, "Take this, and keep it; it is a good one, and burn the others"—she afterwards said, "What a shame that I should be kept in the dark like this! I found these notes since my hus<lb></lb>band went out this morning, and I do not know anything about them"—that was all she said—I then took her to the station.</p>

Sutton, of Bow Church-yard, dealt with me for this medicine - this book is called the ready money book, and this the small diary - here is an entry of the prisoner's, on the 6th of June, and again on the 10th, but no entry on the 7th - if he had received any money on the 7th - it would have been his duty to have entered it in the book, and given the money to me - here is no receipt of 5l. 8s. from Messrs. Sutton, at any time, and he never paid me that sum - I have a tenant named Jarvis, whose house of business is in Long-acre, and who resides in Percy-street - his quarter's rent was 26l. 5s. - the prisoner always collected it, and should have paid it to me - he entered it in this book - here are his entries, with"M. C.", which is my signature, to them, but the last quarter's rent he has not entered, nor has he accounted to me for it in any way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What was this man to you? A. He was nothing more than a clerk - I am in the habit of lending out money at interest - I do not know that the prisoner has negotiated a loan with any nobleman - Mr. Carland, my solicitor, has done it - there was property in the country to the value of 400l., for which I could not get my money - I was advised to send some person down to buy it, and make it over to me - I sent the prisoner down - I do not know that it was made over to the prisoner absolutely, though I am sorry to say I have been very negligent, from the confidence I put in him - I believe the property was not made over to him entirely - the deed may be at home, but I have not got it here - the person who resided in the country, was Mr. Browning - I asked the prisoner whether he had received the money of Mr. Jarvis - I told him I found he had received it - he put his handkerchief to his face, began to cry, and said he hoped I would not be severe with him - I said, "I find you have received this money," and he said he had, or something to that effect - he has not been in the habit of receiving a commission on what he sold - he wanted an increase of wages a few months ago - I said, "I will not increase your wages; but if you write a good advertisement for me, I may remunerate you with a few shillings" - I never intended to give him any commission on what was sold - if he had written a good advertisement, I should have given him a few shillings, whether I had sold a bottle or not - I do not think he wrote more than one advertisement, and I believe that was chiefly one that had been written before - I am not aware that I have made several mistakes in my accounts - nor that the prisoner paid me a sum of money in advance before he had received it of Mr. Eccles - I remember the prisoner being arrested - he told me so, but did not say a word about wanting money - he did not say that, in order to get rid of it, he would dispose of an unfinished work he was writing - when I taxed him with receiving this money of Mr. Jarvis, he began to cry, and said he was doing a work, and he should get money, meaning, as I suppose, that he could return the money - I believe he did say he could get 160 guineas for the work, though it was not perfect - I said I must take the advice of my friends - I have not taken any one into the prisoner's situation, but I suppose I have had a hundred applications - I remember a mortgage with a man named Cook - he owes me a great deal of money now - I did not know that he was a tavern-keeper - his property was not purchased by the prisoner - I know a tobacconist named Maddox - I believe there was a warrant for 300l. given by him - I did not direct the prisoner to buy Maddox's goods in his own name - my solicitor might - I advanced the money to Maddox, but I did not give the prisoner money to buy Maddox's goods - I left it to my attorney - I do not think I gave the prisoner the money with my own hands - I do not recollect it - I swear I am not aware of it- I never saw Maddox's shop - the prisoner told me he had put his name over Maddox's shop after the sale, but it was not by my direction - I gave him some evasive answer, when he told me I knew he did it to prevent other creditors coming in, because I had advanced him more than he was worth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whatever he may have done with respect to a tobacco shop, or his name being put in deeds, was he any thing to you but a servant or clerk? A. I never considered him any more - I paid him his salary regularly and quarterly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he employed by you, and would it have been his duty to receive the 5l. 8s. and pay it to you? A. Yes, strictly so; and it was his duty to receive the 26l. 5s. for the rent, and give it me.</p>

            . I rent a house of the prosecutrix in Percy-street, for which I pay 100 guineas a year - on the 17th of July I paid the prisoner 26l. 5s. for the last quarter's rent, and he brought me the receipt for it - it was written and signed in Mrs. Canham's name - I gave him a cheque for the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he bring it ready filled up? A. Yes; the cheque has been returned to me by the banker, as paid cheques are - it appears by the banker's book that it was paid on the same day it was given - (Receipt read.)</p>
               <p>MRS. CANHAM. This receipt was written by the prisoner, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not in the habit of giving him multitudes of blank receipts with your name signed to them? A. I am sorry I did so - I have no doubt I gave him this receipt signed in blank, a considerable time before the money was paid, and he repeatedly told me that Mr. Jarvis complained that he was out of cash, and could not pay - I said it was very extraordinary.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Herts. I came to Mrs. Canham's when she discovered something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040029"></xptr>about the prisoner - I spoke to him about the rent received from Mr. Jarvis - I made him no promise or threat, but asked him what he had done with the rent he had received from Mr. Jarvis, and whether he had paid it to Mrs. Canham - he said he had not, but he had received it, and that he had a wife and family, who he hoped would be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask him whether it was a cheque or money? A. No - it was on the 11th of August, the day he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the year, 1823, I came to London, and engaged with the late Mr. Canham to manage his business - he died in 1825, and I continued with Mrs. Canham. About eighteen months ago, I had some conversation with her about my salary, and she said she would do the same with me as her late uncle had done with another person, Mr. Whittingham - allow me one shilling on every bottle sold at the full price of thirteen shillings. I regret that she should have taken this step, as the consequence is, I shall be obliged to mention some circumstances which have transpired between her and myself; but the truth is, she sold full half of the medicine without stamps. As soon as we had made our new arrangement, I put down in a book every bottle sold at full price, which book was kept in a drawer with the fruit book. The one was indorsed"Fruit Book," and the other, "Account Book," and she could not see one without seeing the other. During the last six years she has lent not less than £80,000, in sums of from £20 to £4,000, to different persons, on securities, many of which were prepared by myself - not a loan was advanced without her consulting me. I am made a party in some deeds. For some years I have not paid her the cash as I received it, but she and I settled about once a week. I have frequently lent her cash, and paid her money, when I have not received it. Had it been my intention to have robbed her, I could have done so, on several occasions, to a great extent, as I have had £3,000 or £4,000 in my pocket, for days together. I have made her acquainted with sums due to her, of which she has been ignorant; and she consented that I should employ myself in any way I pleased, provided I transacted her business. With respect to the money of Mr. Jarvis's, he told her he had paid it to me, and when she saw me again, she told me of it. I instantly said, "I have received it," and she marked it off, as paid, on a list which she kept in her pocket, of rents and debts due, for which I was to call. I never asked her for forgiveness. A new list was made out every quarter, and the balance of the old list was carried to it. She carries in her pocket a list of what receipts I had, and if she were to produce that, it would appear that she has marked that as paid. Two or three days before I was taken, she talked about a bill that was to be provided for, and said Mr. Clutterbuck would lend her the money; and he offered to lend her the money to make up the bill, which she had not the means of meeting; but Mr. Clutterbuck has been indebted to her for years, and is it likely, if he had any money to spare, that he would offer to lend her money, rather than pay off the debt? But this, and the circumstance of his coming frequently to the office and asking me how the business was going on, has led me to conclude that he wished to get me out of my situation, to introduce one of his sons into it. Mrs. Canham was aware of my being arrested, and of my being compelled to pay another debt or two. There was a balance, at that time, due to her. I told her I could pay her soon, or, if she chose, I could do it then, by disposing of a work, which I was writing, for £165; but she said she did not wish me to make such a sacrifice. She lent Mr. Cook several large sums, on different mortgages, and when he became a bankrupt, I purchased some property of his, at Garraway's, in my own name. She appears to deny that she knew of his being a hotel-keeper, but she has been there and examined the premises, and said to me, and to others, that it was very foolish for Cook to go to so great an expense in fitting up the hotel. Had any suit arisen about Cook's property, I must have been a party to it; and, about two years ago, Mrs. Canham sent me to France, with full power to act in her name: and, would she have done so, had she considered me merely as a servant? About twelve months ago, she lent Mr. Maddox £125 - he got into difficulties, and she came in under a warrant of attorney, she was in possession a few days, Mr. Selby was then called in, to value the property - Mrs. Canham then gave me a cheque on Gosling's, to receive the money, which I paid, desiring Mr. Maddox to transmit the money to Mrs. Canham - I then had the business carried on, and one of the creditors has declared his intention to indict Mr. Maddox and me for a conspiracy. Mrs. Canham also lent me £100, which I was to repay at £10 per quarter; part of which has been paid. When I entered Mrs. Canham's service, I gave a bond for £400, which Mrs. Canham still holds, and, therefore, she cannot be a great loser by me. I have written several advertisements for her - I read her three new and different ones in one day, and she expressed great satisfaction at them. I trust this explanation will prove that there has been no embezzlement on my part. I felt no obligation to account to her for money the instant I received it, but I had no intention of keeping it; and after she discovered the rent had been paid, I remained several days in her service, and managed her business.</p>
               <p>MRS. CANHAM re-examined. Q. Do you hold a bond as security to the amount of £400? A. My late husband did, but I was informed that at his decease it ceased - when I spoke to the prisoner about this rent, he took out his handkerchief and began to cry - I have my pocket list here - I have not marked off this sum as paid - I have marked "stolen" against it - I indiscreetly allowed the prisoner to remain two or three days in my office after I discovered this.</p>

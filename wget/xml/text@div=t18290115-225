               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not you give me 1s. besides the 1d.? A. No, I had no 1s.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY RAWLINGS. I sent my brother to receive 1l. 13s., in Torrington-square: I gave him 7s. - he came back with 4s. short.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURPHY. I am a watchman. The lad came and told me to lay hold of that woman, as she had robbed him of 4s. 6d.; I took another woman - he said, "No, this was the woman;" she ran into a dark passage, came out, and said, "Do you want me?" I took her to the watchhouse - she had 1s. 2d, on her; the constable told me to go back, and I found 4s. 6d. at the further end of the passage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This watchman and my husband had a bit of a quarrel last Christmas-day, and he has had a spite against me ever since; he put my husband and two sister-in-law in the watchhouse. Witness. I have no spite against them; they are very quarrelsome - they are a set of tinkers.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Is it a thoroughfare where you picked up the money? A. I understand nobody lives in the house; it is indicted - the door is open at all hours.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN RAWLINGS. Q.How came you to stop and speak to her? A. I did not; she asked me to buy laces - I pulled out my silver and halfpence, and gave her a penny.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to get the price of my sister's lodging; I got 1s. 2 1/2d., and was going home, this boy came and said, "Give me my money:" I said, "What money do you mean?" we passed four watchmen before he gave me in charge - there was another woman on the other side of the way; he said at first he that did give me the shilling - the watchman knows it.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURPHY. No, he did not; he gave her in charge to me in Church-street - she ran into Bainbridge-street.</p>

            . I was going through Lincoln's Inn, they told me there had been a fire, and a hosier had been robbed; after this, near Hide Park corner, at the sign of the Faulcon, I saw the prisoner at the bar selling stockings this 13th of Nov. he sold them cheap, and I suspected he did not come honestly by them; so I came back again, and told Mr. Rotheram about him; in the mean time came in Mr. Turner, so he and I went to take him, which we did with some of the stockings under his arm. They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

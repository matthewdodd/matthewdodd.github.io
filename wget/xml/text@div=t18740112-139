On 5th January, shortly after 1 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner opposite Denmark Hill Church—I asked him what he was doing there—he said "Nothing"—I asked him to go away—he turned round, and asked me if I remembered a job happen<lb></lb>ing in July last, pointing over to the prosecutor's house, Mr. Thompson's—I said I did—he told me the articles which were stolen: a pair of boots, hat, umbrella, and coat, about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in gold, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and like-wise the refreshment that he took on the premises—he said he took part of a piece of mutton and a rhubarb pie—I took him to the station, and he made a statement, which Sergeant Pearman took down—this blade of a knife was found upon him.</p>

I was at the Camberwell police-station when the prisoner was brought in by White—White said "This man has given himself up for committing a burglary in Denmark Hill last July"—the prisoner said "Oh yes, I did"—he then made a statement—I asked him his name, and he said "John Steadman"—I asked him his address, and he said "I have no home"—I asked his trade or profession—he said "I am a shoemaker by trade"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the statement, in my writing, which was taken down at the time and signed by him—(<hi rend="italic">This admitted the burglary, the details of which were given with great particularity, his excuse for the offence being that he was starving at the time; it also stated that he had been since convicted for an attempted burglary, and suffered Three Months' Imprisonment</hi>)—I asked the prisoner his native place, and he said Birmingham.</p>

I am a grocer, at 6, Denmark Hill—on the night of 20th July last I went home about 12 o'clock, and shut up the house about half-past—I went to bed, and was awoke about 3 o'clock in the morning by the police knocking at the door—when I came down I found the officer standing at the door, which was open—the parlour door was open and the gas alight—I looked in the parlour and in the shop, and found the tills open, and about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. taken from the tills—from the sitting-room I missed a coat, hat, pair of boots, and an umbrella—the coat was taken from the hall</p>

               <p>—I found a ham under the table—I then went down into the kitchen, and found that a joint of meat had been taken out and a rhubarb pie, part of it eaten, and the remainder lying on the mantel-piece—there was a young dog in the house—this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine, and was in the house that night—I had left the back kitchen window open about three inches, not enough for a person to get in—they did not get in by that sash, but by the bottom one.</p>

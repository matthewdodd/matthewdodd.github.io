            , he keeps an iron shop; a neighbour of mine; he brought one of these books as a sample, wishing me to buy them as cheap as I could, and give him five shillings brokerage; he said he had them to sell for a person; I told him I must see them all, to tell what they are worth. Taylor went out, and sent the prisoner with the books; he had twenty one tied up in a handkerchief, and one Taylor brought is twenty two. The prisoner pulled this bit of paper out of his pocket, and said this will show how many there is; I told him the paper did not tell the number of them, it only mentioned what they are. On the paper was Whitfield's life, in boards, three shillings; he asked a pound for them. I kept the label and the books, they have been in my possession ever since. I took the prisoner before the magistrate,</p>

It was between nine and ten o'clock that I received these books; I was coming across Tower-hill, a man asked me to carry the parcel for him; I told him I had no objection, he gave me the parcel in the handkerchief; took me to Old Gravel-lane; he said he would give me six-pence, and something to drink. We had something to drink at the White Hart, the corner of Well-street; he put the question to me - did I know any body that I could sell them to; I told him I did not know, I would go and see; I took them to a person facing of Mr. Mercury, he went over with one book to him, he came back and said he could do nothing with them; I went over to him, he took me up.</p>

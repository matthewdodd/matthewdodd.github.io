On the 22d of November between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop with my son and porter - It was quite dark, and I had lit my lamps and candle about five o'clock. Between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner Jones came in, he was a stranger. The door was shut, he opened it came in and told me to send 2 lbs. of eight shilling green tea, to Surgeon 
               <persName id="t18201206-4-person88">Mears</persName>
            , No. 55, Curzon-street. I asked him if he was sure it was right, as I did not serve the gentleman? he said Yes, and this was the shop he was sent to; I said</p>
               <p>"Very well you need not wait I will send it." He went out and I sent my porter to enquire if the tea was ordered - the door was shut when my porter went out, and my son remained in the shop. In two or three minutes after my porter left the door was opened, and five men walked in; three walked towards the parlour (the door of which was open) and took a watch off the chimney piece, I followed and saw one of them take it. The passage divides the shop from the parlour. I followed them, and closed the door leading from the shop to the passage, and shut them out on the parlour side; the other two were in the shop. I shut the passage door, and went on the kitchen stairs calling for assistance. Before I could get assistance, they came from the parlour, and two of the three tried to get through the shop door, which was locked; the third opened the passage private door, which leads into Chapel-street - it is a corner house - all three escaped. A young man in my house ran and called Stop thief! I do not know what became of the two in the shop. In seven or eight minutes Jones was brought back, and then Dunn, Grady, and

            . I recognized Jones immediately, and think Grady was one of them by his size. I remembered Murray, he was one of those who went into the parlour I am sure, I recognized him immediately; he was afterwards rescued. I have no recollection of Dunn. My watch was worth at least 4 l. I lost about 2 l. 3 s. in silver, and about 5 s. in copper. I had been to the till half an hour before, that amount was there then, and I had not left the shop.</p>

I was in the shop between seven and eight o'clock, near the window; I saw five men open the door and come in - Dunn and Murray were two of them; Murray and two others went towards the parlour, my mother followed them - Dunn and another remained in the shop. I went to fasten the passage door, one of them seized me, and held me fast, keeping my face from him. I saw Dunn lay across the counter, take the till out, put it on the counter, and take the silver and copper out; there were several half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences in it. The one that held me ran out of the house door. Dunn ran out of the shop door.</p>

            . I am a journeyman butcher, in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Watkins's. I was standing at my master's door about seven o'clock in the evening, our shop was lighted by gas; when I heard the cry of Stop thief! and Murder! which appeared to come in the direction from Mrs. Watkins's house. I looked round and saw Jones turn the corner running towards me, as soon as he saw me he began calling Stop thief! and said</p>
               <p>"There he goes." I had full command of the place; I said</p>
               <p>"There has been no person by here but yourself, and if there is any thief it is you." I stopped him, as I had seen him running about twenty yards or perhaps not quite so much. I was not above eighty yards from Mrs. Watkins's house. I am sure no person of any description passed me after I had heard the cry of Stop thief! I secured Jones. I saw some persons running after him, and as soon as I stopped him they said in Jones's hearing</p>
               <p>"That is one of them." I took him into Mrs. Watkins's shop, and sent for an officer; Mrs. Watkins said</p>
               <p>"This is one of the men who robbed my till." Jones said he was never there before. They wished me to go to the watch-house with him, but I did not. About five minutes after I returned to my master's shop. I saw the other prisoners; Mrs. Watkins's son pointing to Dunn said</p>
               <p>"That is the one who reached over the counter and took the till." Dunn said he was never there before. Mrs. Watkins said Grady was about the size of one of them, and she thought it was him, but she could not swear to him. When Jones, Grady, and Dunn were beside him, they called me a bl - dy nose. I took them from the description Mrs. Watkins had given.</p>

He was taken to Mrs. Watkins, and she, in the presence of Jones, said he had been in the shop to order 2 lbs. of tea for a gentleman in Curzon-street.

            . I am servant to a gentleman, who lodges at Mrs. Watkins's. I was sitting in the kitchen, and heard a violent screaming, as I judged, it came from Mrs. Watkins. I came to the top of the stairs, heard a door shut; and heard Mrs. Watkins say,</p>
               <p>"Some thieves have got my watch, run and try to catch them." This was after the door was shut. I opened the door, and called Stop thief, but could not see any one - it was dark.

I saw Coulton just before me, and when he reached him, he said I think you are the thief, and we took him back to Mrs. Watkins. She was in the shop - she said she thought he was the man. We sent for a constable, who took him into custody. While I was in the shop some person came in, and said some others of the gang were in the market. I went there, and found Coulton in conversation with some persons - he said,</p>

               <p>"I think you are one of the gang." I then seized Grady and Dunn. Somebody, I think a child, said,</p>

            . On the 3d of this instant, betwixt six and seven o'clock, I was standing at my bar, talking to a neighbour, when in came the prisoner Smith. My neighbour asked me how long that man had used my house. I said I did not remember I had ever seen him before. He went in and out of the room two or three times. My neighbour said, If there is any thing in the house, he will certainly take it. My servants were all out. Soon after Smith was gone, my maid went up stairs and found my room door open. I went up and found my bureau open. I looked in a place where I put papers, and there were six spoons unmarked taken from thence. I pulled out a drawer where there had been six or seven more, they also were gone; they were all table spoons. I lost some tea spoons also. I ran to my neighbour that had been with me at my bar, and told him what I had lost. He and I went about to the pawnbrokers, to give them all the account we could. On the Sunday morning I went to the

            , and sent for Haliburton with a warrant I had from Justice Kelynge: he and I went to the cellar in Russel-street, where the prisoner Johnson lived. Haliburton told Smith, who was there, he had a warrant against him for taking some spoons from the Salutation; then he pulled out another warrant, and said, I have another warrant against your tenant. Wood said, Andrews brought three spoons there, and she gave her 5 s. 3 d. for them. She readily gave them up. Then we asked where Andrews was. I think Wood said she would send her girl with us to her. The girl went with us to White-horse-yard. The little girl went in and beckoned with her finger. Then the constable went in. There we found Andrews. (Two table spoons and a tea spoon produced and deposed to.)</p>

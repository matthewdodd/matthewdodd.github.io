               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you say to the man? - After I had asked her what she had to say, she said he had given her thirteen or fourteen pieces of bandanno handkerchiefs, but he had only taken two of them from me, the remainder he had bought in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say that there are some missing that have not been sold? - Yes, I can, I examined every number and these were missing.</p>

               <p>Q. This conversation that you have stated to the court of both the prisoners, was it at the first examination or the second? - At the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if it was on the first examination, and not at the second, it would not appear here in this deposition? - I mentioned it myself in the second as well as the first.</p>

               <p>I am an handkerchief printer; I print handkerchiefs for Messrs. Peltrau and Legrew; I generally puts the initials of every person's name that I do for, at the fag end of the piece of the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so kind as to look at these fag ends, and see whether you should know them to be your work or not? - Here is one done at my house, it has my mark on it, L. P.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you put L. P. on there for? - To denote the initials of Mr. Peltrau and Legrew's name; here is another that appears like it, but the name is defaced nearly; I verily believe they were done at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you would not venture to say that these would match the pattern of any handkerchief here produced? - That I cannot nor no man living can in the state in which they have been in.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they marked with? - With a type and ink, prepared on purpose, for which I have a patent.</p>

               <p>I am an excise officer.</p>

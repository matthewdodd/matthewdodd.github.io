            , esq. On Tuesday the 15th of December, about eleven o'clock in the evening, my fellow servant and me were going to put the horses to; they were job horses. Mr. Brougham's footman was going to put a great coat into the carriage; he called to me, and said both doors were open, and the steps were let down. Immediately I run to look for the door glasses, and found they were both taken out, and as I was going to tell Mr. Kinley, the hackneyman of the yard, I saw the prisoner walk from the carriges directly. I run, and laid hold of him. I asked him, who he was. He said, what is that to you. I asked him, where the coach glasses were that were taken out of my carriage. He said, he knew nothing at all about them. I said, I think you are a thief, and I will secure you. He had both his hands at liberty; he pulled his breeches down. He said, he had been to ease himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take his breeches down, did you - A. Yes. I asked him, where. He pointed towards the carriage where the glasses had been taken out. I then got more help. I got him well secured. I took a candle to look whether there was any such thing done, where he pointed to; there was not; and as I returned back I found the two glasses standing by the off side of Mr. Brougham's carriage, and the strings were cut off. These are the strings; I found them in the yard. There was nobody in the yard, when I collared the prisoner, but me, my fellow-servant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130007"></xptr>and the prisoner, nor had there been for some time before. It was in the back yard. It is no thoroughfare.</p>

            . I am Mr. Broagham's footman. On the 15th of December, I was in the further yard, assisting the coachman in putting the horses to; I saw the coach doors open, and the steps down. I told the coachman. He said, he would see whether the glasses were gone. He came, and saw they were, and he saw the prisoner going away from the carriage. The coachman went and took hold of him; he asked him, who he was. He was very impertinent. He said, he was a gentleman. The coachman asked him, where his glasses were. He said, he did not know. He said, he had been in the yard to ease himself. He had not got his breeches down when the coachman took hold of him. He unbuttoned them afterwards. The coachman took the candle and lanthorn, to see if he could find any such thing done. He could not find any such thing. There was only me, the coachman, and the prisoner, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was taken short; I went down that yard to ease myself. A man came and asked me whether I had been stealing his glasses. I told him, no. He beat me and cut my mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in coals, and live in Neptune-street, New<lb></lb>ington—on the 4th of August I employed the prisoner, who said he was in distress, to take out some herrings to sell—I gave him a barrow with 300 herrings to sell—he was to account for them—I gave him sixpence the night before to get victuals with, as he said he was in distress, and I gave him another sixpence when he went away with the barrow and herrings—he never brought them or the money back—I saw nothing more of him until he was in custody on the 13th—on the 19th, since he was committed, the barrow has been left at my house.</p>

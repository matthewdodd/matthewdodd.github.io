Debenham—I did not know where they carried on business previously, I heard of it afterwards, I did not know it at the time; I have heard it was in Fenchurch Street—the bankruptcy was in 1871 I think—I knew that he was trading in a different name at Finsbury Circus—I mentioned it in one case—I did not mention it to Debenham's, they were the agents of the landlord of the place in Finsbury Circus—I don't know whether he referred to anybody else; I thought he was a respectable man—I believed him to be an honest man, or I would not have given a reference upon any consideration—I believed that he was a very unfortunate but an honest man—somebody came to me from Messrs. Grant's, I did not give a written reference to them, I told them what I thought of them, that they were respectable people—I don't think I mentioned the bankruptcy to them—I also gave a reference to the Central Bank—I was asked by Wilmius to give these references—I gave the reference for Cramer &amp; Co.—I understood from Wilmius that he was trading under the name of Cramer &amp; Co., not being able, of course, to</p>

Cramer came, perhaps half-a-dozen or a dozen times; he came as a messenger from Wilmius—I am certain he came more than twice—Wilmius generally gave me the orders, but I understood he was in Ireland at the time of the order of 3rd August, and Cramer brought the order; nearly all the orders were given by Wilmius—I can't say positively whether or not Cramer gave the order of the 3rd August—my impression is that he did, but on behalf of Wilmius—I occasionally sell large quantities of goods to ship abroad, that is part of my business—if I deal with respectable persons I expect to ship to the ports they say—if a man bought goods to ship to Sydney and I found he sent them to America, I should fancy directly that there was something wrong—if people change the destination of the goods after they receive them I should think it suspicious—I have never known such an instance—I know many houses in London that trade with every part of the world, but we always know from the marks where goods are going—we generally ship them ourselves or send them to the packers, and they give us a mark.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have now got my books—the first transaction was 31st January, for two oases of furs, the invoice price being 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I advanced 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we deduct packing charges and insurance and dock charges—I paid this cheque for 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I advanced 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett—I take what is called a note of hypothecation—this is the form of it: "Mr. J. Davis, 26, Leadenhall Street. Sir,—Herewith we hand you as a collateral security, the goods named, against which we have received an advance; the goods to be shipped on board, consigned for sale on arrival, without reserve, either privately or by public auction (by my agents in Sidney) from the nett proceeds of the sale the amount of the advance to be deducted, with freight and all agents' charges and expenses, exclusive of the usual commission upon the gross proceeds of the sale; and in the event of the said goods not realising the full amount of the advance, with all charges aforesaid, we hereby agree to pay you the amount of such deficiency, under-taking to receive your verified sales as sufficient evidence of the above consignment, and should there be a surplus, you are authorised to hold and apply the same to make good any deficiency on any other shipment you hold"—We hold the surplus as a general balance until all the con-signments are finished—they are shipped by me on account of Cramer &amp; Co.—they go out in our name—we take possession of the goods for security's sake, or else we should have no security—on 16th February I received another case of furs, and advanced 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett, the invoice price being 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the hypothecation note for that was given up to the clerk at the Mansion House, and has not been returned—that is a copy of it—it is Cramer's writing—on 14th March I received 500 pieces of cotton wadding—the invoice price is 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; I advanced 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the signature to that is in Wilmius' handwriting—on 9th April, thirty-two cloth jackets and eight fur jackets; invoice price, 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; nett advance, 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the hypothecation note signed by Cramer—on 2nd May, nine dozen silk jackets; invoice price, 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; advance, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; hypothecation note signed "Wilmius"—on 10th. May, two cases, containing ten dozen umbrellas, forty-eight dozen hand-kerchiefs, and other things; invoice price, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nett advance, 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the invoice for 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made out to Cramer &amp; Co.—I occasionally saw the original invoices, not always—I did not inquire whether the goods were paid for; it is not usual—on 15th May I received ten pieces of flannels, fifty-nine jackets, ten dozen yards of black silk; invoice price, 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; nett advance, 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the hypothecation for that is also at the Mansion House, in the hands of the clerk—on 17th, 27th, and 31st May, and every two or three or four days, I received goods from them, until the 19th August—that is the last day—the total goods received, according to the invoice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030056"></xptr>
               <p>price, amounted to 5108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—between 31st January and 19th August, the nett advances upon those goods were 2581<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the goods were shirts, umbrellas, handkerchiefs, cloth jackets, mantles, sunshades, linens, flannels, &amp;c.—we are general merchants, and we advance upon any descrip-tion of goods—they have all been shipped to Australia and Valparaiso—I did net send any to Holland—I have not rendered any account sales up to the present, but I expect they will be all ready within a month or two; they will all come in due course, perhaps next mail—in no instance have I not rendered account sales—there has not been time yet in this case—I have seen both the defendants, and I have heard that Wilmius was the manager of Cramer, from whom he received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. My business has been carried on now nearly forty years; twenty odd years by my father before me—we do 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year in shipping to Australia, South America, and New Zealand—there is nothing unusual in the practice to get advances on goods in the way that has been done in this case—I have over fifty firms in the City, of the highest respectability, for whom I ship in the same way—I never heard of any business transaction where they did not render account sales—they have not been rendered in this case, because I have only got a small return of goods—I have not got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the whole of the consignments—when goods go out the consignee exercises his discretion as to whether the market is in a proper condition for the purposes of sale—he would hold them till the proper season—whatever the return sales will be over and above what I have advanced the trustees will get, whatever it is; whatever balance there is will be given to the trustees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had dealt with Wilmius before, when he was in Fen-church Street, in the same way, before his bankruptcy—that was twelve months before he began as Cramer &amp; Co.—I rendered account sales for the business done in Fenohurch Street to Coiner &amp; Co., of Manchester, who were the trustees—goods are about four months going from here to Aus-tralia—the goods would get there about the beginning of the winter, but they ought to be there a month or two before the season comes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of the firm of Cooper and Keeley, Cheapside, and am trustee of the estate of the bankrupt—I have received no assets at all myself; 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid over by Mr. Burton—that is the only asset received—I have not heard of any except the account sales we have heard of—at the time I was appointed trustee there were no books at all—this book was given up in November—it is supposed to be a ledger; except this empty letter-book and pass-book there were no other books—there was no cash-book—the ledger contains the goods sup-plied to Cramer and Co., but it does not show where they went to—there are no entries of any transactions with Mr. Davis, nor Mr. Burton either—the letter-book commences at page 58, and all the letters are torn out; it is a letter-book without any letters—the account commenced in the pass-book on 9th April, 1871, with the payment in of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 30th April, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; altogether 885<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. passed through—that was all drawn out, with the exceptions of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't find any entries of the money which had been received from Davis—there are entries from time to time of sums paid to the creditors—I can trace Mr. Fray's clocks by Mr. Davis's book—they were 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—they were sold to Mr. Davis at 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; bought on 18th June and pledged on the 31st—on 20th May there is an entry of Mrs. Ellis' mantles, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they went to Davis for about 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 27th—on 4th June,</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ellis' goods, 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they went to Mr. Davis on the same day, and sold for a smaller amount—I find that the goods mentioned by the gentle-men called to-day, Mr. Grant and many others, went in the hands of Mr. Davis almost immediately after the transaction at less than the price given.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I have ascertained that from January down to August the sum of 2, 513<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., has been paid to creditors—the hypothecation notes were not among the papers found; Mr. Davis pro-duced them, I believe—I think the hypothecation notes were received from Mr. Brighton—I went to Davis because his proof was for 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against. Cramer's estate—I wrote to Mr. Davis and told him I wished to make an investigation of his books, and he allowed me to do so—he produced the hypothecation notes—I mean to say that Davis claimed 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Cramer produced a statement to that effect through Mr. Brighton—I did not see the hypothecation notes at Davis's, Mr. Brighton, the solicitor, produced them—he was acting on behalf of the bankrupt—that was in November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After Mr. Davis made the claim, he was summoned to the Bankruptcy Court and examined there, and then I asked to see his books and papers, and he allowed me to.</p>

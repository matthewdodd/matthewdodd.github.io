            ; I knew her at the time, and I know she went by that name - they lived together in Oxford-buildings after that marriage; it is about nine years since they were married - I saw her in Oxford-street one day last week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long did that woman live with the prisoner? A.About seven years, as near as I can recollect - I was intimate with them part of the time: she left him at the end of seven years, and it was said she went away with some other man - she returned, and the prisoner took her back; I do not know where she has lived since - I heard a report that the prisoner's wife died at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long ago did you hear that? A. About a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the person you saw last week was the person he married and lived with? A. If I saw her now I could tell - I cannot say upon my oath that she was the person: I saw a woman at the Police-office, who was the person the prisoner married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you will not swear the woman you saw in Oxford-street was the woman he married, how can you swear that the woman you saw at the office was the same? A. I will not swear without I saw her present - I saw the same woman both times; she was the woman - I did say I would not swear it; I was not quite clear of her that day - I did not speak to her; I was subpoenaed to go to Marlborough-street office - there is no other person living who was present at the marriage.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner. I produce an extract from the marriage register of St. George, Hanover-square, and another from Shoreditch - here is the one from St. George, Hanover-square; I examined it in the vestry-room, in the presence of the clerk - it corresponds with the entry in the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you examine it? A. I read it word for word - I read this paper, and read the book - (read.)</p>

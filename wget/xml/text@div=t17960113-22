               <p>Q. You did not see it yourself? - A. That I did, after he had pulled it from under her stays; we took her into custody, and had her before a magistrate in Queen-square; that is all I know of it; Mr. Winter has the ribband.</p>
               <p>WINTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor, in Great Chapel-street, Westminster, within four doors of Mr. Barrett's: I went into Mr. Barrett's between four and five o'clock; I sat there some time; when Mr. Barrett brought the prisoner in, and accused her of taking some ribband; I went to search her, and she said, she would pull her pockets off herself, which she did; but I found nothing in them; I desired her to unbutton a great coat she had on, and I saw the end of the ribband hang out of her pocket-hole, and I gave it a pull; she put her hand up to her stomach, and the ribband would not come; I made her pull her hand away, and it presently fell down upon the ground; the bobbin was in it, and it made a bulge; it fell on the ground, and I took it up; I asked Mr. Barrett if that was his ribband, and he said, it was; this is it (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw that hang out of the pocket-hole? - A. Yes; to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Barrett.) Look at that ribband. - A. I believe this to be the same ribband; it has my private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The prisoner bought several things at your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know exactly what they were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the ribband be a part of that? - A. No; the boy told me what ribband she had bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes; we never sell ribband with the blocks on; we always take the ribband off.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is a remnant? - A. We always take the paper off; and if it be the end of the ribband we give them the block along with it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't undo the ribband? - A. Yes; we must do that to measure it; the mark is on paper, which goes underneath the ribband, and we write on the block.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to swear positively it is your property? - A. Yes; as I have reason for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You say it is customary, when you sell these articles, to take off the block? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do yourselves; but, whether your connexions do it, you cannot say? - A. It is very different from Irish, because there frequently it is left upon the sag end of the Irish, but in ribbands we take off the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. But you cannot say, perhaps, by the negligence or disobedience of your shopman, they might have sold it in this kind of way? - A. I don't believe any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a shop of tolerable good custom, I believe? - A. Tolerable.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many persons buying ribband now and then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot always tell what is gone? - A. We generally keep the boxes full.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot take upon you to say exactly what goes out of your shop? - A. Yes; we keep them in particular rows in the box, so that we generally know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual for persons to bring a piece of ribband sometimes upon a stick, and sometimes in another way, to match it? - A. I don't recollect an instance of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is a thing unusual; you will not tell me so surely? - A. I never did that I recollect, upon a block, they might upon a card.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose a person keeps a little shop, do you think they would take it off a block and put it on a card? - A. No; not with any mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know this poor woman keeps a little shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner in your business? - A. Nobody at all, only my wife, she is a partner in every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Wives are more than partners sometimes, I think they are sometimes masters: Persons do sometimes come in this sort of way, to match<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130039"></xptr>goods? - A. I never remember any thing of that sort, especially with my shop mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. This appears to be a remnant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I should suppose a person coming to steal ribband, it would have been as easy to have stolen a whole piece? - A. To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you keep none but new ribbands? - A. I should be very happy if we could sell them so quick as to have none but new ones.</p>
               <p>Q. This does not appear to be a new one? - A. No; it is not a very new one,</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you not make a distinction; suppose you sell to the small shopkeepers, do you sell with the mark on? - A. In general, in Irishes, we sell the marks, but never in ribbands.</p>
               <p>Court. You take it off the bobbin to measure it, and then you take off the mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You all of you have private marks? - A. Yes; there may be two having one mark, but it is very rare.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you sell to shopkeepers, suppose an ignorant shopkeeper comes to buy ribbands, do you fix that sort of mark, by which they should know the price? - A. No; except they desire it in the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mark is that your people may know what to ask? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes; she was very apt to come and stay a long time; she keeps a little haberdasher's shop in Little Water-street; I have been robbed a great many times.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Barrett: On Tuesday the 15th of December, about four o'clock, the prisoner came to Mr. Barrett's, and asked for some ribbands; I shewed her several pieces; I told her two or three times over, that I missed a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hear you? - A. Yes; and she said, it was no such thing; I saw she had something in her hand; and she watched the opportunity, and put something in her pocket-hole; upon which, I told my master I suspected the prisoner had got something; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles did she buy? - A. Threads and tapes, and some wire ribband.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call wire ribband? - A. Ribband with wire in it, and some yellow ribband.</p>
               <p>Q. Any blue? - A. No; she came in for some yellow and blue.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she did not buy any blue ribband? - A. Yes; she said she wanted to buy some, but she pretended she could not see the colour, and she would come again next day; she never offered to show me any to march.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was she taken into custody? - A. I about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You mean to say, she remained in the shop a quarter of an hour after you had declared she stole a piece of goods from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are sure you sold no blue ribband? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Winter.) Did you find any yellow ribband upon her? - A. Yes; in her pocket; and I gave it her again.</p>

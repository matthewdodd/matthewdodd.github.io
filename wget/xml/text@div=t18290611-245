               <p>ANN GOSS. I am the wife of John Goss. On the 1st of May, we lost a pair of sheets from the room which the prisoner occupied - I had let it him on the Friday - he told me on the Sunday, that his wife had run away - I asked, what made her run away; he said he did not know -I said, "Let me see if my property is all right, and you had better go too." I took down the bed, and the sheets were gone - he said the bed had never been lain on.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Battlebridge. I have two sheets; one I received myself from the prisoner, on the 2d of May; the other I did not take in.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only been four months in this country - I only received 10s. a fortnight from the Society for the Support of the Spanish Refugees; it was not quite sufficient, and I pawned these sheets from distress, intending to get them out again - the landlady missed them - I told her if she was not satisfied, I would leave her a coat or something not to make a disturbance - she kept a house of ill-fame, and would listen to no reason - my character may be heard from Mr. Freshfield, the Secretary to the Spanish Refugees.</p>

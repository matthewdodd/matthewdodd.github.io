            . I am Sexton of the parish church of Heston. Lord Jersey has a pew in that church. It was the custom of his family to leave their prayer-books in that church. There were two quarto ledger prayer-books and an octavo prayer-book in their pew. I saw the church safe on the 24th of September at a funeral. Every thing was then safe, as far as I could see. I had seen every thing safe on the Sunday. I took it for granted every thing was safe on the Tuesday. It was my custom to keep the parish pall in the church. After that I was not in the church from the Tuesday until the Friday. I went out a little way, and when I came home I found that there was a hue, and cry. I went to it on the 25th, Friday, about four o'clock in the afternoon. I found it locked as I had left it. When I got inside, I missed the three prayer-books from the Earl of Jersey's pew. I searched the church carefully over, and I found two books belonging to the communion table were moved out of a cupboard into which I always put them. I have seen the pall since, and have got it now. Whoever it was that stole these things got in by breaking a window, which made space enough for a person to get in. It was about seven feet from the ground, but there was a tomb close, on which he must have got. I saw the pall afterwards on Saturday afternoon. My little girl brought it. Heston is about fourteen miles from here, and twelve from Golden Square.</p>

               <p>- On the 25th of September the prisoner came and offered a quarto prayer-book to pledge. He asked five shillings for it: that was not near its value. I should suppose it was worth from 25s. to 30s. I asked him where he got it from? He said it was his own. I asked him where he bought it? He said he did not buy it, but he had it given him by a gentleman for cleaning his boots and shoes, instead of wages. I told him I thought that was not a very probable thing; so I went and acquainted Mr. Harrison. The prisoner was still in the shop. I went and informed Mr. Harrison, my master. Having conferred with him, he came and questioned the prisoner himself. I heard what passed between them. He asked him where he lodged, or where the gentleman lived that had given him the book? He could not tell us He said he could not tell; he was out of town, and he did not know him. Mr. Harrison then asked him where the gentleman lodged? He told us he did not know, that he believed somewhere in Whitechapel; to which Mr. Harrison said, that would not do; he must take him before a magistrate, and he must give an account where he got the book from. Mr. Harrison said he would take him, and therefore it was needless to make any resistance. He went along with Mr. Harrison. They had not got a long way, before I had occasion to go up stairs, and I was under the necessary of going through the passage where the prisoner had stood, and I stumbled over something. I took it up, and found it to be a bag, and it contained two other prayer-books; one exactly like the one he had offered to pledge. a quarto, and the other a large sized octavo. I immediately took the books I found in the bag to Maryborough-street to Mr. Harrison. The books were examined, and the prisoner was remanded for a further examination. The books have continued in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>9, New Square, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I was present at the trial at the Whitechapel County Court, on the 24th June, in which the prosecutor was defendant and the prisoner plaintiff—I had the management of the caso for the prosecutor—I saw and heard the prisoner sworn, examined, and cross-examined as to two payments alleged to have been made by the prosecutor to him of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the date of payment was the 19th March—he was asked whether he had received payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he denied having received it—he was then asked whether he had not received the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th March—he denied it—he was then asked whether or not he had received any sum on account from the defendant—the answer was that the only money he received was a sum of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had received through our firm, and that he had not received any other sum from the defendant—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when that was paid we were paying Mr. John Gray's debts, and ho made out a list of his liabilities—the date is the 15th April, 1873—I paid Mr. White 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I understood was the whole amount—nothing was said about any further liability—I said "You had better not discount any more bills for him"—he did not say anything else was due, on the contrary, if he had said there was anything more due to him I should have paid him at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The cheque was for an overdue acceptance—I do not know the date of the acceptance—it was overdue some two or three months, I think—I said to the prisoner" We have paid you up down at Mile End two or three times, and you had better not give any more credit, because if you do it may not be paid again"—he made no reply, there was an end of the transaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. I will not pledge myself as to any particular dates of payment—it was the 21st February and 19th March so far as my recol<lb></lb>lection goes—I do not know whether the judge made notes at the trial, I dare say he did—they were not produced before Mr. Paget—the case was adjourned for the production of the certificate laying the foundation of the charge, without which the Magistrate had no jurisdiction—the County Court case we defended for the then defendant—Mr. Pocock appeared—I instructed him—Mr. Gray is a tobacconist—he has a freehold down in Essex, and he has leaseholds—in Mile End—our firm were solicitors for the trustees of his father's will—we had acted for him for some years—I do not know that there have been many monetary transactions between him and Mr. White—on the contrary, Mr. White said there was only one transaction between them, this particular transaction of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had paid—I do not know that that bill had been renewed from time to time—I advised Mr. White not to let Mr. Gray have any more money—that action was not brought for any bill transaction, but merely for goods Hold and delivered—White did not mention to me, after I gave him this cheque for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., anything about this bill for goods sold and delivered until I saw him about twelve months after<lb></lb>wards if he had mentioned it I should have added it to the debt and given him a cheque for the amount—I was then paying all Mr. Gray's liabilities—that was in April, 1873—the case in the County Court was adjourned on the 24th June for further evidence to show that Mr. Gray had paid White one or two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then brought two witnesses to prove it—the County Court Judge did not hear them—on the first occasion the Deputy Judge was sitting and heard the main facts of the case—on the second occasion the Judge himself sat, who had not heard the case, and I brought two wit<lb></lb>nesses to prove that they had heard Mr. White acknowledge that ho had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170049"></xptr>
               <p>received these sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Judge would not hear them, because, it seems that he had made a note in his book that Albert Gray was to be produced, who was a brother of the prosecutor—Albert Gray was in Lincoln<lb></lb>shire, and I considered it far better to bring independent witnesses of the payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than the production of his brother, but the Judge refused to hear them—he asked Mr. White whether he would consent to Mr. Priest and Mrs. Gray being called to prove having received these 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mr. White would not consent to their being called—the name of the Judge who refused to hear the witnesses was Sir Walter Riddell—judgment was given against Mr. Gray—I do not know that Mr. Bustle, the now Solicitor for the Prose<lb></lb>cution, has applied that execution should be stayed—I believe it has been talked about—ho may or may not have done so—I think he ought to have done so—I have no belief on the subject—we have no interest in the matter—Judgment was given on the 8th July for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether, with costs—I understood from Mr. Bustle that Mr. White had not appeared, and that a warrant had issued for his apprehension—I do not know of my own know<lb></lb>ledge that ho was arrested on the 23rd and locked up all night—Mr. Paget heard the two witnesses that Sir Walter Riddell refused to hear—they were not my witnesses—I am not identified with this prosecution—the witnesses for the prosecution were, all heard—Mr. Paget did not commit for trial, he declined to commit—he was called upon under the Vexatious Indictment Act to bind the prosecutor and his witnesses over to prefer a bill at these Sessions—my advice to Mr. Gray was to pay the money over again—that letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed by me on behalf of the firm—it is written under ray dictation—I was at the Police Court before Mr. Paget—I did not see Mr. Gray hand Mr. White my letter—I have a doubt, I cannot say—I certainly tried to get it back from Mr. White—I never asked him—I had no reason to get anything back from Mr. White—I did not see the prisoner hand that letter of mine to Mr. Pdget—I saw Mr. John Gray, under my advice, hand Mr. White a notice—it was sent to Mr. White at his address, and returned through the Dead Letter Office, and I told him to serve him personally—Mr. Gray filed his Liquidation in Bankruptcy on the the 27th July—he will pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—he has got an estate of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Against 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debts—I have no doubt he could pay 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I am not sure that Mr. Paget read the letter. (<hi rend="italic">The letter, being read, was a Notice of Liquidation</hi>). Mr. Paget did not dismiss the case directly he read that letter the letter was handed up to him by consent of Mr. Pocock, who said he had no objection to his reading it—it night have been an hour after that the case was dismissed—I will swear it was more than 20 minutes—I will swear to half an hour—I think there was another witness examined after he read that letter—I will not pledge my oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was responsible for the Judge's refusal to hear the two witnesses, in this way, I had no knowledge of the Judge's note, it was adjourned to produce further evidence confirmatory of John Gray's evidence that he had paid then two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his brother, a ward of Court, was in Lincolnshire, and he gave me his name as being prepared to prove it, but when I found I could get the same witnesses in London I thought it more advantageous to our client to produce independent witnesses than his brother, and Mr. White refused to give his consent to their being heard—Mrs. Gray is here—Mr. Priest, I believe, is ill—with reference to the pri<lb></lb>soner being given into custody on the 23rd July, I believe the first hearing before the Magistrate was the time when he did not appear—I do not know</p>

               <p>anything about the summons being issued—the prisoner handed up some letter to the Magistrate, and the Counsel wished to see it previously to its being handed up—no objection was offered to its being put in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The question before the County Court was whether the two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, and I was prepared to show by the testimony of these witnesses that they had been paid—the allegation on the part of the plaintiff was that after the bill had been given, or during the time it was running, he had trusted Mr. John Gray for goods sold and money lent, and the issue was this, whether that money was lent before the renewed bill was given, or subsequently—the defendant's case was this "You had a bill for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; part of that was for goods supplied, and the other money lent at interest; that is all I owe you, therefore, this bill for goods sold and delivered is included in the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and has been paid you"—that was a separate transaction.</p>

I heard the prisoner deny that he had received two payments of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have paid to the prisoner two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, namely, on the 21st of February and 19th March, 1873, respectively—he gave me no receipts—the consideration for the payment of these two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I received from him in January, 1873—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was repaid for the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the loan of it—I gave the prisoner an acceptance for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on December 16th, 1872—the consideration for this was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then owing on an acceptance then due, the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goods supplied, or thereabouts, and interest upon it in consideration of his taking an acceptance—this was the account on which I was sued on the 24th June, this year.</p>

I cannot say whether my father and Mr. White's father were very intimate, and did a good deal of business together—my father has been dead fifteen years, and I cannot remember what took place then—I have not had a good many monetary transactions with Mr. White—I re<lb></lb>member his lending me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my giving him a bill for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in November, 1872—I paid it when it became due by another acceptance—I could not meet it at that time—the prisoner did not then advance me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and take a bill for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable in a month—my solicitor has the account of the goods supplied me for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the goods contained in this account, supplied up to the 14th December, were articles named in the acceptance—the acceptance for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given about the 16th December—I will not pledge myself to a date, but it was in December—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection it was payable in a month—if so it would be due about the 17th January—it was never presented—very likely I told the prisoner I could not pay until I got my Christmas rents in—he allowed the matter to stand over until April, 1873—I believe Mr. Todd then gave him a cheque—the prisoner did not buy any wine I liked after April—if he bought it I have not had it—he bought some wine in December, 1872, or thereabouts—he did not buy any after the acceptance was given, and charge it in his account—I positively swear that I had no transactions with him excepting the ac<lb></lb>ceptance for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed money—he supplied me with flour, pork, and potatoes—they are all in the account—he came to my shop in the early part of the present year drunk, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or pay him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off a sovereign he said I owed him, and I, being in doubt as</p>

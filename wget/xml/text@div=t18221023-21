I heard the glass crack, and then they walked away; I looked and saw it was broken, and a piece pushed in; I ran after the prisoner, and took him opposite Mr. Stanley's shop, but found nothing on him. He was very much frightened, and the moment I collared him said he had not broken the window, before I charged him with it. When I brought him back he said a boy pushed him against it.</p>

            . I live four doors from the prosecutors'. Between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw eight or ten people gathered round my window. I went out to see what they were doing, and saw a watch-chain in a woman's hand - this was about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner was secured. I asked her for the chain - she said it was hers. I took it from her, saying, I thought it belonged to my neighbour, and she might come with me. I took it to the prosecutors', but she went away. He claimed it. The prisoner was there at the time. It was found down my area. The woman said she was going by, and a little girl who was with her dropped the chain. One of my areas is very shallow, but the chain could not be reached without a stick. The woman herself had no stick, but a boy who stood there had one.</p>

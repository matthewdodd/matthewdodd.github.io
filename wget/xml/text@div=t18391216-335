I was twenty-three years old on the 6th of this month—I am a butcher, and carry on business at No. 2, New Quebec-street, Portman-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone—I have carried, it on on my own account ever since I was twenty-one years of age—my grand<lb></lb>father, Edward Porter, my aunt, Mrs. Brader, and my uncle William Brader, reside in the house with me—my aunt assists me in the management of the business, and attends to the shop—my grandfather has nothing to do with the business—Mr. Brader is a finisher at Broadwood's, the piano-forte manufacturers—he has nothing to do with my business—the prisoner has been in my service about eleven months—he slept in the house, in the back attic—my aunt and Mr. Brader slept in the front-room, second floor—the attic is on the third floor. On Wednesday, the 9th of October, I had a cash-box, in which I kept my money—it was usually kept in the closet of my aunt's room, on the second floor—I had seen it on the Sunday pre<lb></lb>vious, and the money in it, on my aunt's table—I did not count what money there was in it then—there was a bill drawn on Mr. Fitzgerald for 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and accepted by him—there was also a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note received of Mr. Wilkinson, of Park-street. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Wilkinson are customers of mine, and these sums had been received on account of meat supplied to them—there was also a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note received from Mrs. Napier, of Green-street—we had given her change for that, it was not for meat—there was about 1170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the cash-box, including the bill—it was the prisoner's habit to go out on the Wednesday—he was allowed to go out from five o'clock in the evening till ten, provided business was over—he generally dressed himself before he went out—he dressed in the back attic—in coming down stairs to go out he would pass my aunt's bed-room door—I was at home on Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 9th, I do not recollect seeing the prisoner since the afternoon part, about four o'clock—he returned about ten that night—I was at home when the money was missed—it was missed about nine o'clock—I went up stairs to my aunt's room after my aunt found the door open—I have seen some of the notes which I have mentioned, since.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160038"></xptr>
               <p>and then I took possession of my grandfather's room—I cannot exactly say when the new cash-box was first obtained, but it was bought at Wright's, in Oxford-street—I should think I had had it about a year—I have the key of it—it is in our possession—it is a common key, and it is a common box—I believe my father died in debt—I believe those debts have been paid, but I was only 8 years old when he died, and do not know any thing about it of my own knowledge—I received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes from Mr. Wilkinson on the 24th of August—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was in change, not on account of meat—we gave change for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the same time we received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive it, my aunt did in my presence, in the parlour—I was not present when the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was received from Mrs. Napier—I do not recollect the circumstance—that was received before I came of age, and was given up to me at that time—I had paid away a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about three weeks before the robbery, to Mrs. Philpot, of Forty-farm, Harrow—that is the only one I recollect paying away—I do not recollect any other being paid—I have not paid away any 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes latterly—I do not recollect doing so—I was not at home the whole evening when this took place—I returned home about eight o'clock—I had gone out about seven o'clock on business—I have money in the Bank of England—I had some there before I came of age—there is 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my name there—I have a cash account there—it has not increased since I came of age—I have not taken any out since I came of age—I cannot exactly say what sum of money I had in my second cash-box on the evening in question, but I think about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it consisted of notes and gold, fives and tens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying just now it was for small change, when you had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and sovereigns there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The box my aunt had possession of was, if we had more money than we wanted, we used to put it away, if we could spare it, from the other box—I mean by small change 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—there were thirteen sovereigns in the box my aunt had—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the other cash-box was money which had come in in the course of a few days—as the money came in we used to take it out to go to market with—it did not remain there long—I can<lb></lb>not tell how much there was in that box the Wednesday week before, it was all gone at market—I kept no account of what I had in either of the boxes—I had no other cash account except at the Bank.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it invested in any way, or is it in cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was put in the funds by my grandfather—it is money in the funds, not a cash account—I had no cash in the Bank of England—my uncle had no cash account, that I know of—he had no cash-box, that I know of, only the one I gave to his charge—the cash-box that is lost was bought in Oxford-street about a year ago—I cannot speak to the time exactly—there was no other cash-box before that but the one I have—for a twelvemonth after I came of age, the only cash-box kept was the one I have in my room—all the money was then kept in that cash-box in my room, under my own charge—my brother slept with me at that time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>to my aunt, and so I gave it her to take care of—that is about twelve months ago from this time—somewhere about last December—I was pre-sent when one of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes was received of Mr. Younger, of Albion-street—I think that is about nine months since from the present time—I do not know of any other which I can exactly state—there were some more in the box, but I cannot tell who they were received from—I will not swear I have not paid away a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note within the last six months—I have no recollec-tion of paying away more than one 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note within the last twelve months—I have no recollection of it at all—I have not done so that I recollect—we keep no account of what we pay away, or what we receive.</p>

               <p>we kept a cash-box in the closet—it had never been produced to him that I know of—he went out every Wednesday and the other journeyman on Thursday—he received 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—I had no account of the numbers or dates <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Bank-notes in the cash-box—I always put my initials to notes when I take them—the bill was received from Mr. Warren, Mr. Fitzgerald's steward—Mr. Wilkinson and Mrs. Napier were customers of ours—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at three notes</hi>)—this is my writing—these have all my signature at the back—I can undertake to say all these three notes have been in my pos-session—this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I received from Mrs. Napier's butler—I do not know his name—Mrs. Napier then lived in Portman-street—she now lives in Green-street—this "R. Napier, 15, Portman-street, Nov. 23, 1837. E. P." on the note is my writing—that was the time my father had the management of the business, and I put E, P., because his name is Edward—Nov. 23rd is the day I took it of Mrs. Napier's butler—my nephew became of age two years ago, on the 6th of this month—I am sure that note was safe in the box when I went to it on the Sunday night before the Wednesday—on this other 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note here is my writ<lb></lb>ing "R. Wilkinson, Esq., Park-street, August 24, 1839. H. E. P."—I made the distinction of Park-street, because we serve two Wilkinson's—I put "H. E. P." on it because the business was then in his name—Mr. Wilkinson is one of our customers—last season was the first season we ever served him—that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was safe in the cash-box on Sunday night—I took it in payment of an account <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I gave the butler, Mr. Teuton, change for—that was on the same occasion as when he paid the bill on Saturday evening—I have written the same on this note—I am certain it was in the cash-hot on the Sunday evening preceding the robbery—it had not been paid away—I have never had but one more 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note since Henry became of age, and I have brought a memorandum of the lady I paid that to—it is in my own writing—I paid it to Mrs. Philpot, a farmer's wife, at Wilsden Forty-farm, for sheep—I took the number of it at the time I paid it—it is "52232," dated "10th of January, 1838"—I took that memorandum the day Henry went to pay Mrs. Philpot—I did not pay it to her myself—I had seen all these three notes a fortnight before the robbery—we generally supped at eight o'clock—my nephew's business is a very good one—it has improved very much of late years—I may take a good deal of that credit to myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say "the person who brought the box," have you any doubt about this being the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt whatever, but I did not know I was justified in saying "the prisoner"—I have no doubt of him at all—I told him we never made two locks alike—he seemed surprised, and asked me what was to be done—I told him there was no alternative but to break the box open, and that I told him I could do if he pleased—I then asked him if he was the owner of the box—he said no, he was not, but told me the owner—the name I quite forget, but I think he men<lb></lb>tioned the place in or near Judd-street, as where he came from—he then gave me the box, and desired me to open it—I said I could not open it unless I had a note from the owner of the box—he told me he had come some distance with it, and that some person was waiting until he returned, and it would put him to very great inconvenience, in consequence of his going back—these were not his precise words, but to that effect—I said I certainly could not open the box—what I had been saying to him put him a little out of temper, and I said perhaps we had a little more discernment in these matters, and I should not be justified in opening it without the owner—he then gave me the box, and asked me to take care of it until he returned—I took the box a distance of three or four yards, to place it in our fire-proof safe, to let him see it would be secure, and just as I was placing it in the safe he said no, he would take the box with him—I brought it back, and gave it to him, and he took it away—I did not notice the box particularly—I think I should know the size of it—it was about ten inches by five, or between five and six—I think it was wider than five inches—it was black japanned, and a gilt margin round the edge of it—I have brought a handle precisely of the description which I thought the han<lb></lb>dle was, and which I know it to be—(<hi rend="italic">producing a common brass handle</hi>)—I cannot say whether it was a common lock, or whether it was our manu<lb></lb>facture or not—I rather think something passed about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I am not positive, but I think he said he had come in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I do not think there was any appearance about his person as if he had been walking quick—Mr. Britton was sitting in a chair close by the door—I should say no one could possibly open the door without seeing Mr. Britton—I was afterwards sent for to High-street, Marylebone—before I was sent for there I had the dress of the person who came in my recollection—I called it to my memory within half-an-hour before I was called to appear at Marylebone—I cannot positively say what waistcoat he had, but he had a black body coat on, with a black satin long-ended stock with a union pin in it, that is, two pins chained together by a short chain—I described the person who came to Inspector Tedman in the waiting-room—at that time I had no knowledge whatever that a satin stock or union pin had been found in the prisoner's box—I did not notice his hair at the time he came—I remarked his appearance in the face—be was high cheek-boned, and rather flushed at the top of the cheek-bone—his hair was curled at the side, and was very dark—I afterwards saw a man named Dixon produced at the police-office—he was certainly not the man who came—there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160048"></xptr>
               <p>no resemblance of the man in him—the prisoner was not in custody when I gave the description to the inspector—he was sent for while I waited—when he came into the Magistrate's room he was dressed in a butcher's dress—he was called to the witness-box, and while giving his evidence the sitting Magistrate called on me to look at him, to see if he was any thing like the man who came to the shop—I said I believed him to be the man then—I felt fully satisfied he was the man then, but felt very tenacious of swearing to him in consequence of having his working-dress on—I was examined on the subject—the prisoner, upon that occasion, was allowed to go away on some recognizance—I mentioned Mr. Britton having been with me on that occasion—he was not before the Magistrate then—I went to the office again on the following Saturday—the prisoner was in attend<lb></lb>ance—he then came dressed, I think in a suit of black—when I saw him then I had no doubt he was the man—the Magistrate had on the first occasion desired him to appear at the next examination in his Sunday-clothes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a stock</hi>)—I did not think the stock he had on had any blue flowers on it, but still it is possible, from the position in which the pri<lb></lb>soner stood at the time, (he stood before me,) that the stock might have had flowers on without my being able to discover them—it was by gas light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the prisoner once again; on the oath you have taken, have you any doubt whatever that that is the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am still of the same opinion, and have been so all along—I have no doubt he is the man who came to St. Paul's Churchyard on Wednesday, the 9th of October.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What position was he in that you could not see the blue flowers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The situation he was in was close before me, and the gas light was close against him, which was I sup<lb></lb>pose six or nine inches above his face, so that the brim of his hat would certainly shade his front—I do not know that it would shade his neck-handkerchief more than his face—it is possible it might hide the flowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it possible it would hide the stock more than his face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the position he stood in while conversing with him he would certainly alter the position of his head many times, by which I can swear to his face—I do not mean he did not alter the position of his body, but I should certainly take more notice of his face than his stock—I do not swear to the stock—I swore to its being a black satin stock before this was produced to me—I have my doubts whether this is the stock—my belief certainly was that it was a plain black satin stock with a gold union pin—there are not thousands of union pins to be seen in the streets in London—I did not notice any thing particular in the pin to be able to swear to it—I do not say it was a common one—it was fashionable—I did not make a memoran<lb></lb>dum of this circumstance at the time—I made one on Saturday the 19th, when I was called on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you swear it was Wednesday, and not Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I have several circumstances that perfectly satisfy me on the sub<lb></lb>ject—I cannot swear no person came to have a cash-box opened within a week before, or within three or four days of the time—we do not frequently have people come to have boxes opened—sometimes we have, to have our boxes opened and others also—we have had some brought since to be opened—I can swear we had not any brought to be opened on the Thursday or Friday in the same week—I can say so from the manner in which I can account for my engagements on the various days between Wednesday and Saturday—I was not all the time in the shop—I was of an evening possibly from</p>

               <p>five to seven o'clock—had a cash-box been brought to me to be opened within those days I certainly should have called it to memory when this circumstance was brought to light within a few days—I mean to say that I had no box brought to me—I cannot account for my engagements on the Monday and Tuesday before the Wednesday, because this occur<lb></lb>rence has led me most minutely to examine into the circumstance of these two or three days, and nothing has led me. to look back further—I cannot swear I was not in the shop between five and seven o'clock on Thursday—I have not had occasion to consider what I had been doing on the Monday and Tuesday before—my attention has not been directed to it—my attention was directed to the Monday and Tuesday before the Wednesday before the Magistrate—at the time the question was put to me I had an opportunity of thinking whether I had or not, but at the present moment I have not had an opportunity of referring to my own mind to bring it to my recollection—I could refer back to the time then, and I can now if sufficient time is given me to consider—I could not at any time tell whether any boxes were brought to be opened on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The name of Dixon has been put to you; will you venture to swear he did not bring a box to have it opened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I will not swear that he never came to have a box opened—I will swear he did not that week—I mean the week after the Wednesday—I will not swear, but to the best of my recollection, he did not come on the Monday or Tuesday, and I will swear most positively that he did not come on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—I was in the shop part of Thursday, Friday, and Saturday—my engagements call me out in the course of the day—I was there all Thursday evening until eight o'clock—I cannot say whether I was there from four to nine o'clock—we leave at eight o'clock—I was there between five and eight o'clock—most likely I was there between seven and eight o'clock, but I will not swear positively—I will not swear I was there between five and six o'clock—I think I dare swear positively I was there between seven and eight o'clock—I think I was there between five and six o'clock, but I will not swear—I will not swear positively to be<lb></lb>tween six and seven o'clock—I swear positively I was there between five and eight o'clock—I was certainly there some hours between five and eight o'clock—I can say the same of Friday—I cannot say positively I was there until eight o'clock on the Friday, for I was very poorly on the latter part of Friday, and do not know whether I went home earlier than common—on Thursday I was tolerably well—I was not at all poorly to my recollection—I should be justified in saying so positively, perhaps; but I was in such good health as not to notice that I was at all poorly—the box was offered to me on Wednesday—I took it into my hand—boxes of Chubb's manufacture have always been marked during the time I have been in the employ—I was asked for a key to fit it, not for a key to be made to fit it, but to open it—the question was for a key to open it—it might possibly be to fit a key to it—it was in my hand from one to two minutes, while walking three or four yards and turning back again—I said we never had but one key to a lock—that I could not open it, because we never kept a key to any lock of a box we sold—I think I was writing at the time—yes, I was writing—I did not use the term "inconvenience"—the prisoner did—I will not swear positively he made use of that word—I do not know that it was a different word—I cannot</p>

               <p>positively say, but I think something was said about "the position you have taken"—I think the phrase was, "I admire the position which you have taken."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Instead of "inconvenience," it was, "I admire the position you have taken?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said so—I am not positive he did not make use of the word "convenience" in the conversation as well—it is possible the words, "I admire the position you have taken," might have been used instead of "convenience"—I do not know that I said any thing after that, because, in the first instance, he made use, it appears, of the same phrase, and I said we had rather more discernment than he had, and he then made use of the words you have stated—I did not understand him in the first instance, and I then said, "We have more discernment than you"—he then repeated the words again, so that I understood him—it was after that conversation I had the box given to me—Britton was about four yards from me, sitting close to the shop-door—there is only one counter—there is just room for one chair to stand between the door and the counter, and it was there Britton was sitting—I was writing close by where the prisoner came and stood by the counter, nearer to the house than the street—the safe is about four yards farther in than where I stood—the person would be about four yards from Britton, and the safe was about double that distance—I was not writing on a desk, but on the counter—I did not say any thing to Britton, while the person was in the shop—Britton remained sitting all the time—the person was in the shop I should suppose from five to ten minutes—it was between half-past six and seven o'clock as near as I can tell—I can swear to the prisoner—I will not say it is impossible to make a mistake in a person, but I could never have a person stand before me and have such a conversation as the present without making particular observation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not notice the neck cloth to discern the flowers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I talk to a gentleman I look him in the face, invariably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you swear to any one person that came to have a lock opened before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say persons frequently came to have locks opened—I said sometimes, not frequently—I do not think I am justified in making an average at all, but if I was to say about once a fortnight, it would be a fair average; but perhaps not so often as that—they generally bring the box and want it opened, but I never before had a circumstance which caused an altercation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you did not know there would be an altercation in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but it did end in an altercation, and I noticed the person more from the circumstance that we did enter into an altercation—I do not mean to say that I quarrelled with him, but it was a slight altercation; so much so that it induced Mr. Chubb to leave his office at the back—Mr. Chubb came into the shop while he was there—I have said so before—he came into the shop at the time the prisoner was there—I did not say so before I went before the Magistrate, because the first time I went before the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, was the time I was called on to give evidence, and I had no time to name the circumstance—I can say that I did say so to Mr. Davis, the senior clerk, previous to our going before the Magistrate in the first instance, he and I conversed about it—I believe Mr. Chubb was at Marylebone office, but he has never been called upon—I was examined three times before the Magistrate, the first examination was on a Saturday—I was brought up again on the following Saturday, and I think the next was on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160051"></xptr>
               <p>a Thursday—Mr. Chubb was not examined at either time—he was present at one examination—the prisoner was called by the Magistrate, put into the box, and then I was asked to look at him—I had been in the office some time before, during the whole time that he gave in his state<lb></lb>ment what he had to say on the subject—he was called into the witness-box, and examined—I dare say he was sworn—he gave an account of where he had been on the evening in question, before I was called on to look at him, but I had looked at him a great deal before I was called on—all the time he was undergoing examination—the Magistrate called on me to look at him—be had not a black coat on at that time—the account the prisoner gave was in presence of the Magistrate—I suppose it was in the witness-box—I heard him sworn—the woman was at that time in custody, and the soldier was brought up—he had been out on bail—the first day I was examined before the Magistrate, was the second Saturday after the Wednesday, it was the 19th of October—I cannot say what neckcloth he had on at that time—he appeared in a butcher's dress—I cannot swear what neckcloth he had, but I think a lightish one—I cannot swear whether it was black or white—I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you had no reason to pay attention to him, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my attention was arrested directly he entered the witness-box—I do not recollect what colour his neck-handerchief was—I do not think his hair was darker than it is now, but I have observed that he has not had so much hair at one time as at another—his whiskers were certainly more than they are now—I think considerably more, but I cannot see him now very well—I think he had more whiskers then than now, but I will not swear it—I do not know that I have ever said the colour of his hair was darker at one time than another—I do not think I have—I am not positive, but I do not think I have, for there is a preponderance on that side—if I was led to suppose there was or was not, and thought strictly on the subject, I should say certainly I have not—I do not think I have said his hair was darker at one time than another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were first examined, had you heard of a reward of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being offered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; at that time I had—that was the first time I had seen the prisoner since Wednesday the 9th—I believe I was there before he was sent for to the office—I think he was sent for while I was under<lb></lb>going my examination—I have been at Mr. Chubb's about a year and a half—I am shopman and collecting clerk—Britton is a druggist by trade—at the time I knew him he was carrying on trade at Biggleswade, and it was there I became acquainted with him—that is four or five years ago—I am not aware that he has ever carried on business in London—I do not know what he was at the time the transaction took place—I think he was in business in the country—I know he had come to town that day from the country—I am not positive whether he is in business now or not—he has been in business at Wellingborough—I believe he was in business there then—I had not seen him some time before that day—I saw him after for a few minutes on Saturday the 12th—I do not know whether I saw him again pre<lb></lb>vious to the following Saturday or not—I am not certain—I saw him I know on the following Saturday, on the Saturday evening after my first examination before the Magistrate—that was Saturday the 19th—whether I had seen him or not between the 12th and 19th, I do not know—I am not certain—I think I had seen him in that week, but I cannot say how many times—I do not think I had seen him three times—I will</p>

               <p>not swear I had not seen him five times, but I do not think I saw him more than once or twice—I did not see him five times in that week—I will not swear I did not see him three times—he was first examined on Saturday, the 26th, I think—I cannot say how many times I saw him between Saturday the 19th and the 26th—I do not think more than once—I swear I did not see him five times in that week—I never saw him five times in London in one week since I have known him—I saw him on the Saturday night after my first examina<lb></lb>tion—I am not certain that I saw him again on the Wednesday, but I think I did—I will not swear that I did not see him more than once be<lb></lb>tween the two Saturdays, nor that I did not see him three times—I saw him in the office on the Saturday morning before I was examined the se<lb></lb>cond time—I did not see him at any time but at the office—I met him in the office—that was the first time I saw him that day—I never talked to him about my examination before the Magistrate—I told him I had been examined—I did not tell him what I had said—I mean to swear positively I never entered into a minute detail of what I said before the Magistrate—it is possible I might have told him part of it by way of conversation—it is possible I might tell him—I will not swear I did not—I believe I told him I had had an investigation, and I partly perhaps told him—it would naturally suggest itself to tell him what had taken place, as he had to ap<lb></lb>pear, but my evidence I did not tell him, but it appeared on the Monday in the "Times," so that if he wanted to get at it he could have it—I told him he had to appear on the next Saturday, which was my commission from the bench—I told him I had been examined about the person coming into the shop, and I dare say I told him I had fixed on an individual, but I am not positive—I have some doubt about it, or I should be positive—I told him a person was produced—I do not know that I said he was ser<lb></lb>vant to Mr. Porter—I will not swear I did not—I do not know that I told him the description I had given of the person—I will not swear that I did not, to the best of my recollection, I did not—I did not tell him about the stock and pin—nothing passed about them at that time—that was on Saturday the 19th of October, the first time I was examined—I will swear that I did not speak to him about the black stock before he was ex<lb></lb>amined—I never named to him about the stock previous to his first ex<lb></lb>amination, I swear that—I do not know whether Britton identified him by the stock—I saw Britton in the office before be was examined—I had not then seen the prisoner that day—I saw the prisoner before Britton was examined, because I saw him at the time of my own examination, which was before Britton's—Britton saw the prisoner in my presence before he went into the box—I did not talk with him at that time on this subject—not a word about him—not a word about identifying the man—I am not aware that I spoke about the union pin to Britton previous to his ex<lb></lb>amination—I do not think I did—I will not swear I did not—I will swear I did not speak to him, certainly not any thing about the stock, nor yet the pin, that I feel quite positive of—I did not say a word to him about the stock and pin before his first examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, but am not in business at the present time. On the 9th of October last I was residing at No. 3, Liver-pool-road, Islington—I am a friend of Pierce's—on Wednesday evening, the 9th of October, I went to Mr. Chubb's—I was there twice that evening—I was there between half-past six and seven o'clock—while I was there the prisoner came in—Pierce was there at the time—he walked in—he had a cash-box in his hand—he addressed himself to Pierce—I was near enough to hear what was said, and attended to it—he was conversing with Pierce about five minutes, during which time I had a full opportunity of seeing his features—the prisoner first asked Pierce to unlock the box—Pierce asked him if he had lost the key—on finding he had, he said it was part of the excellency of the patent that they professed, not to make two locks alike—on which the prisoner requested him to break it open—I believe the next question was, Pearce asking him if he was the owner—the prisoner answered in the negative—Pearce said he could not break it open without a written order from the owner—on which the prisoner said, that would be very inconvenient, or words to that effect, as he had come some short distance, and that he had to make a payment out of the box, and he should have to return, to get the written order—the remark that particularly drew my attention was the prisoner's saying he saw the position to be right which Pierce took, m refusing to open the box—Pierce said, "We have rather more discernment"—the prisoner said, "You misunderstand me; I say, the position you have taken I see to be right"—Pierce said he would do so, on reflection, or words to that effect—the prisoner offered to leave the box till he got the written order—Pierce had the box in his hand—the prisoner came towards me, and before he got within a yard of me he said, as the box would have to be opened he would take it with him, and he returned and took it with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever seen a man named Dixon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person who said his name was Dixon—I first saw him at one of the examinations at High-street—I never saw him at Mr. Chubb's shop—he is not at all like the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you knew Pierce before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not tell him I was carrying on business when I was in town—I did not tell him I was carrying on business in the country while I was in town—I was not carrying on business at that time at Wel<lb></lb>lingborough</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160055"></xptr>
               <p>—I was not in business then, nor am I now—I have not left town from time to time since this, to attend to business of my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told Pierce, did you not, that yon were out of employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I told him that evening particularly—while I was in town he knew I was out of business—I do not say I told him particularly that evening that I had relinquished business—I have known Pierce about three or four years—I knew him at Biggleswade—I have seen him since then at Dean's, in Monument-yard—I relinquished business towards the latter end of September—I have carried on all branches of a country chemist and druggist's business—I have not been any thing immediately unconnected with the business—I attached the grocery business at Wel<lb></lb>lingborough, in connexion with the druggist's—I gave up business at Wellingborough about the latter end of September—I did not carry on the business of a grocer at that time—I cannot say exactly when I gave up the grocery business—I have been unfortunate—I never took the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I have never been a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you compounded with the creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what composition will be offered—it depends on the sale of private property—I have not paid my debts yet—I have called my creditors together—they have been informed as to the condition I was placed in—there was never a meeting at which I met them—a solicitor was sent to them—I assigned my property to trustees for the benefit of the creditors about the latter end of September—Wellingborough is about twenty-one miles from Biggleswade—I gave up business at Biggleswade three years last June—I was not un<lb></lb>fortunate there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why give it up if you were thriving there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a differ<lb></lb>ence between unfortunate and thriving—I gave it up because I thought I could better myself where I was surrounded by my own relatives—I have been at Wellingborough about three years last June—I sold tea there—I did not act as a doctor—I did not visit patients—I do not know that Pierce knew where I lived when I was in town—he knows where I reside now—he has not been to see me since I have been in town this time—whether he has called when I was out I do not know—I saw him on the night of the 19th of October, the night of his examination, at Mr. Chubb's, in St. Paul's Churchyard—he told me he bad been to give information concerning the presentation of the cash-box there—he related to me what passed before the Magistrate, but not before he had asked me questions—I do not know that he told me word for word what passed before the Magistrate—he gave me some account of his information—this was some time on the Saturday even<lb></lb>ing—I occasionally called to see him at Mr. Chubb's while I was in town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on the Wednesday when you say you saw the prisoner, did you notice what stock he had on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether it was a stock or neck-handkerchief—to the best of my recollection it had long ends, but I will not swear whether it was a stock or handkerchief, or whe<lb></lb>ther they were long or short ends—I will not swear I did not catch my eye on part of his shirt, and I will not swear that I did—I will not swear to any thing of the kind—it was a dark neck-handkerchief—I will not swear whether there was any union pin in it or not—he stood opposite the lamp, and near the lamp at times—he walked about a pace or two, back<lb></lb>wards and forwards—he did not stand exactly opposite the lamp all the time—he was near to it at some times—I will not swear it was near him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160056"></xptr>
               <p>all the while he was showing the box—it might be at some time—it was nearly opposite to his face at the time he was talking to Pierce about the box—it might be exactly opposite at some time—to the best of my belief I think it was at some time—while he was looking Pierce in the face it was not behind him—if he turned his back to it it was behind him—the best part of the conversation I should say he was looking Pierce in the face, not exactly staring him in the face, but as one man would look at another during conversation—the lamp was very near him then—it was not exactly opposite him as I know of all the time—to the best of my recollection the lamp was placed on the counter—the prisoner stood during the best part of the time near the lamp—at some part of the conversation it might be he was before the lamp looking Pierce direct in the face—at another time he might be looking at another part of the shop, not exactly at Pierce—to the best of my recollection the lamp was between him and Pierce—it was on the counter, against the desk—I think it was a gas light—I cannot say whether it was fixed or moveable—I believe it was a fixed gas light, but 1 will not swear it—Pierce was on one side the counter, the gas light on the counter, and the prisoner on the other side—to the best of my recollection that was the position of it—the light was between Pierce and the prisoner—it was between them some part of the time—he did not stand in one position the whole time—he moved a few paces nearer to me—I think the lamp was higher than this one—(<hi rend="italic">one fixed in the Court</hi>)—to the best of my recollection it was higher than this from the counter—I should say it was six inches higher than this from the counter—I was there when the person came in with the cash-box in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he go straight up to Pierce with the cash-box in his hand to ask him to fit a key to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he put the cash-box exactly in Pierce's hand, he might have laid it on the counter—Pierce was standing at the counter—he addressed himself first to Pierce—he asked him to unlock it—the question was to open the box—he gave an intima<lb></lb>tion to unlock it by a key, not to break it open—I will not swear whether it was to fit a key, or to unlock it—I am sure he meant to unlock it, not to break it open—he was there two or three, or three or four minutes, perhaps, before he said he would leave it and go and get an authority—Pierce then took the box towards the end of the counter, and, at the request of the person who brought it he gave it back—I was sitting down all the. time—he took it out of the door with him—this was on Wednesday—I next saw Pierce on the following Saturday, the 12th, at Mr. Chubb's shop—I was going to Isling<lb></lb>ton at the time—I mean the Saturday immediately following the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him between that Saturday and the next? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection I did—I think not more than once—it might be twice—I am not prepared to swear whether it was once or twice—I do not think it was more than twice, but I will not swear it—be was examined on Saturday the 19th, and again on Saturday the 25th—I saw him I think three times between those two Saturdays—I called for him, to the best of my recollection, on Monday night, and walked with him nearly to his lodging, to the best of my recollection—I cannot say where his residence is exactly—it is in Hoxton I believe—it is called Hoxton—it is near the new church, Hoxton, I believe—it is not three or four miles from Mr. Chubb's—it is perhaps about twenty minutes or half-an-hour's walk—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160057"></xptr>
               <p>did not see him on Tuesday or Wednesday—to the best of my recollection the next time I saw him after Monday night was Thursday morning—I cannot swear I did not see him on Wednesday—I could almost swear it—I saw him on Thursday rooming, at Mr. Chubb's, but not for five minutes—I did not walk out with him then—I did not see him on Friday—I met him on Saturday, at High-street, Marylebone—I think we met in High-street, or whether we met in the office I do not know—we met at the appointed time of meeting, on the Saturday—that was not the first time I saw the prisoner after this transaction—I had seen him between the time of the transaction and the time I saw him at the office, at Mr. Porter's shop, in Quebec-street—I was not taken there to identify him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you happen to go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went on purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On purpose to see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To see him—I did not know it was him—I had heard from Pierce that it was a servant of Mr. Porter's that was charged, but I did not know I should see the prisoner—I went to see if, according to my own opinion, it was the person who presented the cash-box—to the best of my recollection it was on the Tuesday morning fol<lb></lb>lowing, the 19th of October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pierce had told you, had he not, that he had sworn to a servant of Mr. Porter's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had not sworn to him I believe then—I think he told me he had not sworn to him—he was to see him again—he told me on Saturday night that the case was adjourned till the following Saturday—he told me he had not sworn to him—be did net tell me any particular reason for that—I should imagine it was because he was not confident it was him—I do not know—I don't think I saw Pierce on the Tuesday I went to Mr. Porter's—it was on Monday evening I saw him, and walked with him to Hoxton, and next morning, I went to Mr. Porter's—Pierce did not tell me to go there—I did not tell him I should go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know where Mr. Porter lived, did Pierce tell you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the hand-bills and placards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward offered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the hand-bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the hand-bills offering the reward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And then you knew where Mr. Porter lived—that told you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, it was printed on it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you walked partly home with Pierce on this Monday, had you a little conversation about what took place on the Saturday; did you talk with him about the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been mentioned, but very slightly—I saw the placards on the Saturday night, at the time Pierce was talking to me about it—Pierce showed it to me—I did not tell Pierce whether I would or would not go to look after the person—not a word passed between me and Pierce about my going to Mr. Porter's—I cannot recollect whether I told him I had been there before I went before the Magistrate or not—I swear I do not remember whether I did or not on the Thursday when I called on him—I do not remember whether or not I told him I had been to Mr. Porter's or had seen the person—I never told the police officers I had done so—I told my cousin who was with me at the time—his name is Glenn—he lives at No. 3, Liverpool-road—he is the person I have been with since I have been in town—Pierce knows him—he has seen him—he is not intimately acquainted with him—he knows him by sight, and has had a few words conversation with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you first see the prisoner on the examination on Saturday the 26th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection, in the outer office—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160058"></xptr>
               <p>satisfied in my own mind he was the man—I had no one with me then to point him out to—the police officers were not with me—I did not see them to my knowledge—they were not in the room where I was—there were police officers waiting about the Court, but to my knowledge neither Tedman or Seal, who are connected with this affair, were there—Pierce was not with me in the outer office—I cannot recollect whether we passed through the outer to the inner office, or whether we went in at the private entrance—I am not prepared to say now—I saw the prisoner first in the outer office—I did not go into the inner office directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you meet Pierce in High-street, and go together into the outer office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at the time I first saw the prisoner—I think I had been in the office before I saw the prisoner—I do not know whether he was there before me—the office was nearly full—I cannot say whether I had been inside and came out again, or not, but the first time I saw him was in the outer office—I do not think Pierce was with me in the outer office at all—I will not swear it—to the best of my recollection, as I said before, we did meet in High-street, but he was not with me at the time I first saw the prisoner—I do not know that I pointed him out at all—I had no one to point him out to—I did not point him out to Pierce, or to any one else, to the best of my recollection—I did not point him out to the officers, or any one else—I did not point out that I knew him—I cannot say whether 1 ever told Pierce I had been to Mr. Porter's or not—I might have told him since—I think I have told him—I cannot swear it—the strong impression of my mind is that I have, but I will not swear it—I will not swear whether I ever did or not, because I am not certain—to the best of my recollection I never told any policeman that I had been there—I believe my cousin who went with me is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever tell any body else that you went to Mr. Porter's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the conversation took place where I live, and I told them of course—my cousin and his wife—to the best of my recollection I did not tell any of the policemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to Mr. Porter's with your cousin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I did not see the prisoner there the first time—I went again about half-an-hour after, and the prisoner was then there—he was in his working dress in the shop, not alone—I think Henry Porter and another person were with him when I saw him in the shop—I was persuaded he was the man who presented the cash-box—I went to High-street police office on the following Saturday, and again saw the prisoner in the outer office—the office was nearly full of persons—he was dressed quite different then to when I saw him on Tuesday, but I recognised him—I was positive to the fact—when he came with the cash-box he had on a dark dress-coat, I think they call it, and dark trowsers—I think the coat was black—at all events it was very dark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In respect to the coat, was he dressed the same as the prisoner was on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear to a shade or two, but it was dark—I believe the lamp in Mr. Chubb's shop is at the end of the counter towards the bottom of the shop, but the height I cannot say—Pierce was near the lamp—I have not a distinct recollection of the height of it from the counter—the shop was light at the time the man came in—when he left the cash-box with Pierce, he came, I should say, within a pace or two of where I was sitting, which was at the top of the counter in front of the shop against the door—I went into Bedfordshire after I was examined on the Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183912160059"></xptr>
               <p>—the first time I arrived in town I did not come direct from Welling<lb></lb>borough—I came up on the Wednesday morning, the very day the cash-box was presented.</p>

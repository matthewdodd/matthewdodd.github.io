               <p>Do you know why he went out? - No, he did not give me any reason, and while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070066"></xptr> he was gone the other prisoner White went out, and went to the next public house; when they came into the shop, there were prints laying and some linen handkerchiefs at the top of them, I did not know how many were there, I did not find any missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt Prisoner's Counsel. Are there two doors to the shop? - There is the door in the street and the door into the house.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About two.</p>
               <p>A great many people were passing and repassing? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was called down by the boy to serve these women, as I was coming down stairs, I observed two women in the shop stand nearly close together, and before I got quite down I observed one of the two go out of the shop in a hurry, when I got quite down in the shop I observed one woman that I left behind, which is White, I recollected her face, and I suspected the woman that was gone out, that was Smith, I went out immediately after her, I saw her running away, and I caught her and told her I wanted her, and she said she was sure I could not want her, I said I was sure I did, she was very unwilling to come back with me, but I pulled her away, and when I pulled her away there lay this dozen of handkerchiefs down at the side of her, on that side that I pulled her from in the mud, I picked them up, they are my masters property, they have been in my possession ever since, here is a private mark which I think is my own hand writing, but I cannot say for certain.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilcox. Do you know what those handkerchiefs were that were laying on the counter? - Yes, these are the very handkerchiefs, the other shopman told me to put them away, and I was going to put them away, and I saw these two women coming in again, for he had before told me to take care of these women therefore I called him down.</p>

               <p>Have you any more of that pattern? - Yes, more, but not so great a quantity.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of them but from their general appearance? - I saw these very handkerchiefs on the counter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Brown. You followed the two prisoners out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a croud about her when you took her? - To the best of my remembrance there were two men, in her hurry she was getting through them, the first I saw of the handkerchiefs was on the ground.</p>
               <p>You did not see from whom they came? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is not your shop mark a common mark? - Yes, all that cost us that price.</p>
               <p>Other pieces of goods have had that mark? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you sold many of these handkerchiefs? - No, I had not.</p>

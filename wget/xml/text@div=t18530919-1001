                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and I also keep the White Horse public house at North Ockendon, Essex; I have a little land. On Thursday 7th July, I purchased some poled Scotch heifers for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Watson, in Gravesend cattle market—I employed the prisoner to take them by train to Woolwich, and drive them to save expence from there to Smithfield to Messrs. Wolton and Eve, salesmen, to whom I had employed him to take cattle on former occasions—I did not see the prisoner again till next evening Friday the 8th about 5 o'clock, when he came to my house at North Ockendon—I asked him whether the heifers were sold—he said, No George, there is wonderful bad trade as you will see by the paper; I had them turned out on Plaistow Marshes, I was only offered 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—I said, "It is very foolish of you, Thomas; they will waste like dew, being stall fed"—he said, "They will not hurt, they will be all right; they will go to Smithfield again on Monday"—I saw no more of him till the following Wednesday at Romford market; I then said, "Are the heifers sold, Thomas?"—he said, "They were sold on Monday, and your money lies at Mr. Pocklington's"—that is a Smithfield banker, I do not keep an account there—I asked him who 1 was to apply to for it, he said, "Playford"—I said, "I thought I</p>

               <p>told you to take them to Wolton and Eve; "he said, "Oh, Play ford is a very good salesman"—I had given him no authority to sell them himself, he was to take them to Wolton and Eve, and take his money at the book as he bad done before—I have never seen the beasts since or the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you when you gave the heifers up to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Three Crowns, at Gravesend—I was drinking there; it is no use to go there without you do drink—I drank a little wine, and what I drank I paid for—I know a man named Cumbers too well—he was with me, and rode home with me by my invitation, and if I was to see you, I should give you a ride—I dare say I might drink half a pint of wine that day, that is as much as I did; a bottle would not hurt me much—I did not drink two or three bottles of wine myself—I had been drinking part of two or three bottles of wine with Cumbers and other men, which I paid for—I was perfectly sober; that I swear—I am generally sober, I have not been drunk for some years—I gave Cumbers the money to pay for the beasts; he did not buy them—he has not bought beasts for me before; I have advanced him money to buy for himself, and have had neither interest or principal—Cumbers and I were never in partnership for the sale of beasts—he has sold beasts for me, but I never had the money—the heifers were sold on 8th July, and I saw the prisoner on the following day, and on the Wednesday also—I gave him into custody on a Monday—I cannot say when I saw him after the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between that Wednesday when you saw him the second time, and the time you gave him into custody, how often did you see him at Romford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several times at Romford and elsewhere—I cannot say whether I saw him as much as twenty times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He knew you did not bank at Pocklington's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That made no difference; I went there on the Thursday after the Wednesday that I saw him—I did not find my money there, or else I should not have troubled you here—I did not give him into custody between the 7th or 8th July and 15th Aug., when I saw him, because I always give a man lenity; that was my reason; I always consider a man's wife and family—he had not told me he had sold the heifers and paid the money to Cumbers; he told me he did not know what had become of him—Cumbers did not come to me and tell me that the prisoner had paid him the money; I deny it—Cumbers did not come to me at Romford, and tell me that the prisoner had paid him the money, he used very bad language to me on the Wednesday; both of them did—that was because I asked them for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you ask them for the money when he had told you it was at Pocklington's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was well aware that he was telling me an untruth; they used language unfit to mention in Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you ask Cumbers for the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly, both of them; Cumbers had nothing to do with me whatever; I did not ask him for the money, I asked Haydon, and Cumbers said, "Go away with you," and I asked him about some sheep on the marsh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask Cumbers where the money was, and did not he tell you he had got it, and he should keep it till there was a settlement of accounts between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I swear he said no such thing—the sheep on the marsh was not a joint transaction between me and Cumbers; he said there were five turned out, he had taken some to London, and brought me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, that was all, and there were five sheep left, which cost me 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had not bought some lambs and sheep between us—they were not the same sheep—I never in ray life agreed to go into partnership with Cumbers for the pur<lb></lb>chase</p>

               <p>and sale of beasts, nor were these heifers purchased on that footing—Cumbers never at any time asked me for a settlement of accounts; I have asked him many times; I want a great deal of money of him—he claims 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think of me; I have got his bill—he does not claim money of me on the partnership transaction, there never was one, and I never received a shilling of him in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say, when he asked you for a settlement, that you knew two or three lawyers, and would give them a job? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never asked me—I swear the prisoner did not tell me, on the Wednesday, in Romford, market, that Cumbers had got the money—Cumbers has not come to my house several times for the purpose of getting a settlement—I keep a public house—I mean to say I have got a license from the Magistrates—I have got a license so far as I sell spirits—I hold a license now—it has not been taken away by the Magistrates exactly—it has been suspended for a month—I am not obliged to answer such questions as when it was suspended—I am not ashamed of the matter, there is nothing to be ashamed of—it is only suspended, that is all—no Magistrates have taken it away for bad conduct—I was before the Magistrates on the licensing day—I have never in my life been summoned for anything improper; I mean to represent that—I have never been summoned for having disorderly and improper people in my house—I never served liquors on a Sunday—I was summoned for beer; one Sunday I gave a barber a pint of beer who shaved me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you tell those gentlemen just now you never were summoned before a Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never was; I was here; yesterday was the day I was summoned, but I did not attend because I was here—I have never been summoned before for serving liquors on a Sunday—I was summoned to attend yesterday, and that was the first time, I swear it, for these thirty years and more, I might say.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a good deal of money owing to you by Cumbers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was never any partnership between us, no farther than if I chose to give him anything—he had nothing whatever to do with the heifers; I bought them, paid for them, and employed the prisoner—had he kept the profit, it would not have mattered; I mean I should not have thought so much of it; but he kept the principal—if there were a settlement of accounts, I should not owe Cumbers any money—I owe him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he owes me 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., besides two cows and five sheep—I have been about thirty years a publican, and was never summoned till yesterday, nor my father before me—I bought the heifers of Watson.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Romford, in Essex—I have been engaged in cattle driving fifteen years, ever since I was twelve years old—I have a brother at Romford; he is a drover and dealer, and so am I—I have known Mr. Clark five or six years—he has known me as a drover and dealer in cattle occasionally—I have been in a sort of partnership with him ever since 10th March last, the nature of which was buying and selling; buying together and dividing the profits—there was no deed—it was a verbal arrangement—it was made coming from Tilbury-fort Market—I told him I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said he had 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lying doing nothing, and we went on dealing together—Mr. Clark kept a public house; it is a beer shop now; he has lost his license—I consider myself a judge of cattle—I used to buy all the cattle, at least Mr. Clark used to come and take my opinion before he bought; but he bought very few—the first market we attended was Salisbury; we travelled together—we bought twenty-six beasts there—the next was Romsey fair, where Haydon was with us—Haydon was aware we were in partnership, we both told him so, and we agreed to give him five shillings a day and his travelling expenses—we bought eight beasts and a cart at Romsey market—we have been at other fairs, and have purchased altogether 172 beasts—Mr. Clark took me to look at these beasts in Gravesend market—there was some dispute about the price, but ultimately I was of opinion that they were worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I <hi rend="italic">laid</hi> them at 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece—(they were sold at Smith field at 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. profit)—I received the money from Mr. Clark to pay for them, and I paid the money myself to Watson, at the Three Crowns—Mr. Clark had been drinking very freely that day—I have seen him frequently drinking freely—there was also a transaction that day of eight lambs and a sheep; Mr. Clark paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards them, and I paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I directed a man named Tollust to take the whole lot together, sheep and beasts, to the railroad, and load them—Mr. dark told me he should want me to go home with him that afternoon, because Haydon was going up the water, and I went home with Mr. Clark—he told me if I was not up soon enough by the mail train in the morning, that Haydon was to sell the heifers—there was an object in getting up early; there are better buyers between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, and</p>

               <p>I told John Young, a drover, in Mr. Clark's presence, to tell my brother that there were five heifers coming by the rail, and he was to send for them, and if I was not up in time enough in the morning, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Hay don was to sell them—Clark heard that message; we were all sitting together—I think there were seven or eight bottles of wine ordered by Mr. Clark; there were four or five persons partook of it—I did not get up to Smithfield till between 9 and 10 o'clock that morning—I saw the prisoner; he told me he had sold the beasts, and at 12 o'clock in the day he gave me the money, 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was on Friday, 8th July—I saw Mr. Clark again on the Saturday; be asked me what had been done with the heifers? I said, "Did not <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> tellyouwhen he came home with his horse last night?" he said "No; I was so drunk, I do not know what he said"—this was the very next day after they were sold—on that same Saturday morning, I asked Mr. Clark to come to a settlement, and pulled my book out—he said he was so very busy he could not settle to day, I must call again another day—I had had no settlement with him since we began, on 10th March—I have applied to him for a settlement—I have been at his house five or six different days, and waited all day for a settlement—on this Saturday I stayed at his house till 2 o'clock, and then went to Mr. Cocks to look at some sheep, but did not buy them, and coming back I told Mr. Clark I should keep the money till he came to a settlement; he said he should see all about that on the Wednesday—on the Wednesday I met him again at Romford market; Haydon was with me—Mr. Clark asked for the money; I said I would not deliver it up till he came to some settlement—there was a quarrel—he said he had got two lawyers who wanted a job, and he should set them to work—after that, some stranger called on roe from him; I do not know who he was—he asked me what I knew about the heifers—there was a quarrel and strong language on that occasion between Clark and me, and a lot of people came about—I have seen Clark since, and so has Haydon—he never gave Haydon into custody till 15th August—Clark never came near me after we fell out, but I saw him afterwards at the fairs for four or five weeks—when I have asked for the accounts, he has asked me to bring my book, and I brought it—I am still willing to come to a settlement—I claim money from him.</p>

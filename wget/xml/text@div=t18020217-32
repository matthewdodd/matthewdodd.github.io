            For what time? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person365">A. </persName>
            Between three and four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge with you on the 9th of February? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he quit his lodging? - A. He did not quit it at all: On Friday, the 5th, I went up stairs into my club-room, and found him sitting there with the door shut; I asked him what business he had there, that was not his place, that his place was up stairs, in his own apartment, in the room where he lodged; he was counting some half-pence and penny-pieces, but what quantity I don't know, or whose they were I don't know; he went up to his own room, and I imagine he staid there a quarter of an hour, when he came into the taproom, and went out, and I never saw him till he was apprehended for the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you apprehend him? - A. The 9th, the Tuesday morning; when I came down stairs at seven o'clock that morning to open my house, I went to open the back window, and found some papers lying on the ground that had not a right to be there; I then looked into a cupboard where there was a bag with between thirty and forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room was it you saw the papers on the ground? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person366">A. </persName>
            In the bar; I observed the cupboard forced open by the tongs, which lay on the floor, much bent, and a broken knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from the appearance of the tongs that you judged they had been used? - A. They lay on the floor, and there was a broken knife and another knife lying altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you observe the cupboard to the broke open? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person367">A. </persName>
            Forced open at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss? - A. I missed the bag, which was of old canvas, in which the property was put the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it? - A. I had given change the night before; I put it in, and locked it up, and had the keys in my pocket the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put into it? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person368">A. </persName>
            I cannot swear to a guinea or two; there were bank-notes of one or two pounds, half-guineas, seven-shilling pieces, guineas, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I cannot describe them particularly, but altogether to the amount of thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag left or taken away? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person369">A. </persName>
            They were all taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - A. I looked at the back part of the bar, and found a pane of glass broke, where the prisoner had entered into the bar; the leaden casement window was unbolted, and opened.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020217-32-person370">Q. </persName>
            Suppose the casement open, was there room for a man to get in? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person371">A. </persName>
            Plenty of room; I went up to my wife, and told her, and in the course of the morning I went up to the office, and inquired of the officers; they came with me, and saw the situation of the place; they then went to apprehend the prisoner; we found him at the Marquis of Granby, in the Almonry, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find him there? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person372">A. </persName>
            About the hour of twelve o'clock, it might be a quarter or twenty minutes after; I cannot say to five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020217-32-person373">Q. </persName>
            What did you find? - A. There were two half-guineas, two seven-shilling pieces, two half-crowns, five shillings, seven six-pences, three pennyworth of halfpence, a silver watch, and the canvas bag, which I have sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bank-notes? - A. There were three two-pound notes, a one-pound note, and six guineas, lodged in the hands of the landlady of the house where he was drinking; she delivered them up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to any of the money? - A. I cannot say; I can only speak to the crooked half-guinea, I think I can swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. At twelve o'clock; I was up last.</p>

               <p>Q. Was all fastened? - A. Yes, it was all fastened; and, when I went to bed, the pane of glass was safe, the window bolted, and the cupboard locked up, with the keys in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JAMES sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing about the robbery? - A. I know the bag was my property before I was married.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your bag? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-32-person374">A. </persName>
            Because I cut the bottom out, turned it up, and darned it with red thread.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the watch at that time? - A. Yes; he said he gave three pounds for it that morning; it was silver watch with a steel chain.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take so much notice of it as to know it again? - A. No; he only pulled it out, and said he had given three pounds for it at Mr. Wright's; the one pound note, the three two pound notes, and the six guineas, I wrapped up directly and put in a bag with my own money, but so that it should not mix.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bag? - A. I did not examine his bag; I don't know what was in it.</p>

            (To James.) How was the window fastened? - A. It was fastened when I went to bed.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020217-32-person397">Q. </persName>
            Could any person who was drunk have got in there? - A. Yes; because there is a small ledge under the window, and feats round the bar, where we usually sit.</p>
               <p>

               <p>

            Then you suppose, that by stepping on those tiles, a man might get into the window? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I beg to have the watch, and my own property; the purse I found at the end of Great Tothil-street.</p>
               <p>Bly. When I asked the prisoner how he came by the purse, he said he had had it above two years; I asked him when I searched him, and on the examination he was still in the same story.</p>

On the evening of 14th March, 1851, about 10 o'clock, I was at the bar—in consequence of a noise that I heard I sent the potboy up stairs, and my husband went for a policeman; my husband is now dead—when the policeman came, I went up stairs—I found my drawers had been pushed open; they had been locked that morning, because I had put some of the spoons away—I missed all my spoons, I should think about twenty-four, a medal, punch ladle, and other things, and some money; my husband said there was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had not the handling of it—I did not see it there—when I went up, the window was open—I had passed the window at 6 o'clock in the evening, and had fastened it myself—a person of the name of Ellis was taken at that time—I appeared against him find gave evidence, and he was transported.

                  </hi>. In March, 1851, I was potboy at the Blue Anchor. On 14th March, about 10 o'clock at night, I was sent up stairs by my mistress to what we called the middle room—I went to the window; it was closed—I saw two pairs of legs under the bedstead—I ran to the door, shut it, and called for assistance—when assistance was coming, I went in the room, and saw the backs of two persons getting out of the window; I am quite certain there were two persons, because I saw four legs.</p>

On 14th March, 1851, about half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with George Ellis within about 200 yards of that house—they were in deep</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you a memorandum of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a memorandum; I have not it here, and I assisted in taking Ellis, I believe about 1 o'clock in the morning, at his own home—I know that the prisoner lived at that time in the parish of Bow—it was on a Friday, I am quite sure, and on 14th March, 1851—it was in a public road that I saw the prisoner and Ellis, in the high road, where a good many persons pass—there were no other persons there at that time; no one was in sight, only them two and me—I bad not passed any persons for two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, the same evening, apprehend Ellis, and go before the Magistrate the next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes</p>

                  </hi>. I remember 14th March, 1851; it was on a Friday. I was passing the Blue Anchor between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—I heard the people halloo in the street, and a man pointed up to a window—I looked up, and saw the prisoner and another man get out—I was about two yards from the window; I walked up, and might have put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder if I had known what was the matter at the time—I had known the prisoner for some time; I used to go to the same school with him—I could not be mistaken in him—it was a beautiful moonlight night; it shone right on the window—when they got out they ran along the leads, and jumped from there to the tiles, from there to the gate, and jumped down—when they got from the gate to the ground, I walked up, and might have put my hand on the prisoner—the other man was George Ellis; I knew him well before—I did not know where the prisoner lived at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were so near you could have put your hand on them, if you had known there had been a robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw the two men come out of the window, run along the leads and on the tiles, and on the gate, and jump down and run away—I did not know what it was—a man came out of the house and pointed to the window; he did not say anything—I did not think there was a robbery—I did not know what the people were screaming and calling about; I thought there was a fight, or something—I did not give it a thought—I did not know that there was some robbery—I was passing the house in going home—I knew Ellis; he lived in Amwell-street, the first house on the left hand side—he used to work at Tucker's factory—I believe at that time he had nothing to do; he might have been out of work for six months—I had seen a good deal of him during that time—I was at that time working at a distiller's, at Bromley—I had worked three or four years before that time, sometimes three or four days in a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been examined before, and cross-examined—had you worked three years before that, or only two days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the week of the robbery I think I worked two days—when I did not get work I lived at home with my father and mother, and I do so still—I work now at Curry's and at Hughes'—they are both distillers—I only worked at the gas-works that day—I worked at the distillers three years before the robbery—I never was in any difficulty.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the same evidence before that you have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280065"></xptr>
               <p>to-day. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am quite positive beyond a doubt that the prisoner is the person who came out of the window—it did not strike me whether there was a robbery or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you seize the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were gone so quick—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner—when they came away there was a man came out of the house, and cried, "Stop thief!"—I ran after them, but could not catch them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this matter occurred, haveyouseen the prisoner in Whitechapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw him in Ratcliff-highway ten weeks ago last Saturday—he was with another person—I could not get near enough to him to take him—I have seen him several times since the robbery—I saw him at Hackney two or three times—I gave information to the constable each time I saw him—when I saw him ten weeks ago I expect he saw me, and he ran away too quick for me—I ran after him 200 or 300 yards—he went up the Commercial-road towards Whitechapel church—it was about half-past 10 o'clock in the day—I did not call police—there were not a great many people about—I spoke to a policeman, and he had seen him the day before in company with two more in the Commercial-road—I worked at the distillers for three years, two days a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not before stateyouhad been working with your father? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he worked there—the prisoner had a cap on, and a dark jacket—I do not think the name of this prisoner was mentioned on the former trial—I did not give information on the night of the robbery—I went home and went to bed—I did not see any constable that night—I knew there had been a robbery when the man came out—I did not go back to the Blue Anchor; I met my mother as I came back, and she persuaded me not to go—I mentioned the prisoner's name on the morning after the robbery to Mr. Gifford, when he came down to my house after me—I told him Who the other prisoner was—there was a handkerchief left by Ellis in the Blue Anchor, which led to his being taken—the officer found it with the plate tied in it—if the policeman bad not come to me I would not have given information—the policeman came to me because my brother was standing at the Blue Anchor door, and I told him I knew who they were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Presidents of the Lon<lb></lb>don district of the Post-office. The prisoner has been employed there about seven years—he was a letter-carrier in the Paddington district—on 22nd Jan. last, I made up three catch letters, addressed "Mr. C. Snewing, 3, Alpha<lb></lb>place, Regent's-park, London"—I enclosed in one of them a half-crown and two fourpenny-pieces, which I marked—I sealed it, and gave it to Mr. Cole, with instructions to post it with the other two—soon after that, I went to the interior of the Post-office, where I could see letters put into the box</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030019"></xptr>
               <p>from outside—I found this letter in the box—I took it out, and kept it till the next morning about seven o'clock, when I tied it up in a bundle of letters addressed to Paddington, the Portland-town district, in which Alpha-place is—the letters are conveyed there from the General Office by a mail-cart to Crawford-street—I saw the bundle placed in the bag, which was tied, sealed, and conveyed to the driver—it was despatched from the office about a quarter-past seven, and would be taken to Craw<lb></lb>ford-street, from whence it would be carried by a messenger, to the Portland office, Edgware-road—it would be the duty of the prisoner and the other letter-carriers of that district to sort the letters into walks for delivery—this letter ought to have been delivered in Alpha-place before half-past nine, at which time I called at Mr. Snewing's, and did not find it—I found the other two I had sent—I went on to the Paddington office with Mr. Cole, and Peak, the officer—the prisoner was not there—the other letter-carriers came in while I was there; about nine of them were searched without finding the letter—I did not allow any of them to leave, and the prisoner came there about a quarter to eleven—I said to him that there was a money-letter missing, that the others had been searched, and I must see the contents of his pockets—Peak began to search him, and I said, "The letter was addressed 'Mr. Snewing, 3, Alpha-place,' have you seen such a letter?"—he said, "No, I have not"—Peak took off his hat, lifted up the lining, and said, "Here is the letter, Sir"—I took it, and said, "This is my letter"—the prisoner said, "I took it out by mistake, and put it there that I might not forget it"—the seal was not broken then; it has been since, and I found in it the coins I placed there—Alpha<lb></lb>place was not in the prisoner's delivery—the carriers arrange their letters in streets before they leave the office—if a man found a letter not belong<lb></lb>ing to his walk, he should hand it over to the other—each man starts as soon as he has arranged his own letters—if the man in whose bundle a letter ought to be, was gone when it was found in another bundle, it would be handed over to the superior charge-taker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am charge-taker at Paddington; it was the prisoner's duty to deliver letters in Park-road, and Avenue-road, Regent's Park. On 23rd Jan. I received the Paddington mail-bag from the mail-driver—I conveyed it to Paddington myself—it was opened there—three bags were taken out of it, which contained letters for the Lira-road, Maida-hill, and Portland-town districts—the letter-carriers then sorted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030020"></xptr>
               <p>them—a letter addressed,"Mr. Snewing, Alpha-place," ought to have been sorted to Frederick Willis, who should have delivered it about nine o'clock, or a few minutes past—this letter may have passed into the prisoner's hands in sorting; if so, he should have handed it to Frederick Willis, and if Willis had gone, to put it on the desk for me—I imagine that he knew that to be his duty—it was against his duty to have taken that letter out of the office, if it had come to his hands—after the letters had been sorted to the carriers, they arrange them in streets, in order for delivery, before they leave the office—Alpha-place is about 250 yards from the prisoner's beat; and as it was so near, it would be his duty, if he had found this letter among his, to have delivered it on his return, and apologized for the delay—it would have been only about five yards out of his way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not mistakes of this kind often made in sorting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes; but I never allow the carriers to leave the office till all the letters are looked over—we have not a rule provided for the rectification of such mistakes—it would not have been regular for him to take it to the General Office—I have been at the Paddington office since Nov. 1849, and have heard nothing against his character—I have seen him daily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier in the Paddington district—Mr. Snewing's house is in my walk—I delivered letters there on the morning of the 23rd Jan.—I delivered all the letters that came into my possession.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your beat adjoins the prisoner's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am in the habit of sorting the letters in the office with the other carriers—it has happened that a letter for one district gets into the hands of a carrier of the adjoining district; in that case we have orders to deliver them as we return, if it is near our beat—if the letter-carrier is not gone to whom they belong, we should give it to him; but if he is gone, we are to put them on the desk of the charge-taker—twenty-seven carriers, I think, sort letters there altogether—I have known the prisoner two years and a half, and have seen him daily—I believe he has borne a very good character.</p>

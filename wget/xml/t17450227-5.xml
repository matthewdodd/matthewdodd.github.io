I went to seek after him, and found him behind Old Street Church wheeling of bricks: I charged him with stealing the wig, went with him to a publick house, and he delivered me the wig out of his pocket. I had some knowledge of him, he had been shaved there at different times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the shop to be shaved, I did not take the wig out of the shop with a design to cheat him of it, but out of a joke; and when he came to me, I delivered it to him again directly. Smith went to my wife, and agreed to take a guinea of her not to appear against me, and offered to let me go. I have a note [receipt] here to prove it.</p>

               <p>Smith. This is one Brown's writing, a gardner at Hoxton. Mr. Brown wanted me to make it up, and gave me half a crown, and I told him no such thing could be done - I have seen this paper before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Smith said he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Smith. I said if I could do the Prisoner any service, I would; but afterwards, when I had informed myself, I went to his wife, and told her I could not do it: I would have served him if I could, because he had a wife and two or three children. <rs id="t17450227-5-verdict23" type="verdictDescription">

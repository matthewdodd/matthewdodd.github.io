             CHOWN. I live near Wimbledon. I was passing through St. Paul's Church-yard, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and met three or four men, who I suspected. I turned round, and followed them five or six yards, I then saw three of them close upon Dr. Bollman, I am sure the prisoner was one of them. I saw they were picking his pocket, but could not see which hand did it; and at the same instant I saw one of them give the prisoner a pocket-book. I collared the prisoner and another, both struggled to get from me; the prisoner succeeded in getting away with the pocket-book. I let go of the other, and ran after him, and saw him throw the pocket-book over the rails. A person came up, and made a desperate effort to knock me down as I was pursuing the prisoner. He was secured before I lost sight of him, and I am sure he is one of them. I climbed over the rails, and got the pocket-book, which Dr. Bollman claimed.</p>

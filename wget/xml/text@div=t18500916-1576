                  </hi>. I live at 29, Queen-street, Stepney, and am a commission-agent. On 20th Aug., between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I passed down Whitechapel, and met the prisoner McCarthy—she asked me to treat her—she then asked me to go to a coffee-house, which I agreed to, and went with her to one in Somerset-street, Aldgate—I went with her to a room on the first-floor, where there was a bed—I was only there three or four minutes, when she asked me to stand treat, as she called it, and put her hand into my pocket, and took out all the gold money I had; it was five sovereigns—I said, "You have robbed me;" and she ran to the opposite side of the room—I opened the door, called for assistance, and I saw her put a sovereign into her mouth and swallow it—when I called, the prisoner Hailes was the first who came in, and I said, "This woman has robbed me;" and almost instantly she put her hand over my shoulder, and almost under my face, and I became insensible, and do not recollect anything afterwards—I was perfectly sober when I went into the house—I did not recover my senses till the next afternoon, to the best of my recollection between four and six o'clock, when I found myself at home—I lost five sovereigns out of my left waistcoat pocket, and two half-crowns, and seven shillings in silver, and a white pocket-handkerchief—I had a pocket-book, the papers in it were all disturbed, and apparently examined; my address was in it; I found it in my pocket when I was at home—I was very ill for four or five days—on the day after my recovery, I went with the policeman in search of the parties—we</p>

               <p>went to this house in Somerset-street—I saw Hailes there, and recognized her at once—I touched the police-officer, and said "That is the woman that belongs to the house:" I do not suppose she heard that—after some time, both the prisoners were taken into custody—I am quite certain they are the women.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you been that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Over in Surrey, near the Walworth-road—I had been there with Mr. Algar, to find a person who I supposed to be next heir to a person who had died at Norwich, and left considerable property—I had not been there the whole afternoon,—I met Mr. Algar at half-past six—in the previous part of the day I had been attending to my business as a commission-agent, travelling about in various parts of London, for various parties—I travel for Mr. Thomas, of Finch-lane; for Mr. Bradshaw, of Fleet-street, and various others, and on their business I was engaged the whole day—it was part of my business to travel for them as well as others—I had to collect advertisements for Mr. Thomas' works, as well as for those of Mr. Bradshaw—they emyloy me for that purpose, and pay me—Mr. Thomas never pays me, Mr. Eaton, his agent, does—Mr. Bradshaw leaves the management to persons in Fleet-street; they pay me the second or third of every month—I do not recollect exactly when Mr. Eaton last paid me—I should say it was about two months ago—this inquiry about the heir to some property was made at the request of a friend at Norwich; it was a family matter, not in the way of business—I was a clerk in the Huntingdon and Wisbeach Railway-office about two years ago—I think I was there about two years—I left because the Company was broken up—it does not now exist—it lasted longer than two years—I remained and wound up the affairs of the Company—I was connected with the Eastern Counties Railway four years—I left because Mr. Hudson brought a parcel of his own people there—the manager left, and a whole change took place—I have a testimonial from the Company, signed and sealed—this happened on a Tuesday evening—the prisoners were not taken till I think a fortnight after—I had not seen McCarthy before—I never was in the coffee-shop before—I looked out for the women every evening along the street where McCarthy met me—I was dressed as I am now when I first met her; and afterwards, that she should not know me, I put on a great coat and a cap, so that I appeared a different person—I walked up Aldgate two or three evenings like that—I did not take any other women during that time to the coffee-shop, or to any house—I did not accost any women and speak to any that were walking about—no woman spoke to me—I looked at every woman I met—the money was loose in my left waistcoat pocket; I had not had it with me all day—I got the five sovereigns from home in the afternoon, and had them with me from that time till I was accosted—I do not carry a purse—I put it into that pocket, because I thought it was more secure than my trowsers, and I buttoned up my coat—I am not more ready than you are to go to a coffee-house with a woman—I did not know McCarthy was a woman of the town when I went in with her—I cannot exactly say I did think she was virtuous—I did not believe her to be a woman of the town, nor did I go with her for that reason—she asked me to treat her to some gin—I said I would not go to any public-house—she said, "Here is a coffee-house that I know round here; a very respectable place;" and I went there, and went into a bedroom—I certainly believed that no woman of virtue would have gone with me—I am a married man—I have never been convicted—I was before a Magistrate once: I hap<lb></lb>pened to be drinking too much, and I was taken to the station for safety, I suppose: I was not fined for that, I was discharged—I have never been</p>

               <p>before a Magistrate on any other occasion—I have prosecuted parties here, as Mr. Ballantine knows—I do not think I was ever charged with anything before a Magistrate—I was never charged with ill-treating my wife or child—if you ask me these brutal questions I shall take another opportunity of replying to you—I never attempted to drown my child; I never heard of my being charged with such a thing: it is all a fabrication, I never did anything of the kind—I have one boy six years and a half old—when I went again to the coffee-house I was not certain about the room I had been in—I did not pay much attention to it—I was only there two or three minutes—there were two windows in the room I saw, I thought at first it had only one—I did not go to any other coffee-house—I understand there is another, called the Leopard, close by.</p>

I heard of the breaking open of Kew church about the latter end of April, and obtained information, which led me and sergeant Bennett to Tilby's house, 11, Great James'-street, Marylebone—I asked him for a tin box or case—he directed the servant to go with us; she went into a bed-room on the ground-floor and brought this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave me an account of where he got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop, 11, Great James-street, Lisson-grove—I know the prisoner—he gave me this box about three and a half years ago—I was passing his house, in Bell-street, Edgware-road, one morn<lb></lb>ing, between eight and one o'clock, and he tapped at the window, called me in, and had it in his hand—he was trying to push this lip down, and said, "Look here, George, is this any use to you?"—I said, "No, it will do very well for the child to play with"—he said, "Well, you can have it if you like"—I took it—he said, "I had this out of Kew Church; I had it out of an iron one, but that was too big, it was more weight than it was worth, and I was obliged to leave the b—thing behind"—I thought he was <hi rend="italic">romancing</hi>, I did not think he would rob a Church or anybody—it appeared as if it had been forced—he said it contained papers, I do not recollect the particulars—I took it home and gave it to my child—he said, "Don't go carrying it through the streets, you will have Sergeant Thompson seeing you with it"—I carried it openly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighty-two years of age, and have been fifty years parish clerk of Kew. On the Sunday of the robbery in 1845, I went into the robing-room at eleven o'clock, and found the iron chest, and also a box, which was kept in it, was gone—this produced is it—it was always locked-up in the chest—marriage licenses, and certificates of death were kept in it—it was kept locked—I have every reason to believe this is it—there was a key always tied to it with a little bit of string.</p>

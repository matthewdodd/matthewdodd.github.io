            . I recollect Billen coming to Smithfield. I got the six sheep at Hackney, from a man whose name I do not know, I went to Hackney for them, but I saw them first on Friday, in the possession of the prisoner at Smithfield - I do not know what became of them then. On the Monday following, Mr. Cox sent me to Hackney to fetch them, I brought them to Smithfield, and Billen took them from me. Tilby, the butcher, accompanied me to Hackney to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prisoner with them at Smithfield on Friday - A. Yes; I did not know him before, but am quite sure he is the man. He did not say they were his own. I do not think I can swear to the sheep. I can swear from the marks, that those I fetched from Hackney were the same that I saw at Smithfield. Tilby had the same sheep.</p>

            . I am constable of Hendon. On Wednesday after the Monday, I apprehended the prisoner at Winchmore-hill - he lived there. I took him to his own house, which is six or seven miles from Hendon. I went there about three o'clock in the morning with Mr. Wager, it was all shut up till about seven o'clock, when a young man opened the shutters. I enquired for the prisoner, and afterwards broke the door open, and found him sitting in the kitchen dressed in woman's clothes - this was between seven and eight o'clock. I had been refused admittance a good while. I did not know him, being in disguise. I went up stairs and saw his wife; I could not find him, but Wager called out, that he had caught him in woman's clothes. I had demanded admission, and told them I came to apprehend him for felony.</p>

            . I assisted in apprehending the prisoner. Austin went up stairs, I remained outside, and the prisoner came out having hold of his son's arm, dressed in woman's clothes, and a white handkerchief covered over his face - I did not know him at first - he passed me about fifty yards; when he came out he was crying, and when he got about the distance of fifty yards, I noticed his shoes, followed and laid hold of his arm, pulled the handkerchief from his face, and told him he must come back directly.</p>
               <p>MR. BILLEN. The sheep were worth about thirty-two shillings each.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I beg leave to state I am totally innocent of the crime, and humbly submit there is nothing to warrant a conviction, the only thing that materially affects me, is the sheep being found in my possession. On the 6th of July, I was going to Smithfield to buy some sheep, and on the road, about three o'clock in the morning, I overtook a man with nine, going to Romford market; after some conversation, he said he would sell them to me, I asked the price, he said 12 l. 10 s., which I agreed to give him, but was to have ten shillings returned, having paid for them, they were delivered to me, and the man left me, first saying that his name was Thoms, and he lived at Harrow; but on enquiry I find no such man lives there, nor have I been able to find him, or I would have had him here to-day. I then proceeded on and a butcher overtook me, and asked the price of three, I said 27 s. 6 d. each, which he agreed to give; paid for them and took them in his cart towards Tottenham. I brought the other six to Smithfield, put them in an open pen for sale for six hours, and the prosecutor often passed the pen, but took no notice of the sheep or myself, though I was personally known to him; at length a butcher came, and agreed for them at 28 s. each, saying he had not money enough to pay, but would meet me on Monday morning, at six o'clock, on the Kingsland-road, at the bridge, and pay for them. I took them there, did not see him, and went on to Smithfield, and did not meet him till I got there; he said I have been after you, but believe I went to the wrong bridge, and asked if I had got them; we went to Kingsland and he took them away. I humbly trust I have accounted for how I became possessed of them, and that you will think there is nothing improbable in this. I declare I was totally ignorant of their being stolen, or I would not have stood openly with them in the face of day. Had I stolen them, I should have been more guarded and circumspect, and not have stood six hours in the public market with them, nor have consented to take them home, and wait till market-day for the butcher to bring the money, but have disposed of them at any price. I have been in the habit of attending Smithfield market, and am well known there. I beg to state that the prosecutor lives at Hendon, six miles from where I bought the sheep, and from there to town is six miles, and there are three turnpikes I must go through, and run the chance of being detected; the direct road from Harrow to London is only six miles, and there are no turnpikes; is it reasonable to suppose, I should take them six miles round if I had stolen them.

            . I am a farming man. In July last, I was out of work looking for employ, I came from Ware, in Hertfordshire, and was coming to Mr. Rhodes for work, Dixon was with me. On the 6th of July we were on the the Enfield-road.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know that it was the 6th of July - A. Being Smithfield market and a Friday. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him - A. On the Enfield-road, coming towards town, just on this side of the Three Jolly Butchers, which is four or five miles from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know whether it was past the four or five mile stone - A. I cannot say, for it was night when I came that way, and morning when I started. I saw him there early in the morning, it was day-light, about three or four o'clock. Dixon and I were in a field laying under a hedge asleep, and heard them making a noise on the road, a dog was barking. Dixon was also asleep, I awoke him, and we saw a man like a drover, he had a large dog, they were driving a sheep up to the gate, intending to catch her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they - A. The prisoner and another man, dressed in dark clothes; he had a sort of jacket coat with the flaps cut off, he had no smock frock; there were nine sheep; I heard the man say he should give him 13 l. for them, and the prisoner said if he gave him 13 l., he must<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120048"></xptr>return 10 s. back, he said he would; the man with the dog went back towards Enfield, and the prisoner and sheep towards London. I took no notice, nor said any thing to the prisoner. I came to town and got work at Rhodes', and have been working since that at Mr. Bowden's, a cow-keeper at Marylebone; did not know the prisoner before, and have not seen him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here - A. When I was working at Rhodes', we heard the men in the field talking about this affair, and they told me where to find his son.</p>



               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How did you know he had a son - A. A man in the hay field said he knew his son. I have been to Newgate and seen the prisoner once, which was last Thursday, I came with his son. I set out from Ware about nine o'clock in the morning, to walk about the country for work, and then heard Rhodes', of Islington, had plenty of work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was Dixon - A. A stranger to me; I first saw him at the Red Cow, public-house, at Ware, that night; I did not know him before; we have been together ever since - he does hay-making and harvesting; we lodge together - he has been working at Rhodes' and at Bowden's with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light when you saw these people on the road - A. Yes; I never spoke to them, I heard a noise and was afraid it was somebody coming to make a noise about our being asleep in the field, we went to sleep again, and slept an hour or two; we continued on the ground till about five o'clock, and came on through Tottenham and Edmonton; we saw the prisoner on the other side of Edmonton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend here last Sessions to give evidence on this trial - A. No, the first time I was asked to come here was three weeks ago, his son asked me. I could not have been known of as a witness last Sessions. *</p>
               <p>* This trial was postponed last Sessions on an affidavit made by the prisoner that he had material evidence in his behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Thirteen pounds, bating ten shillings, was the price paid for the sheep - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first hear of the prisoner being charged with stealing sheep - A. I cannot rightly tell, it was while I was at work at Rhodes, I worked there six weeks; the men said a man was taken up for buying stolen sheep in the Enfield-road. Dixon was with me and heard it; the prisoner's name was mentioned in the field.</p>

            , on a Friday morning in July, I think it was the 6th, we were sleeping under a hedge near the Three Jolly Butchers, public-house, about three miles from Islington, on the Enfield-road. How awoke me and told me to get up, I laid still and looked through the hedge and saw two men driving some sheep up to the gate of a field to catch them, there was a dog there, I looked through the hedge so as not to be perceived, and heard them talking about selling some sheep; there were nine sheep, the man said,</p>
               <p>"If I give you thirteen pounds for the sheep you must return me ten shillings;" he said, "Very well, I don't mind returning it." After talking together, I saw him pull out some bills, I suppose they must be money or he would not have given him the sheep. I saw him return the ten shillings. The prisoner is the man who bought them. About a fortnight or three weeks after, when I was working at Mr. Rhodes's, I heard of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been working since - A. I have done porter's work at Covent-garden market, and at Billingsgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived since - A. In East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any one else lodge with you - A. No, I have a room to myself, there are plenty of lodgers but none that I am acquainted with, for I always keep myself to myself.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Your partner's name is John - A. Yes, I always call him John, and he answers to that name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first meet him, in the field - A. No, we had been together for three months looking after work.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been together three months before the night you slept under the hedge - A. Yes. I met him before July, it was the beginning of April, we have been together ever since. I have not been working for a Mr. Bowden. I went once to Newgate to see the prisoner, it was the beginning of August.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was coming to town with some sheep on the 29th of June, and this one got mixed with mine, near the Jolly Butchers, public-house, in coming to Green-lane; it was in the prisoner's possession when it got mixed with mine. I saw him there with eight more besides this ewe. He overtook me between two and three o'clock in the morning, he was driving them, they all got mixed with mine. I told him I was going to London and they might go together, but I got this ewe away - it appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120049"></xptr>an odd one. I told him I thought it was an odd one, and had got mixed with them; he said it had. I said I thought it belonged to some of the neighbours, and we would leave it at the Queen's Head public-house. It did not appear the same sort as the others. He proposed to take it to London, and said he would sell it, and give the money to the man it belonged to, if he could find the owner. I said we had better leave it at the public-house, as it would be handier for the people to find. He agreed to that. The other eight were a kind of half-bred sheep, and I think all wethers. I do not think they had any mark; they were about half meat. I should know them again if I had seen them. He told me he was going to call at Holland's, the butcher's, at Islington, and he would buy them; he knocked at his door, and I said "Do not knock him up, if he wants them he will come to market," He said he would give any thing for a pen; they were taken to Smithfield and put in a pen. I gave the ewe to Wager, at the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first made the observation about the ewe - A. I did. I said I thought it was one of our commoners, and had got mixed with them; he hesitated a little, then said it had got mixed with them. We walked about a mile together after I made the observation before he said it had got mixed; he kept talking to me about what the sheep were worth; I told him I did not know where it came from, as I had not seen a sheep on the road that morning. I am sure he is the man; the first time I saw him was on Good Friday, and once after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say it was half a mile from where you first met him that he said the sheep had joined his - A. We had come nearly half a mile. I suppose it was twenty minutes after I made the observation about it belonging to one of the commoners, that he said it might have strayed among his; during that time we were talking about the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he begun talking to you about the value of the sheep before you made this remark - A. No. He did not say it was his; he said it might have strayed among his, and he was willing to leave it or take it and sell it, and give the owner the money.</p>

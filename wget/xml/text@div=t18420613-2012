The prisoner was foreman of the cap department, and had been so about seven months—he kept a shop of his own in the London-road—he dealt with us for Japan hats, but never for caps, or buttons, or velvet—on Sunday, the 15th of May, in conse<lb></lb>quence of suspicion, I marked a quantity of tassels, ribbons, and chene velvet, and packets of buttons, in the gross packets—I afterwards missed some packets of buttons, and twenty-four inches of two pieces of this vel<lb></lb>vet—here is a pattern of it—it is a cotton velvet, not very valuable—this piece was found at the prisoner's house, and this is the piece it was cut from—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 27th of May—I accom<lb></lb>panied the officer to search his house, and found these three gross packets of buttons—I can swear to two of them, from having the mark I put on them for detection—the other packet I believe to be ours, from its being a Kind of button not generally used in caps, but we bought it as a job—we found</p>

               <p>nine tassels, the whole of which belongs to us—there is a pencil mark a the button of each, which is covered by the silk (they were marked as Sunday, the 15th) and some ribbons, one of the ribbons has not ur mart on it—the only reason I have to suppose it is ours, is that we bought what we call four pieces, and we never used a whole piece—we used a portions of a piece, and one piece is gone—we never sell ribbons, except made up; nor tassels, but as forming part of a cap; nor valve, except made up—we found some caps—they are not marked, but from the particular quality of the cloth, and their appearance, I have no doubt they an ours—I believe all these caps have had our stamp taken. off then—it was a paper stamp stuck on with gum—when we took them, one of them had our stamp it, but before we left his premises his wife concealed it—I saw it, and called the attention of the inspector to it, but it was taken away—the stuff of these caps is particular—it was made by brother for shipment, but it was not ready when his other goods were, and we bought it of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the form of cap you received to make A Yes, my work in this cap is under the lining—here is my work-I put the peak on this cap—the work on it is such as to enable me to say it is mine—I made two caps for the prisoner on two occasions, and be gave me the materials at the prosecutor's warehouse, but they were quite differ<lb></lb>ent to these—I have a book in which the prisoner writes the goods which I am to be paid for making up—part of this book is in Mr. Taylor's hand writing—I find in it the making up of two of the caps I made for the pri<lb></lb>soner on the 4th of April, and the two others, which I made on the 9th of May—the prisoner put "paid" to the book—none of them were made for the prosecutors—they were paid for at the prosecutors' warehouse by Mr. Mullins or Mr. Simpson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am police-inspector. On Friday, the 27th of May, I received charge of the prisoner on his leaving Mr. Mullins—I went and searched his shop in the London-road—I found there these ribbons, velvet slips, and parcels of buttons, in grosses—they had the marks on them at the time—also these tassels for caps, with the marks in pencil under them, and the four caps which have been identified by Jarvis—among the caps there was one with the prosecutors' label on—I put it in a paper parcel among some other things that he identified, at the corner of the shelf—I saw Mrs. Tay<lb></lb>lor put her hand on the parcel—I said, "Don't move the parcel "—some time after it was taken away altogether, and found at last under some things on the counter, but the cap with the label was gone.</p>

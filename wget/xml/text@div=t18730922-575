                  </hi>. I reside at Southampton, and am a Magistrate there—the prisoner was for some years a tenant of my father's, of a ship building yard, at Wolston, near Southampton—after my fathers death the property came into my possession, and the prisoner continued as tenant—in September, 1808, he relinquished the lease in favour of Messrs. Bartlett and Pudney, the mortgagees of his vessel, and I accepted them as tenants—the prisoner was building the ship, it had been remaining there in frame for a considerable period; these parties had sold him timber, he could not pay them, and the result was they took possession of the ship, and in order to enable them to complete the vessel, he made an arrangement with them that he should relinquish his lease in their favour, which he did—he did not leave Southampton for some twelve months afterwards—he never made any claim on me for any money until I received this letter of 31st March, the signature to it is the prisoner's: (<hi rend="italic">This letter was a request to the prosecutor to fulfil an alleged promise of helping him, he having had heavy losses and been at considerable expense upon tlve premises in question</hi>)—I did not answer that letter—on 19th April I received a second letter, this is it, it is signed by the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">This referred to a claim of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for extra rent, and compensation, for repairs, which the prosecutor was requested to send him, if not he should be compelled to consult a gentleman in the neighbourhood and expose his affairs</hi>)—I replied to that letter on 21st April, of which I have a rough copy: (<hi rend="italic">This gave an unqualified denial to the prisoner's claim</hi>)—on 22nd April I received this other letter: (<hi rend="italic">This stated that unless he received, by the following Thursday, 201., together with some offer of compensation for repairs, he should write to the person referred to in the former letter, and that the prosecutor mud blame himself if his affairs became publicly talked of</hi>)—This letter, of 6th August, was received by my son, Captain Buchan, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220021"></xptr>
               <p>is also signed by the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">This repeated the substance of the first letter, and urged Captain Buchan to use his influence with his father to in<lb></lb>duce him to act justly</hi>)—A letter was also sent to my mother's, signed by the prisoner's wife, and then came this letter, of 25th August, upon which the indictment is founded: (<hi rend="italic">This contained the following passage</hi>:—"Blame yourself, and not me, if your affairs are published during next week's festivities, which they will be unless I hear satisfactorily from you pre<lb></lb>viously.")—The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London were about to visit Southampton at that time, and on the occasion of that entertainment I presided—I presume the prisoner knew of that through the public press—I am a trustee of various charities at Southampton, I was Mayor last year, I am in an extensive business, and have business all over the world—it was fearing these statements would be of consequence to me that I took these proceedings—everything the prisoner has stated in these letters is most grossly false—there is not a word of truth in the claim he has made—the only thing I can imagine is that being an aged man his mind has got confused on the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He admitted, at Hammersmith, that he had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra rent for the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I admitted that I had received more rent for the yard than he had agreed to pay in his lease—there was no agreement that he should share in the profit; when he gave up his tenancy I had done with him altogether—he never claimed anything from me in respect of the paling until these letters were written; I swear that positively—in the early part of 1868 he was continually asking me to advance money on this ship, and not wishing to have anything to do with him on the matter, I told him that I had lost a large sum of money, which was quite true, in 1866—he had the place for about five years, at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he had not spent anything like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the paling—he was no doubt at my office several times, but he never made any demand upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, handed in a statement which, in substance, was the same as that contained in the letters.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">entertained considerable doubt whether the letter contained such a menace as came within the meaning of</hi> 24 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">Vic., c.</hi> 96, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 44. <hi rend="italic">It had been decided that a menace must be of such a character at to produce alarm in the mind of the person to whom it was addressed: a mere thing that he might dislike to have brought to his attentiont such as a threat of legal proceedings, was not enough It must be such a menace as would interfere with the freedom of action of a reasonable and tolerably firm minded man. He left it to the Jury to say whether in their opinion it was a menace of that description.</hi>

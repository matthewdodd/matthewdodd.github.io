            . The Prisoner lodged in my House, about a Week; and while my Wife and I were out, she took that Opportunity to take out Key, and rob us of the Plates and the Bed-screw. They were found upon her. This Woman took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats. When I saw it, I asked her how she came by it, and she said it was none of mine, I had nothing to do with it: Well says I, how you got the Key of the Door I know not, but I will enquire: Upon this she went down into the Cellar, and two of the Plates dropped from her: I heard them fall, and so I followed her, and found two more dropped down the House of Office.</p>

            . I took the Bed-screw from under her Petticoats, it was thrust under the String that ty'd them. When we had taken this, she went down Stairs into the Cellar, and dropp'd two Plates upon the Stairs, I saw her pull two more out of her Bosom, and two more she dropped down the Vault. I saw her pull the Plates out of her Bosom upon the Stairs.</p>

               <p>I was at a stand, being just come out of St. Martin's Workhouse. That Samuel Pate letts two-penny Lodgings, and entertains Black-shoe-fellows, and sells Drams. I own I had drank three or four Drams, and if I had the Bed-screw, it was unknown to me. How the Plates came there I do not know, I never handled them. That Woman, King, used to be there, and the House used to be full of People, Men and Women, all lie together in the same Room. I happened to say something he did not like - O ye B - h, says he, I will stick upon your Skirts. I have no Friends but God and my self. <rs id="t17361013-33-verdict153" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am the widow of Mr. Jonathan Durrant, who died in Aug. last. The prisoner has been in my service four years and a half, as housemaid; I placed the greatest possible confidence in her—before March, this year, I had missed money for some time out of this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which I carried my money—Mary Elliott is a niece of my late husband; she came to live with me in Sept last—it had been his request that she should do so—she changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for me on Saturday, 11th March—she gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I placed it in this purse, in which there were two half crowns—I was not aware at that time that any money was marked, or was going to be marked—when I go to bed I keep my purse in my pocket behind my pillow—the prisoner slept in a room close to me, so that she could come in and out at any time in the night—she had been in the habit of sleeping there ever since she had been there—on the next morning, Sunday, Miss Elliott wished to go to Church, and asked me for some silver, as it was a charity sermon—I opened my purse to give her some, and missed two sovereigns and a half—when the prisoner came to take my breakfast things away, I said, "Fanny, I have lost two sovereigns and a half; I cannot think what I have done with it"—she said, "I recollect, Ma'am, when you went to bed, I heard something drop from your pocket"—she also said she did not look for it then as it was candle-light—I told her to look then—she looked, and found one sovereign by the bed steps—I then told her to look again—she did so, and found another sovereign—I said, "Now, Fanny, if you can find the half sovereign, it will e all right"—she found it; and I was so pleased, that I was almost simple enough to give her a present, but I did not—it was 10 o'clock in the morning when the money was found—I cannot say whether the prisoner went into her bedroom after I missed my money—I had never spoken to her about having missed money—my confidence in her was unbounded.</p>

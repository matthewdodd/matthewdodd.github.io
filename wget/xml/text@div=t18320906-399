             (Police-constable F 10.) I took the prisoner - he said he had requested the landlord to remove these from under his bed, and as he would not, he thought he might as well take them, and make something of them; he said at the station that he had done it under the influence of liquor, and we ought not to take advantage of him; he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had asked him several times to remove them from under my bedstead, as they were very dirty, and full of bugs; I said if he did not I would throw them out of the window, or take them away myself.</p>

            . On the 29th of May I was standing in my shop, which is opposite of the prosecutor's, between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner go into his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that he went over the threshold of the door - A. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person in the shop - A. None. I saw him take a parcel off the counter, and run up Everett-street with it, he put it under his arm. I immediately run across the road, and seeing no one in the shop, I called out to the prosecutor that he was robbed. I did not wait for any answer, but I pursued he the prisoner immediately, I kept him in my eye except in turning the corner he turned another corner into Wilmott-street; I there lost him, and seeing a boy, I asked him if he saw any one run with a parcel; he said yes, a man run down Wilmott-street, and looked in a gateway; Mr. Lipscomb was close behind me; I there saw the prisoner standing behind a gateway; he seemed very much confused at the sight of me, and I saw the parcel drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there was no one behind the gate but the prisoner, was there - A. No; I saw it drop, and heard it; there is a vacancy between the gate, the post about five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get sight of him in Wilmott-street - A. No, not till I came up to the gates, and then I saw the jean drop on the ground; I collared him immediately; Mr. Lipscomb came up at the time.</p>

               <p>MR. PARTRIDGL. The prisoner was brought to me at the watchhouse, and Mr. Lipscomb delivered me this parcel; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that jean your property - A. Yes, I can safely swear it is my property. The value of this is near four pounds; I have only valued it at two pounds; that is under the value of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

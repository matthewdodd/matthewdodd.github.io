            . I am a broker; I live in Raven-row, Spitalfields. I know both the prisoners. On the 3d of January Steele came in doors, Lamb waited outside; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; Steele had some shells under both his arms, he asked me if I would buy them; I told him, no, I was no judge of them; he said if I would sell them at the door he would satisfy me; I said, what is the price of them; he said, eighteen-pence the large ones, and nine-pence the small one's. I put them at the door; I did not buy them. Steele said he would take them back again if I did not sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them - A. Twenty-one. Afterwards Mr. Combe the officer came, and Mr. Blundle; two of the shells on that day were at the door, and the others on a shelf. Steele was then in custody. I told the magistrate that Lamb was with him.</p>
               <p>- COOMBES. I am an officer. I went to Jacob's, I found two shells at the door, and twenty-one on a shelf just as you went in at the door. Jacobs described the other man, and Freeman went and apprehended Lamb. Steele said in Lamb's presence that they were together, and that they used to sell them at Burnet's in Mile End road. This was the first time that they went to Jacob's. Lamb said nothing.</p>
               <p>Blundle. These are the shells we lost in December.</p>

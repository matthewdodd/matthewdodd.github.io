I am the prisoner's attorney—I did not see this signature written, and I never saw the prisoner's handwriting before; but this state<lb></lb>ment was given in by my advice, and I do not wish for a moment to dispute its being his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This evidence was rendered necessary by the absence of the usual caution preceding the statement—read:</hi>"I purchase all the dust from the parish of Bermondsey. I have 16 loads per day of their dust shot in my yard; their men bring it. On the day in question, my boy told me that the men had found a number of sovereigns. I went to them, and as I always share with my men all the money and valuables found, they gave me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as my share. When the police-constable asked me if I had found any money, I had paid the parish of Bermondsey 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and to Mr. Brown for half a load of hay. Fearing to have to pay the amount to some one if I had heard of the finding of the money, I said I had not found any. I told this to the inspector when the charge was taken, after having been cautioned by him that all I said would be used against me.

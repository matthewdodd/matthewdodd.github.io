               <p>Q.Were the fences in good order? - A. Yes. The next morning I went to the field, and missed a ewe lamb, there were but thirty-seven, they were all ewe lambs; they were in an inner field, the outside gate was locked, then there was a gate to the inner field, and that was withyed up, and the withy had been burst open, by the sheep being drawn, as I suppose; there were the marks of their having been drawn, they were drawn close to the gate.</p>

               <p>Q.There were no signs of any thing having been killed in the field? - A. No, no blood, or any thing of that kind; in search of that one I went down to the wood, within about forty poles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300055"></xptr>of the field,

             went with me; the wood belongs to Mr. Redgrave, in the parish of Pinner; as soon as we got into the wood, John King and and myself looked a very little way before we found the skin, with the entrails tied up in the skin; it was covered over with a little bit of grass, just a handful over the top of it, near the entrance of the wood; the skin and the entrails were warm. I did not search after the blood, to see where it had been killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear that skin came from your lamb? - A. Yes, it had the marks upon it very plain indeed; the skin is here; the head was not with the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been accustomed to kill sheep yourself? - A. Sometimes I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin taken off the lamb in a butcher-like way? - A. No, it had been taken off very badly indeed; some of the bark of the body had been left sticking to the skin; in going a little further I found the prisoner Monday and another man, lying about eight or ten poles from where I found the skin; they were lying down by a sack full of things; I asked what they had got there, and Monday said, nothing belonging to me; I told him I would see what he had got in his sack; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; he got up and undid his sack, the other man got up and did nothing; the first thing he pulled out of this sack was a tin kettle, and in the kettle were some ribs of lamb and potatoes boiled, and a bit of a loin.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you ascertain, in that state, whether it was mutton or lamb? - A. Yes, pretty well; there were two legs and two shoulders in the bag that were not dressed, that was lamb. I asked Munday where he got his meat; he told me he bought it at Watford, he said he gave sixpence a pound for it; I asked him if he would shew me the shop, and he told me he would go along with me: the man that was in company with Munday, and myself, and John King, and Munday all set off together towards Watford; as we were going along, the other man said, d-n my eyes if I will go any further; accordingly he stopped, and Munday and I and another man went on; I left him behind along with

            ; I went a very little way before Munday said to me, it is of no use to go any further, for I cannot shew you where I had it; I never bought it. Then I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was brought to him while he was asleep; well, says I, you must go along with me, all the same; he told me he did not much care about it, for he was a deserter, and so we went together, and I delivered him up to Mr. Birch, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not find the head? - A. Yes, I did, the very next day, very near the same spot; but that had been boiled; the four joints were warm; he had a black jack-ass with him, but he said he had nothing to do with it, it was not his.(The skin produced, with the mark I W upon it.)</p>

             sworn. - I work for Mr. Ward: I went along with him in search after his lamb; I was with him when he found the skin; we left the skin where it was till we found the man; we found Munday, and a man of the name of Hawkins, lying upon the ground together; there was a sack lying by them: Ward asked what they had got in that sack; Munday said, nothing at all belonging to you; this was about four o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can guess; the sack was open in the middle, and the things at each end: then Ward insisted upon seeing what he had, and he pulled out a tin kettle with some ribs of lamb and some potatoes in it, boiled, and a piece of the loin with it; then he pulled out four joints, two legs and two shoulders, they were warm when we got them home to our own house; they were wrapped up in a cloth; the skin and entrails were warm when we found them. Ward asked Munday how he came by the meat; he said he brought it at Watford; he asked him at which butcher's, he said he did not know, but he would go and shew him where it was; then we took the skin and the tin kettle with the ribs of mutton in it, and went towards Watford; we left the ribs behind in the kit; when we got about half way there, Hawkins swore he would not go any further; Ward and another man went on with Munday, I stopped with Hawkins, and before they came back, he got away from me.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you very sure the joints of meat were warm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going after a job of work, and I met with the other man, and he told me if I would stop a bit, he would go with me and shew me where to get a job; and while we were stopping there, the man came up and took us.</p>

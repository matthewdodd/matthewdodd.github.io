I lost one ewe sheep, and one wether sheep, last Thursday: I marked the sheep with my own name, and with my own hands: I ordered my shepherd to look to them next morning, to see if they were all right. I marked upwards of two hundred on Thursday. The next morning, there were six missing: he traced a man in the snow, and the sheep up a lane, that leads to Wood-Green, a bye-way to London, and in a place called Tottenham-Freehold, he found three of them; after that he traced the man, and sheep up to the turnpike, and from thence quite up to Islington; and at last found two sheep, in one Mr. Hardy's, a salesman's penn, in Smithfield: they were marked DD, my own name, my man sent down to me: I came to town, and I saw the sheep in Mr. Hardy's yard: I knew them again, they had been marked on both sides before at sheep-shearing time, and the marks were not worn out.</p>

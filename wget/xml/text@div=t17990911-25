               <p>Q. Did you see what occasioned his tumbling? - A. No, I was not soon enough; I then went up to the deceased, and I saw him get out of the ditch, and there I saw the other man naked behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased naked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that naked man? - A. No, I could tell him if I was to see him again; he came out of the ditch after the other; the deceased got out and made away to the public-house door, and said, I have had enough, I will fight no more.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might it be from the ditch to the place where he got up? - A. It might be six yards; then the naked man shoved him away from the public-house, I did not know who it was, and struck him many blows in the face with his fist, then a scuffle ensued; the deceased rather returned the blows as well as he could; ne'er a blow that I saw reached so high as his face, it was like pushing him away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that last? - A. I suppose not half a minute scarce before one was down; Giles, the deceased, got the naked man down first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him afterwards? - A. Yes, twice at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the Court, and see if you see the man? - (Looks round the Court.) A. I cannot say I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that man at the bar before? - A. I see him now, I was looking down before, that is the man that I saw naked; Giles got him down, and they both got up again, and Giles said, he would have no more; after that, by pushing and hitting one another about, Giles was thrown into a bit of a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean each pushing the other? - A. Yes, they did, as well as they could; I believe Giles was thrown into a bit of a gutter by the side of the road, after the deceased laid down, and some people round about said, d-n him, kick him, serve him as he served you; then three very heavy kicks across the body were directly given by his antagonist; then Mr. Olive came and took hold of Giles, and said, old brutality through the piece, then he took him to his house, and got him a bowl of water, he washed his face, and then the deceased turned his head round with great sagacity, and said, is nobody here? - Mr. Olive said, yes, I am here.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing more that passed between the prisoner and the deceased? - A. No, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that I followed the deceased to his own door in a chair; I left him at his own door, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw this man kick the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nails in his shoes, had not he? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. The battle had begun before you first came up? - A. I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you do not know whether the battle had begun before you came up? - A. I cannot tell that; the first I saw was, Giles, falling into the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you saw one man stripped, and another falling into the ditch, you mean to tell that Jury that you don't know whether the battle was begun or not? - A. How should I know whether it had, when I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. You are known at this public-house that you speak of? - A. I cannot tell that rightly, I go there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then have you any doubt that they know you? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you doubt whether the battle had begun when you heard the deceased say, I will fight no more? - A. I did not see any blows.</p>

             sworn. - I am a painter and glazier; I live very high the spot where this happened; I was standing at my own door, when the prisoner and the deceased came out of a public-house, about twenty yards from the door of the public-house, it was on Sunday, the 18th of August; about twenty minutes past twelve at night, the deceased came out, and the prisoner and three others, which were the prisoner's acquaintances, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should you suppose they were the friends of one more than the other? - A. I have known the deceased a great many years, living in the neighbourhood, but I never saw these other persons before; when they came out of the public-house, the prisoner went up to the deceased, and said, you kick my a-e, it is not in your power to kick my a-e; upon that the prisoner went and put his hand to the deceased's face, and struck him on the left hand side of his face open handed; he then gave him a push, and sprung back in a position to meet him; then the deceased struck him, and they enclosed together for about half a minute I suppose, they fall down, and the prisoner was undermost, about two yards from the public-house door, in the public street; the deceased struck the prisoner two or three times while he was upon the ground, and they he kicked the prisoner; they got up together again, and they fought togethere again, and fell down again; the prisoner fell undermost the second fall; I believe, after the second round, the prisoner stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Then up to this time, they had both their clothes on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strip? - A. No, he did not; then they enclosed again, and fell down, I cannot say which was uppermost; the third fall they got up again, and met together again, and they had hold of one another; the prisoner was striking over the head, and the deceased was striking over the body, and as they were fighting, they both fell into the ditch together; the prisoner at the bar came out of the ditch first; the deceased made towards the public-house door, the Northumberland-arms; it is called the White-house, because it is stuccoed; as soon as he came out of the ditch, the deceased said, he had had enough, and would not fight any more; the prisoner at the bar said, keep the door shut, do not let him go in.</p>
               <p>Q.This was immediately upon their getting out of the ditch? - A. Yes, immediately; upon that some man went to put his backside against the door to prevent the deceased going in; upon that the prisoner went up to the deceased as he was standing at the public-house, and he struck him two or three times in the face, or about the head, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that immediately? - A. Yes; then the deceased kicked at the prisoner to keep him off; then they enclosed together again immediately, they did not fall that time, but they were parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any blows given when they closed? - A. The prisoner gave the deceased blows, but I did not see the deceased strike any blow; they were parted, and then they enclosed again afterwards, and fell down just by the public-house door, and got up again, and closed again, and they tumbled both together again, and the deceased was undermost, and laid across a drain; then the prisoner struck the deceased two or three times over the face while he was lying upon the ground, and the prisoner at the bar kicked him two or three times upon the left side; upon that there was some voice expressed, why do not you kick him, d-n you, kick him, serve him as he served you, kill him if you can.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might there be collected together at that time? - A. There might be fifty or sixty people, I cannot exactly say how many; I then took hold of him by the arms, and lifted him up; he walked about the space of nine or ten yards nearly to my own door, and I went down stairs, and got some water, and washed his face, and he attempted to wash his face as well as he was able; then my wife came up stairs; I asked him into my kitchen, he staid about a quarter of an hour, and while he was there, we washed his temples with vinegar and water; and while he was in my kitchen, he said, oh! that ditch, that ditch! and trying to utter it a third time, he said, dish; I saw such a change in the man's countenance, that I thought he was dying, and I got some assistance, and he was carrying home in a great arm chair to his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110058"></xptr>apartments; I went soon after while the apothe cary was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live afterwards? - A. I suppose he was dead before he got to his own house; the apothecary was trying all means to recover him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say that you saw him at the very moment they came out of the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were not attempts made to prevent the deceased attacking prisoner; and that he did not tear the man's coat that attempted to prevent it? - A. I did not see any such thing; there was some person said to the prisoner at the bar, don't fight, for God's sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say no such thing passed? - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by the name of Sandman? - A. No, I am a little higher character than a Sandman too.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was a taller man than the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a more powerful man? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Giles the most quarrelsome man in the neighbourhood. - A. I know very little of the man, except living in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not some ribs broke about three weeks ago in a fight? - A. Not that I ever heard, and I live close by him.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you near enough to hear any expressions the deceased made use of? - A. No, I did not hear him make use of any expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to have heard him if he had? - A. I was standing at my own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards was this from your own door? - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - This happened about twenty yards from my own house; they had just got out of the ditch when I came up; I saw the deceased go towards the public-house door; he got to the public-house door, and the prisoner called out, don't let him in. Giles received several blows from the prisoner; Giles then kicked at him, but where he hit him, I do not know; after that Giles rushed at him, and then down he was; then they closed, and had one another down, and the prisoner was undermost; then they got up again; Mr. Giles said, he had had enough, and would fight no more.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that after they had fallen and got up again? - A. Yes, then the prisoner had at him again; they closed again, and fell down again; then they got up again, and closed again, and several blows were struck about the body on both sides; then the prisoner threw him down across the kennel; then somebody made answer and said, kick him, d-n him, kick him, serve him as he served you; kill him if you can, but who it was I cannot say; then Mr. Olive said, you will kill the man, and he took him out of the kennel, and took him towards his own door, and fetched a bason of water and washed his face; after that he called me to help him to get him home; he said, O Sam! I am very sick, let me alone a bit; then Olive and I got him into a chair; then Olive washed his temples with vinegar; his countenance changed very much, and I thought he was dying; he was not above three or four minutes in his own house before he died.</p>

             sworn. - I came down just as they had got to the last round; I saw them both fall over the kennel; I saw the prisoner kick the deceased several times while he was down; I was very near them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Elizabeth Giles). Did you see any part of this fight yourself? - A. I know nothing of it till I was informed he was fighting; I got to him just as Mr. Olive was taking him into his house; I saw by his face that he was a dead man, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Mr. BIRCH sworn. - I am a surgeon, I attended the deceased about ten minutes after his death?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine his body to ascertain the cause of his death? - A. Yes; I found three ribs fractured on the left side, and one of them had punctured the lungs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you suppose, from your examination of the body, was the cause of his death? - A. Two of them were large ribs, and one of them a small rib, at a distance from one another; it must have been occasioned by a violent fall upon some very hard body or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from the appearance of the ribs whether it had been done recently, or any time? - A. It was undoubtedly a recent case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else that could be the occasion of his death, except these fractured ribs? - A. Nothing particular; there was no external appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blows that could occasion his death? - A. Not to any external appearance; there was just a scratch upon the surface, which appeared to me from a brick-bat, or something of that kind, but it was very trifling; if it had been been done by the fist or kicks, there would have been external marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q.There were a number of brick-bats in this ditch, were they fell, perhaps you may know that? - A. Most undoubtedly there are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the deceased in consequence of any injury he had received from fighting previous to this? - A. Yes, about three months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110059"></xptr>Q.What injury did he then receive. - A. A trifling injury on the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know enough of the deceased to know whether he bore the general character of a quarrelsome man? - A. He did by some people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in this public-house with an acquaintance, and the deceased came in with some ducks, and we were talking about the ducks; I said I had one larger, and he said it was a d-d lie, and began to quarrel, and insisted upon fighting; I paid my reckoning, and solicited my friend to do the same to get away from him, but he would follow me out, and then the accident happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he return apparently in better temper? - A. Yes; when we were going away, the deceased said, now, you sh-n son of a b-b, where is your ten pound duck now? the prisoner said, he could produce him; says he you are a d-d liar, and I will make a liar of you before I leave you; I left the prisoner and the deceased together while I turned the corner; some person said your friend is a fighting, I then ran in between them, and said, for God's sake, don't go to fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Had they closed when you interfered? - A. No, they had not closed; they were striking at each other; I did not see who struck the first blow; the deceased then got hold of me by the coat, shoved me against the wall, and told me to go along, or he would serve me the same, and tore my coat as you now see it; then they went to fighting, and had several rounds in their clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. During these rounds, was there any foul play on the part of the prisoner, or on the part of the deceased? - A. After the deceased had got the prisoner down, he knelt upon him, and beat him in the face several times; he was taken off by some people that were standing by; they got up, went to it again, and he served him the same a second time; then I lifted the deceased off the prisoner, and they got up again.</p>
               <p>Q.During all the time of the fight, did you see any unfair conduct on the part of the prisoner towards the deceased? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any unfair conduct of the prisoner, towards the deceased, must you not have seen it? - A. I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swear there was not? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About three years; he is a very peaceable, quiet man.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. - Q. Did you see them when they got out of the ditch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased go towards the public house door saying, he would have no more of it? - A. No; he might say such a thing, but I was too far off to hear that.</p>

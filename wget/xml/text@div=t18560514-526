                  </hi>. I keep a coffee shop at Knightsbridge. The prisoner is my wife—she came out of prison on New Year's day—I fetched her home, and she lived with me till 27th March—on the Sunday before this the prisoner's sister had come up from the country on a visit—she and the prisoner were very good friends at first—on the Tuesday I was going to take my wife and her sister to a place of amusement, but instead of that I went over to my own sister's, at Rotherhithe—I left my wife at my sister's, and returned home to business—I expected my wife home the next morning—she never arrived—I staid at home till 11 o'clock at night—I then went out to see if I could find her anywhere in the neighbourhood—I did not go to Rotherhithe to fetch her—I heard something about her, and when I got home, I found the prisoner and her sister quarrelling in the kitchen—the prisoner said to me, "You have been out with some one, and could not come to fetch me"—I tried to make peace—she tore her sister's bonnet off and threw it on the fire—I begged her to be quiet, and tried all I possibly could to keep them both quiet—I could not, and I left them to put on my cap and jacket, and when I came back to the kitchen she flew at me, and scratched my face—I said I was determined I would not put up with that—she said, "I will do for you, I will smash the windows"—she took the poker, and was breaking the glass—I went to take the poker, and received two blows on the front of my head—I fell back insensible into the arms of some one—I was taken to St. George's Hospital; I did not remain there—I continued an out patient about five weeks.</p>

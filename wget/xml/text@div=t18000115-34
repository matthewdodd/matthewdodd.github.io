               <p>MARY HIGGS sworn. - On the 26th of December, Mrs. Rix was taken ill; I removed the gown into the front room, I had ironed it; between twelve and one o'clock, the same night, the prisoner came to ask for lodgings; I told her she could have a lodging; she said she would go and let her husband know, and they would both come together; I saw nothing of the prisoner till three o'clock in the morning; I had been under the necessity of going to No. 4, and upon returning, I saw the prisoner come out; I asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted a lodging; I told her I had informed her before that she could have one; I asked her what she had got in her apron; she said she had got her child's gown; I pulled down her apron, and saw it was Mrs. Rix's gown; I called the watchman, and gave the gown into the watchman's hands. (The watchman produced the gown, which was deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in to ask for a lodging. and the prosecutrix was not at home; I told her I was very tired; she said she saw that I got my bread by washing, by my hands being white, just come from the tub; she told me she could get me a great deal of work if I lived that way, and she gave me that gown to wash; I have four children.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Higg's. When she first came, there was a young woman there; but when she came the second time I was gone home with that very young woman; she said it was her child's gown when I asked her what she had got there. <rs id="t18000115-34-verdict195" type="verdictDescription">

I am a cashier at the Charing Cross Branch of the National Bank—Mr. Solomon Ullman, of Regent Street, jeweller, keeps an account at that branch—a little before 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 9th December, the prisoner came to the bank and gave me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I thought there was an alteration in it, and I went to my note till, and said "How will you take this, in notes <hi rend="italic">T</hi>—he said "Yes; notes will do"—I then said to him "What do you claim for this cheque, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he did not make any particular reply to that, and I said again "You claim 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this cheque?"—he said "Yes; 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what is in the cheque"—I thought it my duty to refer the matter to the manager—as I was going to the manager, he walked that way, and after I had spoken to the manager the prisoner said "What is the matter? if there is anything wrong with the cheque, I will take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and go about my business"—the manager said "Oh, no; we can't do that"—the prisoner said he had sold a ring to Mr. Ullman for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he wanted the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, that was all he wanted—the manager requested him to wait until we sent for some officers—young Mr. Ullman came in while he was there, and the prisoner was given into custody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187401120029"></xptr>

I did not understand you," and I did not say "Gracious, how did you expect to get 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes"—the other cashier may have said so, I did not hear him—I did not hear you say "I know nothing about notes, can't you give me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes"—the manager had the cheque then—I did not hear you say to Mr. Ullman "Is not the cheque just as you wrote it"—you were talking a great deal, I know—Mr. Ullman said there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due—you did not say in my hearing "The boy has acknowledged there is 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due; I claim no more than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., neither have I claimed more; give me that 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that will settle this business"—I can only speak of what you said to me, not what you said to other people—I could see that the cheque was wrong—Mr. Ullman's son had told me that he had given a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that in writing the cheque he had smudged the figures, and he hoped that I would pay the cheque, because he did not wish the gentleman to be prevented from getting his money, and that he had called at the bank in order that the cheque might not be returned—he told me, that about a minute before you came in.</p>

I am the son of Solomon Ullman, jeweller, 94, Regent Street—I assist in the shop—my father keeps an account at the Charing Cross Branch of the National Bank, and I have cheques entrusted to me with authority to fill them up—on the 9th December, a little after 3 o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop—he said he wished to sell a ring, he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a very foggy day, and I could not see exactly what it was, and I told him I would give him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then for it, and if it was worth any more I would give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the following day—I asked him who he was, and he gave me this card, and said he was correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>; and he showed me a document and said it was a letter of credit on London for 10,000 dollars, that he could not draw the money for ten days, and he wished to telegraph to New York, and he wanted the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I had been talking about first, and then I blotted the 10 with my fingers and put 8 on the top of the two figures—I am quite sure when I gave it to the prisoner it was a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since I gave it to him the "y "has been added, and the "0"—the prisoner left the ring with me and went away with the cheque—it was then about 3.40—I don't remember that I said anything to him about the bank or the time—I filled up the counterfoil—I had to go to the Borough afterwards, on business, and as I passed the bank I went in and made a statement to the cashier—I was in the act of going to the Borough when the prisoner came into the shop, and I stopped to serve him—when he left I went up and put my coat and hat on, and went to the bank—the prisoner was not at" the bank when I got there—he came in some few minutes afterwards—my father saw the cheque before I gave it to the prisoner—T handed it across the counter, and my father took it from me.</p>

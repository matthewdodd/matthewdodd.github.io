                  </hi>.

Miller," and to the best of my belief it is in the handwriting of Luke—I have seen him sign his name—(<hi rend="italic">litter read</hi>)—it asked for payment of Campbell's share, and was addressed from No. 6, Elisabeth Place, Grundy Street, Poplar—an answer was returned, the draft copy of which I produce (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—it stated that the money could only be paid to Campbell personally, or by letter—on the 30th July a letter was received, dated the day previously, purporting to come from John Campbell, and I believe the signature to be in the handwriting of Lake (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—I pro<lb></lb>duce another letter dated 9th August, purporting, also, to come from Gamp<lb></lb>bell, which I likewise believe to be in the handwriting of the same prisoner (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—the writer requested that a printed form might be sent to a Mrs. Collins, in Ellerthorpe Street, as the first one had been lest—on the 6th September another letter, enclosing a form, and signed John Campbell, was received—the questions in the form were filled up by the applicants—they showed that he had served in the 3rd Madras European regiment, that he enlisted in London, that he sailed from this country on board the <hi rend="italic">Salamanes,</hi> that he was discharged at the time of the proclamation, and that he came home again in the <hi rend="italic">Tasmanian</hi>—there was also sent a certificate of identity, signed by the Rev. T. W. Noel, the minister of Poplar—for certain reasons I sent a letter to the address given, directing John Campbell to apply personally for the money—on the 23rd September the prisoner Bird came to the office, and handed me the letter and form that had been sent—I asked him if he was John Campbell, and he said that he was—I then put several questions to him, to see if he could identify himself—I asked him where he was barn,</p>

Miller" was shown to Bird, and when asked if it was his handwriting, he hesitated a little, and said he thought that it was—some pieces of paper taken by the policeman from Bird I believe to be in the handwriting of Lake—on one of those the words "John Campbell" are written three times, and on another is the regimental number, 999—since Lake has been in custody, a letter has been sent by him to the Military Secretary (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced and read</hi>), asserting that he had purchased Campbell's share of the prize-money for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I sat down on a seat in the park, and conversed with him. He handed me a letter of the 16th September, from the Military Secretary, and asked me if I would go in and receive it. He said that before his God there was nothing wrong in it. I thought I could go in, sign his name, and get the money, without doing anything wrong. I did go in, and hand in his letter, and ask for John Campbell's share of the prize money. I did not say that I was John Campbell. Mr. Walpole was not in the office then; another gentleman came in first. I did not answer Mr. G. Walpole, but the other gentleman. I did not, during the whole time I was in the office, say that I was John Campbell. If I have done wrong, it was unintentionally.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lake's Defence.</hi> I am a total stranger in England, having been born and brought up in India. I came to this country, where I had a little prize money due to me for my service in India, having served through the late mutiny. By not obtaining employment, I was brought to a state of abject poverty, destitution, and starvation. I found all attempts to get to India of no avail. I applied repeatedly to the authorities of the India office, for a passage back, by working for it, but my request was declined, and I thought this was hard treatment; and seeing that all my friends were there, I felt a yearning desire to get back to them. In the meantime I took the necessary measures to lay my case before the Government; but my complaint was ignored and discharged, on the ground of improbability. If inquiries were made into my case, I am convinced that British law and government could not tolerate such proceedings. I was subjected to very serious injuries, when coming from India, by the neglect of the owners of the ship, and I received no satisfaction. In January last I purchased John Campbell's share of the price money for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at Liverpool, and received a receipt in the name of T. Miller. I forwarded a letter to the India Office, and it was returned, with instructions to apply personally. Unfortunately for me John Campbell has left for Australia. I throw myself upon your lordship's clemency, and upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

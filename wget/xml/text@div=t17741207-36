               <p>Q. Is your house a part of the hall, or separate and detached from it?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. There is no part separate, I have the whole dwelling, there is no one resides in it but myself. On the first of November, when we were going to breakfast about nine o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070027"></xptr> we missed the milk pot; the maid servant then went into the back room, and missed most of the things mentioned in the indictment; upon which I went up into my office, and found the drawers in which I keep my money broke open, with a chissel, in a rough and clumsey manner. I took all the money out of it a day or two before, except three shillings in halfpence, which was gone. I missed a shirt out of a drawer, that is always left open for the washerwoman; and two silk handkerchiefs that I said the night before upon the desk in the store room; out of which the plate was taken. I saw the mark of a dirty foot upon the table: there is a square window to that room, but the steps go up by it, by which it is reduced to but half a window, that window was shut down, but it is never fastened; it appeared plainly that somebody had entered in at this window, and shut it down again; the window looks upon the steps in the main street, that goes up to the hall. I concluded from the circumstances of the robbery, the drawer being broke where I kept my money, and no other, and a pair of candlesticks being left, which were not silver, but plated, that the prisoner Pritchard who had lived with me four months, and had the care of my plate, and knew the drawers where I kept my money, must be concerned in this business. Pritchard left me on the 10th of September last, and he perfectly knew the situation of the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I never found any of them, the witnesses will give you an account of a chissel that was found?</p>

            . That half window in the store-room was shut down over-night, I was the last person in the room, the plate was taken from a closet in that room; while Pritchard was our servant, he always brought the plate out of the closet, and carried it in. Most of the plate, mentioned in the indictment, was in the closet, the pint mug was on the table under the window, six large table spoons, and six desert spoons were in the store-room on a table; I lost a satin cloak and a child's frock, which hung up in, the store-room; I missed fifteen spoons from the case in the dining-room, which were under the tea table, they were always kept covered with a gauze he has seen me cover them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cruttenden. Did not the contents of the other drawers appear to be tumbled, or attempted to be opened?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. None other but that where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you changed any other of your servants within a few months of this time?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I believe not, a maid servant had gone, but no other man servant but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this your own plate?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. Yes. I found the window shut, the street door the servant found ajarr, which I shut the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is your room?</p>
               <p>Vince. In Parker's-Lane, Drury-Lane.

Parker said, don't let us all go together, the people will stare so, as we go along the street. I said I did not want to go; it was no business of mine; we would go to another publick house, and wait for them; we went accordingly to the Crown and Horse-shoe, the corner of Bartlet's Buildings, in Holborn, and waited for them till five o'clock.</p>

Pritchard said, no, no, my lads, here is the money, and pulled out a guinea and a half, and some silver, and Thane pulled out the same, and said, I think my half guinea looks light; Pritchard said, I think mine does too, we will have them both weighed; accordingly they went to the bar, and had them weighed; they came back, and said, they were both rather too good weight; we sat down, and Pritchard asked us if we would have any supper; we made answer, it was rather lateish, we would have a pot of beer, or so. No, says he, we will have something to eat: and he sent Thane for some pork: he brought both roast and boiled; we ate it together, and had two or three pots of beer; and about ten o'clock we went from the house, because Thane was in a hurry; he was going to lie with a girl he knew: he said, he was in a hurry, he could not stay any longer: we parted with Thane at the door.

We went to Piccadilly and lay at an inn all night; I don't know the inn.

Shields desired us to go to the eating house, by Newgate, and said, he would bring Thane to us.

            ; they were all there before I came in: they were drinking some beer together. They were talking that they had committed a robbery at Surgeon's Hall. I said, what fools they were to talk of it there; as there were so many people about, they might be taken up directly. They were pretty much in liquor. We went out of the house, and went down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was talking of having done the robbery?</p>
               <p>Shields. Thane was the first that spoke of it. We went out and came back again into the house to have some more beer; when we came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070030"></xptr> out of the house they went away; and Wade and I went away, and lay at a house together. We were to meet them next morning: we did accordingly meet them at a house by Temple-Bar: I don't know the sign, it is up a little court, just through the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Chequers?</p>
               <p>Shields. I believe that is the sign. Pritchard was there by himself; Thane came in, after we had been there a little while: we had some herrings, and some beer: and in about an hour, or an hour and half after Parker came in, and a young woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all stay there till Parker came in?</p>
               <p>Shields. Yes; then we had some beefsteakes and onions for dinner, and a pot of beer, and then we went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said, while they staid there?</p>
               <p>Shields. They were talking about going for some money they had sold the plate for</p>
               <p>Q. Who were talking about that?</p>
               <p>Shields. Parker, Thane, and Pritchard: then we all five went to the Crown and Horse-shoe on Holborn-hill: we drank some beer; then they said, they were going to the place were they were to get the money: they came back, and said, they could not get it till five o'clock at night; and they desired. Wade and I to meet them at the same house, at nine o'clock. At nine o'clock the three prisoners came together: Thane went out to a cook's shop, and bought a piece of pork for supper. Before they began to eat, they disputed about two half guineas, and had them weighed; then the landlord got acquainted with Pritchard, they said, they had been neighbours together, and they had a pot of hot. Parker went away with them, but did not return to that house where they eat the supper: there was none but Thane and Pritchard came into that house; then we walked up Holborn: as we were walking along, Pritchard said, he had ventured his life with them, which one in a thousand would not have done: he said, they got in at the window; and the first thing they put their foot on, were some bottles, or glasses, he did not know which: and then he said, he went to look for the plate, and saw a pair of candlesticks, which they did not take. because he knew them to be French plate. He said; he went to the drawers where the money was kept; and got a bowl of half pence; that there was a cup they were looking for, but they could not find it; and he said that there was a kettle, or sauce-pan that had some mark upon it; they did not like to take it; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this talk?</p>
               <p>Shields. A going along from the house where we supped. We went that night as far as the Crown, in Broad St. Giles's; there I left Thane, Pritchard, and Ward, together. Parker said, he had bought a great whitish coat with a red cape, a green coat and a red scarlet waistcoat, and a hat, and buckles. He said, that at the Chequers. Pritchard said, he took a coat and some things out of pawn, and bought a pair of second-hand breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress did you see Parker in before this?</p>
               <p>Shields. All three of them had very ragged cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you often meet with Parker before?</p>
               <p>Shields. No, I never saw him but once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Thane dressed at the Chequers?</p>
               <p>Shields. He had a brown coat, and a brown waistcoat, the same he has on now, and a brown great coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Prichard and the other man any pistol?</p>
               <p>Shields. Yes, they had a pair of pistols; Thane bought them, and brought them into the Chequers, and they carried them along with them to St. Giles's: there they gave me the pistols to load: and I took them and carried them away: the next morning, Pritchard came to me, and gave me six or eight shillings for them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Pritchard say, and how did he behave, as he went up Holborn?</p>
               <p>Shields. He seemed glad, and talked about going to commit another robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was apprehensive of being taken up, or what would become of him?</p>
               <p>Shields. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Parker. These men have been with the thief-catchers, and they have fed them up, and said, if they would not swear against me in particular - I beg your lordship will ask. Shields, whether he has not been maintained by the thief-catchers.</p>

               <p>Q. to Wade. Have you been in goal?</p>
               <p>Wade. Yes, three weeks; then I was bailed out: I have been at my father's house ever since.</p>

            . The last hanging-day but one, Vince came to my house, and said, some people, that were concerned in robbing Mr. Cruttenden's house, were going to Tyburn in a coach; and mentioned the prisoners at the bar. I and Jenkens, and Jealous, went to the bottom of Wells-street, and took a coach to meet these people: when we came to the turnpike, as we stopped to pay, a coach came up, which Vince informed us was the coach; they were in that coach.</p>

               <p>Evans. The same morning. I went to one door and opened it, and desired Mr. Jenkins to jump into the coach at the other door: we found Pritchard and Thane in the coach: Pritchard put his hand inside his coat, and took out a handkerchief; I snatched it out of his hand, and said, if I saw him put his hand there again, I would blow his brains out: then I told them, I insisted upon every man in the coach putting his hands on his knees, and the first that refused I would make a couple of eyelet holes in his body: they did put their hands on their knees, and I brought them to Justice Welch's office. I searched Pritchard, and found this pistol (producing it) upon him was loaded, and he had powder and balls; in his coat pocket I found this chissel, (producing it) he had another pistol; but by some means they handed it from one to another, and it is gone. These buckles, (producing a pair of shoe and a pair of knee buckles) I took out of Thane's shoes and knees; they are new: I was informed they were bought with part of the money received for the plate, stole from Mr. Cruttenden: there were only Pritchard and Thane in the coach.

            . On Monday morning, the 17th of November, I received an information, by Vince, that Surgeon's Hall had been broke open; and he told me he knew something of the people concerned in it, and if we would go with him, he thought we might take them.</p>
               <p>We took a coach, about nine o'clock, and went as far as Tyburn turnpike; and when the coach, with the prisoners came up, we got in and took them. The pistol and chissel were found on Pritchard, and the buckles on Thane.</p>

               <p>Evans. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I found this knife (producing a large clasp knife) upon Thane; two or three days after I went to Surgeon's Hall, Mr. Cruttenden took me up stairs, and shewed me the drawers that was broke open. I brought the chissel with me, and by the marks made, in breaking the drawer open, I believe that is the chissel it was broke open with: it was the uppermost drawer on the right hand that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Give your reason, why you suppose it to be the instrument this drawer was broke open with?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I tried it to the marks, and it seemed to fit the marks pretty near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cruttenden. It did not match so particularly as to be very decisive; I can have the drawer here in a minute.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Cruttenden. Did you ever hear anything about the cup?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. At the Justice's it was mentioned, that Pritchard sought after the cup, and thought it a gold one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned any thing about the cup before that?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you two plated candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. Yes, I believe they are tutenage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned having these candlesticks, and their being left?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. No.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Had you a saucepan, that had a mark in the inside?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I have; it is called an urn, it has my arms upon it, it is plated, and looks like silver.</p>
               <p>Pritchard's Defence.</p>
               <p>If I had been guilty of it, should I have mentioned it to any body I did not know? I am in the same distress now, respecting cloaths, that I was before, I had an acquaintance, that lent me thirty-five shillings, I bought some stockings and shoes, and took a shirt out of pawn: the gentleman who is the prosecutor, is the last person I should think of robbing. I never saw a gilt cup in the house; if I had had this money, I must have had more cloaths to my back, or some more property upon me. I hope you will take it into consideration, not to take an innocent person's life away, without proof. I have no witness. The prosecutor is the last person I lived with; he is the only person I had to call, the last time. I never saw

               <p>Thane's Defence.</p>
               <p>The thing laid to my charge, I am quite innocent of; I never was concerned in the robbery at all; as to the money I bought my buckles with, I had about five shillings; I tossed up, and won about a guinea and half, and borrowed a guinea and half of one Mr. Mares, in Bishopsgate-street. I have not been from my master above six weeks. I was <rs id="t17741207-36-deflabel167" type="occupation">shop-man</rs>

               <p>Parker's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all about the affair; neither do I know the prisoners at the bar. I never saw Pritchard till I was in trouble; I never saw Thane, till I was before the Justice: the witnesses, are men of very bad characters: Vince was tried here, for robbing his master, two or three sessions ago, and I was a witness against him. I never saw Thane till we were before the Justice. Jealous came up to me and shook his fist at me, and said, he should do for me now. I have no friends in the world only God and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jealous. Was there any ill blood between you and him before?</p>
               <p>Jealous. No. I took him once, and got him to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that Vince gave you the information on Monday morning?</p>
               <p>Jealous. He spoke of it on Thursday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with James Charles Edmiston—we are tailors, and live in Gracechurch-street—the prisoner came to our shop about the 30th of Sept.—I do not recollect seeing him before that day—he said, "I want a suit of black; my name is Williams, 43, Mincing-lane; you have done something for me before"—I said, "I recollect the name, but not the face"—I took his instructions for making a suit of black, and asked the day it was to go home—he said on Friday, at four o'clock—he asked the price; I said, "4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the coat, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the waistcoat, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the trousers"—he said, "What will that be?"—I said, "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I suppose 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. will do for cash"—he said it was for cash—the clothes were made, and sent by our shopman, Charles Hemmings—he returned, but brought back nothing except the change which had been given him to take with the things—I saw the prisoner afterwards at the Lambeth police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hobday. I only knew of this order from the order-book—I sent the clothes home by our shopman—I gave him particular instructions not to leave them without the money—there was a black coat, waistcoat, and trowsers—I gave the shopman change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he came back about half-past five o'clock, and stated he had left the clothes—I went with him to the address immediately—I took a policeman with me, and went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not find the prisoner—I went again on Saturday morning—I did not find the prisoner then—I then went to the police-office, and asked the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate's advice—I did not see the prisoner till he was in custody—I had never seen him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When your shopman came back without either clothes or money, you were very angry with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not angry, nor quite pleased—I did not tell him that unless the money was got he should go out of my service—I never used any threat of that kind—I did not tell him I would not keep him—I did not give him warning—I did not say anything about the clothes, except that we were to go back and endeavour to find the man—I did not go or send to Mincing-lane before we supplied the clothes—the prisoner had said he lived in Dorey-street—I certainly went there that evening with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see Mr. Matthews that night—I went again the next morning—I did not see Mr. Matthews then—I saw him at St. Martin's workhouse—he was holding some office in the parish, and was landlord of the house where the prisoner was living—he said he considered the prisoner was perfectly respectable—I inquired if he had absconded, and Mr. Matthews said he had slept at home every night—I inquired about his employment—it is quite possible that Mr. Matthews said, "I have no doubt he will pay you, if you wait a day or two"—I do not recollect it now—if I said so at the Police-court, it was true—I do not recollect that I said in answer to that, "Very well, I will"—I will not swear I did not say so—I said, "I will endeavour to see you again before I take harsh measures"—I said that because I would not frighten the man away from his lodging, but with the intention of taking him into custody—I should not have taken him into custody if I had been paid.</p>

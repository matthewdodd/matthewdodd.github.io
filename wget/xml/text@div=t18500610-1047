                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 97). On 3rd June, I was on duty in Water-lane, Blackfriars, about a quarter before five o'clock—I was applied to by the prisoner's sister, and went to a house in Green Dragon-court, St. Andrew's-hill—I saw a great number of persons collected round the house—they were quiet—the door was open, I looked in, but saw no one in the pas<lb></lb>sage—I heard the prisoner in the room—he was not making a noise then—I did not hear any scuffling—I went in by request of the female, and as soon as I got to the room door I saw the prisoner coming towards me—he struck me a violent blow in the face—I had not touched him—the blow knocked me down in the room where be was—I got up, and we had a scuffle, and both went down together—he then struck me several times, and kicked me—I was getting off him, he was under me, and he fastened his teeth into the lower part of my thigh—I lifted him right up off the ground with his teeth hanging to me—I then gave him a knock on the side of the head, to knock him off—just then Narborough came up to my assistance—the prisoner and I were then down, partly on the step and partly in the passage—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> on to Narborough, and kicked and beat him—we secured the prisoner, he said, "Let me go quietly; I will go"—he went quietly till he got opposite where they are making a new sewer—he then made a violent push, to push</p>

               <p>us both down the sewer, which is fifteen or sixteen feet deep—some of the bricklayers assisted us past the sewer—the prisoner then went pretty quietly, and we took him to the station—I am still under the surgeon's care—I am disabled from doing duty in consequence of the wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 369). On 3rd June I was on duty in Earl-street, Blackfriars. I was beckoned by two gentlemen to go to a house in Green Dragon-court—I saw the prisoner and my brother-officer down together, partly in the passage and partly out—the prisoner was kicking him, beating him with his first, and biting him—I went, got the prisoner up, and then Montague got up—as soon as the prisoner got up he struck me—he kicked my shins several times, and bit at me—we endeavoured to take him to the station—I asked him if he would go quietly—he said, "I will"—when he got about the middle of the sewer, he made a great push, and said, "Go on," and he endeavoured to push us into the sewer; but the men who were at work saw it, and jumped across the sewer, and pushed us back.</p>

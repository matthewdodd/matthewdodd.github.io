                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ELIZABETH PIDDINGTON</hi>. I am the wife of John Piddington, of Bru<lb></lb>denell-place, New North-road. We formerly lived in Northampton<lb></lb>terrace—the prisoner came to live with me in March, and left me on the 14th of August—from something that occurred, I went to where she lived with a lady to whom I gave her a character—I saw the prisoner there and re<lb></lb>quired to look at her boxes—I there found these cambric handkerchiefs</p>

               <p>this other handkerchief, and these gloves—I asked her why she took them—she begged hard for mercy, and said one of them was not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I went, in company with a policeman, to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodgings, at Mr. Keene's, in Popham-street, and required to look other boxes—I found this shawl and this calico in them—she begged hard to be forgiven, and said she had not stolen the shawl, but had taken the materials and made it herself—I know the materials of which it is com<lb></lb>posed—they are the property of my employers, and were in my house foe she lived as servant.</p>

Q.</hi> What is your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am in the service of Whiteman, Tomms, and Co., silk mercers—this shawl is composed of a centre, a border, and some fringe—the border is my employers'—it is printed in their factory, and made only by them—they do not sell it but on shawls, and when it has passed through my hands—I swear this is our printing from the peculiarity of the pattern, and the printing, and the colours—it is quite impossible that other houses should print exactly like this—I have been eight years in the business, and am thoroughly ac<lb></lb>quaineted contained with printing.</p>

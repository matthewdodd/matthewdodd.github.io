                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Fox. On Friday evening. the 2nd of Feb., I saw the prisoner leave my master's premises, with something in his basket—I did not see him any more till I saw him in the Kitchen, and the policeman searching him—his basket contained potatoes and a bottle of milk—I heard him say to Mrs. Fox that the hoped master would look over it on account of his wife and family—I do not know whose property these things are, but I had seen this basket, with the potatoes and other things in it, under the hay in the cow-house.</p>

I found this property on the prisoner, at a quarter past five o'clock, on the 2nd of Feb.—he was coming out of Mr. Fox's yard—I asked what he had got in his basket—he said I might look—I asked him a second time, and he said potatoes, which he was going to take to Marshall, at the railroad police; that the were some his master had, and he was going to take them to change—I asked if his master knew it—he said, "Yes"—asked if his master was at home—he said, "No"—I took him back, and Mrs. Fox said he was not allowed to take any<lb></lb>thing off the premises—I took him out, and Mrs. Fox saw him throw some<lb></lb>thing away—I took him back, and found in his pocket three pints of oats, and two candles in his hat.</p>

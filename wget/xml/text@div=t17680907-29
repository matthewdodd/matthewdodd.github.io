I believe they had been removed out of their place in the night, they lay in a heap together: upon this alarm I began to think where the robber could get in; I went down the kitchen stairs, all the parlour-windows seemed to be fast; I observed the back kitchen-window was open, the upper sash was down, there appeared on the inside and outside ledges the print of a foot very clear, from thence I conjectured a person might get in there; I then sent for a watchman, and told him I had been robbed, and should be glad if he could give any account of any thing he had seen that might lead to a discovery; he said to me, Lord bless me, Sir, between two and three o'clock this morning a man came out of your house to light a candle; he told him he might light two if he pleased, he is here, and will give the account himself; I had at that time no man servant; this unhappy prisoner had lived with me in the year 1761, I believe he then might be 16 or 17 years old, he left me in April 1762; I could make no discovery, till on the 2d of August, about nine at night, or rather before, all of a sudden our maid came screaming up out of the area, and said, there is a man in the small-beer vault; I immediately unbolted the street-door, there were two chairmen, I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070023"></xptr> them to come in and assist; one stood to see that he did not get over the rails, and the other went in at the area-door; I stood at the top of the stairs, the chairman brought the prisoner up to the head of the stairs; I did not then recollect him, I asked him what business he had there, who are you, and what are you; he looked down, and said, his hat was throwed or blowed off, and he got over the rails to get it; I said, it would have looked better had you knocked at the door for your hat; he said, he was afraid of disturbing of me; I asked him what his name was; he said his name was

Dixon, a friend of mine, my name is Manners; I told him every thing his property should be returned him, but I had been robbed lately, therefore I should expect a good account of him before I parted with him; upon searching the place where he lay this instrument was found (producing a new tap-borer;) he was asked if it belonged to him, he denied it then; a person happened to come in, and said, Lord bless me, this is the young man that lived with you at the time of the coronation; I said to him, did you never live with me, and if he did not come from Lincoln; he said, no; I said, I believe you are the person; he was then carried to the watch-house, and the next morning before Mr. Welch; when I came there, I said to him, Will, I am very sorry to find you here on this occasion, you have very ill rewarded my kindness to you; he then acknowledged he had lived with me, and that he came from Lincoln, and his name was

            , I then very well knew him; one of the letters was addressed to him by the name of Capt. Dixon, at this Antigallican coffee-house, it was a letter from one Jones; Mr. Welch asked his name; he said it was Dixon, and allowed he had gone by the name of Capt. Dixon; he seemed to be much affected, and did not care to own any thing; Mr. Welch did observe to him, there had been several robberies about the town, and if he had any accomplices he might have an opportunity of saving himself; I made no promise to him, he did confess he was the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words Mr. Welch made use of, as near as you can recollect?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I think Mr. Welch very mildly said, if he had any correspondents in any other robbery he would do well to save himself, as he was a young man.</p>

               <p>Q What did you understand was meant by that?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. To turn evidence; the prisoner said he had none, and cried a good deal; at last he said he had been guilty of no other robbery; he was asked if he had any accomplices, or any body advised him to this; he said no body knew of it but one person; he was asked who that person was; he answered, it was Miss Jones; I know nothing of her, she was before Mr. Welch, she is a woman of the town; he was asked how he got into my house; he said he got in at a window, which I found open; he said he found one of the shutters open.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not understand the prisoner would have told you any thing of it, if Mr. Welch had not told him it was as a means to save his life?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I did understand at that time he expected I would not indict him capitally (which I have not;) Mr. Welch said, if he had any thing to say, no body should hear it, but he should go out of the room; he made no answer to it, but cried and said this woman had been the ruin of him.</p>

The prisoner came on 7th June—he said he was recommended there to buy a pair of boots—he chose a pair of boots and a pair of slippers—he ordered them to be sent to 8, Craven-buildings, Drury-lane, in a quarter of an hour, and he would pay for them—I sent them by Johnson, who was not to leave them without the money—these are them—they are my master's.</p>

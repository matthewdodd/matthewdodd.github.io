               <p>JOSEPH ROTHERY. I am son to the last witness. On Friday the 29th of December the prisoner came in for an ounce of tea, as I was taking down the cannister I saw him take the paper of starch from off the window and run out, I ran after him and halloaed out, stop thief; he was stopped; I picked up the starch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. Somebody threw him down. When I came up to him I found him down and the starch fell on the ground; I took up the starch and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON LOT. I am a baker. On Friday the 29th of December I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran to the door, I saw a porter trip the prisoner up, he fell with the paper of starch under him; young Rothery picked the paper of starch up; I secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I never had the paper of starch. I was running along, I heard somebody call out, I turned round to see and somebody knocked me down directly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

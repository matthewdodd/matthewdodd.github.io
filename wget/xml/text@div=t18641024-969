I am a member of the firm of Gough and Silvester, of Birmingham—we have an office in Ely-place—in December last year, the prisoner was in our employ as town-traveller—on 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> December, I spoke to him. about something not being quite clear in his accounts—that was the last time I saw him, until October last—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) we received from him on the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of October—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is payable to the order of Gough and Silvester, and the endorsement is in the prisoner's handwriting—he had no authority to endorse the name of the firm on cheques—the cheque was paid to him, and ought to have been forwarded to us—he has not accounted to us for the money.</p>

I was coming home from Newington between two and three o'clock in the morning—the prisoner came up to me, put her arms round me, and asked me whether I wanted * *—I said, "No"—she hugged round me, and would not let me go—when she got me four or five yards past the churchyard gate, she put her band into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and took out two crowns and two half-crowns—I heard it chink as she passed it to another female—she went across to the other and said, "What do you do here while I am engaged?"—I swear I had seen the money safe not a minute before she came up to me—I had had half a pint of beer and two glasses of gin and water in the course of the evening.</p>

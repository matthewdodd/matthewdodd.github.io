                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Casey. On 22nd July I sent the prisoner to Billingsgate-market, and received eleven dead salmon there, cut up, and put into a tub, which was put into the cart, and we came towards home—we went to a public house in front of the London Hospital—a man came out and spoke to the prisoner; then the prisoner came to me, and told me to send him into the bar; I did so, and the prisoner told me to put the salmon into the basket; I did so, and the man took it out of the cart—there was more <hi rend="italic">refuge</hi> of fish in the basket, but that was not taken, only the salmon—I should know the man again, but have not seen him since—the prisoner and the man were in the public house, talking together, while I was outside minding the horse and cart, after the fish was taken—I stopped there till the prisoner came out—my master had sent me under the prisoner, to do what he told me—we then went home, and delivered what we had in the cart, at West Ham—my master spoke to me about it next day, and I told him.</p>

The prisoner is in his employment—it was his duty to go to Billingsgate-market every morning with a hone and cart, and bring away the refuse fish—he went there on Tuesday, 22nd July, and brought home a quantity of refuse fish, but no salmon—that was not a remarkable thing, as I had never had any salmon before—the prisoner was not authorized to stop at any place that I am aware of—there were several tubs in the cart, some empty, and some with fish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish inspector, appointed by the Fishmonger's Company to superintend Billingsgate market. On 2nd July I delivered eleven salmon to the prisoner—they weighed 75lbs.; I cut them up, to prevent their being used for food, as they were not fit for use—we generally cut them up in pieces of 1lb. or 2lbs.—I put them into a tub in the prisoners cart, which comes daily for that purpose to the market.</p>

                  </hi>.

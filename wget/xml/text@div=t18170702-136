I worked at the Custom-House, under the prisoner; about seven week ago, he told me to take a bar of steel from under the bellows, and to follow him, we went out at the north gate, to his house on Tower-hill - He said it was his; we went on until we came to Ratcliff-highway, he then told me to put it into my house and to take care of it until he called or sent for it; it remained there about two weeks, he desired me on the Saturday night, to go home and fetch his bar away, which was at my house - He and Butler fetched it away that night; he told Butler to take it, and said it was his property-they took it.</p>

I went to Wedlock's house with him-he told me to take the bar, as it was his property. I followed him until we got to Ratcliff-highway, he said he did not like to go over Tower-hill - We went into Whitechapel, and stopped at a public-house - We got intoxicated, and were taken into custody.</p>

Sparrow and Wright's, in Smithfield, and that he had got the bill and receipt, but he had not; and that he gave 11d. per lb. for it last week. When Mr. Peto asked him about it, he said he bought it of the same people two years ago.</p>

On 28th November I was on duty, and, from information, I proceeded to the Harrow public-house—I there found a young man, whom I have since learned to be Donald McDonald—he was in bed, and was bleeding from the mouth—I called in a surgeon; and, on his advice I had him removed to Guy's Hospital—I afterwards attended an inquest, on his body—I have no doubt it was the body of the man I had seen at the public-house—I afterwards apprehended Asquith.

I live in Grange-road, Bermondsey, and am a tanner—on 28th November I left London, with a great number of other persons, to see a fight with Asquith and McDonald at Abbey Wood—the prisoners went there with me—I saw the fight—the prisoners' were McDonald's seconds—I saw the last round of the fight—I saw Asquith dose on McDonald—they both closed, and Asquith fell on McDonald—when McDonald fell, I heard him use the expression, "I am done; save my life."</p>

               <p>On the 12th of November last, a man came into our shop I had a suspicion of, he asked for some silks, some grave silks, upon asking what they were, he asked for a card of the shop and went out; this woman (Potten) came in very soon after, and asked for some white mode, and Cunningham also came in and asked if that was mode on the counter, I said, it was not, I called the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100144"></xptr> boy, and I went to the glass, and I turned, and saw Mrs. Pottan doubling this under her cloak, I immediately went to look at the parcel, and found a piece was gone, when she saw my master come into the shop she let it fall.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it fell from her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see it? - Yes, I heard it fall, and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Might it not have fallen off the counter? - No.</p>
               <p>Is that your master's sattin? - Yes, I know it by the marks.</p>

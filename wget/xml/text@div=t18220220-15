I know nothing of the prisoner myself - I lost my trunk the latter end of November, or beginning of December, 1820. It was in the one pair back room, I saw it about an hour before it was lost, (between three and five o'clock in the afternoon) - I do not know whether the outer door was latched. The house was let out in tenements, and the landlord did not live in it; I have the first floor, I locked the outer door of my apartment myself that day, and took the key with me - I came home about half-past four o'clock, it was light then, the trunk was gone, I have not seen it since, but have seen a silk shawl in pawn, which was in it. I did not see it for fifteen months after, I have found nothing else; it was worth 2 l., and cost a great deal more - the rest of the property stated in the indictment was in the trunk, and was worth above 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at Union Hall, that you lost it a fortnight before Christmas - A. A fortnight or more, I cannot say the day - It was on a Monday.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker in Fleet-street. I have a shawl which was pawned on the 30th of November, 1820. I took it in myself, from a woman whom I believe to be the prisoner's wife - I have frequently seen them together, they addressed each other as man and wife; the prisoner came a short time ago, for an affidavit of his losing the ticket; he said he had lost the duplicate of the shawl, and had sent his wife before to stop it, (she had been to stop it). I did not shew it to him; he spoke of it, as a shawl pawned in the name of Conner - I have the duplicate here; I gave him a printed form of affidavit, which I have since seen in Goff's possession.</p>

            . I lived last with Mr. Newcombe, of Bloomsbury-square. I know the prisoner, he asked me to pawn a shawl like this, which I refused, this was the latter end of November, 1820; he asked me also to pawn two white gowns, two white petticoats, a dark silk gown, a black silk cloak, and a table cloth; he and his wife asked me to pawn them at the corner of Seacoal-lane, I refused - they then asked me to pawn the shawl, which I refused. I called on the prisoner in Newgate, in December last, when he was imprisoned there; he asked me to do him a favour, I said I would, he said,</p>
               <p>"My wife has left me, and gone to live with another man, and she has got a shawl which will hang me; it came out of Legg-alley;" he gave me a note to carry to Mr. Gray, which I did - he told me to go and stop it before his wife got it out, as if she got it she would hang him, as it was one of the shawls taken from Legg-alley. At the time the robbery was committed in Legg-alley, in November, 1820; I was going to have my hair cut at Lumley's, which was the house it was committed at, and the prisoner came out of the house as I went in, with a large trunk on his shoulder; he went towards the bottom of Hart-street, and the next day, the prisoner came to my lodging, in a court in Fleet-street, and asked me to walk out with him, which I did; he took me into a gin shop in Fleet-market, where his wife and another woman were, they had two bundles, and asked me to have some gin with them, which I did, and on leaving the shop, they asked me to pawn the things; I had heard of the robbery, and that was the reason I would not - I did not know these were the things stolen, but was afraid, as they were dangerous characters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe he had the trunk himself. Have you not been to Bow-street, for passing bad money?</p>
               <p>The witness being informed that he had a right to refuse answering this question, declined.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you go to him in Newgate - A. He sent for me. I went backwards and forwards to see him till he came out, as he said he was distressed.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner, he said he bought the shawl of a man named Swiney; afterwards he said he did not buy the shawl, but bought a duplicate of it, and that it was in pledge at Guest's in Fleet-market, with a sheet - I went to Guest's, and searched the books, but could find no account of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What information did Barnacle give you - A. He said the shawl came from a crack, I asked how he knew that; he said the prisoner and his wife had quarrelled and the prisoner was afraid his wife would have him hung, and he gave him the affidavit to take care of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Barnacle sold the ticket of the shawl to my wife, it was pawned with a shirt, she redeemed it and pawned the shawl. If he knew I robbed the house, why not give information; he owes me money, and has robbed me - I said I would have satisfaction, and then he gave information.</p>

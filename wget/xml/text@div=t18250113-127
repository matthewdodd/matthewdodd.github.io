            . I was in the service of Mr. Nicholson. I saw the prisoner coming in, alone; I served her with a quarter of a yard of muslin, for 4 1/2 d. - she did not look at anything else. There were a great many pieces of muslin in the same wrapper. In about two hours Spooner brought the prisoner back, with part of two pieces of muslin, about ten yards and a half; I looked into the wrapper, and missed the two pieces. I am certain I did not see her take them. My master and a lad were serving in the shop at the time - I do not think either of them saw the prisoner take it; it is worth about 15 s.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at Shadwell. I took the prisoner in my shop, between two and three o'clock, I believe. I found two pieces of muslin in her apron - they were afterwards claimed by Mr. Nicholson; I asked where she got them - she told me it was no business of mine.</p>

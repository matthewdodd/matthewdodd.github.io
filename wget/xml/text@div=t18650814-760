               <p>my lodgings in the house of Mrs. Fidele Katzenstein—I was arrested by Mr. Hall on 5th December and taken to prison, Mr. Levin went with me—I did Dot see the defendant that day, Mr. Hall told me he was arrested—he had come with me from France to England to take a lodging for himself and his wife and daughter—I had known him about a year in Paris—he was in diffi<lb></lb>culties he had no occupation, he had been expelled from the Club where he had been for several years; that was in the Bourse—I had occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed him on some errands before I came to London—he came to the same house as myself in London, and three days afterwards sent for his wife, who came with her three daughters—I have lent him money out of charity, enough to prevent their leaving and to pay for their lodgings, and in England I lent him 5,000 francs for him and his wife and daughters to set up a Parisian laundry—that was in October—and on 24th or 25th November he came to me, told me he had no money to go to market and requested my charity—I refused to give them money and they requested me to lend them 3,000 francs on an inheritance to come—I gave them a bank note of 50f. to get rid of them and told him and his wife that they could not yet have spent the money which I had lent them; at my reckoning of their expenditure they ought to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—I did not see them again for some time—from the time I came to England till I was taken in custody I never told the pri<lb></lb>soner or any one else that I was going to America, or that I intended to leave England and go abroad; I came to London to stay here and die here—on 5th May the prisoner came to me in Whitecross-street prison, that was the first time I had seen him since my arrest—I did not speak to him but Madame Rey spoke of the affidavits concerning my departure for America, and he said that he had told a lie in saving so; but that Mr. Hall and M. Bouillon gave him 12,500f. to lie, and if I was willing to give him the same price he would say the truth but he should be obliged in that case to leave London immediately, because Mr. Hall would get him arrested, as he was cunning enough to get him arrested beforehand if he had any suspicion: as to the oath he was to take, that he did not care because English justice was a comedy, and as to taking an oath he would take as many as might be re<lb></lb>quested from him at that price—I saw him again at Westminster at the trial but did not speak to him—I was in prison from 5th December to 16th June—I was taken in custody to Westminster to give my evidence—I heard the prisoner examined and cross-examined through an interpreter.</p>

Donflou after his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Bouillon and his wife—they gave me 7,500 to 8,000f. out of 40,000f. which ought to have come to me under the will—on the day M. Donflou died the official seals were put on everything that was for his personal use; I had two wills of M. Donflou—shortly after that, on 1st December, I was charged with having abstracted a certain number of shares, by the adopted children of M. Donflou—the officers came to lock me up on 4th December, 1862—after M. Donflou's death and before the officers came, I sold fifty-five Orleans Railway shares, twenty-five coupons were my own property, coming from the Orleans railway, five other coupons were from shares belonging to my sister, the capital of which had been put into the lands of M. Donflou, and the twenty-five other coupons had been given to me by him for house expenses—I was charged with ab<lb></lb>stracting or stealing fifty-five shares of the Orleans Railway, belonging to the deceased, and fifty shares of the Lyons and Mediterranean Railway but I had not done it—I do not know whether I was accused of stealing twenty-five shares of the Paris Omnibus Company, but they were demanded of me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140022"></xptr>
               <p>—I wish to explain; on 4th December, 1862 I was brought from my house, M. Bouillon the husband of the adopted daughter of M. Donflou came, accompanied by a commissary of police and two men, and asked me if I had in my possession coupons of Orleans Railway Shares, I said, "Yes"; he said, "Have you silver plate?"; I said, "Yes"; he said, "You are to be brought to the Prefecture of police"—I wrote at once to the Juge d' Instruction in order that he should have me brought before him and I was afterwards in<lb></lb>terrogated by him on four different occasions—he did not say, "You are charged with having fraudulently abstracted to the injury of the heirs of M. Donflou, thirty-five shares of the Paris and Orleans Railway, fifty of the Lyons and Mediterranean, and twenty-five of the Paris Omnibus Company," he only asked me how many shares I had in my possession—I did say, "I do not know what has become of the shares which are claimed of me"—from 5th December, 1862, to 24th April 1863, I was kept in prison with the threat that I might be kept there for two years—I maintained and still main<lb></lb>tain that I had not abstracted the shares I was asked about—I denied it be<lb></lb>cause I had not done it—I wish to explain, on the eve of the death of M. Donflou he told me that by our marriage I should be entitled to half of his fortune, but he said, "As I am unfortunate enough not to be able to live to fulfil my duty, here are 100,000f. which I give you"—the result of that enquiry was that I was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and it was in order to take from me my plate and my shares in the Orleans Rail way that I was put in prison—I came out on 20th October, 1863, and on the same day that I came out the females of the defendant's family came to ask for me and I made their acquaintance—after I left prison I made the acquaintance of Mmlle. Rey—I did not see her while I was in prison—when I came out I went to live at the same hotel as the defendant—he was not a waiter there or anything at all—his wife and daughters had left him, not to give him bread—I remained in the same house with him till 1st July, 1864, when I left—I did not see him constantly during that time—I gave them hospitality for two months when they were living with me, and when they left I paid the rent of their rooms—I went to Bordeaux in July, and while there I think I wrote this letter without date (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Mdme. Lafourcade—as soon as I went to Bordeaux I applied to all the defendant's family for charity for him and then I wrote this letter—I left Bordeux and went to Paris in August, being called there by the Minister of Justice; and when I had settled all my business with the solicitor, I sold all I had and came to England in Sep<lb></lb>tember—at the end of August or in September I gave the defendant 50 Lyons and Mediterranean shares to sell for me, and 25 Orleans Rail way shares, and 25 Paris Omnibus shares—I had no knowledge of those shares when I was examined before the Juge d' Instruction—the defendant handed me over 94,000f. in French bank notes, out of the 100,000f. that M. Donflou told me he gave me when he handed me those shares—I gave the defendant 100f. for his trouble—he accompanied me to England, and we arrived on the 25th or 26th September, and went to the Hotel de Ville de France in Dean-street—I passed there by the name of Bertin, and also of Valentin, since the proceedings in France—nobody called me Bertin at the hotel, as nobody knew me, my letters came there to me in the name of Valentin—the ladies of the defendants' family called me Bertin, because I had told them not to call me Donflou any more—I do not know whether the defendant went by the name of Edward there—I always heard him called Jean or Lafourcade—I had never been in London before 26th Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1864; I had never seen it—I mean to say that I had not been in</p>

               <p>London in the early part of the same September—Mr. Hall made Coulan go up stairs with me when I went to prison, and had told me that he was in custody also; and coulan had shown me the warrant to arrest him—I did not say to Coulan, "Directly you regain your liberty, go to the hotel where I lodged, and ask them to give you a black leather bag"—I may have expressed a desire to have my bag—I did not say to Coulan, "If the Bouillons get that bag I am lost"—I had nothing to fear from the Bouillons—I did not say, "Get possession of that bag at any cost and get away to France with it"—if I expressed a desire to have it, I repeat it now—there was property concealed in the lining of that bag—I had taken a pretty large sum that very morning to the Union bank, and there was left in the bag 30,000f. in bank notes, and 14,000f. in coupons of railway shares—they were the coupons of the very railway shares which had been sold for me by the defendant—after the defendant left the hotel I went three or four times to Berwick-street, where he had started as a wine merchant, because he wanted to hire me the apartments on the first floor—Coulan was with him in Berwick-street, as friend and interpreter—Coulan twice accompanied me with his wife from the house in Berwick-street to the hotel—before he was entirely residing with Lafourcade he lodged with his wife in Jerrard-street—I persist in my statement that on 24th or 25th November I refused to give them 3,500f.; but I may make a mistake as to two or three days in the date—it was on 25th or 26th November, about 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

Houett, an <hi rend="italic">avoue</hi>, to represent me before the French tribunal, but he sold himself to a solicitor at Versailles—I made a complaint against him, which resulted in bringing me a few thousand francs, and I received something from the Minister of Justice besides—the <hi rend="italic">avoue</hi> continued to prosecute, he was not punished for having broken the official seal, but he received a reprimand—the coupons which the defendant sold for me in Paris, for which I gave him 100f. for his trouble, came from the packet which M.

I live at 69, Davies-street, Berkley-square, and am a porter—I came to London last October, and went to the Hotel de Ville de France, kept by Mr. Katzenstein—I found Madame Valentin and the prisoner there—I had never seen either of them before—after I had been there a little time, the prisoner and his wife and family left the hotel and went to 56, Maddox-street, and I went with them—soon after leaving, he told me that he would send Madame Valentin to the galleys for ten years—I asked him the reason—he said he could not tell me that day—he told me two days after that it was about some shares which she had stolen from a M: Donflon, with whom she had been cohabiting thirty-two years, and that he would have her in prison because she had promised him money, and did not keep her promise, and if I would serve him and help him in the case, I should be handsomely rewarded; that I need not fear, for it was not for my proper account that I was acting; and that he would have Madam Valentin arrested soon—he said it was for revenge—he wrote to Paris to his daughter Matilde, in order to obtain M. Bouillon's address, who was the son-in-law of M. Donflou, and a few days after he received a letter from Paris from his N. daughter, in which she gave him the address of M.

Berwick-street—the first time was about the middle of November—I have X. seen him with the prisoner, but was not present at the interviews—he Y. came about 11 o'clock, and went away at 1 or half-past—after he left, the Z. prisoner said that Mr. Hall would give him 12,000f. if he would give his AA. statement against Madam Valentin, and that he should do so. and accept the BB. 12,000f.—that was about 12th November—I saw Mr. Hall at the prisoner's CC. two or three days afterwards, but was not present at the interview that day DD.—Mr. Hall afterwards said he wanted the prisoner's statement directly, but EE. the prisoner said he would not give it without money; that Mr. Hall had FF. promised to make an agreement, and he would then accept—he made the GG. same communication to his wife in my presence; she said, "Well, at any HH. rate, if you have no money at present, we shall have 12,000f. at the end; do II. it"—two or three days after that, the prisoner said that he came from Mr.</p>

Bouillon—I asked him what he required from me—he said, "Only to corroborate my statement"—he did not tell me what I was to corroborate—I said that I did not know Madame Valentin, and it was very strange that he made such a proposal—he said that I need not fear, I was acting for my own sake, and he would reward me—he said, "As you understand both English and French, you will be very useful to me"—he had previously engaged me as his interpreter—two days afterwards I went with him to Mr. Hall's office—I think it was about 23d or 24th November—we saw Mr. Hall in his private office—he asked the prisoner who I was—he said, "It is my nephew; you need not fear, you can speak before him"—I am not his nephew—Mr. Hall asked him if he had made the written statement—he said, "Yes," and the prisoner signed an agreement—Mr. Hall said that it was an agreement for the deposit of the 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after the prisoner had signed the statement, Mr. Hall said, that to have her arrested under lock and key, it would be necessary to state that she was going to America—I do not think any other gentleman was present—the prisoner said that if it was necessary to say it, it must be said—the prisoner and I left the office with Mr. Hall and went to the London and Westminster Bank, Temple-War branch, where Mr. Hall gave a cheque to a gentleman at the counter, and the prisoner and Mr. Hall signed a book—the gentleman gave Mr. Hall a paper, which he gave to the prisoner, and said, "I hope you will have that money soon"; the prisoner said, "I hope so"—I went back, to the best of my recollection, to Mr. Hall's office, but the prisoner was not with me—I called on Mr. Hall next day, and the prisoner was with me—I went with Mr. Hall from his office to Chancery-lane at a little before 5 in the evening, to a place which I found out after<lb></lb>wards to be the Judges' Chambers—the prisoner was not with us—Mr. Hall there presented a paper to me, and I signed it—I did not read it, nor was it read to me—Mr. Hall also signed it—Mr. Hall and me each took the book and kissed it, and something was said to us, but I did not know then that it was an oath—I went next day with the prisoner to Mr. Hall's office—we saw him and his brother, and a French <hi rend="italic">avocat</hi>—Mr. Hall said that he had not succeeded in obtaining the arrest of Madam Valentin yesterday, and one of the Mr. Halls said that something must be <hi rend="italic">made</hi> to have her under lock and key as soon as possible—the prisoner said, "Make it strong this time"—we went out and came back a little time after, when a paper was ready which the prisoner signed—that was the paper I looked at when I was called this morning—I do not recollect whether it was signed at Mr. Hall's office, or at 13, Gray's Inn-square—I went with the prisoner and the two Mr. Halls to 13, Gray's Inn-square, and was present when Mr. Cree ad<lb></lb>ministered the oath to the prisoner—I heard Mr. Charles Kennedy Hall interpret the oath to him—he interpreted it correctly—he also interpreted the affidavit—the prisoner afterwards told me that he had obtained Madame Valentin's arrest—about 8 o'clock on the morning of 5th December, Mr. Hall came to Berwick-street, where the prisoner and I were staying—I had not seen Madame Valentin in the meantime—he said to the prisoner and his wife and others, "To-day is the day appointed for Madame Valentin's arrest"—there was a Sheriff's officer with him—Mr. Hall told me to watch till Madame Valentin came out of the hotel in Dean-street, and give a</p>

LAFOURCADE</hi>")—the counterpart was signed by me, I kept this one and he the one which I signed—up to that time he had not disclosed to me the person described as the thief, but had spoken of the thief as <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—on my return to my office and within half an hour after that agreement was signed, I heard Madame Valentin's name in connection with it—I had at that time learned nothing about her movements or probable movements, and did not know where she was—on the day after I received the information from the prisoner I went to the Bow-street police-court,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140031"></xptr>
               <p>Coulan went with me—the same afternoon that the deposit was made, be<lb></lb>fore five o'clock, Coulan had handed me this paper with information, I think that was on the 23d, but it may have been on the morning of the 24th, before we went to Bow-street—it was not precisely an application at Bow-street, it was a mere submission of documents—up to that time there was no idea of a capias, I never thought of it and had not the least idea it would apply—there was no communication with the prisoner about his ma<lb></lb>king an affidavit for a capias—the paper that has been put in in Coulan's writing refers to the criminal proceedings—I got the information as to the possibility of Madame Valentin going to America, from Coulan—I mean that statement, it was on the way back from Bow-street—the prisoner was not present but Coulan repeated the statement next day in the prisoner's presence—Coulan gave me verbal information in addition to what was in the written statement—the first application to a Judge at Chambers was made late in the day on 24th November, on a joint affidavit of Coulan and myself—it was prepared in Coulan's presence and he read it—we were sworn on the same testament at the same time—the next application was made on the following day on a more explicit affidavit of myself and an affidavit of the defendant—I had had no conversation with him before that as to the probable intention of Madame Valentin to leave the country, but I had re<lb></lb>ceived the information from Coulan before—upon that a capias issued and on 5th December she was arrested—I had very considerable communications with Paris in that interval—the execution of the capias was purposely delayed—I did not when she was taken say that Lafourcade was in custody or that Coulan was arrested—I went with her to the lock-up in Bream's Build<lb></lb>ings—Coulan remained there after I tot and afterwards made a statement to me in consequence of which I saw Mdme. Valentin, who denied all know<lb></lb>ledge of the shares or coupons—in the afternoon I went to Katzenstein's to serve process on him in an action of detenue, for detaining part of Bouillon's property, and before I left the place I saw that Coulan had possession of a bag—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there are some brass things on it and a ticket—there is no key that I know of—it was opened in this way. (<hi rend="italic">Bending the iron</hi>)—I did not open it, Coulan emptied it of all its apparent contents, and it was thought to contain nothing further, when in this corner some lumps about as big as walnuts were felt, thereupon it was forced a little more open and the lining was pulled out a little, and between the lining and the leather was a little bag carefully sewn up which we opened and out came three bundles of coupons—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of them, these are all of the Lyons Railway Company, and these of the Paris Omnibus Company—the earliest coupon of the Omnibus Company is 1st January, 1863, and the latest 1st July, 1864—there are four sets, January and July 1863, and January and July, 1864—those of the Lyons Railway are 1st May, 1862, to 1st May, 1864, also four sets—I took possession of them but not of the Orleans then—there were also in the bag some sleeves, collars and small articles of dress, a bottle of scent, and a case with two pair of spectacles in it—there were no l,000f. bank notes—Coulan retained possession of the bag, all the other things being put back except these coupons—one morning in December when I reached chambers I found the bag on my table, tied up in a newspaper but who left it I know not—the same things were in it ap<lb></lb>parently—I put it aside on the top of a book-case folded up in paper and tied with string and there it remained till the day of the trial, at least it was produced once in the meantime—I have received from the prisoner some sale notes of shares which exactly correspond with the coupons found in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140032"></xptr>
               <p>bag—these shares pass from hand to hand and the coupons can only be cashed at the Company's office, they must ultimately be paid by the Com<lb></lb>pany—a subsequent action was commenced against Madame Valentin by M. Bouillon after the discovery of the coupons in the bag, in consequence of fresh instructions from France; it was an action in trover for the shares themselves, the first action being for the coupons—they were both tried and the defendant was a witness—a M. Maniere acted as solicitor for Madame Valentin, I can hardly say whether he was her solicitor at the time of the first capias—I was only in communication with him three or four days after the arrest—Madame Valentin referred me to him as her solicitor on, I think, 8th December—he acted as her solicitor at the first trial on 6th February, when both actions were tried as undefended, and afterwards a new trial was permitted, and then the larger action was to be tried and the second was to abide the event; one was tried and the other only formally tried—I had two or three interviews with M. Maniere when he was acting as her solicitor and all notices were served at his office.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you enter those causes as un<lb></lb>defended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> they were marked undefended—that was the end of January or February—they were entered for trial for the first sitting in Hilary Term, 12th January—the first cause was ripe for entering, but the other was not ripe for trial; the pleadings were not completed—having com<lb></lb>menced an action, I made the first a remanet until the second was ready—the order to hold Madame Valentin to bail was in the sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I obtained an order to detain her in the sum of 2,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I issued a writ against Katzenstein, and took a copy of it with me to serve him personally—there was an original to it—the two papers produced yesterday and marked, emanated from my office—they are in my clerk's writing; one of them purports to be a copy of a writ of summons to institute an action against Auguste Coulan in the Court of Exchequer, at the suit of Guillaume Bouillon and Frances Bouillon, his wife—there was never an original to that, that I know of—it comes from nay office—I believe it to have been copied from the original in the action brought against Madame Valentin, and for months afterwards I believed it was a copy of that—I know now that it was not directed to Coulan—I first saw it when it was produced at Westminster last January; I never saw it before in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know as a fact, that when Madame Valentin was arrested on 5th December, Coulan had in his possession that which purported to be the copy of a writ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know he had not—I know that on the evening of that day he had not a paper which purported to be a legal paper from my office—I had an interview with Madame Valentin in Coulan's presence about 2 o'clock that day—she was arrested at a little before 10 o'clock that morning, and I went to see her in the course of the day at Bream's-buildings—I had previously accompanied Coulan and the Sheriff's officer in a cab from the place where she was arrested, to the lock up; I was the only person who could explain in the French language—in the evening of that day when I had a conversation with Madame Valentin, I did not, referring to Coulan who was in the hall, speak of him as "This poor fellow."</p>

               <p>only one in my office who could explain to the defendant the nature of the arrest, and explain the circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have seen another document here—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purports to be what; look at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This purports to be a copy of the writ of capias—there was an order made by Baron Martin of what this is a copy; not to arrest Coulan, but this does not purport to be a copy of Coulan's writ—this is not a copy—there never was an order made by Mr. Baron Martin at my instance to arrest Auguste Coulan—as to the other paper, I never saw it till January—I know that neither of these papers were in existence on 5th December, nor on the 6th—I gave directions for them to be written, and I have my books here to show it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you gave directions to a clerk to make this which pur<lb></lb>ports to be a copy of a writ of which there never was an original, and this which purports to be an order of Mr. Baron Martin which never was made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave directions on 5th December, that Coulan might have copies of Valentin's writ of capias—I handed these two papers to Coulan, I was going into the office, and I said, "Tell them they are to make copies of those for you"—one is in the writing of a clerk named Barker, and the other of a clerk named Goden—I was examined at the trial at Nisi Prius, and when I was asked, "Did these writs come out of your office?" the papers were, I believe, put into my hand, and I think I said there might have been an original writ in a very few minutes if something had not hap<lb></lb>pened, and there would have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked to repeat your answer, and you say, "Yes. there would have been very shortly, if we had not found that the man to whom it is directed was willing to assist us": you say you thought that was a copy of the writ issued against Madame Valentin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, "the man to whom it is directed," refers to Coulan—Coulan had reported to me that he had been authorized by Madame Valentin to procure this bag which contained matters which would compromise her, he had attempted to get it from the hotel-keeper, who refused, and therefore I sued him, and on being served with the writ, he gave up the bag to Coulan, who gave the coupons to me, and afterwards said, "Am I safe with regard to these?"—I said, "If you like I will return you the coupons; you may keep them;" but I kept this reservation in my mind that I would keep my eye on him—I said that I should have "run them through," by which I meant that I should have sued anybody he handed them to, and anybody that that person handed them to, until they were in safety; I knew these people very little, and I was obliged to be very cautious how I dealt with them—this was on the 6th, the day after I had them, he came and asked me whether he was safe, and I said, "If you are afraid, I will hand them back to you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does this explain your giving him this capias two days afterwards, because you offered them back, and he declined to take them, therefore there was no reason to have writs prepared against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say I should have sued him had I seen any intention on his part to run away with the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are asked to explain about the sham writs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had been pre<lb></lb>sent in the cab when Madame Valentin was served with a copy of the capias and of the writ, and she believed him to be a fellow prisoner; he was calling continually all day, and he said, "I wish you would let me have copies of those papers which you gave to Valentin"—they were for his own information, not only as to the nature of the proceedings but of getting information as to the nature of the property.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140034"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked to account for them, and you said, "I had those copies made for an original to be prepared in case of necessity?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see that that is explained afterwards; at the time those writs were handed to me I bad not the least recollection of them, I supposed them for the time to be copies of the writs against Valentin, afterwards, when I found that they had been handed to him, they said that he asked to have his name put in—I said in my former examination that I supposed they were prepared to have originals made from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the proper course of proceeding, having brought an action against Madame Valentin, what business had you to give what purported to be copies of the process to Coulan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me for copies, and I let him have them, because he was in the confidence of Valentin, and I believed I was dealing with a very clever thief—I did not instruct papers to be made in my office and given to him that he might flourish them about as a terror to Madame Valentin, or other persons, certainly not—there was an original writ in Madame Valentin's case—it was not my only object in going in the cab that I was anxious to see Madame Valentin arrested, but also to see that she was the right person, and to explain to her in her own language the nature of the case—these papers were made out pursuant to my direction, but not as I directed them to be made out—it was my sup<lb></lb>position at first that an original could be made in case of necessity—it was not till my examination at the trial at Nisi Prius had proceeded some way, and I saw the direction it was taking, that it dawned upon my mind, I have since referred to my books, and now it is perfectly clear; you will find afterwards that it is fully explained—I will refer to my books if you wish it—these entries are in my own writing—here is an entry on 8th December; it would be entered on the evening of the 8th or the morning of the 9th, "Copy writ for Mr. Coulan; copy capias for him"—this is my day-book—I have a diary in which I post appointments—the action is still pending, and there are the names of persons mentioned here, but I do not object to the Jury seeing the book, if you will refer to the 5th you will find an account of the arrest—I do not think I had an interview with Mr. Maniere, Madame Valentin's attorney, on the Thursday when the entry was made—if you let me look at the book I will tell you—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the book</hi>) I do not believe I saw him for a week afterwards—I did not see him on the 8th—I had no interview with him at all—I keep an appointment-book—this is my diary—I have no other book in which I make original entries day by day—this is written partly by me and partly by my partner—I did not on the 8th direct anybody to confer with Mr. Maniere on my behalf about this matter—you have got hold of the wrong name; it is Manners, and not Maniere, that is written there, but it is in reference to this matter—I do not think I have here the book in which I enter appointments, but I can get it in twenty minutes—the writ in Madame Valentin's case was issued on the 24tb, and the order to hold her to bail was on the 25th—these two papers, which were called on the trial sham writs, are dated 25th November, the very same day, they are copies—I did not allude to Coulan as "This poor fellow,"I do not think he was referred to in the least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked the question, "Do you remember saying, you are an actress of great merit, but you are not so clever as to succeed, you have brought many into trouble by your tricks, this poor young man Coulan was arrested through your tricks," did you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my answer was not "This poor young man I might have said"—it is obvious that part of the question is run into the answer; it is not English as it stands; it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186508140035"></xptr>
               <p>should be "This poor young man; I might have said that she was an actress, because I understood she had been on the stage"—there is something left out there—I did not make that answer; I may have been mis<lb></lb>understood—Coulan was present at the interview with Madame Valentin—I never heard him spoken of as "This poor young man."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not further asked, "Was Coulan there at the time? I believe he was—I believe he did not say one word, and he has told so many lies I do not know what is the truth. When did you know he was arrested? I knew it after he had done it to get me back the coupons." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The coupons were delivered over directly afterwards—I had them the game day, I think it was, I did not know of this until some time after the coupons were got—I wish to point out that there are manifest inaccuracies in part of that copy—on the day of the arrest, after Coulan had an interview with Madame Valentin in the lock-up, he came to me and repeated that being alone with her in her room she said to him, "How comes it that you are arrested with me?" "Thereupon," he said, "I took my cue and said nothing"; that she said, "You cannot be kept in prison very long; when you go out, go to my lodging, and get a bag you will find there, and make away with it, hide it, burn it, or go to France with it"—in consequence of that proceedings were taken, and the hotel-keeper gave up the bag afterwards—it was found that the bulk of property claimed could not be traced, and Coulan continued to act out the character of fellow prisoner for two days longer for the purpose of ascertaining who she was in communication with, in order that the property might be traced—that was about the 7th or 8th, and I was aware that she was under the impression that he was a fellow-prisoner—I knew that his scheme was to pretend that he had been arrested, and that he was carrying it on for three days, but the idea originated with Madame Valentin—it was done with my knowledge for two or three days—the papers were made by my clerk on 8th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to persevere in telling my Lord and the Jury that on that day when they were made you did not know that it was process against Coulan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was informed when I returned that they had been made and that his name had been introduced, but that was after they went out of my hands—I was taken quite by surprise in the trial—I attached so little importance to it, that of course in six months the fact itself had passed from my mind—it dawned on me for the first time on the trial; I had no notion of sham writs—I saw what it was intended to impute to me, I was asked, "Are those in the writing of your clerks?"—I knew on the same afternoon that Madame Valentin's writs were copied and that Coulan's name had been substituted—I believe it was on the 15th that I first saw M. Maniere, for, strange enough, I was in the very act of preparing the affidavits to hold her to bail and I had him shown into another room—he said that he was going to get her discharge as she was not going to leave the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give instructions to anybody to put the name of Coulan in the writ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; whoever did so it is in the writing of my clerk, without any suggestion or order from me—at my interview with Madame Valentin at Bream's-buildings at which Coulan was present, I gave her the full particulars of the claim made against her for the shares and the coupons we were seeking to recover; she said that she knew nothing whatever of the coupons or shares; I said, "You cannot say that for I have received documents from Lafourcade which disprove that fact"—she said, "I know no one of the name of Lafourcade."</p>

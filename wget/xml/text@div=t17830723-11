             of York, bookseller; I went to Sampson Wright, and got a search warrant, and as soon as we had taken the man, he owned the whole affair, and pointed out a number of books that were my property; we found him at a house in Round Court, I was present, and asked him to point out my property, desiring him particularly to point out none but what was mine; the constable then seized him. I told him I have you at last, for says I, you have had no mercy on me, you have robbed me considerably; I had sufficient now to convict him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him it was better for him to say where the rest were, because you wanted to get the rest? - He cried out for mercy, and the children cried for mercy; I never made him any promise whatever.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing more to him? - I do not recollect I did; he said he stole these books from me while he worked for me.</p>
               <p>(The books produced.)</p>
               <p>- ATKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>These are the books, and the prisoner pointed out several more; these I picked up and sealed in the presence of Mr. Cadell; I went to the house and enquired if Mr. Robins was at home, the child said, yes, the wife ran down stairs, I said, is your spouse at home, she said yes; I ran after her, and there was nobody but the man; he said to Mr. Cadell, for God's sake Mr. Cadell, have mercy upon me for the sake of my family, and I will shew you the books; I came down before Mr. Cadell; I believe it was after Mr. Cadell said, we have got you; he took down three or four large piles of books, and then he went to the other side; he took out of his pocket his watch, and his pocket book, I took that, he said there was an account of Mr. Cadell's books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I believe he thought that would have satisfied Mr. Cadell? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He took down almost all the books? - He did, and Mr. Cadell said, if they are not mine, I will not take them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cadell. There was one book that was not bound as I bind my books, and I objected to taking it, and he said, that is yours, for I took some unbound, and bound them afterwards.</p>
               <p>- EVANS sworn.</p>
               <p>Passing through Round-Court, I saw some books which I suspected were Mr. Cadell's property. I saw two books which I had seen at Mr. Cadell's house; I bought them, and paid 2 s. for them, they are Sherlock's Sermons, I shewed them to Mr. Cadell; (Mr. Cadell deposed to the books) I bought them of the prisoner's wife; I then went before the Magistrates in Bow-street, and I returned back with a search warrant to the prisoner's house; the moment he saw Mr. Cadell, he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take so much notice of the books to know them again? - I have frequently dined at Mr. Cadell's house, and had seen them there repeatedly, there is writing in the front page, in a handwriting that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. Cadell promissed me he would not hurt me, if I would give up the property, and I did so immediately.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who all gave him a very good character, and said he had a wife and four or five children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Joseph Baugh, a clothier, of 107 and 108, Poplar—I sleep on the premises—the two houses are thrown into one, internally—on 22d April, I went to bed at half-past 10, or a quarter to 11—we close at 10—the premises were then safe—I was alarmed about half-past 1 o'clock by the barking of a dog, and saw the reflection of a light in the glass, it appeared to come from the end of the shop—I jumped out of bed and ran for a rattle, with which I made an alarm—I saw a man running down the back yard, but could not discern who it was—there is a long garden at the back of the house—a person came, and I went into the garden, and saw several things lying there which had been on the premises over night—coats, waistcoats, trousers, shirts, and drawers, value altogether, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some of which had been on the shelves, and some on the counter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 214). On 23rd April, about half-past I in the morning. I heard a rattle springing—I ran to the prosecutor's shop, and asked where I could get in—I went in through the butcher's adjoining, and over the wall, where I saw the prisoner running away, without shoes or stockings, from the back of the house to the far end of the garden, where I found him—there is a wooden fence there, three feet high, and a ditch—I caught him just as he was getting over the fence, and we both went head foremost into the ditch, where we both became insensible through the mud and water—we got up and fell again, and I being the stronger man, managed him, or he would have smothered me—I did not leave go of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police man, K</hi> 138). I heard the rattle springing, and went with Watkinson to Mr. Baughs, and saw the prisoner in the garden running away with something in his hand; I said, "Here he goes and he dropped it at the edge of the ditch—I went there and found three pairs of trousers, which the Magistrate ordered to be given up as they were ordered goods; also these other articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) outside the back door of No. 107—the window had been opened, and the shutter put down—that could be done from the outside—I went to the ditch and saw Watkinson and the prisoner struggling together—I found this candle at the bottom of the garden where the prisoner was captured.</p>

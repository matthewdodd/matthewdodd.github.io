D. Chappell, Taunton, Somerset"—any body in the street could read it—next day, the 24th, Walker came to the distillery with this letter, and the memorandum which is appended to it—I asked him some questions—Mr. Seager was standing behind him—in consequence of what passed, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., having marked it first, by Mr. Seager's directions—this order was not quite sepa<lb></lb>rated from the letter when it was brought—Mr. Seager went out before Walker.</p>

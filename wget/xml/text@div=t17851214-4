I went to apprehend the prisoner, and I took him going up to the gallery in Drury-lane, Play-house; I brought him back and told him that his master had charged me to take him into custody, I took him up on the 5th of this month, about eight; I brought him back to Mr. Young's, and I went up stairs to look over his box, and in his box I found three pair of new shoes, two pair of new buckles and other things, and he told me if I would send up for his mistress, he would tell her the whole business, Mrs. Young came up, I was present, and when she came up he said -</p>
               <p>Court. Before you tell this did you advise him to send for his mistress? - I told him, says I, young man, all the servants at present have their characters at stake, they will all be discharged, and it is a pity they should if you have the draft, and it looks very suspicious.</p>
               <p>Was that all you said? - It was, I called up his mistress, that was Mrs. Young that is here, and he told her he hoped it would be a warning to her, for leaving her draughts and her money about, that he had taken the draught and got the cash for it, that he had sent one Mad Jack to receive the money, a coachman; I then went and took the man into custody that went to receive the money, and a woman that went with him; here is a small bit of paper, where is put down how he expended a great deal of the money that was after he was apprehended, and the remainder, he said, he had lost at gambling, I found 1 l. 8 s. 2 d. upon him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Young. When you was sent for, what did you say to him to induce him to tell you the truth of the matter? - I did not ask him any questions, I made him no promises, he owned he had taken the money, and said he hoped it would be a warning to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Lucas. Did not you promise me that if I would confess having the draft I should be forgiven and nothing said against my character?</p>
               <p>Lucas. No, my Lord, I do not recollect ever saying any thing of that sort to him, I only told him that the rest of the servants characters stood at stake, as nigh as I can recollect; I told him this, that it was a pity, if he had taken it, that the other people should lose their characters,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140012"></xptr> that they would all be turned away; then said call up my mistress, call up my mistress.</p>

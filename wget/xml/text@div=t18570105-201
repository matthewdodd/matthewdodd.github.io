                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 449). On Sunday night last I saw the prisoner in Gresham-street—he had an empty bag on his shoulder—he went into the Swan with Two Necks; he remained there a quarter of an hour, then came out, and stood talking for two or three minutes to a police<lb></lb>man on the beat—the policeman then went round his beat, and, as he turned the corner of Aldermanbury, the prisoner stooped down, and drew a piece of lead, with a cord attached to it, to the gateway—it weighed 48 lbs.—I saw him draw it—he then put it into the bag, and put it on his shoulder—I followed him to the corner of Aldermanbury, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "I think it is a piece of lead"—I said, "I shall take you into custody"—I took him to Bow-lane station—on going along, he said, "I intended taking it to the inspector at Moor-lane station"—he first said that the landlord of the Gresham Arms had given him the bag.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">FORD</hi>. I am servant to Mary Davey, who keeps the Swan with Two Necks. I know the prisoner by sight, by being there, and being employed in taking things to Chaplin and Horne's—on the Sunday after<lb></lb>noon in question he came down into the cellar where I was at work, a little after 4 o'clock—he wanted to know where the chopper was—I said, "It is in its place; what do you want with it?"—he said, "I do not want it for anything"—he followed me up the stairs—I afterwards saw the watchman bring in the chopper—it was not in the cellar—I saw the prisoner again a little after 6 o'clock—he went away a little after 9 o'clock—I was called by the watchman to see the piece of lead; it was lying inside the gate—I stopped there with him, and after the lapse of a few minutes the lead dis<lb></lb>appeared from under the gate, drawn by a piece of strings—I then went out, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>

I overtook the prisoner; I seized him, and said, I am informed, you have got some publicans pewter pots about you; he said, no, I insisted on searching him; I put my hand into his right hand pocket, and there I found one pewter pint pot; I then told him he must go with me to the police office, and going along, he offered me money, all the money he had in his pocket, I refused to take it; he told me, he had been an old soldier in the guards, about fifteen years ago, and going through Queen-square gate, he immediately put his left hand into his breeches and draws out a pint pot, and threw it across the road, against the wall, and said, damn the pot, and me too; I told him, he must not think to unload himself till he came to the police office; there was a man brought the same pint pot, and delivered it into my hand; I then took him to the police office front door, and delivered him to a constable's hands, and the pint pot I also delivered to the constable, with the property he had about him: he had then a pint pot in his right hand coat pocket, and a quart pot in his breeches.</p>

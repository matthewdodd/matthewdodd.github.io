               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Parker and Burkett's, pawn-brokers, in prince's-street, Leicester-fields; on the 8th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to my master's shop for the purpose of pawning these articles, (producing two silver castors, a dozen of table forks, a dozen of table spoons, and half a dozen of desert spoons,) these being articles we don't take from strangers without enquiry, upon enquiring how these articles came into his possession, he said, they belonged to him, and gave us a reference to Holles-street, Cavendish-square, and upon expressing a desire to send to know if he lived there, and to know if these articles belonged to him, he wished that we might not send there; in consequence of that, and not wishing to give us any further account how he came by them, we were induced to send for a constable, who took him into custody, and I appeared next day at Bow-street, when these articles were attested by Mr. King's servant; I believe the prisoner wrote a direction previous to his leaving my master's shop, where Mr. King lived; he said, his name was King, but after he was put in custody, he gave a proper direction to Mr. King, in Queen's-square, Westminster, wishing my master to go there to let Mr. King know that he was stopped pledging these things; in consequence of that, I stopped in the shop, and Mr. Burkett went there, I did not go myself; the prisoner expressed a desire to have these things put in separate parcels, under this with, I should apprehend, to redem them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To smith.) I beg leave to ask him if he has been threatened with any punishment if he did not give this evidence against me? - A. Yes, the constable did; he told me, yesterday, d-n your eyes, if you don't appear, you will be fined your recognizance.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of St. Martin's in the Fields: On the 8th of April last, I was at Bow-street office, and an apprentice of Messrs. Parker and Burkett, came down to the office for a constable to take the prisoner into custody; I went and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith.) Look at these forks and spoons; whose property are they? - A. Upon such an occasion, it is a very material thing to take an oath upon.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a material thing, and therefore look at them, and don't say they are anybody's, unless you are quite sure? - A. They look like Mr. King's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them again, and tell me whether you have any doubt that they are Mr. King's? - A. They have every appearance of it in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be Mr. King's? - A. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110061"></xptr>is a very difficult thing to take an oath upon; there might be more spoons exactly like these.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to see marks such as these, (the crest), upon Mr. King's spoons? - A. I have seen marks such as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see such marks upon any body else's spoons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you doubt whether they are Mr. King's spoons or not? - A. I don't doubt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them again, and will you or not venture to swear they are Mr. King's spoons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I want to know what you meant by giving the answer that you did, that one spoon might be like another? - A. I never used to clean this silver, I have been very little used to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. As a sootman, have you not been in the habit of handling these spoons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>I hope you will never have the handling of Mr. King's spoons again; he is very wrong if he keeps such a servant as you.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. King.) Was the prisoner your servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the witness your servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived with you? - A. About half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he had the handling of these spoons at all? - A. I had only that servant, and the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. And they waited at table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently both of them had the handling occasionally of these spoons? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the spoons and the castors? - A. I am afraid I can swear positively to the castors.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the spoons? - A. No; they have my crest upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me the value of this plate, three pounds, four pounds, or what? - A. I should suppose five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You will venture to swear they are worth more than forty shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at all the spoons? - A. They appear to be all alike.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. I wish to give some account of the prisoner, I think I owe it to the prisoner; and Mr. Moss, the son of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, is here also, who wishes to speak for him; he was two years a livery servant of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, where I first knew him, and it was from his exemplary conduct there that I took him into my service; during the short time he was in my service, I believe about two months, I think, not more, but during that time, and from the knowledge I had of him before, the Bishop being my father-in-law, from that recommendation, I have, previous to this time, trusted him with money; upon one occasion, I sent him with a hundred pounds to a Bankers, he faithfully delivered it; and had frequent opportunities, if he had chosen, of robbing me; and he not only behaved very well in other respects, but since this unfortunate circumstance happened, I have taken some pains, and, as far as I can find, except this one crime, which he now stands charged with before your Lordship, I cannot find that he not only has not committed a crime, but I cannot find the slightest misconduct in him, except that of turning from a very honest man to commit this great crime.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to leave you? - A. He was in my service at the time of committing this crime, he had not quitted me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I have little to trouble your Lordship with; however strong appearances are against me, if I omit the last few weeks, I can look back upon my past life without shame or remorse.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Rev. Mr. MOSS sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand, from Mr. King, that the prisoner lived with your father, the Bishop of Bath and Wells? - A. Yes, two years; and during that time, he was a most excellent servant in every respect: very well behaved, very sober, and very honest; he had a wife ill for a long time, I believe about twelve months, in a very long and expensive illness, and he was obliged to support her out of his wages; we always had the highest opinion of his honesty.</p>

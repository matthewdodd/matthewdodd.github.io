                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, and live in Mercer's-place, Match Walk, Shadwell. On Saturday, the 17th of August, I was at the Three Compasses public-house, Shadwell Market, a young man sat on the opposite side to me drinking rum-and-water, and I said, "Mark, give me a drop"—he told me to come over and take it—I went over, and was in the act of drinking out of the glass, when the prisoner came into the tap<lb></lb>room, and said, "No one shall drink out of that," and threw it over me—I struck her, and took my bonnet into the skittle-ground—I returned to the tap-room, and found she was gone into the skittle-ground, and I followed her there again—we went out to the skittle-ground to fight it out—I did not see any thing in her hand—I asked her what she threw it over me for, in the skittle-ground—she made no answer, and I struck her again—I have no reason to think she got the knife on purpose to strike me—I followed her out to strike her—she struck me on the back of my ear, and wounded me—when she saw the blood flow from my ear, she said, "Hold on, for I have got a knife in my hand"—I understood her to mean for me to keep off—she then threw the knife down on the ground—it was a penknife—somebody pulled me away from her.</p>

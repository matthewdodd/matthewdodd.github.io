               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. ROSE.</p>
               <p>At the call-over, GEORGE BARRINGTON being brought up with the other prisoners, thus addressed the court:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship,</p>
               <p>As I am before the court, and if I do not trespass on your Lordship's time, I humbly request that I may be allowed to state a few circumstances.</p>
               <p>I was removed to a very distant part of the kingdom in July last, by writ of habeas corpus; before the habeas was obtained, I knew nothing of a bill of indictment having been found against me; and had no knowledge of an outlawry thereon, till I arrived in London; if I had, I would respectfully and immediately have submitted to a trial. For my Lord, notwithstanding the confident assertions which have been made in some erroneous, I will not say malignant prints, and elsewhere, I am credibly assured, that the charge against me, as laid before the magistrate in the information, is only on suspicion; and it is very unreasonable to suppose, that a person under such circumstances, would subject himself to a process so summary and rigorous in its nature as outlawry indisputably is, knowing that such a proceeding was going forwards: Or will the liberal spirit of the laws justify putting a man to death untried and unheard, because he appears to have been negligent?</p>
               <p>With respect to the indictment, I can only say, my Lord, that I am ready at any moment to take my trial; and if after a fair and impartial hearing, conviction follows, I shall bow to the sentence of the law with submissive reverence.</p>
               <p>But I am given to understand, that I am to have no trial, if it can be hindered; a sanguinary process, which has lain dormant for ages, is to supply the place of trial by jury; and fiction propagated in newspapers, to fill up vacant corners from dearth of news and advertisements, is to supply the place of facts and proofs of guilt.</p>
               <p>I am also, my Lord, given to understand, that it has been said by the supporters of this measure, that the present case is meant as a precedent to the rising generation; yet, however plausible this may found, it may perhaps appear, to think of arriving at popularity by curtailing the best privileges of the subject, to be a mistaken idea; and the rising generation will have but little cause to thank that reformer, who establishes a precedent to set aside the trial by jury, when the charge is theft on suspicion, and certainly free from violence and cruelty.</p>
               <p>Candour should never be lost sight of in any prosecution, even in the most rigorous pursuit of justice. But if the gentleman on the part of the prosecution, will persist to deny me a trial, either from conscious inability to prove guilt, or from misguided fury against an unfortunate man, who has been spared from the imputation of cruelty and violence, even by the voice of calumny itself, loud as it has been raised against him; yet I trust your Lordship, from the dictates of benevolence, will not deny me such means of defence, as a case so hard and so extraordinary may require.</p>
               <p>The persons concerned in the prosecution have been applied to, for leave for my council and solicitor to inspect the proceedings against me, and even this has been refused; surely they wish not to keep their prisoner entirely in the dark, or to deprive him of all possibility of defence.</p>
               <p>The practice of a surgeon is at all times very limited, without an extensive acquaintance, and many friends; in a prison it can afford but little emolument, by no means sufficient to defray the expences, which I am informed, in such a case are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100173"></xptr>liable to be very great on the part of the accused. I am therefore under the necessity of requesting, which I do with the utmost humility, that your Lordship in your goodness will be pleased to recommend, that my counsel and solicitor have leave to inspect the proceedings against me.</p>
               <p>To which Mr. Recorder gave the following Answer:</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrington,</p>
               <p>It is only necessary for me to observe to you, in the situation in which you at present stand, that you appear to be committed, moved by habeas corpus to the gaol of Newgate, under a judgment of outlawry, allowed to be duly pronounced against you. If that judgment had been returned on record to this court, the arguments which you have advanced would have had great weight. As you have been attainted by the judgment of the law, the only thing this court could do with that attainder, while it remains in force and unreserved, would be not to pronounce judgment, but to award execution of the sentence of the law. The court has been informed, that it is the intention of the prosecutor to remove the proceedings into his Majesty's court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>It occurs to me, that this intention is proper, both from the consequences of the precedent to the public, and it is favourable to you, as giving you an opportunity to bring a writ of error in that court, which has the supreme jurisdiction in the kingdom, in order to reverse that outlawry, if any error should be found in the proceedings.</p>
               <p>It would by no means become me to state what will be proper for that court to do. When they have the record before them, I am perfectly persuaded justice will be administered according to the law, and with all the lenity the law will permit.</p>
               <p>It only remains, therefore, to take notice of another circumstance, the application you have made to inspect the proceedings, which not being before the court, the court can make no order on that subject, which could be compulsory; and a recommendation pronounced by persons in a judicial situation, in cases where they have no authority to make an order, is improper.</p>
               <p>Your application, unless you can obtain a copy of the proceedings by the consent of the prosecutor, must be made to the court of King's-bench after the record is returned before them. If the court think it proper, they will order it, and will take care that you shall not be prejudiced in point of time, but that you shall have a proper opportunity of urging by your counsel and yourself whatever may be deemed material.</p>
               <p>The legal consequences of the outlawry, and the effect of the attainder, if not reversed, is, the judgment of death, in point of law already extended against you. And this is not obsolete law; but is the undoubted subsisting law of the country. Courts of justice, however, considering, that in some cases it may be a harsh operation of the law, have always listened to every attempt to assign errors in the outlawry, by which the attainder may be reversed, and the party labouring under it, restored to the benefit of a trial by his country.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt, but when this matter comes before the court of King's bench, they will shew you all the indulgence which the law will permit.</p>

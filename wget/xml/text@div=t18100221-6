Yes, he has; his shop is part of his dwelling-house. On Friday, the 9th of January, about ten minutes past seven in the evening, (it was dark), in consequence of information, I went out of the shop and saw the prisoner taking out this diaper table-cloth with his right hand, and he was holding his coat with his left hand, to hinder people from seeing him, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it taken out - A. Out of a pane of glass in the shop window, which he had cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him cut that pane of glass - A. I did not. I saw him taking out this cloth; I seized him by the collar, he had not got it quite out. I dragged him into the shop. When I laid hold of him he let go the cloth. When I got him into the shop, I gave him into the care of Mr. Young, an attorney, until I went and fetched Mr. Foy, the officer.</p>


               <p>Q. Where was the diaper table-cloth - A. It was laid against the window, not against the square that he cut, the square next to it; it was on the railing of the window, to shew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he removed it from the place where it was -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210007"></xptr>A. He had entirely removed it from the place, and about one quarter of it was out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that pane of glass before this - A. The same pane of glass had been cut four nights before, there was no hole, there was a crack in it before. I walked round the window, which I usually do; there were lamps suspended to the window, in order to shew the goods. About half an hour or an hour before it was whole, except the crack; the piece was not out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there was no piece out - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. After the window had been cut, then there was part of the pane of glass left in, was it not - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other part - A. The other part could not be found, it was taken clear away. This is the table-cloth, it is the property of

            , it is worth thirty shillings. I delivered it to Foy, the officer, the same evening. The prisoner was drawing it out of the window, and with his left hand he was holding his coat; the hole in the window was large enough to let it out.</p>

            . On the 9th of February I was sent into Oxford-street, to match some ribbon, I could not get it. When I came to this shop, I was looking at some print. I saw the prisoner standing at the window close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he appear to be doing - A. He was pressing himself against the window, and spreading his great coat I suspected he was at no good. I walked backwards and forwards near the shop, and saw him cutting the glass; I could not see what he was cutting it with. I saw the glass going as he pressed. I could not see any thing in his hand. When I first looked at the window, I saw the glass quite whole, I walked back the other way, I saw him cutting the glass, I saw him pressing against it, and the glass I saw it quite out.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole pane was not quite out, was it - A. No, only part of it. I went in the shop and informed the last witness Portington, he came out immediately, I saw him drag the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner take any thing out, did you - A. No, I went into the shop immediately I saw him put his hand in; and I saw his hand moving as if cutting the glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the magistrate's she said it was eight o'clock, the gentleman said now it was seven o'clock; she said, that she looked me in the face; I will now ask her, whether I would stand there stealing cloth and let her go in and tell the gentleman.</p>

            . I belong to Marlborough-street Office. I was sent for by the first witness to take the prisoner in custody. I searched him and found a knife; I afterwards matched this knife with the putty, the putty was very soft, it matched with one place exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the glass been taken out - A. It is a common thing to star the glass with it. I have kept the table-cloth in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to this window, two men were standing there, they went away, I was looking at the window. I stood there about five minutes, and this piece of cloth was standing against the window, I was thinking to go in and let the gentleman know the cloth was standing there, and I thought he would give me sixpence. He came out and said, you rascal, what do you do here. I really think I saved the house from being robbed, instead of robbing it.</p>

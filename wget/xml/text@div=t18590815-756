                  </hi>. I reside at Richmond, in Surrey—about half past 2 o'clock in the day, on the 19th, I was in the Commercial-road, Shoreditch—I saw the prisoner there, talking to a female—I noticed him casually as I was walking past; he seemed to be in conversation—I was waiting for a train—I turned down a street to pass away the time till the train started—I went down a little way and then turned back—I then noticed the prisoner standing in the gutter—I was just passing him when he sprang forward and laid hold of my watch-guard, and made a snatch at it—I then laid hold of him—he got my watch—he tore the chain from the swivel—he made a hit at my head—he hit me and kicked me—he said he would kick my brains out—I was wrestling with him—I looked up and asked some one who was there to call a policeman—a policeman came up and I gave him in charge—my watch is a silver one, and worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found afterwards that I had got a wound on my head, where the prisoner struck me with his fist—I had it bandaged by a surgeon.</p>

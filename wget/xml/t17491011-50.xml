I being in liquor, said, I'll give you a dram if that will do you any good.</p>
               <p>Q. How old might she be, do you think ?</p>
               <p>Butler. I believe about fourteen or fifteen years of age, she was a little creature; she had me into these people's house; I ask'd what they had got to drink, they said nothing but gin; I saw the woman, I cannot say I saw the man; then I called for a quartern of gin; the woman saw me in liquor, and ask'd me to go and lie down on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down ?</p>
               <p>Butler. Yes I did, my lord, and lay for some hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you?</p>
               <p>Butler. Somebody went with me, I do not know who, but she did not stay with me; I lay there about two or three hours: after I awak'd my buckles were taken out of my shoes; and my money out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Butler. I had in my pocket about three or four shillings, it was all gone, but I will not swear to above two; I had two pair of silver buttons in my pocket, and two pair in my sleeves, which were taken away; when I miss'd these things I knock'd with my heel for somebody to come up; and presently I saw a woman's hand push open the door, and disappear'd again, (I was fasten'd in before) then I went down and saw the woman prisoner; I said I had been robb'd of my silver buckles and other things, and insisted upon having my buckles again; after a great deal of talk she said, if I would give her 3 s. for the gin I had, I should have my buckles again. As I had no money, and had a relation hard by where I could have some, I desir'd somebody to go and call them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you came down stairs ?</p>
               <p>Butler. It was not night; I said if I had not my buckles again I would prosecute as far as the law would direct. There was a sailor in the house who said, if you take her up in order to prosecute her, I'll swear that you gave her the buckles; then I went to my cousin, and after that I got a warrant, and went to take up the woman; she said her name was

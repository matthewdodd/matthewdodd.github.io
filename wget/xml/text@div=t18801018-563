                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 73). On Sunday, 29th August, at 3.30 p.m., I was on duty in Chenies Street, Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prisoner sitting on a doorstep with a female child in her lap; it had its arm up—it looked half starved—I asked her where she lived—she said "Not far from here"—I said "Where?"—she said "Draper's place"—I said "What number?"—she said "10"—I told her to get up and take the child home—she got up, walked a few yards, and fell in the gutter—she was drunk—I took her and the child to the station and charged her with being drunk and incapable of taking care of the child—the surgeon was sent for, and the child was removed to the workhouse at once—the prisoner was charged at Bow Street next morning, remanded for a week, and discharged on promising not to drink again—the child's clothes were very dirty and wet—I was present at the inquest on the child and heard the prisoner give her evidence, which was read over to her and she signed it—this is her deposition (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

After she was charged I went to 10, Draper Street; her husband, who is a birdcage maker, was living there; they only occupied one room, and seemed in a very poor way—he works when he can get it to do—the only food I saw was some pieces of very dry bread in a cupboard—there was no furniture in the room—he had work going on at that time—the prisoner had a bottle of milk in her hand when I went up to her and a bottle of medicine—she was pouring the milk into the child's mouth—I left the bottle at the station.</p>

I am mother of deceased and wife to John Thomas Alexander, a birdcage maker. The deceased child was three months and two weeks old. I suckled the child for three weeks. When it was three weeks old it was taken into the University College Hospital as it was ill, and remained there three weeks. When the child came out of the hospital I had no breast milk, and then fed it with cow's milk. The child did not improve, and I took her to Middlesex Hospital. After I left the hospital with the child I sat down on a doorstep to feed the child, and a policeman told me to take it home. I got up, and the policeman then took me to the station, where I was charged with being drunk. The child was taken away from me and I was locked up. On the following day, Monday, I was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded for a week to the House of Detention, and was then brought up again before the Magistrate and was discharged. When I was let out I went to St. Giles's Workhouse three or four times to see the child. I had fed the deceased on milk and water, bread and milk, and arrowroot. The doctor at both hospitals told me to feed deceased with milk and water, as bread was too heavy for the child. I only fed it with bread and milk once after the doctor said I was to give it milk and water. I have had ten living children; seven have died. The body seen by the Jurors is that of my child, Rebecca Catherine Alexander."</p>

I am a laundress and a widow—I have lived about twelve months at 10, Draper's Place—the prisoner lived there with her husband, a birdcage maker, in one front room on the second floor—they came there about three months after me—they had five children, including the baby—one was about 18 years old—her husband used to go out to work—I remember this baby being born on 29th May; I saw it about five minutes afterwards, and from time to time afterwards—I waited on her for a fortnight—she said that she had no milk, and that appeared to be correct—I used to feed the child on gruel—it was a beautiful baby—the prisoner got on very well, and was able to get about in fifteen or sixteen days—she is not a sober woman—about the second day after she came down the baby looked very ill, and I persuaded her to take it to the University College Hospital, and it was away some time—when she got it back it had improved wonderfully—she always took it with her when she went out, but I never entered her room—she told me that she took it to Middlesex Hospital; that was about a week before she was taken in custody—I did not see her feed it from time to time.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. On 29th June I was house physician at University College Hospital when the prisoner brought a child and complained that it had fallen away, and I think she said it had diarrhoea and a slight cough—it was scarcely a month old—it was small</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188010180027"></xptr>
               <p>and somewhat emaciated about its extremities, but not about its face—the bony prominences were more marked than usual, and it was ex<lb></lb>tremely dirty—it appeared to be suffering from loss of flesh, and as it looked ill, and we had one or two empty beds, I took it in and took charge of it till 16th July, when tie mother fetched it—it improved very rapidly—it was then comparatively fat and quite healthy; the wrinkles had disappeared from the skin, but it was still a small child—I formed the opinion when it was brought in that the emaciation arose either from no food or from an excess of improper food—there was no disease; it improved the very first day; In fact it improved at once after washing—when the prisoner fetched it away I told her to bring it once or twice a week that I might see that it was kept clean and did not lose flesh, and she promised to do so—I directed her to feed it on milk with a certain portion of water—she stated that she had given it the breast up to the time she brought it in—I did not weigh it—the average weight of a child three months old is I think 10lb. or 121b.—a child has been born weighing 14lb., but the average is 6 1/2 lb.; female children are a little less—the child had no diarrhoea or cough in the hospital.</p>

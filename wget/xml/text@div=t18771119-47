                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Darling, of 4, Amersham Villas, New Cross—the prisoner was in our service for about five months—on the 23rd September she went out for a holiday, and in consequence of some matters that had come to my knowledge I went into her bed-room and examined her boxes, in one of which I found 4 yards of coloured lace, which I had given 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, some black lace given me by my brother, two pairs of linen cuffs, a small pair of white kid gloves belonging to my little girl, and several other articles; in another box, locked, I found a pair of ear-rings belonging to my daughter (<hi rend="italic">property produced</hi>)—I identify these articles—I found the keys in the washstand drawer and took them out and unlocked the box—the lace had been on two different dresses at different times—I bought it at a large linen-draper's at Croydon—I found the pieces of the blanket between the prisoner's bed and mattress, rolled up—I have never found the remainder of it—the prisoner returned home in the evening—I understood she had no home, and I did not send her away, it being past 10 o'clock—next morning I asked her how she came to tear up one of my good blankets—she said she had not—I said "Who has done it if you have not?"—she said she did not know—after a time she said she tore it up for house flannels—I then said "There are things that I have found in your boxes, belonging to me, that I have taken out, and after finding these things, and being so deceived in you, I should not think of your remaining in my service any longer; pack up your things and at once go"—she went, and at the expiration of a week she came back for the remainder of her things—several things were then missing, a silver watch amongst other things—Mr. Darling, being at home, spoke to her about the things missing—she said she knew she took the things found in the boxes, but had not taken the watch—I said "We will give you time to bring it back, and if you do not I shall lock you up"—she was very pert about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think the lace is quite common—it is rather an uncommon pattern—I tried to match it at several shops and could not—can swear to the ear-rings, they belong to my daughter—they may have been mended—they were given her by an old friend—I was at the police-court—when the prisoner's father was called the Magis<lb></lb>trate asked him to give a description of some ear-rings about which he was going to give evidence, and I believe he did so, before any ear-rings</p>

               <p>were put in his hand—he said she had a pair, and he had mended them—they were afterwards put in his hand—I believe my daughter gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this feather—it was in the prisoner's hat over a feather of her own which she had bought and which she left behind with some of her things—I don't know what good the other part of the blanket would be unless she made a petticoat of it, which I taxed her with—I thought very likely she had—she has done the same thing in other places where she has been—I swear to all the articles positively.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>.

I am the wife of Alfred Souter, and am the prosecutrix's daughter—these coral ear-rings are mine—I don't live with my mother now, I did when the prisoner was in my mother's service—they were my property then, and I kept them in a box—I went away from home in September, and when I came back I missed them—I know this feather by a dent in the stem—it was kept in a box in my room—I missed that also—I have since searched to find both the ear-rings and feather, but they had disappeared.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are 4 1/2 yards of lace here, I should say—the lace on the polonaise is of very inferior quality—Yak lace and this is very good—I should say this is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have bought a good many yards of it—selling it secondhand, in my ordinary way of business, I should say I should charge 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard for it.</p>

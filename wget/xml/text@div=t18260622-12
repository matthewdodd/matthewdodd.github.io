My wife is now in St. George's Hospital.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220010"></xptr>About ten minutes past twelve o'clock that night, the prisoner had absconded without giving us notice, and the money was missing - when she was apprehended I saw the officer find the handkerchief, which I had wrapped the money in, on her person; I am certain it is the same handkerchief - Mrs. Kendal produced twenty-nine sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. How long have you been married? A. Seven years; I always lived happy with my wife; she swore at Bow-street, that she had not given the prisoner leave to go out that night - she was very ill and required her attendance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How late that night did you see the prisoner? A. About ten o'clock - she used to sleep in the house.</p>

            . My husband lives at No. 10, Nea castle-court - the prisoner was in my service twelve months ago. On the 26th of May, at nearly twelve o'clock at night, she came and gave me twenty sovereigns, and said it was prize-money of her husband's - I was to take care of it, that she might put it into the Savings' Bank, and next morning she gave me nine more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her husband? A. No; she was eight months with me, and I recommended her to my sister; I have known her fifteen months; I never heard any harm of her.</p>

            . This is the handkerchief I wrapped the money in - I have had it five years. When the officer took her, he said it was for robbing Mr. Guerin; she said"No, I never robbed him - his wife gave me the money;" my wife is now in a dying state; she told me I might do my best - that she got drunk, and was robbed of the money on the step of a door. My wife was dangerously ill at that time, and it was all the money we had in the world.</p>
               <p>MRS. KENDALL. I am sure she said she got it as prize-money, from her husband.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in her defence, accused the prosecutor of illtreating his wife, and stated that she gave her the money when nobody was present.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know his person before this? - I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there warehouses up stairs? - He was up in the garret, after that I took hold of him by the collar and took him down stairs along with me, and delivered him to Mr. Gordy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him examined? - No, he had no bundle in his hand, that was all he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he had a sample in his hand? - That was all he had, it was a little bag tied up; the constable has the bag, I see it delivered to the constable, there was only one head out in the whole place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever compare it with the same sugar that was in the cask? - It was the very same sugar, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not offer to hide myself away from you when I met you? - He hid himself behind the hogshead with his head down, I did not know he was there till he coughed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him walking there, or was he standing still? - He stood still when I came to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordy. Was the property in the warehouse of which Benjamin speaks of, under the care of your gang? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the sugar there belonging to your gang? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hogshead broke open? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any missing? - I cannot tell particularly that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to see whether any sugar was missing? - It is impossible to tell for the value of three pounds what was taken out, I suppose the cask wanted a matter of a hundred pounds weight of being full, but the head was out of the hogshead, part of it; I have got a sample of the sugar here that I took out of the cask.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordy. What may be the value of the sugar that was taken? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150058"></xptr>Of the value of one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went up in the warehouse for to set the capstains up, when I came up there I found it was set up, and I returned again, and came out of the warehouse, as I came along the warehouse I saw this bag lay with the sugar in, I did not put it in at all; as I was coming out I met this man, he asked me what it was? I said I believed it was sugar, says he come down along with me, I went down stairs with him. I have not got any one to speak for me at all.</p>

I took the prisoner; he was quite intoxicated - in taking him to the office he said he did not know what I took him for, unless it was disorderly conduct; I said it was for receiving 10s. - I said, "I don't wish to know any thing about it, but it is right you should know before you go before the Magistrate."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written).</p>
               <p>On the 1st of last month I received warning to quit my mother's house, but owing to my not being able to get employment, she consented to let me stop until I could get into a situation. On the following Wednesday I went to the house of Mr. Hook with bread, who (without being asked), paid me 1l. 3s. 4d. as part of his bill; and on my leaving his house I met with some friends, and having no money of my own, I spent 10s., and of course gave my mother but 13s. 4d., she agreeing that she would stop it out of my week's wages; but on Monday she paid me my full money, telling me that she would place it to an account she had against me of monies paid by her on my account.</p>
               <p>COURT to CATHERINE EDWARDS. Q. Why did you not charge him with this till October? A. Because I wanted to keep him in my house, but his conduct was such I could not endure it; I never gave him permission to take out money, but he has done it; I would have placed this to his account, but his conduct was such; he has put me in fear of my life - I have been forced to have an officer in the house to keep me from blows and insults - I did say I would place it to account that night, but my little son told me that he was just as usual, very drunk - I have devised every means to reclaim him.</p>

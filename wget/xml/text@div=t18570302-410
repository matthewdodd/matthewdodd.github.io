                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of the New North-road. On Saturday, 7th Feb., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for half a quartern of rum; she brought a bottle, and my daughter put the rum into it, and brought me a half crown, which was bad—I told the prisoner it was bad; she said, "Dear me! is it?" I said, "Yes," and broke it before her, and threw the best part of it into a punch bowl, and afterwards gave it to a policeman—I took the rum from her, and told her not to come for any more, or I should lock her up—on the 18th she came again with a bottle for half a quartern of rum—I suspected that she was the same woman when she first came in—she offered me a bad half crown, and I told her it was bad, and that she had been there before, which she denied—I said that I was sure of her, and should give her in charge;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185703020059"></xptr>
               <p>she said that she hoped I should not, for her sight was so bad; I told her it was her heart that was so bad, and gave her in charge, with the half crown and the broken pieces—I am certain she is the same person who came on the 7th.</p>

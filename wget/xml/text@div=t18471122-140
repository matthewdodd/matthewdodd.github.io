                  </hi> I live at and manage the Duke of Lancaster public-house, for Mr. Viney. The prisoner was in my service about three months, and up to this time I had no reason to suspect her—I found some person was robbing me from the till—I placed certain sums in the till, and found a deficiency—the money was my own—I had an interview with an officer, and I marked six sixpences and one shilling, which I gave to him, with instructions to purchase certain articles—the next morning, 15th Nov., I came down, at half-past eight o'clock, expecting to find the money in the till—I only found three sixpences, one shilling, and a four-penny-piece—I went into the bar parlour, and said to the prisoner, "I have reason to suspect you have been robbing the till for some time"—she called me a vagabond—the policeman came in, and I said to her, "Have you seen this gentleman before?"—she admitted she had—the policeman then asked her if she had any money, and she pulled two marked sixpences out of her pocket—I gave her in charge, went up stairs, and found other money.</p>

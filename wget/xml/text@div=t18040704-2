               <p>Q. What do you accuse her of? - A. Of stealing eleven Bank-notes. On Thursday, the 17th of May, a little before one o'clock, as myself and family were sitting down to dinner, the prisoner came instantly down stairs, and entered the room where we were, and said there was a man in our chamber up stairs; I immediately got up, and secured the front and back door; I went up stairs, and when I entered the room, there was a sheet taken off the bed, and spread on the floor, upon which was all my wearing apparel taken out of the wardrobe, which were seven coats and seven waistcoats, and four pair of breeches, and a suit of clothes; besides on the table, which stood just against where the clothes were laid on the sheet, was laying my pocket-book, with a number of Bank-notes upon it, which were taken out of the book; I took the notes and book, and put them in my pocket; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040004"></xptr>immediately sought the house all over to see if I could discover any person; I could not discover any person in the house but our own family; I concluded that if there was any person, as I then thought there had been, they might have slipped down stairs after the girl; I blamed the girl for not holding the door, and calling me; she said, she saw the person in the room in a light-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it possible that any person might have followed the girl, and have gone out? - A. It was possible; after we had given up the search, I took the book, and counted the notes, and found there were eleven missing out of the thirty-eight that were in the book; some hours after, I conceived it an awkward circumstance, and, ruminating in my mind, a thought struck me whether the girl could have any concern in the business; the day past over, we did not make any discovery; but, on the following day, my wife told me the prisoner had been at her box, and if I would satisfy myself, she would have me examine it; I went down stairs, and got Hawkins to bring the box down stairs; the prisoner was in the room, and said, that is my box, Sir; I replied, I knew it was, I wished to see the inside of it; I asked her to give me the key; she gave the key to Hawkins, and we opened the box; in undoing her things, in a piece of muslin, a caul of a cap, was pinned up ten one-pound notes out of the eleven, and nearly a pound was found in her pocket that had been changed; I desired Hawkins to put the notes in the box, and lock it, and keep the key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these notes to be your's? - A. I believe them to be mine; there is a witness or two present that can swear to them.</p>

My wife said she had lost a pocket-book out of her drawer, since she had been in the Country. The prisoner was in the room at the time. I told her it was impossible for her to lose it, and she had better look again. She said I am confident I have lost it. Then I challenged the prisoner with it, and she denied it for five or ten minutes. Then I came down stairs, and told my son not to let her go out until I fetched an officer, I fetched an officer, and gave charge of her. In bringing her down stairs, she informed the officer that the pocket-book was in the house. I asked her where it was, and she said, down in the cellar, where the five chaldrons of coals were shot, on the cill of the window. The officer looked for it, and could not find it. I said to the prisoner, shew the officer where it is; she put her hand up over the cill of the window, and bringing out the pocket-book delivered it to the officer. I asked her whether there was any property in it, and she said, yes, that there was part of it. The officer examined the pocket-book, and found a five shilling and sixpenny dollar, a three shilling piece, a duplicate for two gold coins, a bill of exchange, and a promissory note; the bill of exchange was for ten pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence; the promissory note was for seven pounds. I asked her how she had got to the property, and she said she had got a key to the drawer, and I asked her what she had done with it, and she said, she had thrown it down the privy.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARKER. I am an officer. Mr. Hewes came to me on Sunday, the 22nd of September, and said he suspected that the servant had robbed him of these things. I went with him, and took charge of her; she then began to be rather alarmed. I asked her where was the money, and she said, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180034"></xptr>was in the cellar. I went into the cellar, and could not find it, and she came down, and took it off a beam in the cieling off of the little I opened the pocket-book, and found in it a five shilling and sixpenny dollar, a three shilling piece, a duplicate for two gold coins, ten shillings and sixpence, and a seven shilling piece. I then asked her what she had done with the other money; she said, she had laid it out, and had pawned the guinea at Mr. Pearl's for eighteen shillings, and she said she had found the key in the garret. Mr. Hewes suspected that she had taken notes out of another drawer; but she said, she-had not, for the key was too large, and she could not unlock it.</p>

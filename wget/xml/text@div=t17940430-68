               <p>Q. Was it linen? - It was. In pursuing him he turned up an alley, to go into Paternoster-row, and I called out stop thief! and there was a boy that tripped him up in the kennel as he run; as the prisoner fell, I saw the handkerchief drop out of his hand, and I picked it up, and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>A CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of March, the prosecutor shewed me this handkerchief, and said the prisoner had robbed him of it; in searching of him I found this handkerchief, with a little blood on it, and this sharp knife, beyond the sharpness of a common case knife.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord I had been with my brother to receive some money; in St. Paul's Church-yard, I heard the people call stop thief! I ran the same as another person might, and they catched hold of me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I saw the handkerchief fall out of his hand.</p>

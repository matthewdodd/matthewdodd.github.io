                  </hi> I keep an oyster-shop at Stratford, in Essex. On 2nd Dec., about five o'clock, I was in my shop—I was busy—the prisoner came in with two more lads, and went into an inner room—I called my sister—she went into that room to wait on them—they were coming out—they got to the step of the door—my sister called to me, "Stop those lads! they have got something!"—I put my hand on the prisoner's shoulder—they dropped my till between them—they were then about a yard and a half or two yards from my door—three penny pieces were picked up, one halfpenny, and six farthings—the prisoner got away, but was fetched back; he said, "It was not me; it was Munt."</p>

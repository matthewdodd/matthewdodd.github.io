They had not got the printing under them, without which they never leave our house; some similar to these had been sent out - I do not sell any myself; I had not sent any out, but the proofs to the proprietors - the prisoner had been two years and a half in my service; I have three other persons in my employ; these prints must have passed through their hands - the printers deliver them to the prisoner; some spoiled prints have been given to the prisoner, but these are not spoiled - Lascelles and Tupp have given the prisoner prints, but not to take out, only to stick up in the shop; I certainly should object to their taking them out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you give leave generally? A. Yes, when a print is spoiled - these are worth about 30s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He sold you prints which he said had been spoiled? A. Yes - I think these are what I bought; I had not two of a kind of any of them - I live nearly half a mile from the prosecutor; I did not know the prisoner worked there - I have been there since the examination but not before; I did not know where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080033"></xptr>lived - I gave sixpence a piece for those I bought; I sold one of them for 1s. - I never dealt in prints before; I was never in custody - I went with the witness to the prosecutor, and then to the office.</p>

            . I am a printer in the service of the prosecutor. I gave the prisoner one or two of these prints - I gave him one like this of Mrs. Siddons; they were damaged and good for nothing - this is not damaged; I never gave him one that was not damaged.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear you gave him that? A. No, nor that I did not; there is no damage on this - I gave him one like this; it was damaged, but this is dirty on the back - we sometimes call that a damage, and give it away.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. If it was dirty, as it is now, you might have given it away? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some of these were given to me by Lascelles, and some by Kershaw - these are two which Dominic gave me, one a portrait, and the other a landscape.</p>
               <p>DOMINIC KERSHAW. I gave him a landscape of Benares, but I do not know whether it was this or not - I did not give it to him to take out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this one damaged? A. No - the one I gave him was darker than this.</p>

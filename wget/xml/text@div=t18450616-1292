                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 422.) I know the place of business of Sir William Magnay and Co., at College-hill, in the City—I had been for some time previous to the 17th of April watching Messrs. I Magnay's premises, for reasons which had been given me—on the 18th of April I remember seeing Messrs. Magnays' wagon loaded at their ware—I house with paper—I fallowed it, from instructions I had received, up to the Stationery-office, near St. James's-park—after the wagon was unloaded at the Stationery-office, I followed the van over the water, to a receiving-house of the London Parcels Delivery Company—Ell, who was clerk at I Messrs. Magnay's, came up in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and joined the wagon, and then went I to the receiving-house—I then went into the receiving-house, and, in consequence of what transpired there, I communicated with Mr. George Magnay—he and I then went to the prisoner Dodge's house, at No. 25, Ashley-terrace, City-road—we got there about nine o'clock at night, on the 18th of April—Todhunter, the inspector, went with us—I went to the house first alone, and carried a parcel with me—I saw Dodge, and had a conversation with him, before Mr. Magnay or Mr. Todhunter came—he did not before they came say anything to me about any paper that was then in his house—the parcel I took with me contained paper—I had got it from the receiving-house of the London, Parcels Delivery Company in Waterloo-road—there was an address on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership, as a wholesale stationer, with Sir William Magnay, at College-hill. We supply her Majesty's Sta<lb></lb>tionery-office with paper—we had desired Haydon to watch our carts—on the 18th of April he gave us information—I went with him and Todhunter to Dodge's house—Haydon went in first, and I waited in the immediate neighbourhood—I then went up, and had some conversation with Dodge—the greatest part of it was while Haydon and Todhunter were searching the house—I said to him, "How came you to buy these goods? you knew you were acting improperly"—he said, "I bought them of John Ell"—I said, "Where are your invoices for these things?"—he said, "I have none"—I said, "You know you have acted very improperly; I shall give you in charge for this"—he said, "I did not know I was doing wrong;" on which I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "Ten shillings"—I said, "Ten shillings a ream for paper weighing twenty-six pounds! you must have known you were doing wrong"—he said, "If I have done wrong I am sorry for it; I hope you will not prosecute me"—I said, "I have already given you in charge; you must go to the station."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were speaking at this time about paper found on the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said, "There is that paper I have bought," pointing to some yellow-wove foolscap, and some blue double-wove foolscap, "and I have five reams at Yarranton's, the ruler's"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "At Compton-street, St. Giles"—he said, "I hope you will be lenient"—I said "I will make no promise whatever"—he then alluded to his being just commencing business, having a first-rate character from the Bank of England; that he was going into business; that a friend and hit sister would advance him money, and his prospects in business would be completely blighted by his being taken up on such a charge—his wife was not there then; she came in about a quarter-past eleven o'clock—he said, "If</p>

                  </hi>. I was a jobbing porter. I know Ell—I knew he was in the employ of Messrs. Magnay—I have known Ell a long time—I know Dodge—it is about three months ago since I first saw him—I hate taken notes to him from Ell three or four times—Ell once gave me a note at the door of Messrs. Magnay and Co.—I was standing at the dodr at the time—once he gave me a note in the tap-room of a public-house, and once he called me into a public-house—I saw Dodge the first time I went to his house, and afterwards I saw the servant—I did not bring any notes back, only a message, saying what time—the last time I took a message back from Dodge, was on the 18th of April—I had then taken a letter.</p>

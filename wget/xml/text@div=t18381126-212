                  </hi>. I was shopman to Mr. Henry Moyce, King-street, Convent-garden; but I have left—the prisoner was also a shopman in his service. On Saturday evening, the 27th of October, after lighting the gas, I went to the desk and counted the money on it—there were three half-crowns, a fourpenny-penny, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I left it on the top of the desk—the prisoner was in the shop at the time-a woman came in, and was served by the prisoner—I saw her pay him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—the prisoner went to the desk and put 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there—the shilling was put somewhere else—I went to the desk directly after, and there was no shilling there—I asked the prisoner how much money he had taken of that lady—he immediately said "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "Where is the shilling? there is no shilling there"—he said, "Perhaps it is under the coppers, per<lb></lb>haps it has fallen down behind the desk"—he was going round to see himself, but thinking perhaps he would put the shilling there, I pulled him back a little, and there was no shilling there when I went round-when</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Moyce. On Saturday evening, the 27th of October, I counted the money on the desk, after Bryant—there was three half-crowns, a sixpence, a fourpence, and some coppers—these told me to count it—the prisoner was serving a customer while I did so—he took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the customer, and went and put some money on the desk—these went and counted it—I went afterwards, and found there was one shilling short of what the prisoner had taken—I did not remove any thing—I am quite sure there was no shilling there when I went—these might, if so disposed, have taken the shilling off before I went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you not very much surprised at Bryant ask<lb></lb>ing you to go and count the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he told me on Saturday morning that he suspected him—I had a slight suspicion myself, as be several times dropped money, and said it was very slippery—he said so in Bryant's presence—these was discharged for being out two or three nights—these asked the prisoner what he had taken from the customer, and he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—I did not look to see whether he entered it in the book—he ought to have done so, but it is sometimes not done when we are very busy—my master had not desired me to watch the prisoner—he never intimated any suspicion about him, or complained of money being deficient.</p>

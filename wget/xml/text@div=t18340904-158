Yes - it was about twenty minutes past nine o'clock - it was dark or nearly so - from the position in which the omnibus stood, there would have been no objection to any one in a cab passing by - the deceased was standing at the horses' heads, which were turned towards St. Giles's - I do not think the person in the cab could see him - the deceased was about sixty-three years old.</p>

             (police-constable D 119). I was in Oxford-street, on the 17th of July, near Vere-street - I saw two or three persons running after a cab, and I stopped it - it was going on the gallop, eight or ten miles an hour - the prisoner was driving it, and the cabman was sitting on the dickey by the side - the prisoner was sitting inside; he had the reins and the whip - he gave his name"James King, No. 4, Highbury-place, Islington" - he had got from sixty to one hundred yards from Vere-street, when I stopped the cab - it was a yellow cab; No. 696 - the cabman is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see this accident happen? A. No - I cannot tell whether the horse was frightened at the fall of the poor man, or whether the prisoner was able to control it - the prisoner gave his right address - he did not seem at all intoxicated.</p>

I had been speaking to the deceased just before he was knocked down - I left him, walked to the pavement, and set down my tools, when I heard of the accident - the omnibus passed me at the rate of about eight miles an hour - the cab was going faster, because it gained upon the omnibus - the people called to stop the cab; that attracted my attention - the cab went on at a faster rate, till it was stopped by the policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the person inside the cab? A. No - I cannot tell whether the horse was under the control of the person who had him in hand after the accident.</p>

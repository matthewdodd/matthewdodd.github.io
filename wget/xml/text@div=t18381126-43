                  </hi>. I am servant with Sir William Frimble. On the 30th of October, near nine o'clock, I was in Drury-lane—I had two handkerchiefs in my coat pocket—I heard a rustling near my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner—I accused him of being the thief—he denied it, but imme<lb></lb>diately gave me the handkerchiefs-no other persons were nearer than him—he said two boys took them out of my pocket, and threw them down, but I saw no boys, and the prisoner was close to me.</p>

I have worked as a coach-maker, but I am out of work at present—I did work for Mr. Norris—I have left him a long time and have been working for myself, mending boots and shoes, beating carpets, and cleaning windows—I have given my stall up about a fortnight ago—I lived with my parents at No* 9, Union-street, Lisson-grove—I do not know the prisoner, but I have come to state that I was walking down Drury-lane between nine and ten o'clock that night, and saw two boys run from a gentleman—I saw a young man go across to him, and the gentleman turned and gave him in charge—when I saw the prisoner at the office I said it was not him, it was two other boys—I went down the fol<lb></lb>lowing evening to Bow-street, (I was not there when he was examined,) to see if he had got off—I never spoke to him in my life—his mother did not know me—she was there bidding him good bye—I went up and asked her if she knew him, seeing her speak to him, and then I said I saw the thing done—she asked me if I would come forth here and say I saw the thing done—she told me to come to Newgate—I was not down at Bow-street at the time he was up to have his hearing.</p>

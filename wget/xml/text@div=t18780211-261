                  </hi>. I lodge at 1, Eden Grove; the deceased lodged there also—on 3rd February, about 4.45 p.m., I was in the yard being shaved, and the deceased was there having his boots blacked by a boy—the prisoner came out of the kitchen, and Raffe asked him if he had seen any of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> about—the prisoner said ''You had better go and look for them yourself''—the prisoner then went into the closet, and when he came out the prisoner said that the deceased had himself—the prisoner said that he would throw something at him—Raffe said "Perhaps you can throw it at him"—the prisoner said "Can you <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it at him?"—Raffe said "I can in a moment,'' and sparred up to him—the prisoner said "I don't want to hit you, I might hit the man being shaved;" that was me—I said "I will take good care you won't knock him on me," and I got up, and then the deceased struck the prisoner on the chest or stomach, I don't know which; and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his left hand and hit him on the nose, and he fell—he got up and put his hand to his nose and felt blood, and said "It serves me right, it has let some of the mad blood out of me"—when he fell he pitched on his hands and knees and rolled over—he then got up and had his other boot cleaned, and then went into the closet, and I went away—both the men had had a drop of drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Y</hi>). I received information and went to the lodging-house, which is known an Eden Grove Dormitory, and saw Joseph Raffe lying in bed insensible—I saw dry blood on his right hand—I received information that the prisoner was in a public-house—I sent for him and he came—I said that I belonged to the police and had seen a man lying upstairs insensible, and had received information that he had struck him—he said "Yes, it is quite right, I received great provocation; the man used very offensive language to me; we had both had a drop of drink; I am very sorry it has occurred; he struck me first and I did it in self-defence"—I told him he had better come to the station—he said "yes, I never intended to go away; I should like to have the matter cleared up"—I wish to say that four months ago I saw Raffe in a fit—I have known him for months as one of the most habitual drunkards in the neighbourhood—I saw him four months ago just recovered from a fit, and he had come out of prison the same morning.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 1, Thornhill Square, Barns<lb></lb>bury—I assisted Dr. Crabb in making a post-mortem examination on 9th February—there was a bruise over the bridge of the nose, and the tissues were also bruised—the bones of the nose were both broken, I am quite sure of that—the membranes of the brain were congested, and also the brain itself, and the texture of the brain was somewhat softened—I should say that the congestion was caused from the concussion, the blow was the cause of it—one portion of the skull was driven in—the conges<lb></lb>tion and softening was all from the same cause, and not from any pre<lb></lb>existing cause—the cause of death was congestion of the brain from fracture of the nasal bones produced by the blow—I do not think in the position in which it was it could have been produced by a fall—a blow from a fist would produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Raffe was a strong young man, and bigger than you, about 34 years old—I have known before of a blow of a lighter man's fist producing such an injury—Raffe had been addicted to habits of in<lb></lb>temperance, and although he appeared stout and robust, I do not think he had much stamina—if he had been just released from the House of Correction and taken to a public-house and plied with raw spirits, and then put to bed for 18 hours, taking nothing but cold water, I think he would be more susceptible.</p>

I said I had a house to glaze, and I would look at it - he said if I would call in about half an hour, he would shew it to me; that he had it to sell for a poor man who was in the Bench- he called in about half an hour and we went up to his room over the stable. I saw Matthews in the room, looking over the glass; I did not examine it, for I was afraid of breaking it; it looked very good. Matthews said, if he had all the money in the world, he would not give more than 6l. for it; the prisoner was in the room at that time, I think. I said nothing to him about the price - I never offered him any price; he never asked what I would give for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose any price to the prisoner? A. Never; till I left the money in the publican's hands; and said if he would take 5l. or five guineas for it, I would have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave that message with him? A. I was obliged to go to town - I gave him four sovereigns, and asked him to lend me 25s. I got the glass out of the room on the Sunday morning afterwards; I carried it home, and had it glazed - I bought nothing but plain glass of him; the prisoner had mentioned no price in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not the prisoner tell you he had it from a person at Kensington, who had it from a man in the Bench? A. No; I had known the prisoner for about a fortnight before.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. On the 16th of February, the prisoner told me he had some glass to dispose of, for a person in trouble, and asked if I could get a customer, or buy it myself; he would let me have it reasonable - I went, and while I was measuring it, Sells came; I should call it second glass. I saw some orange coloured, and some ground glass there - there was about 120 square feet altogether; the largest square I saw was twenty-two inches by fifteen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner keep a liverystable, in Earl-street? A. Yes; I know one Cox - I do not know where he is, or whether he has absconded; the prisoner did not tell me it came from Cox.</p>

I asked where he got it; he said he had it to sell for one Rodman, who had bought it at a sale, at Hammersmith and left it for him to take care of, as he could not take it home; and if he got a customer he might sell it for him - the prisoner rented a stable of me, and, I believe, deals in horses.</p>

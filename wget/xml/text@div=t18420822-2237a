                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Massey, a hatter, in the Hampstead-road. On the afternoon of the 15th of July the prisoner and another person came into the shop—the other asked to see a white hat—I showed several—I saw the prisoner take a hat out of the window, and go out—the other man followed in a minute or two afterwards, saying he would call again another day—I ran to the door—a neighbour opposite said something—I saw the prisoner—he turned round twice—the third time he saw me, and ran away—I called, "Stop thief"—when he got into Brook-street I lost sight of him, the mob was so great—he was brought back, and the hat also.</p>

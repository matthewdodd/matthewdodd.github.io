            . I live at the Rose and Crown public-house, Star-street, Shadwell, which is kept by my cousin. The prisoner (whom I knew) came to the house on the 2d of February, in the evening, and asked for change for a 5l. note; I asked who it was for - he said, "For Captain Simms, of the ship Anna;" I did not recollect the name, and told him I had not got it; he said he would take it in copper, or silver, or in any way; I said I had not got it: he came again in a quarter of an hour, and said he would leave the note, and take 2l. or 3l., as the vessel was to sail next day - I took the note, but gave him no change - here it is; he had it in a snuff-box; and had apparently a new black coat on, much too large for him.</p>

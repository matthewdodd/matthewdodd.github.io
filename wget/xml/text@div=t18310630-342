            . I was in the prosecutor's employ. I went out in search of McNiff; I found him at a public-house, in the Seven-dials - he had a new pair of shoes on; there was some beer on the table, and he was singing a song - a person, who was with me, asked him about the silver lace; he said it was in the shop there - the other man then told him if he would tell him where the lace was he would get it out at his own expence, rather than there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300148"></xptr>should be any more row about it; he did not state where it was.</p>
               <p>MR. BURGESS re-examined. As I was coming to Bow-street, the next morning, I went by chance into the prisoner Smart's shop, in Princes-street - I showed him a pattern of some of the ornaments which I had lost, and asked if he had such goods, and if he had any lace according to the new regulation - he turned as if he was going to find the articles, then turned back, and said he had no such goods, for whatever he bought in that way he always melted it directly - he did not show me any thing then, and I went away; I went and saw McNiff, previous to the examination at Bow-street - I did not use any threat or make any promise to get him into conversation - I only said there was quite enough to convict him, as some kerseymere was found on him - in consequence of what he told me I went back to Mr. Smart's shop, with an officer, between ten and eleven o'clock the same morning - the officer went in first, and I waited about five minutes; I then went in, and Mr. Smart stated that what he had purchased he had melted down, and he gave us a bill of 1l. 17s. 6d., as a memorandum of what he had purchased that evening - he then produced this silver, which had been melted, and these other articles, which was what he stated he had purchased, and that he had not purchased any thing else that evening - this silver was then put into a bag, and taken to the office - he stated before the Magistrate that that was what he had purchased, and he had nothing else but what he had melted; the Magistrate immediately granted a search-warrant - I went with it with an officer; Mr. Smart remained at Bow-street - we then searched the premises, and in a back room behind the shop; we found a chest with a great quantity of silver in it - we pulled out a great deal of silver, and found the lace and these ornaments, which I had given to McNiff to work - I had marked them, and knew them again; McNiff had not exactly told me where these things were to be found, but he said it was in a shop near Wardour-street, going down towards the Hay-market; that answered the description of Mr. Smart's, and there I found these articles- when we found them, we produced them to Mr. Smart, and he acknowledged having purchased them of this man for 8s. - they cost me about 2s. 17s. 6d.; they were quite new- I am no judge of what would have been the worth of them to burn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Mr. Smart was not present at any conversation you had with the other prisoner? A. No; I had not been to Mr. Smart's before - he is a refiner; he says their business is to melt down silver lace - I showed him something like these ornaments, but I have not brought here what I showed to him; these which I found at his house correspond with what I showed him - these were sewn on a garment by mistake, but were never worn; they were taken off, and would be used again - I do not know what they would be worth to a refiner; I asked him whether he had any ornaments of this description, and like a star, which I made on a bit of paper- I asked if he had them to sell; I do not recollect a question being asked what they were wanted for - there was a person in the shop talking to him at the time; I do not know that these things are called lace in the trade - we call them ornaments; they are spangles, I believe - I do not know whether those he first produced are called ornaments; we do not use them - I think I went to the shop a second time about half an hour after the first - when we went back we still found him at home: the officer was in about five minutes before I went in - he was going to send his man with the things; the officer then said he would take them, and Mr. Smart said, "If you will take the things, I will come myself;" the officer said,"You must come yourself;" I think we were at Bow-street about a quarter of an hour before we went back a third time; we then left Mr. Smart at the office, but as we went back we met him in Covent-garden - I do not know whether he was on bail; I do not think he had an officer with him - I should imagine he was at large: he had an opportunity of going away - he said, when we were going back to his house, "You had better take my word, whatever was purchased was melted down:" he told us to desire his father to show us two tin boxes, and he showed us, very readily, over the place - I had not been to his house the day before; I went three times that morning - I think it might be an hour after my first calling that I went again, and he had that hour to have disposed of this property, but when the officer went it was there - I did not see his father there at first; his man was there, and he had an opportunity of telling him to get rid of the property; I have known the house for a long time - I know nothing of the parties; there had been an alteration in the military costume; we are acquainted with the costume, but I do not know that refiners know it - a man might not know whether what he bought was according to the present regulation or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The second time you went you brought away these two ornaments, through which stitches had been passed, but they had not been worn? A. Yes; I only asked him then if he had such things to sell - I said nothing to induce him to think I had any suspicion; the second time I went with an officer, and then he produced these silver articles, and went to Bow-street; he said these were what he had purchased the evening before, and he gave me this bill of the amount - he wanted to send his man with them; the officer said, "If you send your man I shall take them;" he said, "You shan't take them from my man, I will go and take them myself;" he did not say any thing about any chests - he said we might take his word there was nothing but what was melted; these things were found at the bottom of the chest, in the back room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went three times to Mr. Smart's? A. Yes; and it was the first time I asked if he had any lace according to the new regulation.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I went with Mr. Burgess to Mr. Smart's - I had not seen the other prisoner at that time; I went in before Mr. Burgess, and saw Mr. Smart there - I asked if he had bought any silver lace last night, and some ornaments belonging to a uniform coat; he called a man by the name of John, and asked him what sort of a man he bought the things of, and each of them described McNiff - I wished him to let the man come to Bow-street, to identify McNiff, and I said I wanted the property - he was weighing the ornaments, and Mr. Burgess came in; he did not state that these did not belong to him - Mr. Smart said these were the ornaments, and that the lace was melted down; he was going to give his man the ornaments, and as I wanted to take them he said he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300149"></xptr>go, and I said, "Very well;" - we went to Bow-street, and when we were going to execute the search-warrant, Mr. Smart wished to go, but I said he must stop - he said his father was old and nervous, and would be alarmed; I told him every thing should be done in a gentle way - he told me to tell his father there were two tin boxes he might show us, but he said it was no use to go to search, as they were burnt - I went down and saw this property taken out of a box, I think it was a tin box, but I was not near enough to see; in coming to Bow-street again, we met Mr. Smart in New-street - he turned and went to Bow-street, and was held to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prosecutor go back to Bow-street with Mr. Smart? A. Yes - I do not know whether he was present when he was held to bail: I was in the shop, and the tin boxes were in the back room - there was nothing to hide them from my view; in my opinion they were taken from a tin box - there was a great deal of lace taken out: the question I put to Mr. Smart was, whether he had bought any lace the night before with military ornaments - he said he had, and he produced these things, I believe, or some similar - I believe he then asked the young man to come forward, and state whether lace had been bought with these ornaments, and I understood the lace was burnt, but whether it was the lace bought with these ornaments or not I do not know; he showed me something similar to this, which he called burnt - he was asked what he gave for it, and I thought it said on the bill, 1l. 17s. 6d.; if he trusted his property with me there would have been no necessity for his going to Bow-street - his father appeared a nervous old gentleman; we were afforded every facility in searching - there seemed no opposition to it; this property could have been melted down in five minutes - there was a fire and every thing backwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When Mr. Smart produced these articles, and showed the bill, did he tell you that he had bought other things? A. No, he did not - I understood the lace was destroyed; I did not go in to search the boxes - I did not see any deal box; there is a partition and a glass door between the shop and parlour - I had been in that room before the search, and saw the two tin boxes; I did not notice any deal box.</p>

            . I am a wool-stapler and merchant. I was at Mr. Smart's at the time of the search - I had been at Bow-street, and Mr. Burgess asked me to accompany him down - I saw this lace and property found in a box in the room adjoining the shop; I believe it was a deal box - there were some small tin boxes in the shop, but I did not notice any in the room; these articles were found in the bottom of the box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You will not swear whether there were any tin boxes in the room? A. No, I did not notice any; I will not swear whether they were found in a tin box or a wooden one - it was filled with lace; the constable, who is not here, was present -Mr. Burgess took out the things; I am not in business just at present - I am waiting the result of an appeal in the House of Lords, and some actions in the King's Bench - Mr. Smedly is my attorney.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know Mr. Smart before this? A. No, I did not; I had no quarrel with him, nor any interest to serve Mr. Burgess - I happened to hear Mr. Burgess was at Bow-street, and went in there; there were some tin boxes in the shop, which the officer took from a drawer - Mr. Smart's father was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the box from which these things were taken larger than the tin boxes? A.Much larger - I do not know that any one pointed out the tin boxes; I should think the box from which this property was taken was about a foot square - the tin boxes were about four or six inches.</p>
               <p>McNiff's Defence. I was very much inebriated, and in consequence of that I committed this act; Mr. Smart said, "Is this your property?" I said Yes; he said, "If it is not, I will not purchase it" - I still persisted it was, and he laid me down 8s.; he is as innocent of buying it, knowing it to be stolen, as I am guilty of the theft - I should not have done it had I not been drunk.</p>
               <p>Smart read the following Defence. I am utterly incapable of what is laid to my charge, and hosts of witnesses will tell you the same; the circumstances which have brought me into this, I would have detailed before the Magistrate, but was not allowed- we buy lace and ornaments to burn, that is, to get the silver they contain; we are not in the habit of selling them, and if any one asked if I had lace of any particular pattern, I should have answered No - on the day I bought these, several ornaments and pieces of lace had been offered, which had been refused, but about six o'clock I bought the silver ornaments of an officer's coat, and with them a piece of lace which I have since discovered had belonged to -; the late army regulations having dispensed with much of the lace formerly worn, it is very common for such articles to be offered for sale, though they had not been worn - when the prosecutor called at my house, what passed will be detailed to you; in about ten minutes after the Police-officer called, and asked if I had bought any military ornaments of a man, I showed him what I had bought at six o'clock, and gave him the weight, and the amount from the day-book - he asked me to take them to Bow-street, and I did; he asked if I should know the man - I said I did not, but he might ask my man; I went to Bow-street, and saw the man now beside me, but that was not the man I had bought these ornaments of - the lace brought with these ornaments had been burnt, as I stated; when the prosecutor and the officer asked where it was, I said burnt - you will at once perceive what lace I meant, but they who asked the question did not perceive my meaning; a search-warrant was then granted, and these things were found in an open tin box, with other pieces of lace which had been purchased, and which I had abundant time to have removed, had I been the person capable of the felony laid to my charge; all this I would have explained to Mr. Halls, but he would not allow me.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Smart. I recollect these military ornaments and some silver lace being brought at the same time, by a person who is not here - I burnt it to ascertain the value and weight of it; this is the produce of it - I cannot exactly tell what it weights; my master gave 5s. 8d. an ounce for it - I do not remember how much was paid for it; I did not see McNiff come afterwards, but this lace was not brought by him - we buy to refine, not to sell in the same state we buy it; we melt it into bars.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were present when these ornaments, and some lace which has been burnt, were brought to your shop? A. Yes; that was about five o'clock; I did not see these other things and this lace brought - we ask questions of persons who are strangers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300150"></xptr>of whom we have any suspicion; I do not know whether my master asks other persons - Mr. Smart keeps these things in a tin box in the shop till they are melted; we sometimes burn new lace and ornaments - the person we bought these ornaments and the lace which was burnt of, was a respectable tall man; I never saw him before nor since - he did not tell me where he came from; I was in the back shop - he brought an officer's belt, and I destroyed it myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you the only person employed at burning silver lace? A. Yes - there was a fire in the place when they came to Mr. Smart.</p>
               <p>Thirty-two witnesses gave Smart an undeniable character, several of whom being silver-refiners, valued the property at about 8s. to burn.</p>

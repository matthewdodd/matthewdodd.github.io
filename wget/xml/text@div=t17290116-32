Sentement, to long whom the Prisoner was a Coachman, the Prisoner had for a long Time endeavour'd to perswade him to be Confederate in robbing his Master; that at length, with frequent Importunities, he was prevail'd with to a Complyance. That on the Day mentioned in the Indictment, he the Prisoner, took the Opportunity of Mr. Charlwood's, and the Maid's being Abroad, and with false Keys opened several Doors, and took out the Plate from the Lady Thorold's Trunk, and the Money from his Master's Desk, and brought down his Hands full of Guineas. That he went up Stairs a second Time, and brought down more Plate, and then broke open his Master's Till, out of which he took a broad Piece, a Guinea, a half Guinea, and some Silver; that they shar'd the Money, and the Prisoner hid the Plate in the Still-Room. That in the Morning betimes, after this, he got up, and pull'd out the Frame of the Cellar Window, and then ry'd this Deponent down in his Bed to put a Colour on the Knavery, as if it was done by common Housebreakers; after which, he went up Stairs, and fir'd off a Pistol, to amuse the Neighbourhood, and Alarum the Family, with the Apprehension of Thieves and Robbers.</p>
               <p>That some Time after, none of them being in the least suspected, and the Prisoner's Money exhausted, he consulted with this Deponent about melting down the Silver, and accordingly they bought a melting Pot, and after melting it, ran it upon the Hearth, and the Prisoner dropping it afterwards in the Dirt, perswaded this Deponent to go with him to a Silversmith, to vouch for him, That he see him find it in the Dirt; but the Silversmith being cautious, stopp'd the Plate, and very honestly, and industriously discover'd the Scene of Iniquity; and upon the first Appearance of a Discovery, this Deponent made a full Confession, and was admitted an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weaks the Silversmith corroborated the latter Part of this Deposition, in relating every Circumstance of their coming to him with the Plate, his Suspicion, and their being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen of Worth appear'd for his Character, who gave him an extraordinary good Word, he having serv'd some of them as a Coachman, others as a Footman, and all to the best of their Knowledge, as a faithful Servant; but notwithstanding his former Character, the Fact appear'd plain, upon which the Jury found him <rs id="t17290116-32-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

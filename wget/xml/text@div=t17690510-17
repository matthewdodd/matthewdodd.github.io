            . I had left my place at the White-Swan at Knightsbridge. I was not well, so I took a coach at the watch-house, to go to Mrs. Brand's at <placeName id="t17690510-17-crimeloc117">Kensington Gravel-pits</placeName>

He drove me to the ditch-side on the opposite side the way by Mrs. Brand's. I did not know where Mrs. Brand lived. I saw the house, but did not know it was her house. He opened the door on the farther side and pulled me out of the coach. I fell on my face, and it stunned me. I was not sensible. I was carried into a house by a relation of mine. I did not come to myself till after I was carried in at Mrs. Brand's. The prisoner was then gone. He was by the coach-side half an hour before he pulled me out. He said, D - n you, you shall come out. I lost half a guinea and eighteen-pence, and a shoe and silver buckle. My friends had taken the number of his coach, so I took him up last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the coach with you?</p>
               <p>E. Dawson. No, there was not; nor no body by the coach side when he pulled me out. I paid the coachman before I came there.</p>

            . I never saw the prosecutrix before I saw her at Mrs. Brand's, where I live. I saw the coach by the ditch side opposite our house. The prisoner drove it. I thought he was waiting for somebody; he was by the coach side; I could see his legs. After some time, the woman was brought into our house. I gave her some hartshorn drops and water. She said, she had lost her money and shoe. The coach was gone. Then we went to the place, but could not find any thing. After she was brought in, I went and fetched her bundle and hat from the coach. That was about four or five minutes before the coachman drove away. Her face was bloody, and her gown-sleeve bloody also.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she fuddled or sober?</p>
               <p>Jeffery. I cannot say, having never seen her before. She said she had lost her money, and thought the coachman must have it.</p>

            . I went out and saw the coach standing. I went in and eat my supper. Then I went out again, and heard a noise at the coach. I went round it; there lay the woman. I went and got a chair, and carried her over to Mrs. Brand's. I asked the coachman how long he had been there; he said he had stood there a good while. There were her things lying about the road.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Had you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I spent a couple of shillings at the tap-room at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or feel him take your money?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>The woman came with another woman with her, very much in liquor. She said she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100020"></xptr> have a coach: I said, I would not carry her at all. She much desired one. Then said I, Get in. She was mortal fuddled to be sure. We got her in. I drove her to where she wanted to go, and then I got down. She said the house was farther up. I could not get her out for some time. At last she tumbled out by the side of the road. I goes to a house and said, She is in liquor, come and take her in; and two men came and took her in a chair. Then I said, There are some bundles come and take them out of the coach. The coach was swimming in piss. I said. There are two glasses broke, and my coach daubed, therefore I ought to have a couple of shillings. The man gave me them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Grover. Did you observe the coach?</p>
               <p>Grover. I did. The coach was very wet at the bottom; it ran down both sides the coach.</p>

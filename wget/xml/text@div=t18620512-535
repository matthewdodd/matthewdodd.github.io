                  </hi>. I am a paperhanger, and live at 18, William-street, Stepney—between 12 and 1 o'clock, on the morning of 26th May, I was in High-street, Whitechapel—I had been spending the evening with some friends at Lambeth, and having something to drink, but I was sober—I knew what I was about—as I was walking in the High-street two females came up to me, and I had some conversation with them—I walked a little distance with them—they wanted me to go somewhere, and—went to Flower and Dean-street—we were standing outside the house—I would not go in—I did not like the place, and I said, "No, I am going home"—I was then suddenly seized by the prisoner Lucking—he put his hand round my neck—when he let go I called out "Police!" but I could not call out while he was holding me—he held me too tight—I was put in that fear that I could not halloo nor speak—before he came up, I had a silver watch in my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, this metal tobacco-box in my left-hand pocket, and a silk handkerchief my coat-pocket—they were all gone when Lucking went away—the watch was fastened to my dress by this silver chain, which was round my neck—when he went away it was broken as it is now—I saw some one else about that time, who I believe to be Percival, but I will not swear to him—he was, it might be, two or three yards from Lucking at the time it happened—the handkerchief and the watch all went while Lucking had got hold of me—as soon as Lucking's hand was removed from my throat, they both ran away; one, one way, and the other, the other—I can swear to the man that held me—when I was released, I met a policeman walking up the street—I said, "I have been robbed of a watch"—I had called out "Police!" before that—I do not know whether they ran in the same or different directions—they were not brought back at all—Percival was shown to me by a constable some few minutes afterwards—the constable said, "Should you know the man again?"—I said, "Yes, I should"—I went with him, and said, "That is the man"—the constable did not take me to Lucking's house—after he had taken Lucking, he went and fetched Percival—I did not accompany the policeman to a house—I gave four guineas for the watch.</p>

On 26th March, I was in the H division of police, No. 96—on that night, or early on the following morning, I was on duty in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields—I saw a crowd and heard a cry—I saw Lucking and Percival coming out of the crowd, running—one went one aide of the road and the other the other side—as soon as they saw me they stopped and walked—I asked Lucking what was the matter up there—he said, "Nothing particular"—about ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards Edgings came up to me and said, "Constable, I have lost my watch"—I said, "Would you know the men that took your watch if you saw them"—he said, "Yes; I would"—I said, "Come with me;" and I took him to Lucking's house at the corner of George-street, Spitalfields—I knocked at the door and called Lucking out, and as soon as he came to the door, Edgings said, "That is the man that has throttled me, and taken my watch"—Lucking made no reply to that—I then told him he must come with me to the station, and took him there—I then went back to search for the watch, and saw Percival amongst the crowd, opposite Lucking's house, just in the centre of the road—I told Percival he must come with me down to the station, that I wanted him down there—he made no reply, but came with me—the prosecutor was at the station.</p>

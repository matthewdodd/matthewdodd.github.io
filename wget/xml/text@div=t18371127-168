On Saturday night, the 18th of November, I was on duty in High-street, Bow, and saw Mrs. Tebbenham standing by her door-way—I bid her good night, and she went away—I then heard the prisoner say to the boy, "You are not wanted; you had better go away"—they were shutting the shop up—I stood on the opposite side of the way, and saw the prisoner go to his lodgings, and then I went with the sergeant to the prosecutor—I went with Mrs. Tebbenham to the prisoner's lodgings, and said to him I supposed he knew what we came about—he said no—I said, "We come for the piece of meat that you brought away from the shop to-night"—he firmly denied it—I said it was no use—he then took this pork out, and said, "I have only got one piece; this is what I brought to-night," and then I went to the cupboard, and saw some more pork—he then took. up a knife, and said, "I don't know what business you have in my place; we will have a <hi rend="italic">row"</hi>—I advised him to put it down—I took out my staff, and then he put it down.</p>

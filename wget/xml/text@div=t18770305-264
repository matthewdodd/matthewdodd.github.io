                  </hi>. I am at present staying at the Ship Hotel, Halliford—I am possessed of considerable property in the counties of Wex-ford, Tipperary, and Waterford—I came to reside in England in 1871, and have lived here since then—in the year 1875 I made the acquaintance of the late Sir Edward Cunningham—I resided at Clunn's Hotel, I think from April 30th, 1875, I till the end of June—I had to pay a large sum of money on certain bills of exchange for Sir Edward Cunningham—I think I left Clunn's Hotel on 10th October, and returned to it on 8th November—Sir Edward Cunningham was living there at that time; he occupied a bed-room next to mine—I was on very friendly terms with him at that time—in November he introduced me to the two defendants—I don't know the date—he introduced them as wine merchants—after that introduction they were in the habit of coming early in the morning to my room—they came at different hours, generally about 10 o'clock—at that time I was in bed—they would remain an hour, perhaps—while they were there they would drink champagne cup—about six or eight champagne cups used to be ordered up in the morning, and hot pickle sandwiches—they had no other drink that I remember—I drank with them—I paid for it—I do not remember the 24th November—I remember their coming to my bed-room on the morning of a dinner with Mr. Hollingshead—they came at the usual hour, about 10 o'clock—they had sandwiches and champagne cup on that occasion—I don't think I had a luncheon party that day—I remember a suggestion being made by one of the defendants, I can't remember which, Owing to a fire at the sessions House, no sitting was held in the Old Court this Session.</p>

               <p>about a dinner at Clunn's—I ordered the dinner in their presence, the best that could be got, and drink unlimited—I don't think there were any other persons dining there besides the defendants—I think Mr. Hoofe dined there, I am not certain—there was a good deal of wine drank at that dinner—before the dinner I think Sir Edward Cunningham suggested turtle soup—no reason was given for that, except that as Mr. Hollingshead dined they wanted the best to be put on the table—before the 25th Wetherall, I believe, asked me to go to Spam to buy horses, not knowing an) thing of the wine trade—that was said in my bed-room one morning when the drink was going on—after the dinner on the 24th I remember going to Evans'—I was drunk when I went there—the defendants went with me—we had more drink there; I cannot give any account of what I drank there—I don't know whether I have since paid the bill for the drink—after I left Evans' I think I went to Clunn's—I am unable to state which of the defendants went with me—I have not the slightest idea how I got to bed or at what hour—I can't tell whether the defendants and Cunningham came to my room next morning, most likely, I suppose so—I suppose we had the usual champagne cup; that took place every morning that they came—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in signed 25th November—I signed it in bed. (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be an agreement between the witness and the defendants, by which in consideration of Wetherall's relinquishing to the witness a portion of the wine business recently carried on by him and Cottam, at</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">Burleigh Street, Mr. Doyle was to advance</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be used for the purposes of the said business or otherwise; the four partners to share equally in the profits or losses, and to take on themselves the liabilities of the late firm</hi>.) I never saw the contents of that document till now; oh, yes, I beg pardon, I saw it before the Magistrate—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something I heard I went to my solicitor, Mr. Mitton—before I went to him I knew that I had signed that document entering into a part<lb></lb>nership with Wetherall, De Chastelaine, and Cunningham, in the wine business; I don't know the date when I first knew it, it was before I went to my solicitor; I was advised to go to him by a friend, Mr. Flores, on the 25th, the morning after the dinner—I suppose this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the docu<lb></lb>ment I signed; I have not the slightest recollection of signing it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "December 7th, Clunn's Hotel. Dear Wetherall, I have not as yet received your letter, but Cunningham has explained the contents.

I had a servant John Elwood, attending upon me at that time—I saw my solicitor from time to time, and on 6th December, I attended with him at counsel's chambers, for the purpose of having a consultation—I was unable to see counsel; I don't remember where I went to afterwards—I don't remember whether I went to the Criterion, or whether I went back to Clunn's after I had been to counsel's chambers—I do not remember what happened next morning—I do not remember Cunningham and De Chastelaine coming to my room that morning; they always came there, I don't remember whether they came first and Wetherall afterwards—I remember a letter being dictated to me, I think by Wetherall or De Chastelaine; I can't remember which—I remember writing a letter; I remember it to a certain extent—I think Sir Edward Cun<lb></lb>ningham may have dictated it tome; I think De Chastelaine and Wetherall were with, him at the tune—I don't <hi rend="italic">know</hi> whether they all came together</p>

               <p>that morning, or whether two came first, and the other subsequently, I remember subsequently to that my solicitor sending me away from Clunn's into the country; I don't know the date—I don't remember putting a date to this letter—I don't remember whether I was asked by anybody to put a date to it—before I went out of town I remember going to De Chastelaine's place; that was either in North Street or Bury Street—at one place I played the piano, and at the other place I drank; I don't remember what place it was—there had been conversation from time to time about my going to Spain and buying horses—I don't know when I first became acquainted with the fact that I had signed a partnership in the wine business.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Doyle and have been so since May, 1876—I came with him to Clunn's Hotel about 8th November, and remained there till 7th December—during the time I have been in his service he was almost always drinking, with the exception of a week or two when we were away—he had suffered from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> three times since I have been with him—he always had half a pint of brandy put by his bedside at night—I first saw Sir Edward Cunningham about the beginning of November; he was then staying at the hotel, he occupied the room next to Mr. Doyle, he was constantly in Mr. Doyle's society, he came every morning to his bed-room and had a brandy and soda—the two defendants were introduced to Mr. Doyle about 10th or 12th November—I did not see the introduction, but I saw them at the hotel in Mr. Doyle's room—Mr. De Chastelaine used to come almost every day—Mr. Wetherall did not come so often—Mr. De C Chastelaine used to come about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning—Sir Edward Cunningham used to come the first thing every morning while Mr. Doyle was in bed, and he always used to have brandy and soda or whiskey and milk, and champagne cups afterwards—they had five or six quart champagne cups as a rule—Mr. Doyle joined with them in drinking—I never heard anything about the wine business—I heard Sir Edward Cunningham say that Mr. Doyle was going to Spain with him to buy horses—he said that to Mr. Doyle in my presence, and he said it was a very good thing for him, because he was delicate, and it was a nice warm climate—on 24th November I remember the defendants being in the bed-room in the early morning as usual—they had brandies and sodas and five or six champagne cups as usual—I heard that there was to be a dinner—Sir Edward Cunningham, Mr. De Chastelaine, and Mr. Doyle spoke about it—I heard them say that they must have a very good dinner, because it was important, and I also heard Mr. Doyle say that it made a difference of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him having a good dinner; he did not say why—the three defendants and two other gentlemen were there to luncheon that day, they had some champagne and burgundy at lunch—I remember the dinner that evening—I think there was only one other guest besides the defendants—I waited at dinner—I think they had several bottles of champagne go up—I saw Mr. Doyle before he left the hotel after dinner; he was drunk—I saw them go into Evans', Sir Edward Cunningham, Mr. Doyle, and Mr. De Chastelaine; that was all, I think, who went—Mr. Wetherall did not go with them into Evans'—I saw them when they left 'Evans', at 12.30—Sir Edward came in with Mr. Doyle, he had hold of Mr. Doyle's arm, and Mr. De Chastelaine came in just after them—they had some more drink and sat up till between 3 and I o'clock—I then took Mr. Doyle to bed—I always followed him to bed; "he was very drink, more so than usual—I did not undress him, he would not let me—I took hold of his coat and shoved him on to the bed, and took hold of his legs and threw him backwards into the bed—he dosed off for a little time, he woke up about an hour after and wanted a brandy and soda—I would not give him one at first and he said "Let us have a split old man," and I let him have a split—I then undressed him and put him into bed—next morning Sir Edward Cunningham came into the bed-room early, between 8 and 9 o'clock; he said he was awfully thirsty and wanted a brandy and soda, and I gave him one—all this drink was put down to Mr. Doyle's account—Sir Edward</p>

I am a solicitor, of 2, Gray's Inn Square—I have acted as solicitor for Mr. Doyle since 1871—I am the solicitor con<lb></lb>ducting this prosecution—on 2nd December Mr. Doyle's servant came to me—in consequence of what he said to me I went and saw Mr. Doyle at Clunn's hotel—I had some conversation with him, in consequence of which, on the following Monday, the 4th, I wrote this letter to Mr. Wetherall. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—My client, Mr. Doyle, informs me that he has placed his signa<lb></lb>ture to a document in your possession, of the purport of which he appears to be in perfect ignorance. Will you furnish me with copy, in order that I my approve it on Mr. Doyle's behalf?") I received no reply to that—I wrote again stating that as Mr. Doyle was not in a state to sign any such document I must insist on its being given up or I should take the most sum<lb></lb>mary measures to bring him and others to justice—I then received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th December</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Wetherall, and stated that he had positive evidence of Mr. Doyle's approval of what he had done, and (that on receiving a note from him he would place the document</hi> in <hi rend="italic">question before him, for inspection</hi>.) I received that letter on the morning of the 8th on the morning of the 6th I got this paper with a billhead from Mr. Flora, he sent it to me and said he had found it in the hotel—I only know Wetherall's handwriting by the letters I received; this is in the same hand-writing as the letters. (<hi rend="italic">Head;</hi> "5th December, 1876. Wetherall, Doyle, &amp;Co., wine merchants, &amp;c, 10, Burleigh Street, Strand, We have received the enclosed letter from Mr. Doyle's solicitor. What is the meaning of it? It seems to me very sharp. Please show it to Doyle and ask him to see me on the matter").' On the morning of the 6th I went to 10, Burleigh Street, strand—I found there a sort of vault, or cellar, and two small offices—the name of Cottam, Wetherall, &amp; Co. was on the door post—on first entering there was a small office, there was a large desk in the centre of the room, I id not notice anything else; there was very little furniture indeed—you passed through a green baize door into another office; there were three desks there, a sofa, and a few chairs, cigar boxes, and a bottle or two of wine—here were some bottles of brandy on the table, and I think a bottle of sherry—I did not notice any claret—I saw no clerks there—I saw De Chas<lb></lb>telaine, he came out of the inner office—I told him that I wanted to look at the agreement that I understood Mr. Doyle had signed—he said he was not able to let me have it, it was in the possession of Mr. Wetherall, and Mr. Wetherall was out—I told him that if any use was made of any document</p>

               <p>that had been signed by Mr. Doyle it would be made a very serious matter of, and I cautioned him against allowing any use whatever to be made of anything that Mr. Doyle had anything to do with, that Mr. Doyle was a man that I considered incapable of entering into any engagement whatever—he expressed his surprise, he said he was not aware that was the case, and a copy of the agreement should be sent to me by that day's post, I was to have it that afternoon, it did not come, and on the morning of the 8th I called again at Burleigh Street about 10.40—I found nobody in the offices, they were locked up—I saw that the name on the door had been changed to Wetherall, Doyle,&amp; Co.—I went there again about 4 o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon—I then found Mr. De Chastelaine there; there was nobody else there then—I had a long conversation with him, it was merely a reiteration of what I had said before, that Mr. Doyle was a man incapable of entering into an agreement and I must insist upon having the document and have it destroyed at once—I asked Mr. De Chastelaine whether Mr. Doyle's credit had been in any way pledged in connection with the business—he said "Yes," they had entered into certain arrangements which would make it very diffi<lb></lb>cult, and so on—I told him it was a very serious matter, that I was in full possession of all the facts in connection with their having got his signature to the agreement, and I urged upon him considerably that he should hand over to me the document at once in order to prevent any further unplea<lb></lb>santness—he said that it was simply impossible to do so, that Mr. Wetherall would be there that afternoon and he would talk to him on the subject—I said I must have it before I left, so I took a seat and remained till Mr. Wetherall came, which was about 5.30—I reiterated to him what I had said to De Chastelaine and said that I must see the agreement at once—he said he wound fetch for me from his solicitor, Mr. Shires—he went out, came back, and said that Mr. Shires was out—I said I would wait till he returned—I waited, and after a time Mr. Wetherall went out again and returned and handed me the agreement; I took a copy of it; this is the agreement; I think it was stamped at that time—I told Mr. Wetherall it was a matter in which it would be impossible for me to allow any time to elapse, that the thing must be destroyed at once, and I must also have a guarantee that Mr. Doyle's credit had not been in any way pledged, because I did not consider that he was a person fit to enter into an agreement—on that morning, find<lb></lb>ing that the offices were locked up and that the cellar was open, I went down into the cellar and took the opportunity of making an investigation—I found a small boy there, between eight and twelve years of age—I saw three casks, I don't know whether they were full or not, a number of dozen bottles of racked wine, they looked like claret bottles, perhaps forty dozen—the bottles looked clean, they did not look like old port, or anything of that sort I have on many occasions written for Mr. Doyle's bill at Clunn's, I have not been able to get it—I saw Mr. Doyle before the 24th or 25th November—his state duaing the last two or three years has never been very satisfactory, it is very difficult to get him when he is not more or less under the influence of intoxication.</p>

I drew; I treated that as part of the capital—there were books kept, a ledger and cash-book—I have not had notice to produce them—I believe Wetherall told me that he had made an arrangement to join Mr. Doyle, and that Mr. Doyle objected to the agreement that had been drawn up; to the arrangements that had been made—he said nothing further—the business was carried on at 10, Burleigh Street—this book is in my hand-writing—Mr. Wetherall would make entries in it—it is a cash-book, a day book—I did not keep the books—there was no cellar-book, there was an order-book—my reason for leaving the business was entirely of a personal nature, a disagreement between ourselves privately—it was not a subject of money—Wetherall put in about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business—I don't know what he drew out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I made Mr. Wetherall's acquaintance about November, 1875, I met him casually, and afterwards became on inti<lb></lb>mate terms—the reason for my quitting the partnership was with reference to some private and domestic matter, and there was a quarrel between us on that point—during the time we were in partnership we dealt in the purchase of wines with Montis, Smith,&amp; Co., of Mark Lane; they are a well<lb></lb>known firm—I think we purchased wine of them to the extent of over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we also purchased wine of Oak, Simson,&amp; Co., well-known wine merchants, to tie extent of over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we purchased wine of Boursot &amp; Co., of 9, Hart Street, wine merchants, to the extent of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; also of Messrs. Southend &amp; Co. of St. Dunstan's Hill, to the extent of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and cigars of Archer—I remember Mr. Wetherall going to Spain—while he was there I received from him value to the extent of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shares of the Union Steam Navi<lb></lb>gation Company; 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that came to my hands; that was not part of the 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I drew out—the remainder of the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to somebody else to whom money was owed—75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, was used for the business—I left the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Mr. Mattie's hands; I had no portion of that—at the time of making Wetherall's acquaintance I learnt from him that he had something like 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him in Spain—Mr. Anderson, of Shepherd's Bush, was a customer; also Mr. Burgess, of Newland House, Carlisle Square; Mr. Beattie,</p>

             (police-officer). I was on duty in Silver-street, on the 27th of April, between three and four in the morning - I saw the prosecutor, who said the prisoner had robbed him of a box and some money - I took him to the station-house - on the way, he said he had no box, nor yet money of the prosecutor's - at the station-house he took out two boxes, and said, "Is either of these it?" - the prosecutor said, "No" - I then searched him, and found two more boxes, one of which is the prosecutor's - I found three half-crowns and four shillings and sixpence in his trousers pocket - he admitted, next morning, that it was the prosecutor's money, and he had taken it out of a lark, and should have returned it to him next morning.</p>

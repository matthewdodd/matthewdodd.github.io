On 9th April, about 10.25 p.m. I was at the back of St. Giles's Church, going round to examine the doors, and heard a noise at the far end of the church—I went to ascertain what it was and found' a bundle on the churchyard path, and farther on I saw. the prisoner with his face to the wall—as I got close to him he turned round and tried to pass on my left—I caught hold of his left arm and then of his wrists and secured him—I asked what he was doing there—he made no</p>

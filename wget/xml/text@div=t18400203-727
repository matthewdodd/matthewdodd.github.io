                  </hi>. I am shopman to George Frederick Butcher, a linen-draper at Hoxton. On the 1st of February, about three o'clock, the prisoner and another female came to the shop, and asked for some lining—I showed them some—they bought two or three things, and asked to look at some lace—I showed them some in a box, and sold them two yards and three quarters—I took the box back, and one of the young men told me something—I then went and asked the prisoner if she meant to keep the lace which she had under her shawl—she said, "What lace?"—the other female rose up—the prisoner rose at the same time, and I saw two pieces of lace on the floor—another fell to the ground between the prisoner and the counter—I sent for the policeman, and gave her into custody—this is my master's lace (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

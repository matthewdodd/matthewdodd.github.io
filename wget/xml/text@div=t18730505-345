I am the wife of John Spinks, a railway porter—I live with a man named John Ransom—on Saturday night, 26th April, I was in a public-house on Tower Hill, with him—I asked him if he was coming home; he said "Not yet"—I said "You had better come home, and have some food indoors, instead of spending your money here, "and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the rent—the prisoner was standing at the counter at the time—he said if I did not hold my tongue he would smack me across the jaw—I turned round and said "It won't pay you"—he laid hold of me by the wrist, and was going to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> me outside the door—he had a knife in his right hand, and struck me, outside of the door—the blood flowed, and I said "You have stabbed me"—I had seen the knife in his hand before—he had been cutting tobacco—I went outside, and called "Police!" and gave him into custody.</p>

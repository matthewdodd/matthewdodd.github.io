Barry personally between June last and February, but I may have had deliveries of jute from the wharf—I saw Mr. Alfred Barry on the works between November and February—I did not Bee Mr. John George Barry till the November fire—Mr. Alfred Barry did mention to me before that time that some of the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi> jute had been saved from the fire; nothing passed about the <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Cabot</hi>—I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as a settlement of my claim on the policy—my writing is across it—(<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 1,313<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to J.

                  </hi>. I act as agent to some of the insurance offices—I received this paper, marked W. from Meriton's Wharf—I saw Alfred and John Barry on that occasion—I requested to be furnished with a list of all the goods described in the fire—they promised to have it sent on to my office—I asked Mr. Alfred Barry on one occasion, Mr. Thorne on another occasion, and I think I once saw Arnett, and requested him to send it, but my principal interviews were with Alfred Barry and Thorne—I after<lb></lb>wards found that list left at my office in an envelope—I did not see any of the parties about it; I had no occasion—I believe it to be in Thorne's writing, but cannot swear to it; there is no signature to it—I believe I received it a week or ten days after the fire—I represent several offices; the Royal Exchange and others, but not the London and Lancashire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-manager at the London and Lancashire office—about the end of September, 1864, after the claim for the jute by the Sebastian Cabot had been paid, Mr. Alfred Barry called upon me—I cannot give you the date—he stated that we had not entered the usual wharfinger's certificate in respect of Messrs. Baxter's claim—that is a</p>

               <p>certificate that the goods were there at the time of the fire—I said that we had not, but we had satisfied ourselves from inquiry at the wharf that the goods were there at the time of the fire—he said that it was usual to obtain the certificate, because in the event of the person whose goods they were being a dishonest man, he could get his money without paying their wharf charge—the ordinary course is that the wharfinger gets his charge paid before he gives a certificate to the insurance office.</p>

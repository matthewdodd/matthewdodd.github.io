                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there about seven years—he was a clerk in the same office—he was employed on Sunday evenings in the sorting tender, in the Cambridge Railway—he went on the tender on Sunday evening and returned the next morning—it was his duty to open the mail-bag and sort the letters—in consequence of complaints I made up a letter on Saturday, 25th June, which enclosed 2 half-sovereigns and some postage-stamps—the card was put in the letter and the postage stamps round it—the coins were stuck in a slit in the card, and the whole put in a letter and fastened down with gum—the letter was directed to the Rev. William Smythe, the Rectory, Midhurst—I took the letter and posted it at the Romford Post-office, about 4 o'clock, on 25th June—I also posted another letter addressed to Tunbridge Wells—they would both go the same day—I communicated with Mr. Dixon about these letters—they would leave the Post-office on the Sunday morning—on the arrival of the Cambridge train, on Monday morning, the 27th, I found the letter to Tunbridge Wells, but not the one to Midhurst; that contained the money—it was the prisoner's duty to be, on the Sunday evening, on the tender which goes down from London to Cambridge—he would be on the tender about 1/2 past 8 o'clock, going towards Cambridge—I looked for the letter addressed to the Rev. Mr. Smythe in the Cambridge bag, and could not find it—the bag was sealed in the ordinary way—there was a letter-bill made up by the prisoner—the person who sorts the letters signs the bill, and that bill was signed by the prisoner—the prisoner re<lb></lb>turned about 5 o'clock, on the Monday morning, and after he had been there about an hour, I took him into a private room, and asked him if he had performed duty, at the Cambridge sorting-tender on the last evening—he said "Yes"—I said that I had been informed that a money-letter, addressed to Midhurst, had been sent in one of his bags, and I asked him if he knew anything about it—he said he did not—I asked him if he had re<lb></lb>ceived such a letter, what he would have done with it—he said he would have returned it in his bag—I said, "It has not arrived; how would you account for that?"—he said it should have arrived, and he could not account for it—I asked him if he would allow the officer to see whether he had it in his pocket—he said, "Yes," and the officer, Bingham, searched him, and took from his-pocket a sovereign, 4 half-sovereigns, some silver, and 12 postage-stamps—I looked at the 4 half-sovereigns, and found amongst them the two that I had put in the letter, and which I had marked; and I found my marks upon the postage stamps also—these are the 2 half-sovereigns, and these are the postage stamps—I told the prisoner that these 2 half-sovereigns had been enclosed in the letter I had just asked him about, and I asked him where he got them—he said, "In the tender; I found them in the bag"—I asked him where he got the postage-stamps—he said, "The postage-stamps I also found in the same bag"—that money and stamps were the property of the Postmaster-General—I spoke to the prisoner about the bag being sealed—he said the bag was properly tied and sealed.</p>

Mr. Smythe, Midhurst—it contained something, and was securely fastened—I had seen that letter made up at the Post-office in the morning, by Mr. Gardner—I made up a bag for Cambridge, and in consequence of instructions I placed those two letters in the bag for Cambridge in the up journey, on Sunday morning—there were other letters in that bag—I came with that bag up to London, and in due course that bag would be taken to the Post-office about 5 o'clock in the morning—that Cambridge bag was tied and sealed by me before it was sent to the Post-office—it was put in another large bag, and sent by George Buck to the Post-office.</p>

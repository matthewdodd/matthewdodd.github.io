On Tuesday. the 7th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, the policeman celled me up, and asked if I had not some horses and a cart in my stable, belonging to Mr. Drummond, of Paddington—I said, "Yes"—he asked if 1 knew they had just left my premises—I said I did not know it—we fetched the two men back—the prisoner was sitting in the cart the pro<lb></lb>perty was found in—we brought them back to the yard, ordered them to take their horses out, which the other did, and made his escape—in the cart I found the things stated—they belong to me—they were in a sack in the cart—the prisoner and the other man had been stopping at ray house a month with their horses—their master had taken my stable for a short time, as they were drawing gravel on the road.</p>

Stop thief! I pursued myself, and endeavoured to take him, but did not succeed - I saw him about two o'clock the same day, in custody; he was then in quite a different dress, but his countenance had struck me, as the light shone as brilliant as the day almost - I gave a description of his dress to Bolton, at the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What description did you give? A. That he was a man about my own stature, with a round face, but stouter; I had been on duty, but had nothing to drink more than my usual beer - I was quite sober; I know Mr. Ainsley; he is a stout man, about five feet high - he is the man who came forward to make a compromise on behalf of those who robbed me - I had not seen Ainaley that evening.</p>

               <p>Q. You said you thought that was the man? A. No. 1 said he was not the man who robbed me - I thought he was one of the party; I never said I was drunk.</p>

On the Monday following - it happened on Thursday night; I was not at home when he called, but saw him about seven o'clock in the evening - he asked me what news; I told him nothing particular, knowing him to be a bad character - I was cantious; he said, "I think I have seen your name in the paper, have you lost any thing?" I said I had lost my watch; he said, "Are you positive of it?" I said Yes - he said, "It is a sad thing, but your watch is quite sufficient, if you are positive, but would not another watch and money satisfy you?" I said,"Is it my own watch?" he said, "No; your own watch is not comeatable, but you shall have a watch and money to satisfy you" - I said,"No, I decline it, the law shall have its course;" the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Police. I saw Doyle at the station-house on Thursday morning, the 31st of August, about ten o'clock - he gave me an account of his having been robbed, and described the person who robbed him; he described his dress, and said he was a man about his own stature, with broad shoulders, and wore a fustain jacket - I acted on his information, and took the prisoner in Angel-alley, Whitechapel, close to Whitechapel-church; I said, "Bill, I want you" - (I had seen him before in the habit of wearing the dress described, but he then had a different dress on) - he said, "I am wanted for every b - y thing;" I took him to the watch-house, and fetched the prosecutor there before I told him what he was taken for - the prosecutor immediately said, "That's the man, I will swear to him from one hundred men."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You received information about ten o'clock? A. Yes, on Thursday morning, and took him about two - I had seen him between ten and two, but did not take him; he could not help coming with me - there were two examinations before the Magistrate on the Thursday and Saturday - when I took him he was dressed as he is now; I believe he had the same coat on; I am not unacquainted with his person - I do not know that I ever saw him in that coat before; I have seen him in a fustain jacket five nights out of a week - I have seen him in a black coat before, but am pretty certain I never saw him in the coat he has on; I have seen him in one of the same shape - there are a great many had characters on my beat, and I am in the habit of looking at them: when I saw him in a different coat to the jacket he usually wore, I always suspected there was something wrong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen him in the fustain jacket lately before? A. I am quite certain I saw him in it the night before this occurred; when I saw him he was generally in company with others.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined.Q. He seemed in company, was he talking to them? A. It was a narrow part of the pavement, where two could not walk abreast; they walked one after the other - he was the last of the four.</p>

            . I live at No. 31, George-yard, High-street, Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner about three months; he rents an apartment in my house - I saw him on Wednesday, the 29th of August, and on Tuesday night, the 28th - it was last Wednesday week; I saw him three times on Wednesday, about five o'clock in the evening - at about nine, a few minutes before or after, he went in with his pint of beer - he had on a brown coat, but the other part of his dress I cannot tell, but think it was light trousers; this was at nine o'clock or a few minutes after - he slept there on Wednesday night, the 29th of August, I will take my solemn oath; he called me up stairs, and paid me 6s. 6d. about half an hour after he took the beer in - my wife was up in the room with me; that was between nine and ten o'clock - I saw him up stairs after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How late? A. Between nine and ten o'clock; the latest time I heard him was when I called up to ask if all the lodgers were in; I then fastened the door, and am thoroughly convinced no individual could get out without my knowledge that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten the door? A. I bolted it, and turned the handle right down to the plate; I found it so in the morning - I did not lock the door, but am thoroughly convinced the door was as I had left it; nobody could get in or out.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What are you? A. A wheelwright: a master - I sometimes employ one man and sometimes more; this man and his wife, and another couple, were my only lodgers that night.</p>

            , nor any person going by that name; I know nothing of any body going from my house to the prosecutor - I am married; my wife is outside - the couple, who lodged with me, are not here; I went to bed about half-past eleven, and shut the door up - I am sure it was never opened till I opened it; the prisoner slept in the top room - I sleep below; my head is underneath the staircase - I was not awake all night; we supped before we went to bed - I know it was Wednesday by my repairing a wheel for a gentleman, which I booked; I have seen the prisoner wear a fustain coatee or jacket with pockets, but he had not it on on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were not asked that question - how came you to know that it was material? A. I did not know it was material at all, only I was asked about the coat.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Why did you say, in answer to my question, that he had not got the fustain jacket on on Wednesday evening? A. Because I before told you he had a brown coat on, which is the truth, so help me God, the man had no other - I did not see the fustain jacket that night at all; I do not know Walton by name - (looking at him) I have seen that gentleman about my place, but not oftener about my place than in any other neighbourhood: I do not often change my lodgers while they keep peace and soberness in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife see the prisoner at five o'clock? A. I do not know - I was at work in the yard at a wheel: my wife was in the kitchen - the prisoner passed through the yard to go in: he had a fish or something with him: it was something moist in a handkerchief - he went up to his own apartment: I lost sight of him till nine o'clock when he passed me with the beer in his hand - I did not see him in the fustain jacket about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him change his dress in the course of the day? A. Not particularly change his dress - I never in my life saw him change his dress in the day, nor have I seen him with it changed; I never saw him with two dresses on in the course of one day - he did not, to my knowledge leave a fustain jacket in his lodging when he was taken; the Policeman must know that best, I went to the Magistrate's when he was taken, but was not called in; my wife went with me: Thompsons did not go - they had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were going to tell your story yourself - tell it your own way? A. My name is Williams; I reside in George-yard - I am a coach and cart wheelwright by trade; Mr. Palmer, of Bartholomew-close, is my landlord - I have lived in the house twenty years, about ten years on my own hands, and before that under my father's direction; the prisoner passed me in my own yard about five o'clock in the evening, as I was at work, and I saw him at the door again about nine, as I stood by an old coach-carriage - he went up stairs with his pint of beer, and about half an hour after, or it might be a few minutes before, he called me up, paid me 6s. 6d. for rent, and I saw no more of him that night, but when I shut my door that night, I called up to know if he was in, and Mr. Adams himself answered Yes; I bolted the door, and went to bed, and found the door so in the morning, when I got up, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning he passed me in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Just repeat that? The witness did so almost verbatim.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got your story very perfect indeed - how often have you said it over? A. Never before I came here; I never had any talk with my wife about it - we had muscles for supper that night, and bread and cheese for dinner; I had nothing but bread and cheese; I will not be sure what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell what you had next day? A. If I must tell you, I had no dinner; I had bread and cheese for supper; the prisoner would not have lived in my house if he had gone out and in at irregular hours - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060013"></xptr>went in and out at meal times; I took him to be a labouring man - I do not know where he worked he had lodged about three months with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did Louisa Adams sleep there that night? A. Yes; she was up in the room that night when I received the money.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIAMS. I am the wife of the last witness -I saw the prisoner last in the house on the 29th of last month, which was last Wednesday week; I saw him last about eleven o'clock in the evening, when I went up stairs to return a pair of seissors I horrowed of the young woman he lives with, and he was then in bed; I saw him there - that was the last time I saw him; my husband caled up to know if all was in before he fastened the door, and the prisoner answered Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your husband then do? A. He called my husband up stairs, to pay him 6s. 6d., which he owed him - my husband then came down, locked the door, and we went to bed; I saw the door locked.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How many lodgers had you? A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the woman who lived with the prisoner the sister of a man they call Bobby odd legs? A. I do not know; I do not know a man who is called by that name - I have heard the name, but not in my house; I do not know what has become of him - I am sure he never lodged with me; I have seen the prisoner in a fustain jacket - he wore it sometimes, not very often: he sometimes wore that and sometimes a brown coat - I do not think he wore the fustain jacket four or five times a week; I did not see it that Wednesday - I saw him about nine o'clock that evening, between nine and ten o'clock, going up stairs; I did not see him any more till I went up stairs - he had a coat on, and a pint of beer in his hand; he generally takes a pint up at supper time - I am confident this was Wednesday week, I know it very well - he generally slept at home: he slept at home every night as far as I know - we always call up to know if all are in; I cannot swear he slept at home every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have slept out sometimes? A. Sometimes the door is shut, and I do not see who comes down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not people go in and out late at night? A. When my door is shut the staircase is in the passage, and I do not open the door - people go in and out: our street door has got a bolt and a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person wished to go out, one could let the other out and bolt the door? A. Not when the door is all fastened; the passage door has a lock to it, and that locks the staircase in - the gate has a bolt to it; we take the key of the door inside the room where we live every night; we always call up to know if the lodgers are in; I will not swear that is the invariable practice - I do not know Thomas Ainsley; I never in my life heard the name, and never saw such a person at my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what had you for dinner that day? A. That day I and my husband had some rump tails for dinner - that was on Wednesday, and we both had the same for supper - we both dined off beef-steaks next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two comfortable dinners then on Wednesday and Thursday? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What had you on Tuesday? A. On Tuesday we did not have any thing; if I have not the money I do not have any thing. We were married at Whitechapel three years ago; I have had no talk with my husband about this story, nor he with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you went up stairs, when the money was paid to your husband? A. About eleven o'clock, I went up, and my husband went up after that, about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. What, when he received the money? A. Yes - the prisoner went in and out very regularly, like a lahouring man - I do not know where he worked; he was a labouring man, but I do not know what sort of labour he followed; he used to go out regularly at six o'clock in the morning, come home about nine to breakfast, and again at twelve and four - those were his regular hours.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON. I have known the prisoner since last February; he was constantly standing in Wentworth-street - I never saw him employed as a labourer; I have seen him for hours together in Wentworth-street, at two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>

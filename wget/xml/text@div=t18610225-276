                  </hi>. I am a commercial clerk, and brother to the prisoner—I had a sister, now deceased, named Eliza Fisher—her age was about thirty-five, as near as we can possibly ascertain—she was a single woman—she had four children; the eldest I think is about eleven, the youngest is between three and four—my sister resided with me in 1859—a gentleman paid me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for her and her child, during the time she was with me in Carlisle—the other three children were at Southampton at the time, taken care of by the gentleman—I left Carlisle in December,'59, or about that time—the prisoner was a private in the artillery at that time, and was attached to the corps as a tailor, and was allowed to reside in the town, with his wife and family—I think he has six children, I am not certain whether it is six or seven—they were all living with him at the time when I first took my sister to him—I brought her up to London in December, 1859, and left her at the York Hotel in the Waterloo-road—when my sister came to me in Carlisle, I had not seen her before for seven years—I understood she was in a very delicate state when she came, but nothing in the way of out of her mind—I found out afterwards that her mind was affected—her mind was affected very badly once or twice a month, but I did not know it till after she lived with me—it was brought to my knowledge by her actions during the first two or three days—when she arrived in town, I think her state of mind was rather worse if anything—I placed her in the care of one of the servants at the York Hotel, and then I went down to Woolwich to see my brother, with a view to his taking care of her—I told him I had brought my sister from Carlisle, I had written to him previous to this, and he had agreed to take her—I did not mention to him at that time, on what terms he was to keep her, I did afterwards—we met at the York Hotel—an arrangement was made, but what arrangement that was, I did not know till afterwards—we met the gentleman from Southampton—he resides at Southampton—his name is Mr. Little—he, my brother, and my brother's wife made the arrangement between them—I did not hear the arrangement, so that I do not know what it was; but I afterwards ascertained from my brother that he was to have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month for herself and two children—my sister after that went to the house of the prisoner—in the following year, 1860, I took the elder of the two children away, the one about eight years of age; the younger one was left—I did not</p>

               <p>then arrange as to the reduction of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was arranged by a letter between the prisoner and the gentleman—he received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per month after that—I visited my brother when I came from Carlisle—I was between three and four months away, after I brought my sister to him—the first occasion was between March and April, 1860—I did not see but what my sister was treated very well at that time—I think I came to London for good in April—I lived afterwards in the Commercial-road, Peckham, and live there now—I went down to Woolwich several times—I did not notice but what my sister was treated well—she was able to walk about at that time, and she seemed pretty middling—she was light-headed at that time, and used to do very foolish things at times—she did not appear to have judgment over herself at all times—she was very weak on her legs, and would fall and stumble about a great deal, and so she did at Carlisle—I do not know that she was paralytic, no more than what the medical man says—I went there on several occasions—I did not notice anything on the second occasion, nor yet on the third, but that my sister was treated very well by my brother's family, and all—I went to Woolwich frequently, but I never saw anything in regard to ill-treatment towards my sister—I thought she was not quite so cleanly as she ought to have been, and I spoke to her about whether she was treated well, and she said, "Oh yes, oh yes"—she was sensible at that time—I do not know what day of the month it was my sister died; it was in January last—I made my last visit to her about a week or ten days before Christmas—that would be about five or six weeks before her death.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 am the assistant relieving-officer of the parish of Woolwich—in December some application was made by the prisoner's wile, I believe, after which I went to the prisoner's house—I saw the deceased—that was on Sunday, the 16th December—she appeared to be wrapped in a dirty rug, lying on a bed which was straw—I saw some portion of straw from the edges of the bed or mattress—the room was offensive—I did not say much to her—I saw that she appeared to be in an imbecile state and was dirty—her form in the bed was more like that of an animal, with her knees up, and so on—that decided me at once as to her state—I saw the prisoner with reference to the poor woman going into the workhouse—I told him that I had an order for her admission into the house, but that as I perceived from the appearance of the place and from a remark made, there were means to pay, I said to the prisoner, in consequence of his having previously stated to me that he was willing to pay a small sum, "You told me you would pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and your brother, you said, would pay something?"—he said, "Yes, I have no objection to pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and my brother will be down to-day "—I said, "You and your brother will come down and see me in the after-noon; I will give you an order for her removal into the union at once"—the order did not depend on their payment—I had an unconditional order.</p>

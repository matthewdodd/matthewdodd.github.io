                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On Saturday evening, the 4th of Jan., I was in New Gravel-lane—I had just come out of my lodging, and went into the Barley Mow—it was nearly shutting up time, I suppose between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went home with Lynch to her room,</p>

               <p>where Morgan and his wife were—as soon as I got in they wanted some<lb></lb>thing to drink from me, and wanted me to stop there all night—I said I had no money on me, I had rather go home—my jacket, waistcoat, hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and knife were taken away from me by the two prisoners and Morgan's wife—I was not sober—I had been tasting, but I knew what I was doing—they took the things off me, and laid them on a chair—I turned round to pick them up, and they were gone—I asked where they were, and they would not give me any satisfactory answer—I did not see them actually taken, but Lynch told me where she had taken them to—they dragged me down stairs—the house was full of people, and I was afraid to stop—they got me outside the house—Lynch said she was going to get the things for me, but she turned round the corner, and ran away—they took no money from me.</p>

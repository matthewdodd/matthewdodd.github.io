               <p>Mr. Cowden was asked if it was true he gave them to her to pawn? - He said no, he did not, and he never promised to meet her behind the Pantheon.</p>

               <p>The Jury said, they should be glad to ask if he ever was guilty of leaving his wife; but the Court said it was an improper question, that they were not a court of inquisition.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of sugar do you think there might be, from the appearance of the bags? - A. About a ton and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Are Mr. Wade's premises open by night? - A. No; only they lived in those premises, and let them through.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you comply with his request to receive them upon Mr. Wade's premises? - A. I did; there were myself, and Flowers, and three others unknown to me.</p>

             was not there; I cannot say the day of the month, or of the week, it was about six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.What was Flowers doing with the other men? - A. I was intrusted with the key of the premises of Mr. Wade, and upon my putting the key to the door, it was opened for me; I then said to Flowers, what pretty works are going on here; he told me to hold my tongue; I told him I should not, as I thought it was very cruel for such proceedings to be going on and Mr. Wade to know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that was going on? - A. I saw, on entering the premises, several bags, I saw in one of the bags sugar; I said, I thought Mr. Wade was liable to be exchequered for the things being upon his premises; he told me there was no fear, he could cover it in half an hour; I unscrewed the first shutter of the window with an intention to take the shop-shutters down; he said, not to take them down; I told him I should, as I would not be hindered from my business by any person; on recollecting myself, I thought some person going by might recollect this sugar on the premises, it might be seized, and the expences fall upon Mr. Wade, and I did not take the shutters down till they had taken them to Coulthurst's, which is very nearly opposite; I saw some of the bags taken there, I cannot say that I saw them all taken to Coulthurst's.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe who received them at Coulthurst's house? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Coulthurst's house was open? - A. They went in at the front-door from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during any part of the transaction, happen to see Coulthurst himself? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the time you saw Coulthurst's door open, was it at a time when the shop was open for the fair conduct of the business? - A. No; it was about five o'clock in the morning, it was not quite day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember there being any thing to drink? - A. Yes; during the interval, Flowers said to Marshall, make another pot of grog, which Marshall did, and offered it to me; I said, no, I should not drink grog at five o'clock in the morning; Spicer was outside of the door, and it was given to him; Flowers, and some one, returned afterwards for their hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since this took place? - A. In September, six or seven months back.</p>
               <p>Q. I take for granted, as you had seen this transaction yourself, you immediately gave information to a Magistrate? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.How long was it before you went to the Magistrate? - A. Not till February.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know to whom it belongs? - To Mr. Duberley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by any marks? - No, I have no other reason than finding it in his possession, and his coming out of the cutting room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He said he never took any before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made him any promise or threats? - No, none of any kind, it was all voluntary.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he said that he had never taken any before, or that he had never taken any? - He said something of that sort.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wentworth. Has there not been some difference between you and the prisoner? - Never, it is all a malicious report.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a report? - I suppose it must be a report by your speaking of it; I never heard of it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss that cloth from? - I suppose it was missing from the board he cuts out on.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not hesitate to take it out when you told him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you pretend to say that that is Mr. Duberley's? - He did not go from the board where he was cutting out on without my keeping my eye on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About five or six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, on your oath, say that it was not between three and four o'clock? - Yes, I will, it was a little before six.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - It is valued at seven shillings, but it is intrinsically worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you suppose he was going? - Out at the street door, he was going the broad way for it.</p>
               <p>Q. However he made no hesitation to shew you what he had got? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever recollect refusing to let the prisoner have his beer? - I recollect that they used to have beer coming in at all times of the day, and it impeded the business very much continually, and I spoke to Mr. Duberley about it, and he said that they should have it brought in at stated hours of the day, but as to this prisoner at the bar, I never spoke particularly to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you miss any cloth at all from the warehouse? - It is impossible to miss a piece of cloth like this in our warehouse, there is such a quantity there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an Army Clothier, the prisoner was employed by me as a cutter. Among the thousand yards of cloth we have it is almost impossible to identify any, but this particular piece of cloth I can. In consequence of the scarcity of cloth, I had this cloth dyed in town; and it is seldom that I look at a piece of cloth or see it, but this piece coming from the Dyer's not so good in point of colour as we had used to have it, it made me examine the cloth very minutely, this was about two or three days before it was taken, I observed the fag end of the piece particularly torn in this manner, and another circumstance in the dye of the cloth itself, on a minute inspection, it will be found full of little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300013"></xptr>black dots, which is almost imperceptible unless closely looked into, which induced me to dye no more in town.</p>
               <p>Jury Is it customary for to give a piece of cloth to cut so many garments? - No</p>
               <p>Q. How are they employed as cutters? - They cut all by patterns which they have of a person who superintends that branch of the business, and the prisoner was the only man that was cutting this species of cloth, at that time as this was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth. I believe usually you do not give the cutters a whole piece of cloth to cut from? - I deliver nothing myself, there is hardly any thing delivered but a whole piece, except by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is possible that this man might have part of a piece given him to cut out from? - On the contrary, because I can swear to its being a whole piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that piece of cloth was delivered to the cutter? - It was, because I see him cutting the cloth, going in by accident at the time, and seeing the cloth, not liking it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other Army Clothiers in town, and there may be the same cloth? Is it not possible to find cloth of the same kind and dye in other parts of the town? - Yes, it is possible, but not with these marks upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. He worked with you for four years during the American War, I believe? - He worked some time, I cannot say how long.</p>

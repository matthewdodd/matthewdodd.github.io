               <p>about 7 o'clock, and asked fhor four dozen of postage stamps—I supplied him—he gave me a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, into my hand, and left the shop immediately—I looked at the money instantly, and saw the half crown was bad—the prisoner left the office before I could look at it—I was able to shout after him—he had only come to the threshold of the door at first—he was outside before I had time to articulate—I did shout after him—I sent Pitman, who was in the shop, after him—he was brought back in a few minutes—I then threw down the half-crown which I had bent double in a tryer, and said, "See what you have given me"—he threw down another and then took up the first—on seeing me put the second in the tryer, he sai "Is that a bad one?" I said, "Yes," and I saw him put the first one in his mouth—at that time Mr. Moody, who keeps the shop, had come forward—I had sent for him—he asked the prisoner his name and address—the prisoner did not answer—he tried to speak, but could not for the half-crown in his mouth<lb></lb>the constable was sent for, and I heard Mr. Moody tell the constable this the prisoner had got a half-crown in his mouth—the constable caught the prisoner by the throat—the half-crown did not come out—I noticed the pri<lb></lb>soner bend his head back, make quite a curve of his back, and swallow it he then said to the constable, "What a fine set of teeth you have got"—that was all he said</p>

I am a porter in the employment of Mr. Moody, of Exmonth-street—from what Mr. Denton said to me, I went after this prisoner—he was half way across the road—I went up to him and said, "You are wanted back"—he made no reply—I caught hold of him by the collar—he did not do anything, but came back with me—when he got to the shop he went up to the counter, put his hand in his pocket, and threw down a half-crown—I afterwards went and found a constable; he came, and the prisoner was given in custody.</p>

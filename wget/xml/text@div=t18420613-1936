                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Tothill-street. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of Saturday, the 11th of June, I was at the Brill public-house, Brewer's-street, Somers-town—I had a purse in my right-hand trowsers' pocket, containing 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in the same pocket, all in silver—I had some halfpence, a knife, and some tobacco in my waistcoat-pocket—I had had the knife twelve months—I should know it well—the prisoner asked me for something to drink—I gave her a drink out of my pot—we then went to the Bee-hive, and I gave her part of two pints—I went to a room in Middlesex-street with her—in going the said she had no light in the room—I gave her a halfpenny, and she bought a candle—I then went to a brothel with her in another street—I did not take off my clothes—I went to sleep—I was awoke by the woman of the house in about an hour, and found my right-band trowsers' pocket was turned out, and nothing in it—all was gone, and my knife, tobacco, and halfpence—I went back to Middlesex-street, where I had been before, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor—she appeared very tipsy—I staid there that night, and the next morning I saw her in the passage, and charged her with having robbed me—she said she had not—she then went into a privy in the back yard—she tried to shut the door, but I kept it open, and saw her take my purse from her left breast, unpin it, and take the silver out—I rushed in, and she put the silver down her back—I do not know what she did with the purse—she came into the room again, and staid some time, then went to the privy again—I followed, and saw her hand down the privy—she came out wiping her hand—she went to a coffee-shop—I kept her in sight till I got a policeman—he found my knife on her—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 152.) I was called in on Sunday morning, the 12th of June—I took the prisoner and another woman—the prisoner was searched by a woman, who gave me, in her presence, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other woman had the knife—she said the prisoner gave it her, with 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some tobacco—the prisoner said, "You ought to have had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—some copper money and tobacco was produced.</p>

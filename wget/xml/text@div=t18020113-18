I told him I had good grounds for it, and knew more of the business than perhaps he thought of; but, to avoid the painful business of a search, if he had any thing, he had better deliver it up; he said, he had not any; upon which my partner said, you know you have; and he said, what; my partner immediately said, three pieces of wire, which was apparently next kin to electricity to him; I then sent for an officer, and took him down to my dwelling-house, as being a less public place; he went with me to the dwelling-house, and the officer came and searched him; but, finding nothing, he began to be a little insolent; but, upon further search, it was found under his shirt, under the waisthand of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purpose for which that silver was intended? - A. For strainers for funnels that he had to make, and that which was found upon him was the pieces that were too long, and which he had cut off the three pieces that will be produced, and the pieces found upon him will make up the exact deficiency.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you leave it to your men to help themselves to silver? - A. If the foreman is not in the way, or myself and partner, they frequently help themselves from the skillets.</p>

            Did you weigh this yourself? - A. No, nobody weighed them; but silver of the same breadth, the same lenght, and the same thickness, weighs that weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself run this out to know that it was exactly the same? - A. I have got the very piece of silver here from which it was cut off; three such strips would weigh exactly three ounces fifteen pennyweights; it is a flat piece of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that you cut off exactly pieces of the same breadth? - A. It was the whole length of the silver, and we have the rings here that are turned up that he cut off that night; we take them, and divide them as we want them, and mark to that breadth along that silver, and it must come to that weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it measured in such a way that the strips must be of the same weight - how do you manage to cut them so exactly? - A. There is no difficulty in that; the silver, when it is produced, will shew how easy it is done.</p>

               <p>Q. How is it you ascertain that? - A. The silver is flatted to a gauge; we gauge the breadth and length.</p>

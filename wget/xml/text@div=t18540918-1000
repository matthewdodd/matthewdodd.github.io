                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Furnival's-place, Holborn; I am an envelope folder. Last Friday evening, 15th Sept., I was in Holborn, about half past 9 o'clock in the evening—I was on the right hand side, at the corner of Leather-lane—when I got to the corner, there came on a slight mizzling rain—I was walking along, and all at once the pri<lb></lb>soner caught hold of me in a very rude manner—it was rather an insulting manner—I thought he was tipsy—he was before me, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I caught hold of him by the collar of his coat, and I saw my handkerchief in his hand—it was a white handkerchief, and it contained 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one corner and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another corner—while I had hold of his collar, he passed the handkerchief over my shoulder to a woman in a red shawl—that handkerchief had before been in my pocket—I still held the prisoner by the collar, and called for help—I begged him to give me back my money for the sake of my widowed mother, and I would not have him locked up—he struggled very much, and gave me a severe blow on the left side of my face—a young woman who is here, Caroline Marchant, assisted me in holding the prisoner—when she took hold of the prisoner, he gave her blow too—he did not get from me at all till I gave him to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in King's Head—court, Holborn. Last Fri<lb></lb>day evening, at half past 9 o'clock, I was coming down the narrow part of Leather—lane, by the chocolate shop—I was coming towards Holborn with some cheese for my supper—I heard a female scream, and saw a man struggling with her—the woman cried for help, and when she saw me, she said, "O pray, mistress, assist me"—I asked her what was the matter; she said, "The man has robbed me"—she had hold of him by the collar of the coat—she screamed about her mother, what would her widowed mother do, he had taken her money—I said, "Don't make such a noise," and I took hold of the prisoner by the arm—he struck me in the mouth, which bled very much; and he scratched me on the hand, because I held him—I said, "You are no gentleman; if you are innocent you have no need to be frightened?"—he then had a cap on—I assisted in holding him till he was given to the policeman.</p>

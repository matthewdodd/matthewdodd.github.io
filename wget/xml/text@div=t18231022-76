            , Isleworth. I saw the prisoner at work in the shop, with another man, and asked which was Mr. Hood - he said he was. I said I had a parcel for him; he said</p>
               <p>"A parcel for me, where did it come from?" I said from London, and that it was in the cart - he followed me to the cart - I shewed it him; he said he knew nothing about it; a young man who stood by said</p>
               <p>"Why, it is directed to you, I should take it in" - he then told me to take it in, and paid the carriage.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN PRICHARD. I am an officer. In consequence of what Wilson said, I fetched the prisoner from the public-house, told him he had received a parcel the other day, containing stolen property - he denied all knowledge of it. I said it was useless denying it, there was a man who could prove the delivery; he said</p>
               <p>"Oh! them d - d jacks, they are in the shop," and appeared confused - he turned back as if to go away. I took him into the shop - he pointed to the jacks, and said,</p>
               <p>"These are what I received in the hamper," and shewed me the hamper.</p>

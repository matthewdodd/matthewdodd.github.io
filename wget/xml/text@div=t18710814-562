I am servant to Mrs. Watt, who keeps a dairy at 47, Lyle Street—on 27th July I served the prisoner with two eggs—she gave me a shilling—I took it to my mistress, said something to her, and then went out for a constable—I had seen the prisoner in the shop six weeks before, when she bought two eggs, and gave me a shilling, which was put on one side of the till in a separate part—it was found to be bad not many minutes after she left.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a dairy, at 47, Lyle Street—on a Saturday, about six weeks before the prisoner was taken, a woman came in, and asked for two eggs—I don't swear that the prisoner was the woman—she gave me a bad shilling—I gave her change, and put the shilling in a compartment by itself—the last witness came in while I was giving the change—I showed the shilling to her after the woman had gone, and she bent it—I put it in the till again, but afterwards gave it to the constable.</p>

            . I live at Kingsland. On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner - I asked him if he would stand any gin - he took me to the Acorn, and treated me with a glass - I then asked if he would have any - he said he did not care - I paid 2d. more, and we had a quartern - he afterwards got a cab to take me home in - I was rather in liquor - he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket and took out 10s. - I saw and felt his hand take it - I can swear that I had 14s. in my pocket - I gave charge of him when I got home - he took bitter oaths that he had only 10d. about him, but the officer found 7s. in his shoe, and 1s. 10d. in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. A. It happened to be your birth-day, did it not? A. No, I do not recollect saying it was my birth-day, but I had a little money, and said I would get drunk - I was in the Blue Anchor - I had part of a quartern of gin, and of a pot of half-and-half, then a quartern of rum, and then sixpenny worth of gin - I said, "I have never been drunk in my life, I will get drunk to-day as it is my birth-day" - I recollect it now - I then went to the Acorn again - I began to play at skittles - I lost two pots of beer - the prisoner played one game with me - he drank some - I then played for two pints more, and lost them - it was then half-past eleven or twelve o'clock - we then went to the Anchor, and had beef-steaks for dinner, and a pot of porter and some wine - I offered to bet sixpence that the prisoner did not get a floorer with the skittles - I did not pitch my money into his boots - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160052"></xptr>did not call the cab, Chapman did - I indicted Chapman, and the bill was thrown out - I cannot swear I was not at the Royal Oak - I do not recollect going to the Goldsmith's Arms, or to any public-house where they refused to let me have any more liquor - I could walk a little - two men took me by the arm and lifted me into the cab - I know who took my money - I paid 4s. 1 1/2d. in money, and 4s. 4d. I stuck up.</p>

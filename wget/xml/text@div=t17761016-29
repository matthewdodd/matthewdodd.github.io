               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner: Tinkler has been apprentice with me four years within a month or two.</p>
               <p>What has been his behaviour? - Excessive good; I have sent him out with bills, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160054"></xptr> allowed him to give receipts; and he has always brought my money truly; I never found any thing dishonest by him in my life; not only that, but the very night he absconded from me, he brought four shillings that he had received for me.</p>
               <p>Suppose he should be so happy as to regain his liberty, would you again employ him? - I certainly would.</p>
               <p>COURT. What do you mean by absconding from you? - He went away on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - I believe about a fortnight, when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did not he come near you afterwards? - No, I heard nothing of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>How old is he? - I believe about eighteen.</p>

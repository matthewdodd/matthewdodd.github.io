            . I am a groom in the service Mr. Elliott of Edgeware-road. On the 10th of September, I got up first, and left the prisoner in bed - I went away a few minutes before six o'clock - I came home at eight o'clock to breakfast - I had been in bed I suppose an hour and a half before the prisoner came- the drawers were safe then as far as I know.</p>

            . I saw my money safe on Tuesday night, when I came home; it was wrapped up in a handkerchief, in the corner of the drawer - I was up all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170085"></xptr>night with a sick horse, and the next day I went for a shilling to get my breakfast, and the money was all gone - I have never found my money or the handkerchief - the prisoner had not a shilling before; I had lent him 3s. on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His word ought not to be taken, he was tried in Worcestershire for stealing some straw and hay.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was not me, it was my man; I knew nothing of it till four bundles of straw were found in my loft; I was acquitted in a moment.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner in work? A. He used to work part of the week, and drink the rest; on the Sunday when I lent him the 3s. he said he had neither victuals nor money.</p>

             (police-constable D 145). I saw the prisoner at near eight o'clock that evening at the Yorkshire Stingo; I told him I wanted him for robbing his fellow-lodger of some money; he said he knew nothing about it; and nudged the other man who was with him, and who followed him closely - I saw the prisoner take some money out of his pocket, put it behind him, and make a motion; I said, "What are you going to do with that money, put it into your pocket" - I took him to the station-house, and found in his right-hand waistcoat pocket one 5s. piece, two half-crowns, and some other money.</p>

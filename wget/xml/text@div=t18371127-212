I engaged the prisoner to work for me, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the first three weeks, and then to advance his wages—he came to me on Monday the 13th, and on Tuesday evening I missed some tools—I turned him away, and found my gimlet in his pocket—I missed other tools—there was sand in the place he worked, and I found some iron bolts in the sand, and the other tools buried in different places about the premises—I had left them all in a bag in the factory—I afterwards found these pincers and chisels at a marine-store shop, kept by White.</p>

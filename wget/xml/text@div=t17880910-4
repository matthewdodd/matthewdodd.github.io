On the 15th of July my house was broke open; I went to bed about eleven, and was the last of my family that was up; I lock'd my geese and ducks up, and got up about five in the morning, and found the doors where my geese were, were broke open; my geese were kept adjoining to the house, under the same roof; I went round to that part of my house, but where he broke into the dwelling-house, is a passage that I made to go in case it rains where the tools are.</p>

               <p>So that you can get into one part of your dwelling-house into the place where the tools and ducks were taken from, without going out of doors? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the geese kept in the same place? - No, at the other end of the house.</p>
               <p>Were you obliged to go out of your house to get to the place where the geese were kept? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But not where the tools and the ducks are kept? - No; I observed the door broke open where the geese were kept, and found the blood and all the geese gone; I went to look for a tool, and I found them gone, and the passage door open that came into my house, the door was broke open where the tools are kept; the tools were chimney-cloths, sacks, scrapers, shovels, and brushes, and I missed a duck from the place where the tools were.</p>
               <p>Had you seen these things the night before? - I lock'd them all up my own self; I never found any of them at all.</p>
               <p>What makes you suspect the prisoner? - Because I saw him at Hampstead, and they were found upon him; I never knew the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>On the 16th in the morning, the prosecutor came to our office to apply for a warrant to search one Gough's house; we went there, and found nothing; the man said, you are very welcome to search my house; a boy who is here, that is servant to some of them, gave information; and Gough said to the boy, here has been a fine pice of work about some geese again; master, says the boy, there has been a fine piece of work at Johnson's room; me and two more officers went there, and found one goose.</p>
               <p>Was Johnson in the room? - No; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100008"></xptr>we took him at the bottom of the court; he lodged in a house in a little court, by a place they call the Wooden World; it is in Golden Lane; we found there a goose and these chimney-cloths, and these sacks.</p>
               <p>Did you shew the prisoner these things that you had found? - Not directly; but soon after I did; I went to Hampstead the next morning, to fetch the prosecutrix, and she came and swore to all these things.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any alarm in the night - A. About ten minutes before we found him in the room with the light I thought I heard somebody in the room; when I first thought I heard somebody in the room it might be a quarter past eleven. We both went to bed at the same time; there were nobody up in our premises; the house door was hasped but not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors are there to the house - A. Two. I hasped the doors myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the windows fastened - A. They were shut down; we do not fasten the windows at all. About a quarter past eleven I thought I heard somebody in the room, I got out of bed and looked and went into bed again and got half asleep; Davidson and I saw a glimmering light in the room, Davidson got out of bed and struck the man, I saw he had clothes on his arm, I got out of bed and got hold of his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner with a light, did you - A. Yes; he had got a black coat and waistcoat and this handkerchief, and one pair of stockings belonging to me; he had another handkerchief, two coats, a pair of stockings, and a waistcoat of Davidson's, and some handkerchiefs he had got in his pocket; I seized him by the collar and the watchman searched him; we got him down in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found in his pocket when you searched him - A. Three handkerchiefs; they are Davidson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. Yes; he was tried this time twelvemonth for robbing this same room.</p>
               <p>Q. No, no - had he worked about the premises - A. Yes; about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine to see how he got in - A. He had opened the doors and left them open. When I seized him we both fell down stairs, and then I observed both the doors open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do both of the doors lead into the yard - A. Yes:</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken into custody - A. Yes; I kept him till the watchman came, and Donaldson the officer; then I delivered him up to them.</p>

               <p>Q. So, that if the hasp had missed, if any body pushed, they might open them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By a hasp, I suppose, you mean a common latch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at your own clothes, the black coat and waistcoat, and pair of stockings - A. I know them to be mine, they were made for me, there are no marks to them; the handkerchief was in my coat pocket, that is marked.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the room were they taken - A. Just by the foot of the bed, upon a box; they were the clothes that I had worn the day before. I had taken them off about an hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two doors, were they both outward doors - A. One door leads into the accompting-house, the other is the landing to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is only one outward door, and the outer door was only upon the hasp - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shut-to, both - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in trouble, I came out, I had no where to go to; the two handkerchiefs I had on my arm, that is the only thing I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (to Hodgson.) You say he had upon his arm your coat, waistcoat, and stockings - A. Yes; he had got two of Davidson's handkerchiefs putting into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endeavour to get away - A. Yes. He got my two fingers into his mouth; he almost bit one off.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the clothes, when he and you fell down, fall down with you - A. Yes, about three yards down the stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the course of the night - A. Hodgson jumped out of bed about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I saw this man, he looked about, then he thought it was only the carriages going about; he got into bed again. I was afterwards alarmed by a light. I saw a man standing with a candle in his hand, he had both these coats, this waistcoat, and a pair of stockings, that I have in my hand, over his arm, and three handkerchiefs that I had taken off my neck. I saw him reach them, put his hand under his coat, and put them into his pocket. I just looked a moment, I stepped out of bed, he never saw me, his back was towards me. I took my fist and knocked him down, I fell into the other room, about three steps. I came back again, and Hodgson had hold of his collar; he fell down with him. I went to them, and shut this man and Hodgson in the staircase. I got outside.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got down you found the door open, did you not - A. Yes. I got down and shut them in. I gave the alarm, the watchman came up. I kept the door shut till two or three men came; we then took hold of him, brought him into the yard, then the watchman came; he was taken to Bow-street; he was never out of my sight until he came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the clothes that he had on his arm were your's - A. Yes; they were the clothes that I had worn the day before.</p>

               <p>- CALLIGAN. I am a watchman. When I came into Mr. Kendall's yard I took the prisoner into custody. I searched him, he resisted me; these handkerchiefs I took out of his pocket. I have had these handkerchiefs ever since; they were in his right hand coat pocket.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. (to Hodgson.) Were there any other bed in the room besides that you and Davidson were sleeping in - A. No, there was another bed in the room adjoining. One of the post-boys slept there, his name is

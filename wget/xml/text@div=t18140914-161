On the 8th of August, she was called up at four o'clock in the morning to wash; she answered and said, she was not going to wash. About six o'clock, a man called out and said there was a bundle at the back door that looked into the mews. The porter went out; he said he knew the apron that the blanket was tied up in. The blanket was found at the back door. The man that called out asked me if it belonged to my house.</p>

I asked the prisoner what she was going to do with it; she said she was going away that day, and she took it to pay her wages. This is the blanket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner had been in the house but ten days. I did not know she was going away. She had three shillings of me. That is my blanket; I will swear to it. She took it from the one pair room, from under the bed.</p>

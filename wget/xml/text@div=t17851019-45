             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Widegate-alley, on an information which was given to Bow-street, that there was coining in a house adjoining to the prisoner Scott's, and that the way of going into that house, was through the shop, through the kitchen, and to throw up the window, and go into the adjoining cellar at the yard door, and we should find the people at work; being lame I was not so nimble as I formerly have been, and the other officers went in first, I left the prisoner in custody, and went and searched, I saw the three prisoners, the two men were without clothes, the woman without a cloak or bonnet; there were dies fixed in the press, and a quantity of blanks: I was then curious to look at the woman, and I said then, and I say now, I was sorry to see any woman in that situation, I examined the woman, and I have not a doubt -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must stop you, you are the last man I should stop; but I should object the same if my Lord Mayor was a witness? - I have not a doubt, Sir, but you would object to my Lord Mayor: I am sure the woman had been handling of copper.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her hands? - I did indeed, and I repeated the words to her, good woman, I am sorry for you!</p>
               <p>Were her hands dirty? - They were.</p>
               <p>Court. Were her hands black as if she had been handling copper? - There is no doubt, it is certainly a fact, there was a mark where the blanks and things had been handled.</p>
               <p>Describe in what manner this business is done? - There were three people in the cellar, they were locked up, when those springs are in, and the press runs up to the screw, it comes to its purchase, and these springs raise it up again, therefore it must require more strength than if they were in the press; here are the two dies that were fixed in the press at the time, and a quantity of blanks: there is a hole sunk in the earth, in order that the press might not come over their head, therefore they are covered in the earth, that the fly of the press might have more effect.</p>
               <p>How many people are employed at this business of coining? - The only practice that has been proved in this Court, is three, one each end of the fly, and another to feed the press.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Johnson's Council. Do you know anything of the practice of coiners in making farthings, but by hearsay? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to swear that farthings are not sometimes made by coiners without the assistance of a third person? - It is impossible for me to swear that.</p>
               <p>How were the woman's hands, dirty? - Her left hand was dirty in the palm, and all the way up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember her shewing her hands to the Magistrate, and saying they were clean? - I do.</p>
               <p>And she said that, therefore, she could not be employed in coining? - She did.</p>
               <p>Then did you say to her, your hands were dirty, but you have wiped them on your apron? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had she any opportunity of washing her hands? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Pickering and Scott. My Lord, we are both guilty, we would not wish to give the Court any trouble, but the woman is innocent.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow My Lord, the plea varies from the record, but that is not all, it does not state by force and arms, there is a difference in the essential part of the record; the conviction set out in this plea, may be a conviction had at York.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The counter plea does not profess to state the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It says upon an indictment for that, &amp; c.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The counter plea has nothing to do with the jurisdiction in this record, it does not profess to set forth the whole record of this man's conviction, but states the fact, that the prisoner has had his clergy once.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. This is a novel prosecution, the general law of the kingdom most undoubtedly is that what is called the benefit of clergy, shall not be allowed to any man twice: in all cases of felony, excepting where it is expressly taken away by act of parliament, by the common law of the kingdom the benefit of clergy was allowed; the reason and origin of which began in times very different from the present, and when the church enjoyed very peculiar privileges as distinguished from the laity; the privilege in question, was in fact the benefit of clergy, for it was a privilege peculiar to those in holy orders; distinguished from others, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190080"></xptr> though the punishment of the law was death to men in general, yet they had the privilege of not suffering death, in those cases where another man would: in process of time the humanity of the government, and the liberal principles of the law, extended that privilege, by fiction and implication, to all those who could read, for that was considered as a sort of test, and the question whether the culprit was a clerk or not was extended to the enquiry, whether he could read or no; so much of the original of it was retained down to the very modern period; but women were not entitled to this very valuable privilege, for it could not be presumed that they could be clerks in holy orders, and therefore women were allowed to be executed: but by acts of parliament in more modern times, the benefit of clergy, which is and ought to be, if allowed at all, allowed without distinction, and without any reference to the cause of it, was allowed to all persons who committed simple felonies, and taken away from particular offences; and the law holds it shall not be taken away by any act of parliament, even where the law says he shall suffer death, unless the words are added without benefit of clergy; so that, as the law now stands, every man found guilty of any crime from which the benefit of clergy is not taken away, shall, upon praying it have it: but the law says, that though this indulgence shall be once allowed to a man that commits a lesser felony, he shall not be repeatedly intitled to it, and that he shall not be entitled to it a second time: the prisoner Scott has been convicted by your former verdict of an offence for which he is intitled of right to demand the benefit of his clergy, and he has so demanded it by praying the benefit of the statute, to which, say they, on the part of the crown, he is in a situation that does not entitle him so that privilege, for he has received that benefit once, therefore we object to its being allowed to him another time; and they have put into court a plea, which states, that he was tried for felony, and convicted, and prayed the benefit of the statute, which was allowed him, and they say that the said

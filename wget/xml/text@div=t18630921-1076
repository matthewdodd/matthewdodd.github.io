                  </hi>. I am one of the detectives of the City of London—I first received instructions with reference to the prisoner about the 10th or 11th May—I went over to his place in Southampton-street, Camberwell—I found the name of Toovey over the door; it appeared to have been recently painted up—on 12th June, armed with a warrant from the Commissioner of Bankruptcy—I went abroad—on Tuesday, 23rd June, at a town called Ehrenfeld, near Cologne, I saw the prisoner at a public-house—he had not so much whiskers then as he has now; they were just sprouting out—he was first spoken to by a German officer—I could not understand what he said to him—I told him I was an officer from London, and that I held a warrant for his apprehension for absconding from London and defrauding his creditors—he said, "Oh, nonsense, that can't be; I was coming over to<lb></lb>morrow to settle with them"—I raid, "That appears very curious to me, for you were at Gravesend on Sunday, the 21st—he said, "Oh, well, I was coming over to settle with them to-morrow"—he was then taken to the burgomaster's office, and there I searched him—I asked him whether he had any other property; he said "no"—I asked what he had done with the proceeds of the property he had brought from England—he said he had not got a shilling in the world—I asked him where he lived—he told me at No. 6, Cecil-street, Ehrenfeld, which was two or three streets off the public-house where I found him—on searching him I found twenty-three thalers and a silver watch, which I returned to his wife, because she had no money—I went to Cecil-street, where he directed me, and in a top room, which had been fitted up with boarding and shelves, I found eighteen rolls of cocoa-nutmatting, three pieces of Dutch carpet, and a quantity of other things—I have an inventory of them—it was made in my presence—I assisted in making it. (<hi rend="italic">This was read in part; it consisted of carpet, mats, hearth-rugs, railway-wrappers, opera and race glasses, coloured silk handkerchiefs, scarfs, and other goods</hi>) I received six bills of exchange from his wife at the same time—I gave them up to Mr. Gammon, the solicitor—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are four of them;</p>

I am a warehouseman in partnership with other persons, formerly at 42, Gutter-lane, now at 41, Gresham-street—the prisoner dealt me for goods in the present year—on 2d April, he bought silk scarfs and lustres, and on 17th and 19th April, to the amount of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he made a payment of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th April—he had goods subsequent to that payment—I have seen the eighteen dozen and nine scarfs, and other property, which Webb brought back from Cologne—those goods were sold by me to the prisoner in April—the value of those scarfe is more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did he begin to deal with yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. April was the first transaction, and the last was on the 19th; there were five transactions altogether, the first gross amount of which was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—he told me on one occasion that he was going to take the goods to the Leipsic fair—I should say that was about the middle of April; when he had the largest quantity of goods—I sold them <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him with a know<lb></lb>ledge that he was to take them to Leipsic fair—I have been there myself; I did not have a long conversation with him—I told him I had been there, and could not do any business—I did not say, "A man like you that can speak the language will do well there"—I speak the language myself—I did not say he would do well there, or that I should be glad to open an account with him—I found in conversation that he was dealing with Messrs.

               <p>us—it is a fact that other houses do buy from us, not Messrs. Wilson—I did not say if he had come to us before he could have saved a good deal of money—he might have done so; we should have sold to him at the same price we sold to the other houses—I think Leipsic fair takes place in the beginning of May and September—I said nothing about the amount of goods he ought to take from us; I said nothing about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I did not seen him after his return from Germany, nor did he tell me that trade was slack—I never saw him after the 17th April—I do not think he had inter<lb></lb>views with other persons in our establishment—he usually spoke to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in partnership with another gentle<lb></lb>man as a wholesale optician at 69; Hatton-garden, and have had four or five transactions with the prisoner mince November—I had transactions with him on 17th February and 13th March—on 17th February I sold him goods to the amount of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on 13th March 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have since seen a portion of those goods in the possession of Webb; one stereoscope, and twenty-two opera and race-glasses—they were of the value of more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in partnership with my brother in Pitt<lb></lb>street, Old Kend-road, as cocoa-nut manufacturers—I have left the concern; my brother has the books—our first transaction with the prisoner was about twelve mouths ago—we had several transactions with him between that date and 14th February—on 14th February I sold him five pieces of cocoa-nut matting, to the value of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in April I sold him mats and rolls of cocoa-nut matting to the value of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid for that in cash—an acceptance was then running, and about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was also owing—I have since seen part of the cocoa-nut matting in the hands of Webb—it was the same I had sold to the prisoner—some of the rolls had been cut open, others were in the original packages—the value of the matting I saw was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of that matting had not been paid for—I also saw two or three mats—I could not speak to them—the last date at which I sold mats to the prisoner was in April; those he paid for.</p>

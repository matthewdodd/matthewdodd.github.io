            . Was your Pocket picked at any Time?</p>
               <p>Mason. On the 10th of March I was coming through Long-Acre; I had my Watch in my Waistcoat Pocket; I was coming from <placeName id="t17470429-29-crimeloc120">Temple-Bar</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you catch her Hand in your Pocket ?</p>
               <p>Mason. Yes, I pulled her Hand out, and another Person came and took the Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Conversation with her? Did you not speak to her at all before?</p>
               <p>Mason. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your Watch again?</p>
               <p>Mason. No, Sir; as soon as she was taken to the Watch-house, I told her I would give her a Guinea and a half if she would send for it, so she sent this Watchman to one

               <p>Q. Did he bring the Watch?</p>
               <p>Mason. No, he said he heard a great many Voices but none appeared. When I gave the Prisoner the three Half Guineas she put them into her Mouth.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Will you ask the Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are you not a wicked Man to say I robbed you of your Watch; you wanted to push me into an Alley to have Conversation with me, but I would not let you; I said I had been sick a long Time.</p>
               <p>Mason. When I was gone Home to fetch the Money , the Watchman asked her whether I was along with her, whether I drank with her, she said she never saw me till she took hold of the Watch. The Keeper of the Round-House said, Was he long with you; and she said , no.</p>

               <p>Mason. There was a Man made a Stroke at me under the Gate-way, and she took the Watch; there was another Woman by, and she took it out of her Hand.</p>

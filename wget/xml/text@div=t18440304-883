I saw the prisoner there—he remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I followed him—he went into the waiting-room—a lady and gentleman were looking through the window—I saw him put his hand against the lady's dress—he then put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and took out a hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I seized him, and told the gentleman to come with me, he had lost his handkerchief—he felt, and said he had—I took the prisoner—he resisteld very much—I found on him another handkerchief besides the one he took from the gentleman—I have not found the gentleman out, nor his name.</p>

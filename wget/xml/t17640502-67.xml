I had no suspicion of the prisoner, till after I had paid the reward. I had advertised ten guineas reward; and after that, twenty: then Richard Britton came and brought the pocket-book to me, by whom I learned the prisoner at the bar had taken it: and after that, the prisoner, upon being examined, owned to me how he got it. At first, he said he found it in a tub, in the stable; but at last he owned he took it out of my house. I know I had it on the 13th of February, at night.</p>

            . The prisoner brought the pocket book to me, on the 23d of February, and told me he had found his master's pocket-book, in the Malt-house-yard, and thought he had a right to the reward; he asked me to take it to his master? I said I would not: then he asked me if I had any friend that would? I said I had a brother: we carried it to him, and he went with me.</p>

               <p>J. Britton. I am a barber. We told him, we heard it was advertised 10 guineas reward, and if he would carry it, he should have all that was above half a guinea, and if not, he should have a guinea for his trouble.</p>

            . On the 10th of March Mr. Milward heard of his pocket-book; he being very ill in his room, sent for me, and said, he believed he had found the thief that stole his pocket-book, and sent for the prisoner up. He said he found it on the 14th of February, about seven at night, in the malting yard. I said, I believe you tell a story; you could not find it there, for your master was with me that night till eight o'clock; you had better tell the truth. Then he cry'd, and said to his master, I went into the parlour to brush your great coat, and, by brushing it, the book fell out of the pocket. I said, Why did you not put it where it was before? to which he made no answer.</p>

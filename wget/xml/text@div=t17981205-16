             sworn. - I live in Pye-street, almost facing the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him by coming to my house, I keep a little shop, he came for victuals, or such things as he wanted. On the 12th of October, about half past twelve, I saw him come out of a door with a bag upon his right shoulder, there were but two doors between that and the prosecutor's; I really thought he had got some fire-irons; he passed me and another young woman, and went towards Duck-lane, there was a saw I could see out of the bag, about thus far; the house he came out of adjoins the back yard of the prosecutor's: hearing the next morning that these people had been robbed, I told them they might see such a person at Duck-lane, but what house I did not know, because I did not follow him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MESSENGER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Queen-square, I was informed of the robbery, I went in search after the things; I was told the property was carried by the prisoner to his lodgings, in Duck-lane; I found the room where he lodged, but the prisoner was not there; we found the bag much as it is now, with the saw, saucepan, two hammers, and a double iron jack plane.</p>

            (To Longford). Are those your property? - A. Those are my property; this saw I have had a great many years, it is rivetted; I have had the plane by me a great many years; the saucepan I really believe is mine; these hammers are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I don't know any thing at all about the things; I never saw them before they were brought to Queen-square before me.</p>

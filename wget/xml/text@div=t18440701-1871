                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live in Wild-street, Drury-lane. On the 19th of June I slept in Smith's-court, at Emma Wilson's—she used to sleep with a man—I went to bed about six o'clock—I had been to sleep, and heard a knocking—I said, "Who is there?"—the prisoner was there, knocking and swearing—he was there two hours, and fetched Shay and Regan—he asked me three times to open the door, and I said I would not—he broke it down, and came in and laid on the bed—I was naked in bed—I attempted to scream, and he put his hand before my mouth—I said, "Will you give me my clothes?"—he said "No"—he said, "You insist on getting up?"—I said "Yes"—he laid outside the bed, and wanted me to lay in bed with him—he said if I would not, he would stick this knife into me—I in<lb></lb>sisted on going out, and he struck at me—I put up my band, and the knife stuck in my hand—he threw himself down at the foot of the bed, and said, "Now I am to be carried out a corpse to-night"—he was drunk—he wanted * * * and said, "I will have you or your life."</p>

I was awoke by a noise, and heard the prisoner swear<lb></lb>ing dreadfully, and rattling the girl's room door—he broke it open, and asked the prosecutrix several times to get him a light, and when she told him to go down, he said, he could not go down without a light—she said, "I shall not give you a light, there is no one wants you here"—I heard her scream some time after—I saw her hand at seven o'clock in the morning, and saw a cut between the two fore fingers.</p>

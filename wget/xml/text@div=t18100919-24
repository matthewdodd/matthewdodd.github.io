               <p>Q. Did you loose a watch at any time - A. Yes, on the 10th of August, between the hours of nine and ten, my husband's watch was taken from the mantle piece of the ground floor; it cost near four pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might you see it - A. I saw it twenty minutes before eight o'clock. I left the house in care of my mother, and when I came back, my mother informed me the watch was gone, and Mrs. Bull and no one else had been in the room. Mrs. Bull never came home that night; I enquired at the pawnbroker's, and could hear nothing of it. On the next day, I saw Mrs. Bull near the rising Sun, Spitalfields market; I took hold of her, and said, Mrs. Bull, deliver up my husband's watch; she said, she could not tell what I was talking of. I took her home, and then I desired her to give up the duplicate, she told me she had none; I then said, must I accuse you or my mother, as there was no one else in the place; she said, not your mother, your mother is innocent, I have stole it, and I have sold it, it is what I expected, it serves me right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. No, I was never able to find it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 10th of August - A. Yes; the prisoner came in about nine o'clock in the morning, she only staid a few minutes; I looked at the watch to see what it was a clock, the watch was there; I saw it at nine o'clock; a few minutes before ten I went to look what it was o'clock, I missed that watch; Mrs. Bull was gone then. On the 11th my daughter brought her home, and asked her for the duplicate; she said, she had no duplicate, she had stole it and sold it; I asked her where she had sold it; she would not tell it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She lives in the next room to me, and the boy that she lives with is a dust boy; he came down stairs as I did. On Thursday I went to Somerset House, to take my husband's half-pay; I came home on the Saturday, and about one hundred yards from my own door, I met Mrs. Evans, she said, give me my husband's watch; I told her, I did not know what she was talking about. I went up into my own room, and went to the cupboard for my husband's half-pay ticket, it was gone; she said, you have taken my husband's watch, I will keep your husband's half-pay ticket. Mrs. Evans said, make your husband's ticket over to me, and I will not hurt a hair of your head; I told her I would not make it over to any one, I had not pawned the watch nor sold it.</p>

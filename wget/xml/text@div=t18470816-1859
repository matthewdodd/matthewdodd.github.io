                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Rich, who keeps the Windsor Castle public-house, in Albany-street. The prisoner was in our service for nearly six months—on the 16th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, as she was at work in the kitchen, she complained of being very ill with the spasms—I gave her a little brandy-and-water, sent for the doctor, and told her to go and lie down on the bed till he came, as she was so ill—she went up stairs—I went up a little while afterwards, and saw her—she said she was better—I did not stop long in the room, I left immediately, and did not notice anything—I went up again in twenty minutes or half-an-hour, with the doctor—she was not undressed, but lying on the bed—I heard a strange noise when I went into the room, and asked her what it was—she said it was merely the water coming in outside the window—I cannot describe what noise it was—she told the doctor she was much better, he left, and sent her some medicine—she got up again that same evening, and did her work—on the following Friday I found what had been the matter, and accused her of having had a child—she said she had—I asked her if it was alive—she said, yes, it was alive, and the noise I had heard when I was in the room, was the child under the bed, and the hand-basin covered over it—I asked what she did with the child—she said she had given a man outside 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take it away and bury it—I told her I would not believe any such improbable story, for there was no man that would take charge of such a thing and bury it for the sake of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a policeman was sent for on the Saturday, but before he was sent for, I told her it was no use her persisting in that falsehood, for I did not believe it, that the child was either in one of her boxes, or in the water-closet, that we were going to have them both searched, therefore she had better tell me what she</p>

               <p>had done with it—she said the child was not in the house—I said if it was not in the house, it was certainly in the waster-closet—she said it was, that she had taken it down in the slop-pail on Saturday morning, and put it into the waster-closet, that she had taken the stick that we keep to close the shutters with, and <hi rend="italic">poked</hi> it down as low as she could in the water-closet—I asked her about the baby's clothes, she said she had none provided for it, that she was not aware she was in that way at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The water was coming in at the time mistress came up; if the child had been alive, which it was not, it would have been impossible for it to have made a noise like that; I am quite certain that it was not alive, for I never saw it; as it came from me in the chamber utensil, so it remained. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was water coming in at the window at the time, but that was not the sound I heard—it was not a child's cry, it was as if a person was making a noise in the throat—there were two utensils in the room—when I first went into the room the prisoner was sitting on one, and was being sick into the other—I did not notice them when I went into the room with the doctor—she had put it under the bed and covered it over with the hand-basin, but I did not notice it—it was her duty to empty those things—she was lying on the bed at the time I heard the noise, with the blanket and counter-pane thrown over her.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Little Albany-street, and work for Mrs. Rich. On Thursday, the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoner—she told me she was very much distressed in her mind—I said that nothing distressed me but poverty, and I was afraid when my little one was born that I should have nothing to put it in—she said, "I had plenty of things with my baby"—I said, "Have you had a baby, then?"—she said, yes, she had one—I said, "Was it alive?"—she said, "Yes, it was born alive"—I asked what she had done with it—she said she had sent it away—she afterwards told me that when her mistress came into the room with the doctor, it was making a noise, and her mistress asked her what it was, and she said it was the gurgling of the water that was coming into a water-closet close by her bed-room window—I cleaned out the prisoner's bed-room the same day, noticed a large make on the floor close by the bedside—it had been wiped up, and the carpet put over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not tell her the child was alive: I said it was not, and I said that had I been aware I was in that state I should have had plenty to put the child in, but I was not aware I was in that way. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did not say that she was not aware she was in that state.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Cooper, who was surgeon to the workhouse at Camden-town. The prisoner was brought there—I asked her if she had had a child—she said she had—I asked her if it was born alive—she said it was—I asked how she had disposed of it—she said she delivered herself in the chamber utensil, then put it under the bed, and covered it with the washhand basin, and next morning carried it down to the water-closet, and deposited it there—I asked whether she had prepared any clothes—she said she had not, that she did not know she was in the family way—I saw the body of the child—it had the umbilical cord and the after-birth attached to it—it was altogether—that would indicate a rapid birth—it might have taken place into the chamber utensil—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the child—I opened the chest, and found the lungs of a florid red colour, and on cutting into them I found that they contained blood and air, from which I infer that the child had breathed—I thought it was born at its full period—there were no marks of injury about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant.</hi>) I was sent for to Mrs. Rich's, and the prisoner was brought to me—she told me that she had given birth to a child on the 16th, and that on the following morning she took it down in the slop<lb></lb>pail, emptied it into the water-closet, and thrust it down among the soil—I found it there—I afterwards told the prisoner I had found it—she said, "Yes, I know I put it there"—I asked if she had any baby-linen—she said, "No"—I asked to search her box—she gave me the keys, and I found in it a bottle, labeled, "Laudanum, poison," and a certificate from St. Thomas' Hospital.</p>

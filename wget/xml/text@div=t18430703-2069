                  </hi>. I am an officer, and live in Houndsditch. On the 19th of June, about ten minutes to five o'clock, I was walking with a friend in Long-acre—I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in a purse, which I had seen safe three minutes before—I heard a noise behind me, looked round,</p>

               <p>and saw the prisoner in the grasp of a policeman—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I went up to them directly, and sung out I had lost my purse—the policeman produced it to me—I know it to be mine.</p>

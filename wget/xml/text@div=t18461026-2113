At half-past four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, on the 8th of Oct., I was standing at my front window—I saw Smith and Baker together—I saw them take a pan from Mrs. Tittensor's door—one of them put it on his head, and they went off together—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw them walking along Drury-lane—I pointed them out to Mrs. Tittensor.</p>

About a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 8th of Oct., I came to my shop door and missed a brown earthen pan, which was safe a few minutes before—Mrs. Pearson pointed out Smith and Baker coming down the street—I gave them in charge—I afterwards went to No. 12, Short's-gardens, and found Warner in a room there, and the pan was there—I pointed to a jug which hung up there, and said, "There is one of my jugs"—Warner said it was not—there were many other things that were mine, but Warner denied it.</p>

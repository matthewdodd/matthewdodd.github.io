                  </hi>. I live in Cumberland-row, Islington, and am a widow. The prisoner lodged with me—she said a friend of hen was a dyer, and she would take my shawl and get it re-dyed—I did not propose it to her, she did to me, and I let her have it on that representation, intend<lb></lb>ing to have it again.</p>

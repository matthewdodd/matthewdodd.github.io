                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Stepney. The prisoner was in my employ for two years and a half—it was his business to take out bread and receive money for it—and to deliver it over to me as soon as he came in and account for the money, and I booked it—he never accounted to me for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Ballard, and he never paid it me—nor 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Mannicon on Saturday the 12th of Sept.—I went round with him to the customers on the Monday following—before I went with him, he told me of some money he received from a Mr. Burk, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Mannicon on the Saturday before, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mrs. Ballard on the Wednesday before.</p>

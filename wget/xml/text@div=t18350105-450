I am a pork butcher, and live in Redcross-street On Tuesday, the 16th of December, the prisoner came to my shop a few minutes after two o'clock, for half a pound of Epping sausages, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down half-a-crown, and then said, "Stop, I will see, I think I have a shilling in my pocket"—he pulled out an old silk purse, and then said, "No, I have no shilling, you must give me change"—I gave him change, and soon afterwards I saw the half-crown was bad—I pursued, and saw him in Fore-street, walking fast, and just as he got to the corner of Whitecross-street, he ran away—I pursued and caught him just by the waggon office—I seized him, and charged him about the half-crown</p>

               <p>Cabino. I ask'd her who brought her up Stairs: She said a Gentleman gave her the Glass and a Handkerchief to bring down Stairs.</p>

            (to the Prisoner.) Will you ask this Witness any Questions ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was going thro' the Playhouse-Passage, and a Gentleman took my Handkerchief off my Neck, and ran up Stairs with it. This Gentlewoman keeps a disorderly House; when I went in after the Gentleman, and went up one or two Steps of the Stairs, this Gentlewoman took hold of me and said, are you coming to rob the House ?</p>

               <p>Q. Is this House near the Playhouse?</p>

               <p>Gurney. Please you, my Lord, there was a Gentleman standing at the Back Door, and he took hold of my Handkerchief; I had an old white Handkerchief: As I was pursuing the Gentleman, this Mrs. Howard took me into her Coffee-Room, and search'd me, but found nothing upon me. Her Maid came down Stairs about half an Hour after.</p>

               <p>One of the Gentlemen of the Jury said, the fixing up Sconces being a Branch of his Business, the Girl could not well have taken down the Sconce by herself. <rs id="t17460117-21-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

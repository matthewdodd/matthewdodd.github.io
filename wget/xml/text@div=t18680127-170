                  </hi>. I am barman at the George public-house, Brook Street, Holborn—on 17th December, about half-past six, Andrews came in for half a pint of porter, which came to a penny—the landlady served him—he tendered a florin, which she gave to me, saying, "I think this is a bad one, John"—I put it in the detector, found it was bad, and handed it back to my mistress, who asked Andrews where he got it; he said, "My mistress paid if to me"—she took away the beer and he walked out—I received the florin back, broke it in half, and afterwards gave the pieces to G 60—on 6th January both the prisoners came in together, I recognised Andrews immediately—Bray called for a pint of half-and-half, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a florin—I put in the detector, told him it was bad, and called my master, who asked Bray if he knew that it was bad; he said, "No"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "Andrews gave it to me, and I am to receive a shilling out of it"—Andrews said, "That is quite right"—I said to Andrews, "I can prove that you have been in previously, and tendered a bad florin"—he said, "I was never in the place before"—I gave them in charge with the second florin.</p>
               <p>

I wait in the bar of the Wellington tavern, Brook Street, Holborn—on 1st January the prisoners came in at five o'clock—Bray gave me a florin for a pint of porter—I tried it, gave it back to him, and told him it was bad—I bent it and then straightened it again—Andrews then paid me with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they drank the porter together.</p>

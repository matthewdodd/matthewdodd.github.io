                  </hi>. I am an officer in the army. On the 23rd of July, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came up to me, about one hundred yards on the other side of Temple-bar—she kept following me, and when she found she could not induce me to accompany her she pleaded poverty—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to induce her to leave me, but she still persisted in following me down Fleet-street till I got to Bell's-buildings, Salisbury-court, where I reside—I told her I did not wish her to be seen there, as I was a married man, and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get rid of her—I raised my hand to rap at the door, and the moment I did so she plunged her hand into my waistcoat pocket and extracted four sovereigns—I directly put my hand quickly down, which made her drop the four sove<lb></lb>reigns on the pavement—a scramble ensued between us—she succeeded in picking up two sovereigns, one of which she put into her mouth—I got the other two—she attempted to escape, and did run a few yards, but I caught her and gave her in charge to a policeman at the end of the court—I had had no communication with her whatever.</p>

On the night of the 23rd I was on duty in Salisbury-square, when the prosecutor came with the prisoner, and gave her in charge, stating that she had robbed him of two sovereigns—he appeared as if he had been drinking, but I could not swear he was drunk—on the way to the station-house the prisoner gave me a sovereign voluntarily, and in searching her at the station-house I found she had a sovereign in her mouth—to be positive I opened her mouth, and tried to take it from her, but she swallowed it—I saw the sovereign in her mouth.</p>

               <p>Did you take these handkerchiefs from her? - Yes, then we brought her back to the shop; I told my master who was in the back shop, he came, and as she came in, she took another parcel from under her cloak, and put it on the counter; then my master took her into the back shop, and I went to look for a constable; and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Are the handkerchiefs here? - I left them with a woman that keeps that door yesterday; and about ten o'clock last night two men came in my name, and she gave them to them.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave the handkerchiefs with any body? - I was just come out of the gallery, and I left them with her till I came back.</p>
               <p>What is the woman's name? - Mrs. Storey.</p>
               <p>Court. Before this woman comes, were this parcel of handkerchiefs which you took from under her cloak, any of those that were produced to the prisoner in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you are sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the other parcel which the prisoner laid down on the compter, a part of the handkerchiefs which had been produced to her in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many handkerchiefs did each parcel contain? - One contained twelve, and the other eight.</p>
               <p>You took care of these handkerchiefs I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And had them in your possession till what time? - Till last Saturday.</p>
               <p>What became of them then? - I left them at the Pitt's-head over the way.</p>
               <p>With whom? - With Mrs. Goldspring.</p>
               <p>Who is she? - The mistress of the house, till yesterday morning; yesterday I saw them again, that is, I brought them up in the gallery; I went but there in the afternoon about two, and I gave them to the door-keeper to keep till I came back.</p>
               <p>You have not got them again? - No.</p>
               <p>It is necessary to ask you whether you perceived the prisoner in the shop attempting to secret these handkerchiefs? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I think you said it was immediately after she was gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any other person in the shop? - No, nobody else.</p>

               <p>Are they in a great way of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many shopmen may they keep? - They keep another now, they only kept me then.</p>
               <p>Then I take it they frequently attend in the shop themselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Very industrious men in that respect? Yes.</p>
               <p>You have two shops, a back and front shop? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many of these gentlemen are there in the business? - Him and his brother; they are not partners, but they are constantly serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>This was the time of high business? - No, we had no customers in the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Then I take it as you had no other customer in the shop, your attention must be a good deal directed to this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw all she did, I take it? - I did not see her take them, nor offer to take them.</p>
               <p>What Magistrate did you attend before? - Justice Walker, in Hyde-street.</p>
               <p>Were you the only evidence before the Magistrate? - Nobody but me and my master, who came to swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Are you quite confident that you did not declare before the Magistrate that you saw the woman take these things? - Yes, I am quite confident I did not say so; I did not see her take them.</p>
               <p>You gave immediate information to Mr. Richard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you call out your master from the back shop at the same time? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is there any body here beside you and the constable? - My young master is.</p>
               <p>Your other master is taking care of the business at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go with your master to see this poor woman before the Justice, or in prison? - Yes, I went before Mr. Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>Your master felt a great deal of pity for her and her two children, one of four years of age, and the other at the breast? - My young master was very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>He did not wife to indict her capitally, I believe, if he could have helped it? - No.</p>

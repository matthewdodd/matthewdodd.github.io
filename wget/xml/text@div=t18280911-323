            . I am an officer. The prisoner came to the Police-office on the 11th of August, just before eight o'clock - he said he wanted to give himself up; I said, why - he said, "Go to Mr. Cleaver, and he will tell you," and in going along, he said, "I may as well he prosecuted first as at last;" when I got to Mr. Cleaver's house, Mr. Cleaver gave him in charge for taking a cheque and not returning - he said, he did go away about six weeks ago; I asked where he slept last, he said seventy miles off.</p>

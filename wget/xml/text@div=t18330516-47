            . I live at No. 25, City-terrace, City-road. On the 5th of May, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was a little way down <placeName id="t18330516-47-crimeloc245">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How long had you been with your friend? A.Sometime; we had been into the country and were returning - we were both quite sober - I did not see the man before I felt the snatch, it was so sudden; I cannot tell whether my friend observed it; I called out that I had lost my watch, and he pursued.</p>

            . I was a warehouseman to Mr. Hopkins, of Great Dover-road. At the time in question I was in Bishopsgate-street; I did not observe the prosecutor - my eyes were attracted towards where he was - I was going in the same direction as him, to the Flower Pot, and on the same side of the way - and I saw a man make a snatch at Mr. Oakley, which drew my attention, and in a moment Mr. Oakley sung out that he had lost his watch, and cried "Stop thief" - he made a bit of a run, and stopped as if he was lame; I did not see the prisoner's face - I saw a person run across the road towards the London Tavern; I ran directly, and he took a short turn, and I could not see through the corner of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160035"></xptr>Leadenhall-street, and I lost sight of him at the corner, only for a moment, as he turned into Leadenhall-street - I did not lose sight of him afterwards - a young man stopped him, but he broke from him, and the time-keeper at the Black Boy Tavern stopped him; it was more than one hundred yards from the corner of Leadenhall-street, I never lost sight of him after he turned the corner, except that when he was laid hold of, a mob gathered and followed him to the watch-house - the watch has never been found - to the best of my knowledge he is the man, but I did not observe his features; from the size of the body, and the height of the prisoner I should have no hesitation in saying he is the man - I did not go into the watch-house, but returned back to the prosecutor, who was holding another who he suspected to be concerned - I believe the prisoner to be the man who snatched the watch, but am not certain; the prosecutor saw him when he was brought to another watch-house in Cornhill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined Q. I believe two other persons were in custody on this charge? A. Yes, it was Sunday evening, there were a great many persons in the street; the same person who made the snatch ran across the road; I saw no watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Mr. Oakley walking arm in arm with his friend? A. I believe so; Mr. Oakley was outside and so was the man - I was about three yards from him; he turned and ran towards the London Tavern, the same way as I was going; he had turned back from the direction in which he was originally going; I consider he did that to get from the persons who had seen him do it - he crossed the road on the same side as the London Tavern, and turned on his heel, and directly turned again, and went down Leadenhall-street.</p>

            . I am a time-keeper to the Blackwall stages, and also a City officer. About ten minutes before ten o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief," proceeding from down Leadenhall-street; I saw some persons running down Leadenhall-street; I ran down, and turned round the coaches to meet him, and met the prisoner running at the head of the others - a young man who met him made a snatch at him, but he got from him; I instantly ran on him and secured him; he said, "I am not the man, I am running after the thief, you have got the wrong person" - Mr. Welch and several others came up and said,"Hold him;" I took him to Lime-street watch-house, and searched him; I found no watch on him, or any thing relating to the charge - having to dismiss the ten o'clock coach, I left him there; I was present when Mr. Oakley saw him at Cornhill watch-house; he could not identify him when I stopped him; Welch said, "Hold him, he has robbed a gentleman of his watch."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take any other persons? A. No, they were taken in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner said, I had got the wrong person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing at the Blackwall coaches, waiting for my brother-in-law to come up; I saw some person running, and some boys said that was the man, and Mr. Barker took me directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present at the time it was found - A. Yes. The handkerchief was round her neck; it is Cornelius Keefe's, he is my lodger.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How can you say you never let me out of nights when you send your own daughter out with me - A. I never sent you out in the streets.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS KEEFE. I am a painter and glazier, I lodge with Mrs. Davis. On the 3d of August last I lost a handkerchief, it was taken out of my trunk. My trunk was in the room where I slept.</p>

            . The prisoner was delivered in to my custody; I took the gown from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing how she came by the things - A. The same account that she gave you that her mistress consented to her wearing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this house of Mrs. Davis's - A. Yes; it was a bad house before she took it; the house was indicted; they were obliged to leave it about a week before Mrs. Davis took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl. I called there on the Monday between six and seven o'clock; Mr. Keefe is the man that wished me to stop till the return of Mrs. Davis; when she came in I enquired for the persons that were gone away; she said I have taken the house for the same description; she had paid thirty-five pounds for the good will; she said, as they have taken all the girls away, if I would stop with her I should have food, and plenty of raiment. On Tuesday I received company; on the following evening I was dressed and attired, and her daughter with me. On the Saturday I put on the daughter's gown in the evening I went out, it was not my esual hours to return home; Mrs. Davis followed me to the Turk's Head with her nephew; she asked for money; I said I cannot rob gentlemen for money; she said money she would have. She told the constable of the night that I had her things on, and she would bring the man forward; he would swear to the handkerchief. This man is no lodger, he is in the house to insult gentlemen if they lose their money or pocket books, that is his character.</p>

               <p>Did you enquire whether she had any house or shop in Paradise-street? - I did, but I could find no house or shop in that name, nor there was no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire of anybody that was likely to know, such as the parish officers? - No, I enquired of two poor inhabitants, then I asked this linen-draper, supposing him to be most acquainted; here is one of the inhabitants here.</p>
               <p>When was this woman taken up? - I accidentally met her myself the Saturday before the sessions before last, in Rosemary-lane, I knew her again perfectly well, it was about six weeks before that she had been at my shop.</p>
               <p>Did you stop her then? - I did, in the street; she begged I would not expose her; a few people began to collect in consequence of what I said; I took her into a house, and I began to ask her how she could, a woman of her appearance, deceive me in that manner; she said she was drawn to it by a bad husband, she had lived extremely well, but was plunged into distress by very unhappily placing her affections on a very bad man, who had left her with two children; she appeared very sorry and had never done the like before but to me, in consequence of what I had heard, I enquired about it, and had it been distress, I would have acted otherwise; I afterwards went for an officer, and had her committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lucas-street. On the 17th of October I had this property in my pocket, and got intoxicated—I have a slight re<lb></lb>collection of meeting the female prisoner and Turpin—I came to my senses about five o'clock the next morning, and missed this property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. I went into a coffee-shop, where I saw the prosecutor sitting in a box—he was not very tipsy—he seemed to have been asleep some time—the female prisoner sat next him—the felt his pockets, and then she got up and threw her arms over him to get at his left-hand pocket—she drew something out, and put her hand under the table, and Driscoll put his right arm towards her—I and my brother officer went up, pulled his arm from under the table, and found in his band this box and ink-bottle—we took them to the station, and on Turpin I found a handkerchief, penknife, and memorandum-book.</p>

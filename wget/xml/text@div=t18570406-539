                  </hi>. I am a widow; I manage a tobacco shop for Mr. Henry Augustus Bedwell, at Deptford Bridge—I have known the prisoner for two years; a relation of his lodged at one time in Mr. Bed<lb></lb>well's house, and part of the time the prisoner was there—he was very well acquainted with the premises—he was of times there alone—the old lady, his relation, had left for some time—on Sunday, 5th Oct., I went out about 11 o'clock in the morning; I locked the house up, and left no one in it—I am sure the back bedroom window was fastened—the street door was locked, and I had the key of the street door with me—I got home between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—I found my servant, Clara, waiting outside—she had tried to open the door, and could not get in—after I got in I found that the door was bolted inside—when I went out I had locked it; it could not have been bolted—I got Thomas Stannard, and I waited while he got over the fence at the back; he called out that all the back of the house was open—he opened the front door, and I got in, and found my bunch of keys on the mat—I had left them locked up in a drawer in my bedroom—I went in and found another key which had been in my bedroom—I had left the cash box on the counter, under some waste paper, when I went out; it had contained about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver; when I returned it had been moved, and was standing on a stool in the shop; it was open, and everything had been</p>

               <p>taken from it—there was a desk at the end of the counter with 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., worth of copper in it; that had been opened and robbed—I went up into the bedroom; the drawers were every one open, and the things turned out—before I went out, I had a gold watch hanging up over the drawers in my bedroom; I am quite sure I left it there when I went out; it had a white face—I found the back bedroom window open, and near the window, on the outside, were the steps that we used to clean the window; to my know<lb></lb>ledge they were not there when I went out; they were kept in the coal cellar in the garden—access to the house had been obtained by these means—the party could get in by getting up the steps—the money was Mr. Bedwell's, and the watch belonged to me; this is the watch, produced by Mr. Jeffreys; I know it, as I had kept it constantly in use.</p>

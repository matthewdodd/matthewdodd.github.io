                  </hi> I am seaman, and live at North Shields. On the 1st of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was at a public-house at Deptford, drinking with two other men—I saw the prisoner and some other women there—I do not know what public-house it was—I was sober, but had been drink<lb></lb>ing—I left the public-house with the prisoner and another girl, and the two men, and they went with me to get a lodging—I walked along by myself—we went to a house in Dock-street, Deptford—we got there about eleven o'clock—we all went in together—I had some beer there—I was sober after drinking that—I had six sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and two sixpences, in a purse in my jacket pocket—I slept in that house alone—the prisoner was in the room when I went to bed, nobody else—I laid my jacket on two chairs in the room—she was in the room then—I went to sleep—I was awoke about half an hour afterwards by the mistress of the house, she told me something, in con<lb></lb>sequence of which I felt in my jacket pocket, and missed my purse and money—I am quite sure it was in my jacket when I put it on the chair—this now produced is the purse which the money was in, it is mine—the prisoner was not in the room when I awoke—a witness showed me the purse—it had no money in it then.</p>

On the 2nd of July, about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Deptford, and saw some one running round the orchard as I was coming up King-street—I ran round to the other end of the orchard and met the prisoner—I knew her, and called her by name—she directly turned round as though some one had been assaulting her, made use of bad language, and said, "Now, Mr. Shelly, come and strike me again; I have assistance now; here is the police"—I judged from what she said, that somebody was after her, but saw nobody—I asked her the reason, and she told me it was Shelly and his woman—I said, "You shall not be assaulted, or anything of the sort"—I could see no one, and asked where they were—she said at a public-house where they had been drinking—as soon as I got into Dock-street, Deptford, the woman that keeps the house called after me to know if I had anybody in custody—I had the prisoner with me at the time—she could hear what the woman said—I said, "This is quite a different thing altogether"—I took her to the prosecutor, he directly said that was the girl; that he had been</p>

I returned from Canada at the end of 1846—after that I had some transactions on the turf—I had known the prisoner previous to June, 1849, by meeting him casually at race<lb></lb>courses—we occasionally had betting transactions together, not to any great extent, up to that time—in June, 1849, I lent him a small sum, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from that time until June, 1850, I lent him other sums of money, altoge<lb></lb>ther amounting to about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was money absolutely advanced to him—in Jan., 1850, he owed me about 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was money absolutely advanced—as far as my recollection serves me, I had an interview with him in Jan., 1850, at 2, Great Ryder-street, St. James's, where I was then lodging—I had not at that time pressed him for payment of the money that he owed me; I had asked him for it—at that interview he gave me the note produced—he had previously given me one of Mr. Gerard Sturt's for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as security for the sum I had previously advanced to him, and then he gave me this second one as further security for the money I had then advanced to him, together with the sum of 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave him at that time by check—he asked me to keep this note as security—he told me that ho had this document of Lord Clifden's, which was a perfectly good security, and which I believed to be so—he made those preliminary observations before he produced the note—he said if I would hold it until he repaid me, I should be conferring a great favour upon him—this check for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is dated Jan. 4—it was upon that day this took place—I gave him this check at the time, to make up the amount of 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think it was—that was all that took place at that inter<lb></lb>view with reference to Lord Clifden's note—subsequently to that I lent him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the check; it is dated 22nd Feb.—I had some transactions on the Derby of 1850, that was run in May—I betted a con<lb></lb>siderable sum for Coyle—I lost about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that race, over and above the amount which I became liable to for him—he was then indebted to me absolutely about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I only charged or credited him with 2,325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as far as my memory serves me—I paid that 2,325<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—I did not press him for payment of the money he owed me; but after the Derby, when I found I had lost such a considerable sum, I was of course anxious to get from him the money he owed me, to assist me in making my settlement, which was very heavy—knowing his losses were very heavy, I did not press him, but I asked him to help me with a certain portion of this money, which he promised to do on the Monday morning following—that would be the day before the settling, which was Tuesday, 4th June—he called at my chambers on Saturday, 1st June, about 12 o'clock, in a great state of excitement, as I imagined at that time, and alluded to his large debt</p>

               <p>dine with him there—I did not go to the Leger of 1850—I lost last year at the Derby 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not a defaulter—the money I lent Coyle was my own—I first took proceedings on this note at the police-court on 29th January—I applied to Mr. Bingham, the Magistrate, for a warrant—Coyle appeared before him—I did not appear on the first occasion—I was at Carshalton, and did not come back—Mr. Clarkson was my counsel—the case was withdrawn on the promise of Mr. Coyle to pay me the amount of money—I did not speak to Mr. Coyle—I did not hear Mr. Clarkson state, that in consequence of inquiries that had been made, there was reason to believe that Mr. Coyle had not a guilty knowledge at the time the bill was forged—to the best of my belief I was in the yard outside at the time; hut Mr. Clarkson made that statement in consequence of a letter I had received from Coyle—Mr. Emmett, of Bloomsbury-square, was at that time acting as my attorney—Mr. Lewis is conducting this prosecution, with the assistance of Mr. Em<lb></lb>mett—the case was brought on twice before Mr. Bingham—Coyle was there on each occasion—he appeared on bail—I went before the Grand Jury to prefer this indictment in July.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the interval between the Feb., when the case was over at the police-court, and your going before the Grand Jury, had you been indicted for obtaining a large sum of Mr. Kennedy, an officer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a mali<lb></lb>cious prosecution got up by Mr. Coyle, who is on the back of the bill, to stop these proceedings—it is a fact that I am indicted for obtaining 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Kennedy, by false pretences—I know Mr. Kennedy perfectly well, he is now in court—my brother, Captain Holder Alleyne, is also indicted—the indictment was found against us in May—it has not been tried; it was removed by <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> to the Queen's Bench, by mutual consent—the case did not come on for trial—my attorney withdrew the record in the absence of our evidence—I believe my recognizances have not been estreated—I swear that—I was taken upon a warrant after ray recognizances were estreated—the case now stands for trial—it is a malicious prosecution by Mr. Kennedy, unquestionably, as I was in America at the time the alleged offence was con<lb></lb>cocted—I did not receive 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money—I will swear that—I was in America when the bet was made which was the subject of the alleged offence—I know that my brother made a bet with him for 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon a trotting match, which I am happy to say he won—that is the subject of the indict<lb></lb>ment—Mr. Kennedy was a lieutenant in my regiment—I mean to say I did not receive one shilling of that money from my brother—my brother lent me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own money, but not of that money that I believe—he gave it me some short time after he had got the 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Kennedy—he never told me that it was part of that money—it was a present, and he lent me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—I was in England on 6th Jan. 1847—I had no account at Sir John Kirtland's—I had at Cocks and Co—Sir J.

I think—he was not visiting me, and dining with me, at Webb's Hotel, down to Jan. this year, when I preferred the charge against him—I met him at Webb's Hotel, in company with my brothers, on the day of one of my brothers' marriage, and I asked him about this money—I met him for that purpose—he said he would repay it as soon as he could—I did not dine with him—I may have had some refreshment with him, but I never dined with him, and I never saw him, except for the purpose of trying to induce him to pay me a portion of this money—I was not with him at Webb's Hotel ten or twelve times—I forget whether I went there in Jan.; but I never went there except to get him to make payment of this money—I do not recollect dining with him; I may have taken a chop—I had money of my own at the time I lost the money at the Derby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you no occupation at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have various things to look after, inventions and other things, which occupy my attention, inventions in machinery—what my means are is a private affair, I should say—I will let you have an estimate to-morrow of what my annual income is—I do not decline to tell the jury what my means are—I shall be very happy to tell the jury that I get my income from three sources—West India property, from some speculations which I have; a distillery, among other things; a new invention, which has recently come out, for making casts by machinery, which is very valuable; and also an allowance from my mother—this machinery for making casts is valued at a very large sum of money, and for which I paid 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is at work in Wenlock-road, City-basin; the distillery is in Horselydown, and the business is in Tower-street; it distills spirits; the firm is Montgomery, Rosenberg, and myself; I am a partner; that is my means of subsistence—I had seen Lord Clifden in the autumn of 1850, but never spoke to him—I had seen him at races frequently in 1850, and before and since—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my writing.</p>

               <p>proceedings he withdrew—I have no notion how Mr. Coyle got acquainted with Mr. Kennedy, or knew anything about this transaction in 1846; I believe it was through the instrumentality of D'Arey, who was an intimate friend of mine; they went before the Grand Jury, behind my back, without saying anything to me—an officer of the Guards was dining with me, when a clerk arrived to tell me I had been indicted, during the day, by Frank Coyle, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Moses Nathan—that remark about <hi rend="italic">fledglings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> was communicated in a message that was sent me; it was not my own observation—it was communicated to me by my intimate friend, who is a party with Mr. Kennedy and the prisoner in indicting me—I saw Coyle after June, 1850, at Webb's Hotel, in the presence of a brother of mine, the Rev. Joseph Low Alleyne, a clergyman, who is in court; that was in Sept., for the purpose of getting some of this money—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter, which induced me to forego the proceedings against Coyle—it is Coyle's writing—it was not altogether the reason of my foregoing the prosecution—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Feb. 14, 1851—To A. M. Alleyne, Esq. Sir,—I think it right, and more straightforward, as between gentlemen, who have been so connected as you and I, to address you direct, notwithstanding the intervention of professional men, to whom I mean no disrespect. I write to you, as the lawyers say, without prejudice; when I gave you the bill in question, I had no reason to doubt its genuineness; on the contrary, I had every reason to believe its perfect correctness; for it was in the market, and I believe had been some time before it was paid to me; I took it in the regular way of business, and I so parted with it; if you have been taken in, so have I; but, as far as I am concerned, any damage you may have sustained has been unintentional, I give you my honour—I am perfectly blameless in the affair, and I put it to you, as a gentleman, whether it is right further to pursue the steps you have thought proper to take, and which I am sure you would not have done, if you had asked for, and received my explanation"—I am quite satisfied that it was on 4th Jan. that I received this bill from Mr. Coyle; it is dated 31st Dec., four or five days before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an elder brother of Captain M'Geachey Alleyne—I know nothing of this transaction, except being present at one interview; the meeting with Mr. Coyle and Coglan, when my brother was present—Mr. Coyle called on my brother at Piccadilly—I was there, he asked my brother to meet him at a certain house, I think it was at Fur<lb></lb>nival's Inn—I went with him, and there was a friend of his, Mr. Charles Coglan, an Irishman, a well-known man—after some time Mr. Coyle left the room, and Mr. Coglan went after him—Mr. Coyle confessed that he had forged on my brother, that he had acted as a great villain to him, that he had written to his wife to inform her she would never see him again, that he intended to commit suicide, that he had committed this forgery in order to send his brother-in-law and his family out to Australia—he mentioned Lord Clifden as the gentleman whose name he had forged—he begged my brother to consider his wife, begged him not to take proceedings, and if he did not he would work all his life for him, and never forget him; that if he did not he should not live, but commit suicide—we said he could have no object to commit suicide, he had better go back and do all a man could do after com<lb></lb>mitting so gross a villainy—I was present when this promissory note for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given, and this memorandum.</p>

               <p>received the 7,000 and odd pounds something like a fortnight before the trotting-match was to have come off, which was in Jan. 1846; the money was paid because Mr. Kennedy considered he had made a very good bargain—I fancy it was in the latter part of Jan. I received it—I gave my brother Alexander 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and my brother, the clergyman, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have often given him since, when I have won large sums of money—my brother, the clergyman, is not on the turf I presume, I fancy my brother, M'Geachy, did sometimes bet for him, but very seldom—I now stand in the position of a gentleman at large.</p>

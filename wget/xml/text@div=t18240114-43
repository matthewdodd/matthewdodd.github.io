The prisoner Thompson was in my service - she came every morning to do needle work. She came on the 1st of November, about nine o'clock, and worked in the bed-room with me. I was called down stairs about eleven o'clock, and left her alone for about ten minutes; nobody else had been there in my absence. Between seven and eight o'clock, I missed a 5 l. Bank note, which I had seen in my drawer two days before; it was No. 4799. I had twenty of them, and the numbers ran regularly, and were all dated the 1st of September. Ratcliff, who is her mother, called for her about eight o'clock that night, but did not come up stairs - they went away together. When I missed it, I said, I should certainly endeavour to find it out; she said she knew nothing about it. She went to dinner at one o'clock, and returned at two. Mrs. Downey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140020"></xptr>and her servant had access to my room. The notes were folded in one parcel.</p>

On the 1st of November, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner Ratcliff bought two gold rings, and said they were for a young lady; they came to 13 s. - she gave me a 5 l. note. I gave her change - she was ten minutes in the shop; several people were there. I am positive of her being the person. I gave the note to Mr. Murray to get change; he gave me four sovereigns, and I gave her the silver from the till. I made no mark on it. I took no other 5 l. note on that day. Bellenger called that afternoon, and Mr. Murray gave him change for a 25 l. cheque; he gave him some notes and some sovereigns.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of December I went to the prisoner's house, in Albion-street, Commercial-road, and found them at home. I asked Thompson where her hoop and ring were - she said on the mantle-piece. I searched the house over, but did not find them. She then said, the hoop her mother gave her was pawned in the Commercial-road. I asked if it was the hoop and ring which had been bought with the 5 l. note, at Murray's - she said, No; it was one her mother had given her. I said I was come about the 5 l. note which was stolen - that it had been stopped at the Bank, and traced to Murray, and from the description he had given, her mother had paid it. Ratcliff said she did not know where Murray's was, nor East Smithfield - that she was never there, and would go with me; but when I asked her to go she refused, but at last went with me, and begged she might have a fair chance. I said no improper advantage should be taken; we went; I asked Hall if he knew Thompson - he said not. I then asked if he knew Ratcliff, and rather think he at first said he did not. I then began to speak to Mr. Murray, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you received a 5 l. Bank note, which has been stolen?" Hall immediately said</p>
               <p>"Yes; and that is the woman who paid it - I can swear to her." He had said, not a moment before, that he did not know her. Ratcliff said she was never in the shop - he persevered in saying it, was her; and when I came out, Ratcliff said I had not given her a fair chance. The hoop was brought to the office, and is her own.</p>

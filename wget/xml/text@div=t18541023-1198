                  </hi>.—I am a cheesemonger in Charlotte-terrace, New-out On Tuesday, 10th Oct. the prisoner came, between 5 and half past 5 o'clock for a quartern of butter; he gave me in payment a counterfeit shilling—I took it, and put it amongst the copper money, because I had some doubt about the prisoner having been there before—I gave him change and let him leave the shop—when he was gone, I looked at the shilling; I marked it, and put it in a piece of paper in my pocket—I saw the prisoner again on Thursday, the 11th, about seven o'clock in the evening—he asked first for a quartern of butter, and then he said half a quartern would do—he offered me another counterfeit shilling—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge—I gave the two shillings to the constable.</p>

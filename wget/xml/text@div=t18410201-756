On the 18th of January I was on duty in King-street Commercial-road—about half-past twelve o'clock at night I heard cries of "Murder," and went to No. 14, from which theory proceeded—I went in—the street door was opened by the prisoner's wife—she said, "Make baste in, or there will be murder done"—she ran out into the street—I saw the prisoner, who had got hold of Jones, pulling him down the stairs—he was holding him by the sleeve of his shirt, and his arm—Jones's forehead was bleeding—the prisoner was saying to him, "D—your eyes, I have got you now"—I parted them, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was given in charge by Jones, for inflicting a wound on his forehead—the prisoner had a tin candlestick in. his hand when I parted them—I did not take it from him then, but after I came back to take the prisoner away I took it from him—I took the wounded man to the hospital first—the prisoner was the worse for liquor, but not to say dead drunk—he ap<lb></lb>peared to know what he was about—after returning from the hospital I found the door of the prisoner's room fast—I asked him to open the door—he refused—I told him who I was—he would not open it, and I forced it open—he had a hammer in his hand, and held it up as if he would throw it at me—I seized him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in the same house with the prisoner. On the night of the 17th of January he came home, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, and made a noise with his feet by stamping on the floor in the passage leading to the street door, and swearing—Jones was in bed in the first-floor room where he lodges, and had been in bed about three quarters of an hour—he came down on hearing the noise, dressed in his trowsers and slippers—the prisoner was intoxicated—Jones said, "Now, Mr. Murphy, my good man, I think you had better go to bed, for I want my rest, I have got to get up in the morning early, and other people want to rest as well as me"—I heard the prisoner say, "You are a boy," or something to that effect (Jones is a young man) I did not I distinctly hear what else he said—there was a struggle—I did not see how it began—I was not down on the landing—I did not see any light at that time—I believe Jones opened the door, and called the police—I opened the window, and Jones put the prisoner outside the door—the police re<lb></lb>fused to take him into custody, and Jones shut the door, leaving the pri<lb></lb>soner outside—he knocked twice, and his wife let him in—Jones came up to me for a light, and went down with one in his hand, and there was another struggle in the passage—soon after there was quietness, and Jones came up stairs with his head bleeding—he said, "Young man, put up my hair, and bind up my head; I have hurt my head; I am cut; the villain has cut me," and he said he was afraid he should be a dead man—he bled a good deal—he had a wound about two and a half or three inches long over the head—I bound it up with a handkerchief—he wished to be taken to the hospital—I had noticed the policeman come in before Jones re<lb></lb>turned up stairs to me—the prisoner went into the kitchen—the policeman came up for a light, and I gave him one, and Jones left the house with the policeman to go to the hospital—I did not see whether the policeman had his lantern—I had some lucifers up stairs, with which I got a light and gave a candle to the policeman—I believe Jones afterwards brought up the candle—I gave it to the policeman on the first floor, in the next room to Jones—it was a small brass candlestick which Jones took down.</p>

               <p>room—I heard the prisoner running up my staircase—I ran out to prevent him coming any further—he was about four steps up the staircase—I came down with a candle in my hand—he caught me by the right arm, and bawled me down the landing—I was in my sleeves—the light went out, and he said, "D—your eyes, I have got you now"—I was always frightened of him—it is not the first time he has been up the stairs threatening to take a person's life—he afterwards dragged me down the kitchen staircase, which is about eight steps, and he had fast hold of me by the hair of my head, when the policeman came and took him away from me—he had no instrument in his hand—when I first went down he had a candlestick in his hand, and so had I—after he had hurled me down the stair-case I received a wound in the forehead.</p>

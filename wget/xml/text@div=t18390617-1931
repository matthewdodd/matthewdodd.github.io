                  </hi>. I keep a house, in Brighton-street, St. Pancras The prisoner and his wife lodged in the house—on the 31st of March they came home at half-past twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner wanted some beer—I said I could not get it—he said it was not twelve o'clock—I got my watch, and showed him that it was half-past twelve o'clock—I hung the watch inside the press-bedstead, and went and got a light—he then asked me to sit down with his wife while he went out to fetch the beer—he went away, and I missed my watch—I never saw him again till he was in gaol—I asked if he had parted with it—he said yes, but he did not know to whom.</p>

On the 12th of June the prisoner came to me respecting a coat that a man had let him have—I asked him his mame—he told me, "Mark Manchester"—I said I thought he was the man I had heard of—he said he would give himself up, as he was the man that had stolen the watch, that he had never since been home, and he was very uneasy—he gave me Mr. Bonham's direction, and I wrote to him.</p>

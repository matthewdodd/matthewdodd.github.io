                  </hi>. I am one of the street-keepers of Fleet-street. I have known Mr. Carlile's house many years—I have lately observed figures exhibited in the windows of his first floor—one represented a broker—this is a fair representation of the house as it is at present—one of the figures represents a Bishop—I am at a loss to say what the other represents—it is a black figure—that and the figure of a Bishop stand to<lb></lb>gether arm-in-arm—the other figure has a pitchfork in its hand, and horns on its head—I have been in the street on Sundays as well as other days—it is my duty to go round every morning—I have seen the same exhibition there—they were not taken down during Divine service, to my knowledge—I saw them up—I have seen them as I went to church, and in the midst of church time, when it is my duty to go round, I have seen them there as before—I have seen an unusual number of people collect on week days and Sundays, on both sides of the way—sometimes more and some<lb></lb>times less—sometimes twelve, or sixteen, or eighteen on each side, and sometimes, I should think, nearly forty on each side of the way at a time—several times persons have been compelled to go into the carriage-way, instead of going along the footpath—I have continued to observe this up to the present time—I was not able to attend on duty yesterday, but I saw it on Sunday week, and the number of persons, and the exhibition of the figures, were not the least altered.</p>

               <p>"To hoist these every day will be like shutting up my own shop, as well as my neighbours': I must have some consideration for both. I am thinking that one day in a week will be enough: perhaps Sunday will be the best day, as that will not injure business; and that is the day on which the Church is most thought of—the people, in passing by, will see how it is supported. I have no view but public good; certainly no desire to injure any one, but a passionate desire to do some good in the world, so as to leave it better than I found it. Out of respect for the business of my neighbours, I will, after this week, fix on Sundays as the best day on which to exhibit the props of the Church,—the spiritual broker and the temporal broker."</p>

               <p>"We hoisted them full length on Sunday, and made the Bishop preach on the present state of the Church to all passers by, from eight o'clock in the morning until six in the evening, while the temporal broker officiated as clerk and published other notices. I very much respect the institution of the Sabbath, and never call on my shopmen to open on that day; but one of them requested that he might be allowed to open, and did so. He retailed seven hundred copies of <hi rend="italic">A Scourge</hi> over the counter, beside many other things. Thinking of the matter, I could not but consider it as doing more good than is done by an open gin-shop on that day, par<lb></lb>ticularly as I, the master, (as Cobbett would say,) was preaching the revelation of the gospel in assistance of a sick minister of the true Church, both morning and evening.</p>
               <p>"They have been partially exhibited on every other day; but Sunday is to be the grand gala day of public appearance, when the bishop is to have clean boots and clean linen; while the temporal broker must be content to remain as he is, as not worth repair."</p>

I have seen the effigies up at Mr. Carlile's—this is a cor<lb></lb>rect representation of the exhibition in front of the house—there is a window with two figures in it—when I first observed it, it was the same, except that there is an additional figure now—this continues till the present time—I observed it this morning—the consequence of that exhibition has been, a continued assemblage of crowds on the pavement next Mr. Carliles, and on the opposite side as well, in considerable numbers—I have counted them—I should fairly state that, on one occasion, it happened to be Lord Mayor's day—yesterday I counted, on the opposite side of the way, upwards of fifty persons—if I was to say that is the average number of the crowd which have been there since the 21st of October, perhaps it would be more than was the case—there is a perpetual succession of people in the street—the numbers have been so great on the same side as the shop as to be, to me and my neighbours, a serious injury; at I have witnessed persons, passengers, coming from the west being obliged to turn off the pavement into the carriage road repeatedly—I and my neighbours have been incommoded to a considerable degree—I have not been able to keep my shop open as usual on all occasions—on some occasions I have not been able to keep it open—I do not mean to state I have closed altogether on account of the crowd, but partly, that part next to his house—I have had cases of some of my customers (ladies) approach<lb></lb>ing in a carriage, and fearful of coming out of the carriage lest they might be interrupted by the crowd.</p>

I am a coach-proprietor, and conduct the business of the Bolt-in-Tun—I noticed the figures exhibited at Mr. Carlile'g when they were first put up, and have continued my observation of them up to the present time—the effect has been the attracting a concourse of people on both sides of the street—I think usually there was more on the opposite side—there were placards on the wall as well—I read some of them—the crowd assembled caused the stoppage of the foot-passengers passing to and fro—I have frequently seen people obliged to go out into the carriage-way, there not being room on the foot pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Portugal Hotel, No. 155, Fleet-street, exactly opposite Mr. Carlile's door. Since the effigies have been exhibited the crowd has very much increased on my side for the way—persons used not to stop any long time together opposite my house before the exhibition—it has been so every day since—they have rendered my house inconvenient, by standing over my grating, so that my servants could not see to do their business in my kitchen below, and are obliged to burn can<lb></lb>dles—my customers have frequently complained of inconvenience—mine is more of a country hotel.</p>

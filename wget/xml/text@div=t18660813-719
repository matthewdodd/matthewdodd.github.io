                  </hi> (City Policeman 856). On the evening of the 30th July I was in High Street, Aldgate, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and a man not in custody walking side by side, with their hands in their pockets—in consequence of what I saw, I said to the prisoner, "I am a police constable, I shall charge you with attempting to pick pockets"—he said "What is your game?" and at the same time got hold of the black guard which was fastened to a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket—he took my watch and threw it to some one in the crowd—I seized him by the collar—a great many people of the lowest class came round, and after a very severe struggle he bent himself and threw me over his shoulder, and I came down on the top of my head—as I went over his shoulder my feet went through a shop window—I felt much pain for a fortnight afterwards—I got up, collared him again, and after another struggle, in which parties assisted me, I was thrown again—I felt that I could not get up any more, but twisted myself round the prisoner's legs, so that he could not move them—he struggled to get away, and pulled me up by my hair—some of the others joined with him, and completely pulled him away from me—he went twenty yards, and was then brought back to me by two plain clothes men who had come up—I went to the surgeon of the club—I felt sore for a fortnight—my watch was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was taken to the station—his left coat pocket had no bottom to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is not what you stated before the magistrate?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I said that his coat had pockets, but no bottoms to them—that is a mistake—it was only one pocket which had no bottom—the crowd did not assist me, and the shopkeepers would not allow me to take him into their shops—I did not hear the crowd call out "Shame!" or any words to that effect in my hearing—the policeman who came up witnessed the assault upon me, and sprang his rattle—when I said that I took him in custody I put my hand into his neck in the usual quiet way—he said, "If you do not let me go I will <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> you," and he did so—I had a walking stick about the thickness of my thumb—and after I found I was being over<lb></lb> powered I hit him as hard as I could—that was after I fell the first time—I did not hit him before he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me—we struggled on the ground ten or twelve minutes, and I said that I would never leave him.</p>

                  </hi> (City Policeman 921). On the 30th July, about seven in the evening, I was in Houndsditch and heard a female make a complaint to one of our sergeants—in consequence of that, I went towards Aldgate, and saw the prisoner and another man coming round the corner from Aldgate into Houndsditch—I watched them ten minutes, and saw Mitchell go up to the prisoner—he told him that he was a policeman and was going to take him in custody for attempting to pick pockets—I caught hold of one shoulder, and he said to Mitchell, "What is your little game?" and snatched his watch—I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand and the chain hanging down, but did not see him throw it away, as I was engaged with the man not in custody, who struck me in the chest, caught hold of my scarf, and I turned and saw Mitchell lying on his back—I pursued the other man, but he escaped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you with Mitchell the whole time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was thirty or forty yards from him at first, but we came up together, or nearly so—I did not assist my brother officer because I had hold of the other man—I did not see Mitchell strike him with a stick, being engaged with the other—there was a great crowd, but there was no one close to us—I heard the cry of "Shame!" at their abusing the policeman.</p>

I am single, and live at 132, Middlesex Hospital—on the 30th July, between seven and eight in the evening, I was in White<lb></lb>chapel—I saw Mitchell and the prisoner struggling—the prisoner took Mitchell's watch and threw it to another party—I picked up Mitchell's hat and gave it to him—the prisoner caught hold of the hat and struck me across the eyes two or three times—he then threw Mitchell over his shoulder, and knocked his feet through a pane of glass—I saw the other officer come up—they took him to the station and he said, "I have blinded many a better girl than you and <hi rend="italic">drounded</hi> many a better girl than you."</p>

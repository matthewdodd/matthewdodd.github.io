               <p>On the 7th of March I was returning from Pall-Mall, where I dined; I met Mrs. Wynham's servant, who informed me my house had been robbed by the prisoner at the bar, who had lived with me about four months as under footman; I had had a very good character of him from his former master, with whom he had lived some years; when I went home there was a deal of confusion; I missed my watch, which I had left hung up at the bed-head on that day; the prisoner was gone off; there were some tea-spoons missing; I suspected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220007"></xptr>the prisoner, and I went to the office, and the prisoner was apprehended at Ryegate the Thursday following; he was brought to my house by the constables, and he himself delivered me the watch, and the tea-spoons; I know the property.</p>
               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Wasey, me and the housemaid were in the kitchen, there was nobody in the house but us and the prisoner; and he took the candle, and went out of the kitchen, and locked and bolted us in; the housemaid got out at the window, and let me out at the kitchen; I called to the prisoner, and he not answering, I called murder and fire! and I heard the street-door open and shut; it was about nine o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of taking it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

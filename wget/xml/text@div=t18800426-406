                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England—from 1860 to 1866 I was curate of Caddockston, near Neath, and afterwards at Oakwood, an adjoining parish—when first at Caddockston I baptized a child of the prisoner's; I did not know him as a parishioner till then—he was an Excise officer stationed there, and appeared to be one of the most gentlemanly men in the parish—our intimacy was only parochial and ordinary—when I left he was still there—in 1867 I came to a Welsh living in London—I am now incumbent' of St. Benet's, Paul's Wharf—I am living at 324, City Road—I am married, and have two children—I next saw the prisoner about two years ago—he came to my house—he asked if I remembered him—I said "Yes"—he was very badly clad; his feet were through his shoes, and he was in a very dirty state, and pulling out his, shirt he cried bitterly and said, "I have not had a change for nine months"—I gave him a few shillings—he begged for some old clothes, and my wife got two new shirts for him, and I got him a pair of trousers and shoes and</p>

               <p>socks—after that he came very often, and I used to give him a shilling to have his dinner and send him off—he said that he was looking for work—on one occasion I lent him a sovereign to help him to carry out some patent for erasing ink—I asked him how it was he had lost his situation and was in such a plight, and he told me that he had committed a felony by taking Government money and had nine months—I still went on giving him money and befriending him after he told me that—he sent me a letter previous to the one in question, asking for money, which I pitched into the fire—I saw him one day in January in the City Road as I got out of a tram; he touched me on the shoulder and begged for assistance, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or half a crown, and he thanked me and said he would never forget my kindness, crying bitterly at the time—that was after the first letter, and before I received this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is his writing; it came by post (<hi rend="italic">This letter was a request for further assistance, with allusion to an alleged statement by the witness as to familiarity between himself and the wife of one of his former parishioners.</hi>) The prisoner often came to the door after I received that letter, but I was always out; I did not see him.</p>

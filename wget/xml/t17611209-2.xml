             in a tin kettle; she told me of it. I taxed the prisoner with taking them. She confessed she had taken them the 8th, being the Sunday, while I was at church in the morning. There was of it a piece of cheque, some ribbon, and silk lace, such as we make capuchins of. She was examined before Mr. Alderman Alexander on the 13th, and that night Mr. Turner brought me some things that he found in his house; six or eight yards of linen, one yard of muslin, a yard and half of diaper, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090003"></xptr> a pair of cotton stockings. She was searched on the 12th, and some things were found upon her, and some in her box in my house; there were twenty yards of silk stay lacing, half a dozen yards of ribbon. She acknowleged to have taken them out of my shop. I beg leave to recommend her to mercy; she is a young girl.</p>
               <p>Mr. Turner. I was before Mr. Alexander at the mansion-house when the prisoner was there. She had lived servant with me before; I brought her up from a child. She directed me to a lumber-room in my house. I went there, and upon, or rather behind, a parcel of chips, I found the things the prosecutrix has mentioned, tied up in a handkerchief. She used to come to my house at holiday time, or on Sunday. My wife brought her from the country. She bid me carry them to her mistress. She behaved well while with me. She is very young. If the court will order her corporal punishment, I will take care and send her into the country to her friends.</p>

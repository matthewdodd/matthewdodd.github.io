            . My daughter Mary is seven years of age - I live in Compton-street. I sent my daughter to Mr. Brooke's, in Grafton-street, for whom I work, to take a pair of shoes - this was three weeks ago last Tuesday, about ten minutes before four o'clock in the afternoon - she had a dark blue pelisse on, and a pinafore - she returned in about an hour, without basket, shoes, pelisse, or pinafore - I went with her next morning to the clothes shops, to see if I could get any intelligence of the things; as we were coming home, she pulled me by the shawl, and said, "There is the young woman who took my things;" I took hold of the prisoner by the shawl, and said, "You stripped my child last night" - she said, "Let me go into your house" - and then she said if I would go up stairs, she would tell me - she then said she had pawned the shoes at Lambeth, and pulled the ticket out of her pocket; I cannot read, and I got my next door neighbour, Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160051"></xptr>>Sutton, to read it - I heard her read the direction, which was in Paradise-row, Lambeth, but I forget the name - I gave the direction to the officer, but the ticket was lost; I saw the shoes at Mary-le-bone office, and know they were those I had given my daughter to carry - these are the shoes.</p>
               <p>MARY THOMAS. I am seven years of age. I know my duty to God and my neighbour. I was going with the shoes, and saw the prisoner, who asked me to lay hold of her arm, which I did - and she took me down Howland-street - she then asked me to let her take off my pelisse; she then went down to <placeName id="t18260216-73-crimeloc378">Charlotte-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. When was this - A. On last Friday morning, about half after three.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you and your family gone to bed A little before twelve; the house was quite clear then of company.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last up - A.Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your doors and windows secured at that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a door is there to your cellar - A. The outer door there is a flap that lifts up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this night when had you examined that flap - A. On the Monday previous. This was on the Friday. On the Monday before I had beer in; it was opened for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this flap used to be opened excepting for taking beer in - A. No otherwise taking beer in, and letting butts out.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this cellar door secured within - A. Within it is secured by a perpendicular door that it rests upon; we were forced to have a square hole made in the bar, otherwise the hole would not be large enough to let a butt up, and the back of the cellar flap is secured by this perpendicular flap, and the perpendicular flap is secured by the window within the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether on the Monday that the beer had been taken in that this flap was secured - A. I fastened it myself in the usual way, and had no occasion to use it afterwards. The other end of the flap next to the street is fastened by means of iron dogs that goes into the oak frame round the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to examine your cellar from the Monday till the time this happened - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this an old flap or a new one - A. The flap and framing are both new, they had not been made above a fortnight; it was very substantial and firm.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the persons that gave you the alarm on the Friday morning - A. Horn, the inspector of the watch, and Lockwood the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you came down upon receiving the alarm - A. The watchman having no rattle I sprang mine out of the window before I came down. Then I came down and let Horn and Lockwood into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them into your cellar - A. Yes. There is a door in the house that goes down into the cellar, I looked at it, it was as I left it. When I went into the cellar with Horn and Lockwood; I saw a man standing between the cellar stairs and the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time perceive any thing else - A. I perceived a tinder box and candle, the watchman shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them pick it up - A. No, he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon the cellar flap - A. Not until after the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse, that was three quarters of an hour afterwards. The watchman shewed me a file, the end of it was broken off; I looked to see if I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300006"></xptr>see the end of the file sticking in the flap; the flap was wrenched up and one of the dogs off, and the other nearly so; I likewise found the end of the file, I have it in my hand now, it was sticking between the oak frame and the flap. The iron dog the watchman had previously found; Horn and myself tried the dog on where one was missing, it fitted the place exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when one dog was totally removed, and the other nearly so, was there large space enough for a person to get through there - A. When the dog was removed, and the flap only rested upon the curb, it might easily be removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far inside from the ground is your cellar door - A. Near nine feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see found any thing more in your cellar - A. When we returned I found a remainder part of the tinder box. We found part of a tinder box before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it - A. Behind one of the butts.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of a tinder box was there any tinder in it - A. Some small portion, flint, steel, and matches. At the watchhouse I saw two keys found on the prisoner, one a street door key, and the other a smaller one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I think I have seen his face in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean in drinking in your house - A. Yes. or coming to the bar more properly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the dog was wrenched off the flap would rest upon the curb it would not stand wide open - A. No, it would rest upon the curb; I asked the prisoner how he came there, he told me he fell through he was going to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. But the flap was down when you found him - A. Yes, it laid even over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon the alarm you did not examine the outside of the cellar flap - A. I did not examine it particularly, I saw it had been wrenched up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he asked me how I came there I told him I came by about half after three, finding the cellar flap open I went through to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he fell through, and that he was going to sleep there.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch there. Early on the morning of the 25th I was standing in the watchhouse, about twenty yards from Mr. Gillbank's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watchhouse door open or shut - A. The top part of the hatch was a jarr. The watch-house is in Goswell-street, It was about half past three, I heard a noise as if somebody had slipped down, as if they had fallen down in the street, and the sound of wood of something, it appeared at Mr. Gillbank's house; upon nearing this I got up and pulled the hatch of the watchhouse open. I perceived two men standing at Mr. Gillbank's door; I thought by their standing there they were after some lead over the bar window; I opened the lower hatch and walked out; as soon as they perceived me the two men ran down Old street, both of them; I then walked towards Mr. Gillbank's door, and perceived a light under the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. The flap was down - A.Not quite close.</p>
               <p>Q. From what aperture did you perceive the light - A.Through a small space in the front of the flap towards the street, I lifted up the flap a little higher and observed the hand of a person, and a lighted candle.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe any thing more than the hand of the person - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was the hand - A. Just under that past going into the bar. I could see nothing of him but the hand, and a piece of candle in the hand without a candlestick; upon perceiving this I immediately shut down the flap and found this file laying close at the front of the flap on the outside one, and appeared to have been broken. I immediately stood upon the flap to keep it down. I then alarmed Mr. Gillbank by hitting the handle of my cutlass against the boards at the window. I called watch; he was stationed about forty yards from there, that was Lockwood. He came, and the landlord came down, he opened the window first and asked what was the matter; I told; he came down, me and Lockwood went down into the cellar through the house passage.</p>
               <p>Q. That cellar door was fastened was it not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the cellar was there any light there but what you brought with you - A.None. I had a candle, the watchman had nothing. I observed a man standing in the cellar, facing the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. The prisoner at the bar. We took him in custody; I told Lockwood to keep him secure while. I searched about the cellar to see if there was any more persons there; I looked round the cellar, there was nobody else there in the cellar. I found the top of this tinder box underneath the flap in the cellar, and this piece of candle; the candle was out, but the wick was warm; I found this iron dog on the ground, under the cellar flap. I found nothing else at that time, the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse, and in about three quarters of an hour we returned to the house; Mr. Gillbank and I went into the cellar together, we there found this tinder box, flint, steel, and matches. The top that I found before exactly corresponded with it. They were found in a corner under the cellar window, between a butt and the wall. Mr. Gillbank and I tried this dog to the place where it was wrenched off, it fitted the marks exactly. The other dog was nearly wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any account the prisoner gave how he came there - A. When he was at the watchhouse he said he had fallen into the cellar, and was going to sleep there. I saw the officer take these two keys out of his pocket, one a large key, and the other a smaller one.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you pick up the tinder box - A. Mr. Gillbank and I were both together when we found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the observation that you made how did it appear to you that the cellar window had been opened - A. It appeared to me that it had been wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no light in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Witness. I perfectly saw the light from the outside, but when I went down there was no light; this piece of candle I picked up, she wick was warm.</p>

            , and the cellar window was a little open, I did not observe any light in the cellar, I had my lanthorn with me. I heard a voice say, open the flap that he might come out to us. I told him I would not let him come out. I would go down as soon as the door was opened, Mr. Gillbank came down and opened the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went with Mr. Gillbank and Mr. Horn into the cellar - A. Yes. There was no light in the cellar but what I brought. I saw the prisoner at the bar standing there with his back to the wall, nearly opposite to the flap. I asked him how he came there, he told me he was going by there about half past two o'clock, and he tumbled into it, and having no lodging to go home to he pulled down the flap of the cellar, and meant to go to sleep there. I immediately took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him into the watchhouse did you see any thing picked up - A. Yes, the top of the tinder box, and I saw the dog picked up; when I came back I saw the candle picked up and the tinder box. Mr. Horn shewed me a file; I did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gillbank. You produced what you supposed to be the end of a file - A.Yes, here it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Try it with that file - A. It fits exactly. I found the end of the file sticking between the flap and the curb. (The file and the end of the file handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by about half past two in the morning, I thought it rather an unreasonable hour to go home; I saw the cellar flap of one side. I went down into the cellar and

             the flap over me; I fell asleep then; I kept there till about half past three I was alarmed by the watchman.</p>

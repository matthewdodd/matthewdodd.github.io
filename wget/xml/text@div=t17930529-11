On Friday the 17th of May the prisoner, between eleven and twelve, he was in the passage leading from the area opposite the servants hall, in Mr. Francis's house; he saw me in the servants hall and asked if it was the dutchess of Gordon's? I told him it was not, I told him it was the last house but one in the corner, a white fronted house; I went up the steps then and watched him, and I saw him go first to Mr. Barlow's, the house before the dutchess of Gordon's, he went down and was down there about the three fourth of a minute, he came up and past the dutchess of Gordon's and went into Lord Donnegall's, and went down that area, he did not go to the dutchess of Gordon's; when he came near Mr. Francis's house; I went from the steps to the stair case window, two pair of stairs, but when I got there I lost sight of him, from whence I concluded that he must have gone down some area; I waited there about two or three minutes, and then I see him come up from Mr. Hanson's area with something wrapped in a coat, which coat he had on when he was in our area, the same coat he has on now; I immediately came down from the window and went to the street door, and by that time he was a few yards distant from the door; I and

               <p>Q. Had you lost sight all this time after that you came to the door? - Never. We took him to Mr. Hanson's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290024"></xptr>and there the coat was opened and the drawing taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jenkins the witness there? - Yes, he was sent for when we got to Mr. Hanson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he claim the picture? - Yes, as soon as he came; from there we went to the justice's; while we were at Mr. Hanson's the prisoner claimed the coat the picture was wrapped up in, and we returned it, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any particular conversation pass? - At the justices I gave the same evidence as I give now; the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done, hoping Mr. Jenkins would forgive him.</p>

I had this property in my bed-cabin when I went on board. On the morning of the 2d of February, about seven o'clock, I missed them. We took it by turns to be on board one night, and on shore the next. I had left them all safe on the night before: I saw the prisoner on board, and said, "Somebody has robbed me last night," and asked him how many persons had been on board; he said, four. I asked, if any of them had seen my things; he said, no. The mate called them all up at breakfast, and asked, if any of them had seen my things; but, at last, he confessed that he had taken them. We all went to Mr. Davis's, and there found them.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse public-house, Upper East-Smithfield. These things were brought to my house about six o'clock in the morning of the 2d of February, by the prisoner, and another person. They had some rum, and smoked a pipe - they asked, what time the London Dock opened; I told them - and they asked, if I would take care of the bundle till they called; I said, I would. About ten o'clock, the prosecutor and prisoner came, and said, they were stolen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had worked on board the ship eight days; after the ship was loaded, we leaked two feet five inches of water, in five hours. I was in danger of my life, and I took my clothes on shore - I happened to take these things in mistake, being a little in liquor. Next morning this shipmate came on board, and enquired about his things; I told him what I had done, and said, if I had taken them, it was through mistake - he said, if I would return them, he would say no more about them. The mate had me put into confinement - I am a Swede, by birth.</p>
               <p>KIRK re-examined. Q. Had the vessel sprung a leak at all? A. Yes; it used to leak about two feet of water in twenty-four hours. He denied taking them till all hands were called aft, and then he owned it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure they were taken out? - A. Yes; they were completely taken out by both hands, before I got over the counter; there were a number of smaller articles that were gone altogether, there were two tristing things picked up at a little distance from the house; the prisoner was brought back to the house by two watchmen, and I gave charge of him, James Rose was one of the watchmen; upon looking at the door, I found the pendant ring of the lock of the door broke off; I looked round, and to the scraper I saw tied a piece of new cord, and at the other end of it the pendant ring, it had broke in getting the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive you saw them go out at the window? - A. Yes; I saw a man's hands take them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. They cost us more than twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep? - A. A silversmith's and jeweller's shop; my husband is an optician by prosession; I am sure they are my husband's property.</p>

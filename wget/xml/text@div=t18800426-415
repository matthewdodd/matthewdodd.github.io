                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Serjeant B</hi>), I received information of this robbery on 13th March—I immediately went to Mr. Gell's house—it was at 11 p.m. on Saturday—Davey was called up in the presence of Mr. Gell and Mrs. Siddall—I said to her, "You have been left in charge of the house, who has been here?"—she said, "My two sisters have been here, Caroline and Margaret Davey"—I asked their addresses—she produced an envelope of Margaret's address, "Mrs. Whitcliff, Oardington, Bucks"—I said, "Where can she be found?"—she said, "She is in service at 52, Eaton Place"—she also said her father visited her in January, and that I could go to him, to a place called Gropham, near Crawley, in Sussex; also Mr. Orfield, the butler, and Mr. H. White, the footman, at 62, Eaton Place—I said, "Is that all?"—she said, "Yes"—I had examined the cupboards—there were no marks of violence on them—I went again on 18th March, having in the meantime discovered the plates and the clock—I saw Davey about 6.30 in the library, in Mrs. Gell's and Mrs. Siddall's presence—I said, "I have a number of plates, also a clock, a portion of them are pledged in the name of David Dunbar, of 57, Redburn Street, Chelsea, and others by Charles Wilson, of 4, Stafford Place, Buckingham Gate; do you know such persons or their addresses 1"—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—neither was in custody then—on Sunday, 21st March, I went to 57, Redburn Street, Chelsea, about 11 a.m.—I saw Dunbar—I said, "lam a police officer, I shall take you in custody for being concerned with a man named Charles Wilson, and in company with him stealing a large quantity of Dresden plates and a clock, from 44, Eaton Square, the property of the Rev. Mr. Gell, to the value of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he replied, "You do not mean to say they are stolen; I am as innocent as a child un<lb></lb>born; I pledged them for Wilson, he having told me he was a dealer"—Bubbington and others identified him—nothing was found on him relating to the property—on Monday, 22nd March, he was brought up—on that day I saw Witton at 4, Stafford Place, I believe his mother's house—I said, "Is your name Wilson?"—he said, No, Witton,"—I said, "Arthur?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "lama police officer, and shall take you in</p>

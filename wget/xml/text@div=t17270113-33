On Saturday Morning I went out of Town, and left Word that I should not come home that Night, but came home sooner; and in the Stables saw two strange Fellows: And there used to be so many Irishmen about my House, I ordered that no Body should come there without my Knowledge; my Wife complained that it was very strange, if she nor her Sisters must have no Body come to them. I stay'd at home all Day on Sunday, and about 10 o'Clock at Night as I was at Supper with my Wife and her Sister,

I then sent to Mr. Harcourt of the Crown Office, and begg'd he would come immediately, but he was not at home; I went into the Parlour, where was my Mother, Sisters, and my Wife, and seized a Pistol in her Pocket; I told them the Story, and fetched her packt up Cloths; and then sent into Shoreditch to Robert Dug's, desiring him to come to my Assistance, and to bring what Arms he could with him, or else I should be murthered:

               <p>For the Prisoner, Mr. Hammond depos'd. That the Prisoner at the Bar came to the House the Monday before this happened, and agreed with her for a Lodging for a Gentleman that would be private; and that there would not be above two or three Persons come to him: And I insisted that no Woman should come to him, being cautious in that respect for the Reputation of my House. And the next Day after the Gentleman came, he invited me to Dine with him, and told me he was in Debt, and desired I would not let any Bailiff in, and the Prisoner used to be with him every Night. She swore she was awaked out of her Sleep at One in the Morning by the opening of the Door, she put on her Cloaths and went down, and cloud was in the Entry, and Cunningham and Ashton above Stairs.</p>
               <p>Margaret, Mrs. Hammond's Maid swore. About One o'Clock she let the Prisoner out of their House, that Ashton the Potter was not out of their House till after Two o'Clock, (which was positively contradicted by Keneday, Mr. Benson's Coachman) and that Mr. Cunningham and Cloud his Man, and Ashton were all up, and in their House, about the Time of the Disturbance in the Street.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Benson was examin'd by Consent of both Sides, she depos'd. That she was not positive that Mr Russel was privy to her going away with Mr. Cunningham, he had resolved to carry her away as had been mentioned; but did not name particularly who should assist him; but when she was upon the Iron Rails, the Prisoner came up and said no Body should hurt her. That the Prisoner had brought Letters and Messages from Mr. Cunningham, and knew her very well; that she was several Times with Mr. Cunningham, at his Lodgings; and Mrs. Hammond see her and knew of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How came she to go away?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She told me her mother had got a better place, and seemed to be willing to go; so upon that, I was willing she should go; and on the Wednesday after, I missed ten guineas; my mind was a little confused that I could not justly tell at first; I sat down and counted it, and looked at my bills that I had paid, and found I had lost that money; then I went to a gentlewoman that her mother washes for, who sent her maid for the prisoner's mother; after that Mrs. Clark and the mother went and brought the girl to me; when she came, I asked how she could use me so ill as to rob me of so much money; she denied it some time; Mrs. Clark took her into the back parlour, and in a few minutes she came out, and said the girl owned it: then I went in, she owned to me she had taken four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with it?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She said she had taken some things out of pawn with some of it, and bought some things. I asked her when she took it; she said she took it after I brought the box into the parlour, after I was returned, the day I paid for my stays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her mother before?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I never had seen her mother before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon whose recommendation did you take the girl?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I took her upon her looks; I thought she looked like a very honest creditable girl; the mother said she would go and see for some of the money; out of mercy and tenderness to the mother, as she seemed to be in so much sorrow and grief, I would have let her go, if I could have got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your money again?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. I did not; they told me if I took her to a Justice, it was a capital crime, and it would take her life. I kept her in Mrs. Clark's house till half an hour after nine o'clock; then the mother and she went to my house; the mother went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140013"></xptr> out and returned, and said, she could not get the money, but begged of me not to charge a constable. She went away on the Friday morning, and on the Monday her mother brought her to Justice Fielding's; then I took them both up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to the charge before the Justice?</p>
               <p>E. Tweed. She owned she had taken four guineas, and owned to no more.</p>

            . I am a housekeeper in Holbourn; I lett the prosecutrix a shop and parlour in my house. On the 1st of May I came home about eleven o'clock, and found this lady and the prisoner in my parlour along with my wife; the lady declared the prisoner had robbed her of ten guineas; I applied to the prisoner, and said, My girl, have you robbed your mistress of this sum? she made no answer; I asked her again without any threats; she told me she had, but said, I did not take ten guineas, I only took four; said I, you may as well tell the truth, it will be no more criminal to take ten than four, and you will have a greater claim for clemency of your mistress if you confess: she then said she did take ten, and had given her mother five guineas, and had taken her own cloaths out of pawn, and other things for another girl her acquaintance; and had bought some things, mentioning a pair of shoes, which she had on her feet; I advised the prosecutrix to stay, and not charge a constable if she could recover the money, as the girl was young; I advised her not to prosecute her, as it was a capital offence; it was the prisoner's own desire to stay in the shop, and the prosecutrix desired me to go to the mother in the morning, but the prisoner made her escape in the morning; after that, there were people sent to take up the mother; she was taken up, and another person; they said they would produce the girl, and before Mr. Fielding I heard the girl acknowledge she had taken only four guineas; the morning after the girl made her escape, the mother and a gentleman came to me, and made proposals of giving five guineas, and a note for the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clark. The prosecutrix came to me on the 30th of April, and told me she had been robbed of ten guineas by the girl at the bar; I said, I would send for the mother, accordingly I did; when she came, I acquainted her with what her mistress had told me; she said, she knew she had some money, but did not know how she came by it: then I went with the mother, to fetch the girl from the mother's house; we brought her to my house; I took her into the back parlour, and said, if she would tell the truth I would intercede with her mistress for her; then she owned she had taken four guineas and bought some things, and taken some things out of pawn; she went from my house about nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Mrs. Clark's house, and by my mistress's desire, she told my mother she would let me be at her house till 12 the next day; my mother did not come till four in the afternoon; when she came, she said she could not get the money that my mistress charged me with; my mother went home, and my mistress took me to Mr. Parker's house. and told him I had robbed her of ten guineas; I told him I had not; he said, I might as well say it, it would be all the same, and I did not own to it a great while; Mr. Parker bid me say my mother had five guineas, and I had the rest; I said, if I should say that I should say a very false thing; my mistress took me into the house, and said she would lock me up; she locked me into the shop, and I remained there till three in the morning; she imagined I was going to get out, and I was not; she got out of bed and dragged me from the counter, and struck me two or three times, she would not let me sit down nor lean upon the table or chair; I said, I could not stand without sitting down on the floor: she dragged me from the floor, and called the watchman, no watchman came; she got into the bed and left the key in the door; I let myself out, and locked the door and went away; and after that, I heard my mother was taken up, then I went and delivered myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Is this true that she has been relating as to your behaviour to her?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is utterly false.</p>
               <p>Parker. What the prisoner has said relating to me is utterly false. I never bid her say her mother had five guineas, I only desired her to tell the truth.</p>

               <p>Parker. When this last evidence came to my house, he came by way of insult to the woman that has lost the money; I said to him, as he was an officer, how came he to insult the woman; said he, she keeps her a prisoner in her own house. I said, if he was in her case, he would have cause to go down on his knees and thank her for that favour, in not being put into the custody of an officer; I think that was far from abusing him.</p>

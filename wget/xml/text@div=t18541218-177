For the last six months I have seen some iron rails resembling these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying on the side of the embankment close to a bridge at Stratford—I saw them there about a week before 11th Dec.—I went next morning to the spot where they ought to have been, and found that they were gone—these rails are only used between London and Stratford, as there is more traffic there.</p>

               <p>Railway Company. About four months ago I took some rails off the line, and laid them beside the line near Stratford, close to a bridge—these are them—here is a mark on this piece, made by the weight of an engine, which I noticed, as I had to cut another piece and put in the place of it, and I had to put a longer piece in—I do not know the other piece, but I had to cut a piece off to fill up the other, and I put them both together.</p>

I was on duty at Marsh-gate-lane, near Stratford, and saw the prisoner and two more men about 500 yards from the spot which was afterwards pointed out to me by Currey, carrying these two pieces of rail—the prisoner and one man were carrying the long piece, and the other man was carrying the short piece—I got within ten yards of them, when the prisoner and one man threw it off their shoulders; the other man threw his piece down, and they all ran away—I never lost sight of the prisoner—I apprehended him—he said before the Magistrate that he was coming that way from Lea-bridge, but there is no way that way without crossing ditches and marshes.</p>

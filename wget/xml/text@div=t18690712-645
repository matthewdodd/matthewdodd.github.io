                  </hi>. I am a savior, of 36, Storey Street, Caledonian Road—I became acquainted with the prisoner at a loan office, in Seven Dials, fifteen or sixteen months ago, and in April. 1868, he applied to me for a loan—I lent him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was to give me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the loan of it—I obtained from him a mortgage of the house, and a bill of sale for the plant on the premises—I afterwards lent him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for alterations to the place—I did not know that the house was afterwards sold, as Mr. Rowe persuaded me not to speak to Mr. Reeves—I was obliged to bring an action of adjustment against him; but it was some time before that that the transfer to Reeves took place—(<hi rend="italic">An agreement, dated September</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">was here put in, by which George Conway let to Frederick Reeves, for five years, the ground floor</hi>, at 314, <hi rend="italic">Gray's Inn Road, at</hi> 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum. On the back of</hi> it <hi rend="italic">was a memo<lb></lb>randum, signed by both parties, that the rent was reduced to</hi> 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum, to be paid at the rate of</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week</hi>)—The things in this agreement were the same that were originally in the bill of sale—I know nothing of the removal of this horse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About that time did you know that the bill of sale was invalid, in consequence of alterations after execution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it was invalid; I oould not tell the reason—at that time I knew Reeves as servant to the defendant at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had been acting as his servant at this place—I do not know of a proposed partnership between Reeves and the defendant—Rowe wanted me to come in as a partner, but I refused—Rowe sent Reeves with a note, one evening, for me to come down; I did so, and when he got to the office he wanted me to become a partner—I knew that the arrangement of 21st September was for Rowe to have the use of the vans and hones—I lent him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he should not have the handling of the money out of the till before I was paid—after that the furniture was swept off by the execution creditors—on 20th January, 1869, it was quite time that I commenced proceedings in adjustment to turn Mr. Rowe out of the place—I rested my claim on the mortgage deed—I was present at the trial of the adjustment—I believe it was on 24th May—on that occasion I knew that the bill of sale was questioned by Mr. Justice Hannen—I believe the Judge would hear nothing at all about it—on 29th May, I went down to take possession of the premises—I knew of letters passing between the solicitors—I told Mr. Rowe, outside his own door, that I would give him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew that he moved away some few articles of furniture on the morning of 29th May—I did not know that the horse was removed at the same time, but I knew it at 9 o'clock in the morning—I did not give Mr. Vince in custody; he gave himself up to the detectives, and said that he would buy back the horse—I do not know that the horse was used by Mr. Vince for a week or a fortnight in a cab—the charge was dismissed—my solicitor appeared against him—after the charge of stealing the horse was disposed of, Mr. Reeves made a charge against this man of stealing McDougal's van—that was part of the hiring—up to 29th May Mr. Howe's name was on the <hi rend="italic">facia</hi> of these premises; it is up at the top now—his name is on the vans, and mine too.</p>

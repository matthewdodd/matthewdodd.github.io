                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 97.) On the 9th of Feb., about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I saw Seeley, Bentley, and Smith in Greycoat-place, Westminster—I went towards them, and observed they had no shoes on—I said, "What have you got a job to night?"—they said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, we are only going out for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—they went towards Tothill-fields, New-prison—at a quarter before one o'clock I went down Artillery-place—I came back again, and stood against a baker's shop—I saw Bentley run across the road—before I could lay hold of him, Smith was coming up—I laid hold of him—I searched him—he had nothing, and I let him go—Seeley was coming up the same way as the others—he saw me, and ran back again—Smith and Bentley went across Strutton-ground into Pear-street, leading to Duck-lane—there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing there, and Bentley and Smith came and whistled, and said, "Come on, it is all right"—I went down Artillery-place, and found a fowl in a little garden dead, but quite warm—I went down Duck-lane again, and found some feathers at Nos. 16 and 17—I knocked at the door of No. 17—it was opened by a female—I went in—there was a number of feathers on the floor—I went up stairs, and Seeley, Bentley, and Smith were in bed, two in one bed, and one in another—I returned down stairs—I searched under the stairs, and found a hen in a saucepan, covered up—I took it out, and looked for the feathers upon the floor, but they had all been re<lb></lb>moved—Groves then came from the back room with a candle—he was not dressed—I said, "What is done with those things that laid here?"—he said, "I do not know: I have seen no things"—I said, "There were some things laid here"—he said, "I picked up some feathers and put them in the grate"—I searched his room, but found nothing—I went up stairs, and found a cock under the bed, where Seeley and Smith were—I said, "Halloo! what have you got here"—they said they knew nothing about it—I took them into custody—Mr. Jones lives about a quarter of a mile from Artillery-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Robinson's-cottages, Francis-place, West<lb></lb>minster. This cock and two hens are mine—they were safe between one and two o'clock on the 9th of Feb. while I was at dinner—I missed them on the following morning—there is no fastening to the garden-gate, nor to the place where they took the fowls from—the fowls had not lost all their feathers when I saw them again—pretty nearly all the feathers were upon them.</p>

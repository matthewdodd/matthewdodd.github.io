                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said she had aggravated him very much, and he had given her a tap; that was as we were going from Cudham to Bromley—he also said he had been wandering about since he had done it, and had tried to drown himself—he did not seem to be at all excited or alarmed at the charge—he is a very old man—he said he had got the razor with the intention of cutting his throat—we had a ride of about eight miles, and there was a deal of conversation.</p>

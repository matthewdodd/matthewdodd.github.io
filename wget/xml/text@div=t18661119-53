                  </hi>. I live at 6, Hunt's Buildings, Somer's Town, and am a widow—on Friday evening, the 19th October, at 8.30 or 8.40, I was going to my daughter's, and saw the prisoner attempting to open the window of No. 6, Goldington Crescent—I know him, from frequenting Somer's Town market—I am quite sure he is the man—there was a man on the pavement, who gave a sort of whistle between his teeth—the pri<lb></lb>soner suddenly turned round, and I saw his face.</p>

I live with my brother at 5, Goldington Crescent, Oakley Square, and am single—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property, one mine and one my mother's—I know them both well—I saw them last safe on Friday, 19th October, at about half-past eight to nine, as well as I can recollect—my mother missed them about a quarter to eleven—they were kept in a ground room, the same with the street—after we missed them we observed the window open at the bottom end—in the morning we discovered the mark of a foot upon the window curtain—the street door was shut.</p>

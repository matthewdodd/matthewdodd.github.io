               <p>Hore's defence. As I was coming down Long-acre, I saw a bundle lay at the corner of Langworth-street; I was going to pick it up, and an elderly gentlewoman that stood there picked it up; she says to me, you impudent b - h, what reason have you to stoop and pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it on the ground? - A. I do not know, and instantly this woman put up her hand and struck me, and gave me a black eye, and this woman wanted to pull me back to her house; she said I had stole them; I said, I do not know where you live; I will not go with you without an Officer; that gentleman said, you shall go with me, my dear; that gentleman took me to Bow-street, and that woman swore falsely against me; I was never in that woman's house in my life; I saw that woman pick up the bundle.</p>

               <p>1869, an agreement was made by which he was to have a portion of the land which I had taken from the freeholder—I produce the agreement—it is for four plots, for the erection of eight homes, Nos. 7 and 8, Victoria Road, and 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, Amyand Park Road—there was another agree<lb></lb>ment on 19th March, 1869, which I produce, with reference to land, for two bouses at the upper end of Amyand Park—I hare not got any money for those houses—on 3rd April, 1869, there was another agreement for a single house, at Victoria Road, Twickenham—on 7th May I paid Pearse 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he then made a re-assignment of the houses over to me—I paid him the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took possession of all the property mentioned in the three build-ing agreements, and also the materials on the place which had not been used, such as bricks, and other things—he did not tell me that Warlow was suing him, or that he was going down to Lewes; if he had done so I should not have paid him the 751., because I should have had the houses under the agreements—I have seen Warlow at work for Pearse; but I know nothing of him—he acted as Pearse's head man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Norfolk &amp; Yalden, accountants, London—I have seen the accounts in the bankruptcy proceedings, and the banker's pass-book delivered up by the bankrupt—the cash account filed by the bankrupt shows receipts to the amount of 12,345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for twelve months preceding the bankruptcy—that is incorrect in this way, it includes the balance which he had at his banker's in July, 1868, and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was overdrawn in July, 1868—there is no trace in the cash account of a receipt for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Hicks—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Levi appears in the bank-book—there is no account of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Wheeler on 7th May, or 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Holmes on 8th May—there is no account of Mr. Swanston's cheque for 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no entry of a payment to Mr. Hicks on that day on the other side—I have deducted his account from the banker's pass-book, and the gross payments in the twelve months ore 5344<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have examined the detailed cash account which was filed—it is not iden<lb></lb>tical with the pass-book—the balance at the banker's is not brought in in the first instance—the result of the examination tends to show that he has received a great deal of money which he has not accounted for—I find that on the 8th May, the date of the adjudication, he had in his hands 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he ought to have given up to the assignees—therein several mistakes in the casting up of the accounts—I have examined the de<lb></lb>ficiency account—he brings in items there which are absent in the cash account—cheques in favour of "self" amount to 5386<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there is no indication of where they have gone to.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> What is the amount he has paid away in wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 4340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during the year—I have had no books whatever—he had put down in the account "Workmen's wages, about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and so on—there is "May, 1868, paid workmen's wages during this month about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and there are three cheques drawn out of the bank on that day—the unsecured creditors are brought into the deficiency account, which is wrong—there is an entry of property in the hands of Messrs. Lake &amp; Co., six houses in the Golburn Road, 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per house, 3150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gives the amount which those houses cost him to build, and passes it to the account of creditors holding security—the deficiency account is not a deficiency account at all—there is nothing to show what the deficiency is.</p>

                  </hi>. In August, 1869, in consequence of something I heard from a man named Warlow, I went to Pearse—when I saw him he said "I want you to go with me to see Mr. Levi about the furnishing of a pair of villas at Twickenham," and we went together—the prisoner said "The contract must be in your name, as I am a bankrupt"—I was to receive my wages daily, as a working man—I am a carpenter—I was not present at the discussion between Levi and Pearse—Mr. Pearse went in and saw Levi, and left me in the hall—I signed the contract, and I worked there several months—I had worked for Pearse before he was a bankrupt—I was paid while I was at work—the money was brought to me by Pearse—50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to me by Levi to pay wages, and I paid the men with it—I handed it to Pearse; he took it from me—I signed my name' at the back of that cheque—I handed it to Pearse when I got it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that contract finished when you left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think it was—Mr. Pearse had the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he brought me the money the next day to pay the wages—Pearse did not get the money himself—I paid the wages most times—I think by the contract Levi was to pay 400 odd pounds—I did not see the contract after I signed it—I can't say how much I paid in wages—I paid every week—there were sometimes eight men, sometimes twelve at work—it would be 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—since Pearse has been bankrupt he has been working as foreman on the works, not as master—I believe he has been making his living like that ever since he has been a Bankrupt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Steward, Clerk of the Works, depos'd, That the Prisoners knew there was no Lead to be carried out of the Tower without his Order, and that he was inform'd that the Prisoners had been seen about 12 o'Clock, to carry out Lead upon their Shoulders, when he always sends it by a Cart he has for that purpose , and that he is obliged to weigh it in and out, and to take an Account of it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners carrying the Lead out of the Tower was confirmed by several Evidences.</p>
               <p>They pleaded, that they carried it out that it might not be lost, and did design to carry it to the Plumbery the next Morning when they got the Key.</p>
               <p>The Master Plumber depos'd, He never gave Orders for so doing; and that when he examined Durham about carrying it out, he at first deny'd it, but afterwards own'd it.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners pleaded, that they did not conceal it, but carried it to Mr. Wilson's, where their Master used to pay them their Wages, and laid it openly in a publick Room.</p>

I live at New Brentford, and am agent to John Ste<lb></lb>phenson, a coal-merchant—he has business there, and in Derbyshire, Birmingham, and Nottingham—I purchased some oats for his use on the 18th of February, of Mr. Norton, of Old Brentford—they were all of one sort and sample—they were delivered to me on Saturday the 19th of Feb<lb></lb>ruary, and placed in the warehouse—part of them were taken out of tie place on Tuesday night, the 22nd, as near as I can tell, about twelve bushels and a half out of the five quarters—five quarters is forty bushels—I had seen them in the place some time in the day on the 22nd—here are some now in Court—they agreed with the bulk that belonged to Mr. Stephenson when I saw them at the police-station—I have a sample of Mr. Stephenson's, which were left behind, and of those found by the officer—they so much resemble each other, I could not tell one from</p>

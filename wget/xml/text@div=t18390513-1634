                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lodge in Devonshire-street, Lis<lb></lb>son-grove. In March, 1838, I went to lodge in East-street—the two pri<lb></lb>soners lodged in the adjoining room—Wright was a dress-maker—I was very ill—they frequently came into my room—I continued ill a month after, up to May—I had a gold watch, four brooches, a gold eye-glass, and other things—I had seen them all safe after I had been there a month—I cannot say when I saw my watch last, but it was gone on the 12th of May, 1838—I missed the rings and my watch in East-street—I went to Davis-street in May—I there missed the counterpane, three sheets, a pair of scissors, a pen-knife, and four yards of Irish poplin—I lost in East-street a watch, the money, and jewellery, and divers other articles, before I went to Davis-street—I saw the counterpane safe in Davis-street, and there I missed the seven aprons, the two petticoats, and three shawls—I missed them on the 12th of May, 1838—here is a pair of scissors that I missed in East-street, and this veil, this watch, pencil-case, handkerchiefs, four rings, and these two shifts, are mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the two prisoners lodged together—they were there before I went—they went away when I did, in May, and came with me to Davis-street.</p>

I live in East-street—I keep the house—the pri<lb></lb>soners did not lodge with me—I know them both—in October I bought the duplicate of the gold watch of Rose—I did not know her name—I bought three duplicates in October, 1838, one for the watch, pledged for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the others, a counterpane, and a pair of sheets, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the sheets out from Mr. Rowe, and the watch from Mr. Franklin's, at the bottom of Tottenham Court-road—I gave the watch to the officer—Wright was not there when I bought it.</p>

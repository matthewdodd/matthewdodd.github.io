                  </hi>. I live at 291, Lynton Road, Bermondsey, and am in the service of Messrs. Cripps—on the morning of 26th August, about 10 o'clock, I was driving a cart along the Lower Road, Deptford—I saw two vans before me—the prisoner was driving one of them, there were chests of tea in the other van, and barrels in the prisoner's van; the vans were following each other—I saw a man who has escaped, walking behind the tea van, in front of the prisoner's horses; he looked round suspiciously, I was behind—I could not get by at the time, because of the traffic—I saw the rope of the van was undone; I then trotted by, looked round and saw the chest of tea on the man's back, he put it into the prisoner's van and covered it up, and got into the van—I went and spoke to the prisoner, and the man then got down and disappeared while the van was going on—the prisoner drove on very fast; I stopped him and sent for a policeman—the prisoner must have seen the man put the chest of tea in his van; he was right in front <hi rend="italic">of</hi> him at first, and he turned round and saw him put it in, and then he drove away as fast as he could, whipping his horse; I galloped after him and overtook him.</p>

He said 'It is not here; it is in the Surrey Commercial Dock' He asked me to have some beer, we went to the Jolly Sailors, where we got to the Canal Bridge. He said 'Go by that van.' As I was driving by he said 'You have come too far now, turn round again," and as I turned round I saw him cover up a chest, of tea on my van. He said 'Go on as hard as you can,' and he got out and ran away. I drove on and turned to the left, and then to the right, and seeing the witness coming after me I stopped."</p>

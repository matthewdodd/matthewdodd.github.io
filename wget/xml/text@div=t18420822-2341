                  </hi>. I am a coach-painter, in the service of Mr. Hay, a coach-builder, in Great Queen-street. On the morning of the 27th of July, I was standing looking towards the shop, and saw the prisoner bringing some caps out of the shop, in his hand—I believe he observed me, for he' went back again to the back part of the shop, and returned without any thing—I followed him up Queen-street, and told him he had got some caps belonging to us—he said he had not—I felt the pocket of his coat behind—it appeared to contain something heavy, and it was found to contain a metal collet, which is a thing that goes on the axletree—it is Mr. Hay's property.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. James Hay, my father, and another, coach-builders, in Queen-street—I was present when Watts took the collet from the prisoner's pocket—I felt it from the outside of his pocket previous to Watts putting his hand in—I can swear to it—it is one of a set—they are all marked with separate letters, and this letter corre<lb></lb>sponds with the letters on the nuts of the set off which this collet was missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner stopped in Great Queen-street—I went up, and saw Watts running—he said the man had got some of his master's property, put his hand into his pocket, and took the collet out—the prisoner said, "You must have put it there"—I took him to the station, and found 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went into the shop after a young man named Smith, who I understood lived there; I saw no person, came out again, and walked towards Drury-lane; the man came after me; if I had had any thing of the kind, I should have tried to make my escape; he accused me of having this collet; I said I had not; he put his hand info my pocket, and took it out; he must have had it in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. I have known the prisoner about four months. The first time she came was on the 4th of July, she came till she could get a place; she continued with me about three months, before she could get a place, she had her provision and lodging for nothing, she was a countrywoman's of my wife, she came from Dartmouth; she got a place, and staid about a fortnight, she came back again, and was with us about a fortnight, and then she went away. She said she was going to her aunt's, she left one of her boxes, she came for it on the 15th of December, she went up to her box, and that was the time I suspected she took the forty pounds and the two guineas, as my wife was busy washing. On the 22nd of December I went up stairs to get the note and the money, it was gone; the money was in a tin case in a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Where was this pocket book. - A. In a drawer in a chest in the one pair of stairs room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Charlton in Chancery lane. The prisoner on the 15th of December came to me, saying it was a note of Mr. Turner's, a shipwright at Deptford.</p>
               <p>Q. What value was the note. - A. Forty pounds; saying he was going to leave his yard at Deptford. and was taking his money; she said she was going to her place that night. As the note could only be changed at the bank, she begged me to go and get it changed for her. I not having time to go, I begged Mr Brown to change it for me. In about an hour after the young woman came and took the change of the forty pound note, all in small notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not take any particular notice of the note. - A. I did not.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 10th of January last I apprehended the prisoner at the bar near Yarmouth in Suffolk. I told her I came to apprehend her upon this charge; she seemed very much alarmed. I told her to pull her pockets out, that I might see what was in them. I found in her pocket a small pocket book, containing a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a bunch of small keys. I then asked her if she had any box there, she said she had only one trunk, she pointed towards the trunk that was there, I said I must go to it. I had to go round a mahogany table, it was a genteel house where I took her, at a relations. While I was trying to undo the trunk, she said she would not be taken to London, she said I will sooner do this first. I was then stooping down to unlock the trunk; she was dressed in a habit shirt, and she pulled it down, I saw her draw something across her throat, I did not see what it was; the guard of the mail coach was there at the time that I went down with. He caught hold of her arm, and then I returned round the table, seeing the blood come from her neck; presently after, I got the knife from her, but not till we had cut her thumb. In pressing her wrist a great deal, I believe I hurt her thumb. Afterwards I unlocked her trunk, I found nothing in it but wearing apparel; she said she had took the forty pound note, but the two guineas she said she had not. She said she took it for some imprudent liberties that I did not think it prudent to ask her about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her at all. - A. No more than asking her if she was guilty of the crime. She was in that agonising state after she had attempted to cut her throat, what she said was so incoherent you could hardly understand her, and indeed from the flurry that she was in, and the blood flowing, she was cut an inch and a half; she bled so much that her clothes were obliged to be taken off. I asked her where she got the the knife, I was certain that she had no knife in her pocket. She said she took it out of a workbag.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIBBONS. I am clerk in the bank. The forty pound note was paid in the bank by Dawson and Co.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Have you any body from Chancery lane. - A. No.</p>

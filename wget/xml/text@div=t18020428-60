               <p>Q.Were you able to discover the countenance of the man? - A. No, he held down his head with a disposition to hide his face; two other men then came running violently down the court in a direction from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of those men? - A.At the end of the court there is a small gate, the first man that went out shut the gate after him, and the other two men got to the gate together; a scuffle ensued between them and me, they got the gate open; I did not observe them sufficiently to know their countenances; I pursued them into Wine-office-court, where the man was found, who was tried and convicted at the last Sessions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew the prisoner perfectly well before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You have told this story before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were examined before, did you say that you knew any one of the men? - A. I said, the man that struck Mr. Troughton was dressed in a light coloured great-coat.</p>
               <p>Q.That is any thing but an answer - when you were examined before upon the trial of Bean, did you say you knew any one of the men you saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280071"></xptr>there? - A. Yes, the man that struck Mr. Troughtort was a hard looking man.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read over to you the evidence you gave upon that occasion - (reads it, See Page 179.) Did you venture to swear that you knew that man? - A. Yes, I was asked the question if I had known the man before, and I said I had seen him in Fleet-street, and knew him by having that great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you swore you had seen that man in Fleet-street, whoever he was? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon Bean's trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You now venture to swear positively, that, upon that former trial, you swore you knew that man by having seen him in Fleet-street? - A.

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not go, the next Sessions, before the Judge who is now trying, and receive your share of the reward? - A. I have since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect a share of the reward, if this man is convicted? - A. I shall expect it, as well as another; but I would not be here for that.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you that; do you not expect it? - A. To be sure I do.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of last month the two prisoners came into my house, and called for a pint of porter; I had just taken my husband's great coat out of the parlour, and hung it up on the bannisters of the stairs which is in the end of the passage, with intent to take it up stairs; my husband keeps <placeName id="t17940917-19-crimeloc93">the King's Arms, in East smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner Griffiths. Is it a likely thing that I would be had enough to take away the coat when I went in for a pint of beer? the coat was in the bundle, when I went into the parlour, and this very man would not go into the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutrix. Did you serve me with the pint of beer? - The pint of beer was drawn, but there was no time to have the beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about the coat than the man in the moon,</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clifford. Did you see me near the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They both must pass the coat as they went into the parlour; when they came into the house I was standing between the door and the stairs, to go up stairs, with the coat in my hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Clifford. I have nothing more to say, I never put the coat there, and this man never went into the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the coat, I know nothing of the apron, the apron was never in my house before that day, it is a man's apron, I have not a person in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170067"></xptr>family that wears any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clifford. Mrs. Dawson said, I think it is very proper to stop you along with him, as you came in along with this man.</p>

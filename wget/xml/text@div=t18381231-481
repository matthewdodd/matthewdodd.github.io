                  </hi>. I live in Bunhill-row, and am a shoemaker. Between eight and nine o'clock, on the 22nd of December, the prisoners came to my shop, and asked me to show them a pair of shoes—I was about to show them a pair—they told me it was not of that description, it was an old pair of boot-bottoms, to suit the prisoner George—I sent my little boy down in the kitchen to get a pair—they said it-was immaterial, they would call again, and left—I immediately missed two shoes from the window-ledge—I went in pursuit, and they came back with me—previous to sending my little boy down, I heard William speak to some person outside the window, and as I had lost a pair about a week before, I gave charge of the prisoners, but did not find the shoes—I had seen them safe five minutes before they came in—no one else had been in the shop from the time of my placing the shoes there, and missing them—I heard William call out," Harry," and then William came up to me—at that time George had an opportunity of handing them from the window-ledge, to any person outside.</p>

               <p>Donalson. On the 9th of April, at Night, I carried the Prisoner to one Bird's House, in the <placeName id="t17390502-22-crimeloc113">Coal-Yard, in Holborn</placeName>

This Bird keeps a bad House I believe. - About Ten or Eleven o'Clock, I called for some Liquor; and

             (the next Witness) brought up a hot Pint. I felt for Money to pay for it, and missed my Watch, and my Money. There was nobody in the Room but the Prisoner and this Brian, who brought up the Liquor; and I believe the Prisoner is not Guilty, for I take it, - the Evidence [ Brian ] is the Person who convey'd away the Watch.</p>
               <p>Ann Brian. I went into the Room with the hot Pint, and saw the Prisoner and the Prosecutor - together. He bid her take Money out of his Pocket to pay me; she did so, and I saw her pull out his Watch, and laid it upon the Cloaths. I bid him give it me, that I might give it Mr. Bird to take of; but the Prisoner said she could take care of it herself. Sometime afterwards he called for a Candle, and said he had lost his Watch and his Money; then he made her move out at her Place, and found 3 s. 6 d. 1/2 under her, which he gave to me, and told me, it was all the Money he had left. After I had been committed to New Prison, and she to Newgate, Mr. Bird said, he found the Watch under some Bricks in the Chimney.</p>

            . When Brian was sent to New Prison, she told the Constable, she believed the Watch was in the Room where Donalson and the Prisoner had been together; and she desired him to come to me, and beg that I would search the Room. I did, and found the Watch under two Bricks in the Chimney, at the End of the Grate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wood, Constable. On the 9th of April, the Prosecutor brought Brian and the Prisoner before me, and charged them with stealing a Watch. The next Day I took them before Mr. Deveil, and Brian swore the Prisoner gave her the Watch, but she had given it to her again. When Brian was in the Coach going to New Prison, she told me, - if she could be admitted to the House, she believed the Watch would be found. I left that Notice at Bird's House, and in about two Hours Time Bird came to my House, and told me he had found the Watch in the Chimney.</p>
               <p>The Court reprimanded Donalson for his Conduct, and the Jury <rs id="t17390502-22-verdict114" type="verdictDescription">

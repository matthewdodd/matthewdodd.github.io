                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, F</hi> 16). I was at the police station, in Bow-street, on the morning of 25th May; I saw some one there, and went to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I met Pocock and Thomas on the way—I found the street door of the house open—I went up to the first floor front room; I remained there a few minutes—the room door was opened by some one, and I rushed across the room; the prisoner Jackson seized me by my neck-handkerchief—I got from her, but not in sufficient time to prevent Morris from breaking a mould—I saw him take it from the table, throw it on the ground, and stamp on it—I am quite sure it was a mould, I had seen several before—it was made of plaster of Paris—I seized Morris, gave him to Pocock, and picked up some portions of the mould—these are them—I found no impression on them—I saw an old mould, found in a cupboard—I found this wire on the floor, it is attached to a plate, and two counterfeit sixpences were attached to the wire, and eight more six-pences were on the floor, near the wire—on the mantelpiece I found a num<lb></lb>ber of base half crowns in a paper box—there were six half crowns and four half crowns separate, all counterfeit, and fourteen shillings; and in a sepa<lb></lb>rate paper there were six other shillings, all counterfeit—there was a very bright fire, and on the hob was a crucible with some metal in it, which is in it now—it was then in a melted state; the crucible was very hot, I was obliged to get a rag to lay hold of it—I found in a cupboard a battery jar with some liquid in it, which I have got in a bottle—the broken moulds were made of plaster of Paris—there was a slight impression on one of the pieces, I think, of George the Fourth—when I went into the room the prisoner, Riley, made his escape from the table where Morris was at work—Riley got to the door, but was brought back—I prevented Jackson from hitting Pocock on the head with a basin, and she said she would kill any man that took her old man—meaning, I suppose, Morris.</p>

I accompanied Hayes to the house in question—when I went into the room I saw Jackson, and Morris, who was stamping on the floor, and breaking up a plaster of Paris mould—I took hold of Morris, and took him to the farther side of the room; Jack<lb></lb>son came and used violence towards me to make me let her old man go—I saw Riley brought into the room by Thomas—I searched Morris, and found six sixpences in his fob, and six shillings and a half crown in another pocket, all good—I assisted in conveying the prisoners to the station.</p>

I went with the other officers and saw them go into the room; when they went in, I saw Riley rush out, he got part of the way down the staircase; I took him and brought him back—when I got into the room, I fastened the room door with an iron bolt—there were four iron staples on the post, top, and bottom, and wedges of wood were in the staples, ready to shoot through to fasten the door—I also found two broom handles which might fasten the door, with a notch cut in the floor, and a lock besides—I searched Riley, and found on him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all good—I searched the room, and on the table in this tin saucer I found eleven</p>

               <p>sixpences in a little water, and some silver sand; and by the side of the saucer I found twenty-nine other sixpences, and two files, which had been used recently in filing metal—there was metal on the files, which is on them now—I found a knife covered with plaster of Paris—I found this cylinder on the table, this pair of pliers in the cupboard; I found five bottles contain<lb></lb>ing acid, a small quantity of plaster of Paris, and some silver sand in paper bags.</p>

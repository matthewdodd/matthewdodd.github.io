                  </hi>. I live at Hoxton—on 12th November last, between 10 and 11 o'clock, the prisoner brought me a pony—he said it was his father's property, that he did not want to part with it altogether, but any person who liked to use it for his keep could have it—he asked if I could stable it for that night—he said, "You seem to be a very good master of cattle, you can use it on the same terms"—on the next morning I saw him again, and then he said, "I will sell you this horse"—I said it was not a horse as I should like to purchase—there was a man going by, drawing some sawdust, and I said, "It would do for such a man as that"—he went across the road, and asked the man to buy it—I thought his tale was wrong, and I gave information to the police, and he was taken into custody.</p>

I was sent for to Mr. Gray's, on 13th November—I saw the prisoner there, with a pony—I asked him how the pony came into his possession—he said, "It was left me by my father, at Handlyn, in Dorsetshire"—I asked him how it came there—he said, "By the South Western Railway"—I said I was not satisfied with his statement, and I should charge him with the unlawful possession of the horse—he tried to get away—on the way to the station he said to me, "I may as well tell you the truth, I was going to sell it for a man who was going to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for selling her"—Mr. Wood saw the pony afterwards.</p>

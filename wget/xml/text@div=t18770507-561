                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 4, Limerston Street, Chelsea—on April 18th, I was getting out of an omnibus in Limerston Street, when I met the prisoner, who asked me the way to Gertrude Street—I told him the way and as he passed my house, I asked him if he would come in—he came in and said he would make an appointment for the next day—I had a letter next morning, and after that the prisoner came—he said he would not tell me who he was, but afterwards he said he was Lord Willoughby—I had some flowers in my grate which were rather faded—I said I was going to have them done up by contract—he said "Don't do that, I have a proposal to make to you, I have been keeping a little woman, but have left her three months"—then he said he thought I took his fancy and that he would like me; that he belonged to the Army and Navy Club—I said I knew some one there—he said he knew that—I said "Why?"—he said he would not tell me—he then said he should allow me 10?. a week pin money, and that I should have a pony and carriage, a page and a hack for the park, and that he would pay my debts and buy me dresses—he said he would Bend me some jewellery next day as I had not sufficient to please him, and a watch and chain, four rings, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he took one of my rings for a pattern—he wanted to take other things, but I would not let him—he gave me a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., upon the Bank of London, and wanted change—I gave him 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he also gave me an order to Messrs. Howell and James, for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for dresses, I presented the letter—I did not get the dresses—I saw him next at the police—station—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believed all he said—I was very pleased—I gave him the ring for him to take the size of my finger; I expected a better wedding ring and a diamond keeper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in Newgate-street—on 3rd March, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in King William-street, about 200 yards from the foot of London-bridge, I should think—I was pushing through a crowd, and the prisoner pushed very hard against me—after I had passed through the crowd, I saw my watch-chain hanging down, without my watch—it had been all right five minutes before—the last time I saw it was about half an hour before; I cannot exactly tell—when I observed this I turned round to look for the man who had pushed against me, and saw him going down the street, turning a corner—I followed him gently, and laid hold of his hand, and said, "You have got my watch"—he looked at me for about a minute, put his hand into his pocket, and said, "All right, here it is; don't say anything at all about it"—I said, "Yes, it is all very well for you to say all right, but it won't do for me," and with the aid of a friend, I detained him till a constable came up, and then gave him in custody—the prisoners the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 459). I was on duty in King Wil<lb></lb>liam-street on 3d March, and saw the last witness, and a friend of his, with the prisoner—the prosecutor gave me this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appears to have been broken off at the bow—I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in King William-street on this day, passing through the crowd, when I felt something at my coat pocket; when I had passed through the crowd I put my hand to my pocket, and found a watch there. I stayed for some minutes considering what I should do with it, and thought it would be best take it to the station. I was going, and the prosecutor came up, and said, "You have got my watch." I immediately took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him; he said, "It is broken;" I said, "I don't know anything about that," and he gave me in custody. He can't swear I am the party who stole the watch, and yet I am indicted for stealing.</p>

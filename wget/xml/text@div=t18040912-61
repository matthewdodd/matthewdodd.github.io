             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. At that time I was assistant to Mr. Purse, a pawnbroker; on the 6th of July, the prisoner came with an Officer to pledge this cloak, to pay the expences of the Compter; she was in the Compter the over-night; it was a silk cloak, upon which I advanced her one pound; that is all that I know of it, except when I went up to Lambeth-street, where the prisoner was; I am sure she is the person that pawned the cloak. (The cloak produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been out all night; I came home between four and five o'clock in the morning; as I was going up our street I met an Irish woman coming out of the house with a bundle; she gave me the cloak; as I came through Aldgate the Officers took me to the Compter, and I was taken before my Lord Mayor; the Officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120063"></xptr>told me I must go and pledge the cloak to pay the expences, which was half a guinea; I did not take any of the things, and what was in the bundle I do not know; the Officers stopped me, and asked me where I lived; I had been into Darkhouse-lane, with a person that was going to Gravesend; I never was in the place that night; my mother is a very hard-working woman; the two Officers were in our street, where I met the woman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) Did you ever find your stockings again? - A. No, nor my linen.</p>

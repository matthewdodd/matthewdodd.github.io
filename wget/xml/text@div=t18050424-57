               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner; did he lodge at your house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When did this happen? - A. Sunday, the seventh of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his way of life? - A. He came to town <rs id="t18050424-57-deflabel326" type="occupation">to learn the art of shoemaking</rs>

               <p>Q. On Sunday, the seventh of April, had you fastened your bed-room door? - A. Yes, I was the last person that was in it; we have our candles in a large box, in that same room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to bed then? - A. No it was before bed time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you fasten the door? - A. Between the hours of seven and eight, then I fastened the door; I had a candle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was hardly dark then? - A. It was very near; I had a candle in my hand; that was not the door that was broke open, there were two doors that went into the room; that one was nailed up which was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the door by which you usually go into the room that was broke open? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that door that was nailed up, so as to see that it was safe? - A. When I went up stairs to fetch the candles, I shut the door and locked it, and I saw after that all was safe myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in his lodgings at that time? - A. He was in the tap-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the bed-room door open? - A. About eight o'clock, or some time after, the prisoner asked me for a candle to go to bed, and went up stairs; between that and nine he came down again, and brought the candle down in his hand, and said to a lodger of mine he would go and see Mr. Staggs, meaning the man who was learning him to make shoes; he went out and stopped till between ten and eleven; he returned with Staggs and another man, and had two shillings worth of gin and water; then Staggs said he would go home and go to bed, and get up early in the morning; he had some work to finish to go home to shop; the prisoner said he would take a walk with him; I persuaded him not to go out any more that night, if he did, he would be locked out; Staggs said he thought he had better go to bed; with that I reached a candle off the table and the prisoner and I went up stairs together; Staggs went away, and the other man; I and the prisoner went up to bed; I staid in his room till he went to bed; when he had nearly undressed himself, he unlocked his box, he shoved down a canvass bag, with a quantity of penny-pieces and new halfpence, which gave me suspicion that he had done something that he ought not to have done; going down stairs I saw my room door broke open that was nailed up; I went down to the bar, and got the key of the door, by which we used to go into the room; and when I went in I missed my tea-chest off the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the tea-chest placed there? - A. On the table in the bed-room; I went down stairs on missing it, and asked Mrs. Tillett if she had moved it; she said, no; I then went into the adjoining room, and there I saw most part of the tea-chest, it was broke open; I found some in one place and some in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lid broken off? - A. Yes, it was broken into pieces very much; I went into the adjoining room up two pair of stairs, adjoining to where he slept, and there I found the prisoner's knife and one part of the tea-chest, and a small old chopper</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's knife? - A. I really believe it to be so, for I saw that one, or one like that, in his possession, on Sunday morning; I then went down stairs, and said to Mrs. Tillett, I will go to Lambeth-street, and fetch an officer; she said, pray do not go out now, you had better stop, and let the watchman go; I called the watchman in, and asked him if he could take the man up; he said he could, as well as any officer in England, and I gave the prisoner in charge of the watchman; when he got up, I said to him, what do you do with that nightcap; he pulled it off, and threw it between the head of his bed and his box; we took him to the watch-house and searched him, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned and came back with the watchman to the room; how long were you absent from the room? - A. I look upon it about half an hour; we searched the box first, and found eleven shillings and nine pence in penny-pieces and new halfpence, in a canvass bag; then I picked up the night-cap, and in the night-cap we found a 5 l. note, a 2 l. note, and six 1 l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of these notes? - A. Two of them, the five and one of the ones, by the names that were on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240047"></xptr>Q. Do you know how many notes there were in this tea-chest? - A. I cannot take upon me to say how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of this tea-chest; who put them in? - A. Sometimes I put them in, and sometimes Mrs. Tillett, just as it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever any opportunity of seeing you open that tea-chest and take a note out? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you took him? - A. Yes, he asked me what was the matter, and where he was going; I said you will not go far; he said, if I am to stay out all night, I'll put my gaiters on. On the Monday morning the prisoner sent to me at the watch-house; I had not an opportunity of going to the watch-house; I went to the office in Lambeth-street, and saw him in the lock-up room; he there begged of me very much to send him to sea; said that it was the first offence that ever he had committed, and he hoped I would forgive him; I told him that I had given him up into the hands of justice, and I could not think of doing any such a thing. I then asked him what he had done with the remaining part of the notes in the chest; he said, how many have you got; I said, I have only got thirteen pounds; he said, if I was to die, there were no more than fourteen pounds at the time I broke it open, and one I changed at Mr. Miller's; I asked him what notes there were in the chest; he told me there was a five, a two, and seven ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know I went up stairs with one of the lodgers; you have said I went up to bed? - A. You were gone near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I went up stairs to light Mr. Maynard to bed, he being drunk; I was not above a quarter of an hour up; the night-cap was not mine? - A. I can take an oath that it was on your head.</p>
               <p>Q. You have taken an oath of it, therefore I cannot help myself.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found there? - A. Six one pound notes, a two pound, and a five pound note; I saw him pull off the night-cap, and throw it on the ground, and it laid on the same spot where he threw it, when Mr. Tillett took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny the night-cap; it was not mine; it is very hard that I am to be accused of these things; there are other lodgers in the house</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Campbell.) Was this night-cap picked up before you went to the watch-house or after? - A. After.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should be more satisfied about it if they had examined me before I went out of the room; the next day they said they found the notes in my night-cap; it was not my night-cap.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Were there other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes, there was one lodger, who was asleep when I took the prisoner, and when I came back I awoke him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tallow-melter, in partnership with Thomas Cuthbert, of 43, Paternoster-row. In consequence of something, on 16th April, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I went out of a small door in my house on to the loft, without any one seeing me—I looked through a hole cut in the floor, and saw Lewis talking to a man outside—I heard the words, "Have you got it? all right, is it?"—other words passed, I do not know what, and Lewis closed the door with a sack in his hand, which he immediately began filling with large pieces of suet—there was 500 or 600 stone of fat on the floor—when he had nearly filled it, I rushed down and collared him—he made some explanation—I locked him up in a room, and said, "You must be quiet there, because I expect to catch some more of the men, and I don't want them to know you are in custody"—he said Rogers asked him, the</p>

               <p>afternoon before, if he would do a bit of work, and asked him to meet him at half-past six, and take the sack, and put the fat in—I put the sack on one side—I could not see who the man outside was—I afterwards went with an officer to Rogers's lodging—he turned very pale, and said, "Forgive me, you will not harm me master, will you?"—he had been in my employ sixteen or seventeen years, but was away two years as a policeman—Lewis had only been there a day or two—I told Rogers I had Lewis in custody—his wife said he had brought the sack to fetch some waste straw—he said yes, and he was not the only man who had been robbing me—there was no straw on the premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 16). I went with Mr. Cuthbert to 3, Pleasant-place, and saw Rogers—I believe he got off the bed—he was dressed—he said to Mr. Cuthbert, "Forgive me sir, you won't harm me, will you sir, I have never been on your premises to-day?"—Mr. Cuthbert said, "I know you have not, but you threw up an empty sack"—he said, "I took the sack for some chopped straw"—I found in a box 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—he said, "I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left the rail"—I took him, and then went and took Lewis.</p>

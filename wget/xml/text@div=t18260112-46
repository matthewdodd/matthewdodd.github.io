The prisoner was six years in my service. On the 29th of December I missed several watches and cases - I desired him to go up stairs with me, and look over the goods, and on looking them over I missed several watches and cases. I desired him to put down on a paper the number of the watches and cases that were missing - he did so, and I then told him that I felt rather distrustful at losing my property, and requested him to find where they were, or make them good; he said it was possible they might be in the hands of some of the work people - he then left the premises to look for them - he returned in the afternoon, and said he still suspected they must be in the hands of the work people; I said I should not be satisfied till the property was found, nor would I suffer him to sit down till it was found; he left my employ for that day, and returned about the middle of the next day; I went up stairs with him, and told him he must know where the property lay - he said he did not, and went down stairs towards the work-shop - I followed him down, and told him unless the property was found he should not work for me, and he left me. I went to Hatton-garden, and took out a search-warrant, next morning(Saturday) - I proceeded, with Read and Lloyd, to his apartments, in Charlotte-terrace, New-cut, Lambeth, and saw him there; I questioned him, in the presence of the officers, respecting the property - he then admitted that he had pawned it; Read requested him not to say any thing, except it was voluntary. A piece of paper was then handed to him, and he wrote down the names of different pawnbrokers where the property was, but said he had destroyed the duplicates - we searched him, and found upon him the list which he had written for me the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Has he not since shewn great contrition, and been the means of your discovering more property than you missed? A. I have not seen him since to say whether he is contrite. I had seen all this property at different times - it may have been taken peace-meal.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Ramsay, a pawnbroker, of Liquorpond-street. I have known the prisoner some time. On the 11th of October he pawned a silver watch, for 30s - I suppose it is worth 2l. in the trade. On the 10th of November he pawned another, for 30s. - that is worth 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In your judgment neither of them would fetch more than 40s.? A. They would not fetch me more - we sell them by auction. I would sell such a one for 39s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. One is an engine-turned watch? A. I question whether that would fetch more.</p>
               <p>MR. KEAT. This engine-turned watch is mine - it is a double bottomed hunting watch, capped - it cost me 3l. to manufacture; the other is a jewelled double bottomed hunter, and cost me about 3l. 10s.</p>

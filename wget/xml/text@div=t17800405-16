               <p>On the 1st of March, about nine at night, I took a coach at the Horse-guards; when I came into the Minories, I stopped the coach and asked the coachman where he lived? He said in Oxford-road. As I was going a great way farther, I discharged that coach and took another. The postman was then going about; it was about half after nine. I directed the second coachman to drive me to <placeName id="t17800405-16-crimeloc77">Stepney Cause-way</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800405-16-crimeloc77" type="placeName" value="Stepney Cause-way"></interp>

The glass on my side was half down; the glass on the lady's side was quite up. The prisoner came to the door, clapped in a cutlass and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the prisoner? - I could see his features, it was as fine a night as ever was without a moon.</p>
               <p>He opened the coach door? - Yes, both the doors were opened. There was a man on the other side. They had both cutlasses, and they both put them into the coach, and the points of the cutlasses crossed each other in the coach. The prisoner demanded my money and watch; I told him I had not a single guinea about me, I had some silver which he should have if he would not frighten the lady. He said I had a watch; I told him I had not, being desirous to save my property. When he had taken the silver he put his hand across my thighs and felt my watch, and said he must have it, upon which I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050023"></xptr>What silver did you loose? - Eight sixpences and three shillings, my watch was a gold one with a single case and gold dial-plate, there was to it a cornelian seal set in gold, which had my cypher upon it. It wanted then about ten minutes of ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the man? - I am quite certain of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch or seals again? - Never. I advertised them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was on the 1st of March, about ten at night? - Yes; it wanted about seven minutes I believe. I had some company at my house playing at cards. When I went in I asked the time, and no gentleman was after ten.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the robbery before the prisoner was taken up? - The next morning as I was coming to London I heard that two of the people who had robbed the Blackwall stage were taken that morning. I went to the Rotation-office, and I heard there the prisoner was in New Prisoner. I went to New Prison and saw him in bed, all in a gore of blood.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with him? - Not above five minutes; I asked him if he was the party who robbed me; he said he was not. I said, if you are, you know what passed about the watch; it is a family watch, and if you will let me have it I will give you what you think is the value of it.</p>
               <p>Did you express any doubt about his being the man? - No. When he was before the magistrates, I said, that is the man who robbed me. He appears now in his third disguise; all that hair behind is false, it is not his own hair, his own hair was very short and strait, there was not a crooked hair in his head. He appeared in the same dress when he was examined which he had on when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Mention his dress? - He had a pea-green coat and waistcoat shot with yellow, a hat, and a surtout coat.</p>
               <p>What colour was his surtout coat? - It was dark. I cannot say what colour it was. He never put a mask on till after he robbed me. When I talked to him about the watch, he pulled out a piece of black tin and put it over his nose, which altered his voice entirely, and made him squeak like Punch in a puppet-show.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 2d of March at about three o'clock in the morning, a man came and said he saw three persons upon the Green whom he suspected to be thieves. I sent the watchman down the footpath of the green, and went down the road myself. I saw two men; I went towards them. I presented a pistol and bid them stop, or I would blow their brains out; they got off. About a quarter of an hour after a watchman came to me and informed me that he had stopped a man, and desired I would come to assist them. I went up to him. I found the prisoner lying on his back almost suffocated; he had fallen over a post, and was bleeding very much; I thought he would have died. I found the screw of a pistol, which I heard drop from him when we took him up. He was carried on three men's shoulders to the watch-house. One of the men went by my desire to examine the place where he fell and found this pistol (producing a small pocket pistol) I felt a flint and steel in his pocket; it dropped out by the way, and was picked up.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. What had I on at the time I was taken?</p>
               <p>Glenton. A cocked up hat, high in the brim, a blue great coat, his under clothes were almost new; something of a new mixture, yellow, and rather darker than this; the breeches were torn, by the fall I apprehend.</p>
               <p>Were the waistcoat and breeches the same? - Yes. There was some gun-powder twisted up in a paper under him, at the time we took him. He had a gold mourning ring on his finger.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I took the prisoner by Mr. Bower's barn; he seemed to be very much in a sweat.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing the matter with him? - There did not seem to be any thing the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050024"></xptr>matter more than he was in a sweat when I gave chase to him.</p>
               <p>You pursued him did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he fall in your pursuit? - As I was running after him, he tumbled over two posts.</p>
               <p>Did he hurt himself at all? - He seemed to bleed.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure whether he bled or no? - He bled pretty much when he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You took him afterwards? - Yes. Mr. Glenton came to me. I found a flint and steel upon him. These are them. I gave them to Mr. Glenton.</p>
               <p>What else did you find on him? - Nothing else but the key of a pistol, it tumbled out of his pocket as we were raising him on his backside.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it came from him? - It was found where he lay.</p>
               <p>Did you find out what he fell against that wounded him so? - I cannot find any thing but the posts.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the pistol came from? - I found it where he fell.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - About a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - No.</p>
               <p>Had it powder in it or nothing in it? - I cannot say, there was a little priming in the pan.</p>
               <p>Did you try whether it was loaded? - It was snapped.</p>
               <p>Did it flash in the pan? - No, we put the priming out before we snapped it.</p>
               <p>Glenton. The key is marked No. 6, the same as the pistol.</p>
               <p>To Thornhillow. Do you remember how this man was dressed? - When I took him he had on a blue surtout coat, and an olive coloured coat, waistcoat, and breeches.</p>
               <p>Do you know what an olive colour is? - Like the colour of that gentleman's clothes (pointing to a gentleman.)</p>
               <p>Coat, waistcoat and breeches the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his hair? - He had short black hair</p>
               <p>How far did his hair come down? - About to the collar of his coat behind.</p>
               <p>How far did it reach forwards? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did his hair curl or was it strait? - It seemed to me very strait.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of March, a little before three in the morning, an officer belonging to the excise came and gave us information that he saw three men lurking about Stepney fields, as he was going to a brewhouse. He said they were upon Stepney Green. Glenton went out and came back and said he could see nobody. He ordered me to take the foot-way, and he went the way the carriages go. When I had got thirty or forty yards down, I met three men; one of them drew back, and made a blow at me and just grazed my stock.</p>
               <p>With what did he strike at you? - With a hanger, by what I could see, it is not here. I had a hanger by my side, I drew it and chopped at him again; then the other two took towards the road; I pursued them as fast as I could, and they turned towards the watch-house. There are three houses, the watch-house is in the centre. These hangers (producing two) were found next door to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Is the man who found them here? - No. Then they turned round, the other turning to run back down the Green, there they overtook Glenton.</p>
               <p>How long after they turned down by the watch-house was it that the man brought the cutlasses to you? - When I came back to the watch-house he had brought one of them there. I was just at his heels when he picked up the other. This chissel (producing it) was picked up just where the man made a stroke at me.</p>
               <p>Glenton. I found it where Wilson said they stopped, which is about forty yards from the Green.</p>
               <p>Wilson. That is between the place where I stopped them and the place they ran down.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he when he was taken? - I was not present when he was taken, I saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Were either of you present when Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050025"></xptr>Richards came to him, when he was in bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you search the prisoner? - The officer did, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was any money found? - As we were bringing him along, when he began to speak, I asked him if he had any money about him? He told me he had no money; as we were carrying him along the money jolted out of his pocket. I desired the men to pick it up. I picked up two half-crown pieces, which I returned him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. What sort of a night was it? - It was very light, I could see him very well.</p>
               <p>What time was he carried to prison, the next day? - We had him before the magistrate about eight o'clock in the morning, he being ill, the magistrate suffered him to sit down in a chair; and he stayed there for examination till about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was Richards before the magistrate the first day? - No; the prisoner was committed for further examination.</p>

One of them stopped the horses, another laid hold of the bridle; upon which the horse began kicking; and they broke the reins all to pieces. I got down and tied the horse to the pole. They asked me what I got down for. I said, don't you see what a condition I am in? When I had tied the horses I got up upon the box again; one of them opened one door and another the other. I could not see what kind of people they were, nor any thing about them; I had enough to do with the horse, it kicked in such a manner.</p>
               <p>One opened one door and the other the other door? - Yes; and one stood in the pathway with a cutlass in his hand; it was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether they who opened the door had any thing in their hands? - I did not see nor hear any thing, only the gentleman said something about his watch.</p>

            , the woman I work with, who is a millener.</p>
               <p>For how long have you seen him come backwards and forwards there? - About half a year; Mrs. Hancock is his acquaintance; he is no acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - The 1st of March, St. David's day; I am a Welch woman, that makes me particularly remember it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he stayed there till past ten? - Yes; just as the watch came past the door after ten the young man went out; we went out of the court together, and then he departed.</p>
               <p>Had he often before that stayed as late there? - I did not take particular notice; he might or might not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner a great many years. I had not seen him of late for four or five years. On the 1st of March I called in at Mrs. Hancock's, and saw him there; it was between nine and ten o'clock when I called in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - I did not stay long. He said he would call at my house and see me that evening. I left him at the end of Mrs. Hancock's court; he said he had some business to do at Cree-church.</p>
               <p>Are you a Welch woman? - No, an English woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050026"></xptr>How come you to recollect the day? - I had been out about business that afternoon, and saw the Taffies coming along, that made me recollect the day.</p>
               <p>What time did you see the Taffies going along? - In the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who else was there? - This young woman and another.</p>
               <p>There was no other man there? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Richards. Was you before the justice at his second examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing about being at another place? - No; he was asked where he was? he would not say where he had been that night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was asked where he was that night? - Yes. I am positive he was by three of the magistrates out of the five.</p>
               <p>Glenton. I am sure of it, that he said he was at Bow.</p>
               <p>Richards. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>How long was the examination after he was taken? - He was taken on the Thursday, and examined on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Was he asked where he was the first time? - Yes; he said he was at the Three Cups at Bow. A messenger was sent down to the Three Cups to know if such a person had been there. I do not know what answer the messenger brought.</p>
               <p>How far is Leadenhall-street from Bow? - I suppose, as near as I can tell, it is three miles and upwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I left Mrs. Hancock's it was past ten o'clock. I went to see a person I met with to the stage in Whitechapel, and then went to Bow.</p>
               <p>A WATCHMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was crying the hour of ten on the 1st of March, I saw three men go towards Bow. I am sure the prisoner is one of them I looked after them and observed him particularly.</p>
               <p>Richards. They made immediately towards Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Richards came to me to the prison and asked me, if I was the man that robbed him, and if I had his watch? I said I was not the man that did the robbery. He said, he was sorry I was in gaol on his account; that I was not the man that robbed him; he told several in the gaol that I was not the man that robbed him, and gave me a shilling to drink; he went between the gates and told the turnkey that I was not the man that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Richards. When I saw him he was in a dreadful condition; there was a great deal of clotted blood; it shocked me; I did not think he could live. I could not bear to see a man in that condition; I gave him a shilling to get him some wine and water to wash his throat. When I came out the turnkey asked me if I could swear to the man? I said, I could not, as he lay in that condition, one man put the question to me, and I said, I did not know him in bed.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I asked you if you did not tell the gaolor you did not know him? you said you did not.</p>
               <p>Was his face washed as he lay in the bed? - Yes, he was like a corpse, only the blood was about his mouth.</p>
               <p>The coachman says it was a dark night; you say it was a light night; was it a dark night or a light night? - It was as light a night as ever I saw in my life, the moon excepted, there was not a cloud.</p>
               <p>To Long. You say a third man stood in the road with a hanger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was he from the coach? - He was about a yard and a half from me.</p>
               <p>You could see he had a hanger in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a scabbard on it? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Counsel to Richards. You was saying something just now about his putting on a mask? - It was something black; he took it out of his left hand pocket; it made him squeak like punch in a puppet-show. I described his hands, before I saw him, before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>You did not see his hands when he was in bed? - They were covered over.</p>
               <p>- HUMPAGE sworn.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor came in the morning to the prison and asked, if there was not a person brought in who was not very well? I said there was. He asked if he might see him? I said he might. I desired one of the prisoners to shew him. He went up to the prisoner, but what was said I cannot tell;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050027"></xptr>when he came down he asked me what I would drink? I said any thing he chose; he ordered some red wine negus. He said he had seen the prisoner; but he did not believe that he was the person that robbed him, or was any thing like him; he said he was a much stouter man, and he did not appear to be like him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went up on the Monday for an examination; Mr. Richards was present. He said the night was so dark he could not swear to me, but he had his daughter in the coach who could swear to me, and he would bring her on the Friday. On the Friday he said his daughter could not swear to me, and he swore to me himself.</p>
               <p>Richards. I never said any such thing; she was on the other side of the coach, she never turned her head, and knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was by when you first said you knew the prisoner? - Every one of the magistrates, and I believe Glenton was present.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Was you there when the prisoner was brought up to be examined? - I was. I heard Mr. Richards say, if ever I saw a man in my life that is the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Did he swear to him the second time? - No; that was the third time; he did not swear to him till the third time.</p>
               <p>Richards. My motive for not swearing to him was they had two in hold, we were in hopes of getting a king's evidence, and to have knocked up the gang, that was my motive; I told the magistrates that was my motive why I would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrates you had seen him in gaol? - Yes, I told them in the circumstances I then saw him, covered in bed, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>To Glenton. Did the prosecutor tell you at the second examination that he could swear to him? - After he was taken away, he told the magistrates that he could swear to him by his hands, his hair, his voice, and several circumstances.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were five windows in the room where I was in the prison, and it was twelve o'clock, and the windows were all open.</p>
               <p>Richards. The inside window shutters were all shut, only one half open, the person that went up with me laid hold of a pully and opened another window.</p>
               <p>Humpage. There is no pully in the place.</p>

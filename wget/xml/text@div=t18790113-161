                  </hi>. I live at 42, King Henry's Walk, Islington, and am of no occupation—on 26th December, between 6 and 7 p.m., I was in Mildmay Road, Islington, and met the prisoner and three men—the prisoner made some remark to one of the men as I passed—I did not hear what it was, but I was immediately seized by the neek by two of the men, and held by the throat, and the prisoner caught me by my beard with one hand and com<lb></lb>menced rifling my left trousers pocket, where I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she tore the pocket out and took two out of four onions which I had in my right trousers pocket, while the other men held my hands behind me—when the prisoner had got the money, the first man let go of my throat and struck me two severe blows on my eye and head, which stunned me—the other man did not strike me—one of the blows knocked me down—the three men ran away, and the prisoner ran a little way; I got up and overtook her, caught hold of her round her shoulders, and she forced her hand in here and caught me by my private parts; the pain quite overpowered me and I was obliged to let her go—she afterwards came back and held me by that part again for some time—a young man came up and tried to get her away from me, but could not; he then gave her a blow and threw her, and I fell with her—he separated her from me and accompanied me to my house—I could only walk with assistance—I saw the prisoner at the Dalston Police-station in custody about two hours afterwards—she was not with other persons, but I could have identified her from 1,000—I had never seen her before—I have no recollection that she demanded any money, I was in such pain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 65, Stanley Road, Ball's Pond Road, Islington—on 26th December, about 7 p.m., I saw a mob collected in Mildmay Road, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner wrestling together; she had his pocket in one hand and his beard in the other hand—his pocket was not severed from his trousers, but it was turned inside out—she swore that if he did not give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she would choke him—she could not strike him because she had him with both hands—I tried to pull her away and could not, and caught hold of her and threw them both in the road, and pulled the man up and assisted him home—he seemed very weak indeed, I had to give him an arm—a crowd stood looking on all the while—' he appeared in pain—I went to the station and described the prisoner—I am sure she is the person.</p>

               <p>December Bletchley came to the Dalston station with Mr. Sims's wife, and described a woman, in consequence of which I arrested the prisoner in Dalston Lane, three quarters of an hour afterwards—that is about ten minutes' walk from Mildmay Road—both places are in my province—I had seen the prisoner about 6.45 that evening with two young fellows near Peacock's, the tobacconist's, and noticed that she had mud on her back, as if she had been down—the roads were very muddy—the two men near her, and another who was near at hand, belong to a gang which she frequents, but I have not seen them with the two men who were with her when I saw her before to my knowledge—I was in plain clothes—I charged her with robbing a man, she said "I have not robbed you, have I?"—nothing was found on her but a small militia purse.</p>

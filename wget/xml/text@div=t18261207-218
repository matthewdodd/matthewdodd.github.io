On the 3d of November I went to the Red-Lion inn yard, Whitechapel, with Taylor and Finlay, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - we went to the rooms No. 3, in the corner of that yard - the rooms open on a gallery, and we pass Nos. 1 and 2, to go to No. 3 - Mr. Lewis came immediately after we got there; we found these survey books in No. 3 - some of them are dated 1822, and some 1823, and these we found in No. 1 - we found these keys and some covers in No. 3 - the key unlocks a closet at the foot of the stairs, at the Excise-office, where the prisoner's articles were kept; some covers belonging to these books were found in the office of the Comptroller of cash.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was kept in the closet? A. There was some brown paper, a salt-ledger, and a survey-book - I do not recollect seeing any brushes or brooms there - he was allowed the key of it, and there he kept his paper to light his fire - I believe he has nine children - a daughter of his was taken up, but discharged.</p>

I went to the prisoner's room - there were some surveybooks and papers of 1822 and 1823 - there were some permits and covers in No. 1, of 1821, 1822, and 1823; Mr. Powell produced the books, which corresponded with these covers - there was a beer book for 1822. On Saturday, the 4th of November, I opened the cupboard, at the bottom of the stairs, in company with Foster and one of the messengers - we found this salt ledger of 1821, but it was not cut in the manner books are when they are sold - there were some tea books in a drawer, and some brown paper for lighting fires; some of the papers were strewed about the rooms, and some locked up.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. I am first clerk in the Store-keeper's office. I went to the rooms No. 1, and No. 3. and I afterwards saw some books produced by Mr. Powell, which tallied with some books found there; I have known the prisoner ten years, and he has an honest character.</p>

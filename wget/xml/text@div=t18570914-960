               <p>Aug. I was on duty in Endell Street, Drury Lane, about half past 2 o'clock in the day—while there I observed a boy running, followed by some other boys; they came out of a court there—I caught hold of the first boy, who was being pursued; that was to keep the other boys away from him—he went into a fit, and I proceeded with him to the workhouse—as I went, the prisoner followed me from the court, with a number of other girls—the prisoner pushed me, and my hat fell off in consequence—I was turning round to save my hat, and touched the prisoner in the face—I did it as I was swinging myself round to catch my hat; it was with my open hand—she said she would have my b—life for that—there was another con<lb></lb>stable near, and I told him to turn her back—he took her away—I went on to the workhouse with the boy, and left him there—I returned to my beat in Endell Street about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and met the prisoner at the corner of Short's Gardens and Endell Street—she came over to me from the other aide of Endell Street, and asked me whether I had taken the boy to the workhouse—I told her I had done so—she called me a <hi rend="italic">lagging sod</hi>, and said, "I suppose you would like to have <hi rend="italic">lagged him</hi>, like you have a good many others"—I told her to go away, that I wanted nothing to say to her—I put my hand on her shoulder, and told her to go—that was all—at the same moment I dropped my glove on the ground, and, as I stooped to pick it up, the prisoner said, "I have been home for something that will do for you," and I felt myself stabbed in the back, of the head, on the right side—I felt very weak, but tried to recover myself and, on getting up into an erect position, she stabbed me again in the neck, on the right side; she then stabbed at me again through the collar; it went through both my stock and the collar of my coat, and penetrated my neck slightly—she then tried to stab me in the stomach, at the same time she cut my browsers in three places about the waist, but did not touch my flesh—she then said, "If I can't have your life, I will put your b—eye out," and at the same time she struck at me with the knife; it cut me on the cheek—I caught her hand as it came at my eye, and brought it on my cheek bone—at that time I was very faint from loss of blood—I called out, "For God's sake, take the knife," and fainted—a person named Buckfield came up, and secured her, and another constable came up, and assisted—I was taken to the hospital, and had, my wounds dressed—I was five days in the hospital, and am still an out patient—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist's colurman, and live in Ossulton Street, Somers Town. I was passing down Endell Street, on 19th Aug., about 3 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and the constable struggling together; I saw the prisoner raise her hand and strike the constable in the face with some sharp instrument—I only saw her strike him once, it was under the cheek bone—I was on the other side of the way—I ran across</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140070"></xptr>
               <p>and seized her hand with the knife in it—she threatened to serve me the same—the constable was bleeding very much indeed from several wounds—I did not succeed in getting the knife away from the prisoner, she held it firmly; another constable came up and struck her over the knuckles, and then she dropped the knife on the pavement; he could not get it from her without—she said she could only be hung for it—I assisted in taking her to the station; the constable was taken to the hospital, he was in a very exhausted state—I firmly believe the prisoner was sober, she was excited.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 95). On the afternoon in question, I saw the prisoner struggling with Gymer—I went to his assistance after Buckfield had gone up and laid hold of the prisoner's hand; I saw this knife in her hand, it is a common penknife, the larger blade was open, she held the handle tightly clenched in her hand—I directly knocked it out of her hand with my staff; I took her to the station—she was sober, the officer was bleeding very much indeed; blood was flowing out from the back part of his head, and blood was creeping down from underneath the left eye; he was much exhausted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital when Gymer was brought there—he was in a state of collapse from loss of blood—I examined him, and found a punctured wound at the side of the neck, at the angle of the jaw; another wound on the same side of the neck, lower down; but that was comparatively slight—he had also a punctured wound at the back part of the head, on the same side; he was bleeding from that wound when he was brought in—he had another punctured wound on the left cheek, just below the eye, that was not of any depth, it went on the bone—he was under my care for a considerable time, he was five days in the hospital, and continued as an out patient afterwards—the wounds were of that character that dangerous results might follow; a small artery was divided at the back part of the head, no large artery was cut—the wound at the angle of jaw was near the carotid artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say that dangerous results might follow, do you mean inflammation or erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the depth of the deepest wound was from an inch to an inch and a half; it would require considerable force to inflict that; the instrument was blunt, it would produce the wounds—it would require considerable force to puncture the neck through the coat and stock.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 233 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). On 20th March, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in High Street, Stratford, near the Bird-in-Hand public house, and saw the prisoner and another man, and a woman, who was discharged before the Magistrate, standing near the prosecutor's house—the two men went up the street, the contrary way, and the woman stood still to watch me—I went on a little way down the street to see another constable, Elliott; I told him something, went back again, and we heard a whistle—we came up the street behind a wagon, that we should not be seen, and when we got within a few yards of Mr. Tarrant's house they were all three together, coming to meet us—Cook, the man who got away, was carrying something, which afterwards turned oat to be sheet lead—the pri<lb></lb>soner tried to screen him from our view—he put his hands under his coat and walked in this way, so that we should not see what Cook had got—I said to the constable, "It is all right, they have got something"—Harries ran away, and Elliott after him—the man with the lead was too powerful for me—he kicked me on the knee and on the thumb—the lead fell from his jacket, and he got away—we went to the station with the woman and the lead—I then went to Mr. Tarrant's, and found that some lead had been re<lb></lb>moved from the top of the door porch, the lead fitted the place exactly; it was* safe at 10 o'clock, when I went on duty.</p>

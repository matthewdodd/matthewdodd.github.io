                  </hi>. I keep a boarding house, at No. 105, Upper East Smithfield. The prisoner lodged at my house three weeks before this transaction—he slept there on the night of 18th Aug.—he did not pay me for the lodging on the 19th, but presented to me this seaman's advance note for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he had got a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Providence,</hi> and asked if I would cash the note—I said, "Yes," and then looked at it, and told him that I did not think it was genuine, and then one of the boarders looked at it, and said that it was not genuine—I took it from the boarder's hands—the prisoner said that he got the note from Limehouse shipping office, from a gentleman up stairs.</p>

I am manager of the shipping office at Limehouse Captain Brown is the head shipping master, and Mr. Dunbar is the chair<lb></lb>man of the board—we never issue advance notes at all, they are done away with by Act of Parliament—the prisoner never received this note there—the business is conducted by Captain Brown and two clerks, and myself and another manager—I pay the seamen's wages; advance notes used to be paid at one time, but not such as this—captains give the men a bond still but we have nothing to do with that, we pay them in cash when the ship arrives—we never pay advance wages now, and there was no such ship as the <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi> in our office at that time—I have a copy from the books—I am only the manager—all I know of it is what I have heard.</p>

               <p>"Very well"—I said that he must go with me to the station—he said, "Very well," and went with me quietly—when at the station, the inspector asked him where he got it from; he said, "From the Limehouse shipping office"—at the police office he said first that he received it at the shipping office, and afterwards he said that a lad came after him, and asked him if his name was M'Culloch, he said, "Yes," and he said, "I have a note for you which I brought from the captain," and asked him if he had got any half-pence in his pocket; he had got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave it to him—there was no ship called the <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi> in the port of London, or such a person as James Spratt—I tried to and Todd, a ship's chandler, but no such person was known.</p>

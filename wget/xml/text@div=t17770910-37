               <p>I work with the prosecutor: on the 26th July, which was the last execution-day, we both went out of the shop to see the execution; I staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then returned, and went into a house from which we ascend by a ladder to the shop; I went on the top of the house to see the criminals pass, and I saw the prisoner go up the ladder into the shop; I went down, and when I came to the shop I found the prisoner with a green cloth spread on the bench, and the prosecutor's coat and three saws in it; I imagine he brought the green cloth, it was not in the shop before; as I was going up the ladder he was going to put something else in, but I made haste and secured him; I asked him what business he had there; he paused a bit, and then said, he came to enquire for some man, and mentioned a name I don't remember; I called to a person going by to assist me, and he was sent to prison.</p>

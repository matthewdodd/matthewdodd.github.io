            . I am agent to Mr. Richard Bury, and carry on business, on his account, in King-street, Cheapside. I had several transactions with the prisoner, as one of the firm of Bakewell and Co.: it was agreed that he should give me the acceptances of respectable parties. On the 30th of November I received a bill for 40 l. inclosed in a note which I believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

            . This letter is the prisoner's writing, and so is the endorsement</p>

               <p>"R. Wilson and Co."</p>
               <p>MR. HAYNES. Before the bill became due I asked the prisoner who Wilson was - he said he was the merchant and shipper of the hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were satisfied with Rawlings' acceptance, having had it before? A. I never had Rawlings' acceptance - it was Oakley's, payable at Rawlings'.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had you more orders from him after you received the bill; but before it became due? A. Yes; perhaps to the amount of 100 l.; there was a running account; the bill was not given for any particular goods - Rawlings has acknowledged it to be his acceptance.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read from the prisoner, dated the 22d of November, containing an order for goods, and promising to forward a bill, drawn by the shipper, on Rawlings.</p>

            . I let the prisoner a house in the Commercial-road. A person named Wilson came to pay the rent about the 29th of October; he presented me with an account of some goods I had bought, which he deducted from the rent, and gave me a receipt, which I produce - I saw him write it on my table. I do not believe the endorsement on this bill to be the writing of that R. Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You never saw him write but once? A. No, I cannot say whether he wrote better at one time than another, but I should think the character of the writing would be the same.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Does the endorsement appear to be the same character of hand-writing? A. It does not; my account was only 1 l. 16 s.; he only wrote</p>
               <p>"Received cash, Robert Wilson."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often has this bill been shewn to you to compare with the receipt? A. Only once; it struck me immediately that it was not his writing; but I compared it, as I had the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had not seen the receipt after he gave it to you, do you think you could have such a recollection of his writing as to say it was not his writing? A. I do know that I could; the bill is so different from the receipt that it struck me immediately that it was not his.</p>

            . I am landlord of a house at Brentford. A man named R. Wilson was a tenant of mine: I do not know whether he was connected with the prisoner; I once saw him write a receipt, about a month ago; I do not believe the handwriting of the drawer and endorser of this bill to be his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him once, after this bill was due, write a hand which you think not like that on the bill? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner entered into the same line of defence as on the former trial; and declared, that Wilson was the drawer and acceptor of the bill; and had paid it to him in the regular course of trade.</p>

            . In November last the prisoner gave me a bill for 40 l., to take to Wilson to sign and endorse. I believe the bill produced to be the same; I gave the bill to Thomas Oakley, on the 30th of November, at one o'clock, at the White Hart tavern, Tower-street, for that purpose. I called there in the evening, and he gave it to me, signed and endorsed</p>
               <p>"R. Wilson;" I took it home, and next morning, when I sent some bread to Bakewell and Co., I sent the bill by my son to give to Thompson. I knew Wilson about two years ago; he then lived in Rood-land, as a boot and shoe-maker; I have frequently seen him in Thompson's company, at the White Hart, since this bill was drawn, talking upon business.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you know whether Wilson lived at Brentford? A. He was represented to me as having an establishment there in the boot and shoe line.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When were you at Brentford? A. Not lately; I have been in the habit of seeing him in town; the last time I saw him, was on the 4th or 5th of February; I have continued to go to places where I used to see him, but have not seen him since. He has made me out bills for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070077"></xptr>work done, (looking at the bill). I believe this endorsement and signature to be his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often have you seen him write? A. It might be seven or eight times - I am a baker, and live in North-street, Bethnall-green. I do not know where Wilson is now; he wrote very much like a school-boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this to be his writing, (handing a paper)? A. I cannot be positive - it resembles it - I should think it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, will you venture to swear, that you believe the endorsement on the bill to be his writing? A. I do believe it is - I believe both to be written by the same person; I saw him write last about January, at Union-court, Broad-street: I had no connexion with the firm.</p>

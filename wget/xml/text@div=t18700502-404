               <p>Street, Bermondsey—about eight or nine weeks ago, I missed a pair of sculls from my boat at Irongate Stain—on Friday, 8th April, I saw the prisoner with those sculls—I went to the stairs and stood there, waited for a Thames Police Inspector, and he told me I had better summons the man—I was going up to take the summons out and I altered my mind, and on Tuesday I went and asked if he would give them to me up, and he said he would wring my nose—I gave him in charge—these are the sculls—I am certain they are mine—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> had my name along here in full, about an inch and a quarter wide, and twelve inches in length—that has been planed off—I don't see any marks of the letters—there is also a piece out of the blade, which I broke out when I first had them, and also there was a dark green paint that had not been on another pair of sculls, and they were new when I took them out of my yard—I had them last November—they have been black varnished over the green paint—the maker of the sculls is here—the bolt which I brought from the boat would not go through this hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oar and scull maker, at 96, East Lane, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—this pair of sculls was made in my shop for Mr. Thatcher—I identify them at first sight as my make—I make hundreds like them—I gave them a coat of paint which I don't do generally—it was a common green paint, and there was no lead colour under the green—it is covered with black now, but if you scrape the black you see the green under it—sculls and boats are generally painted with a nice green, worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and this is not worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the name of Thatcher was on the sculls, in full—that has been cut off—it is much thinner there than it was when it was new. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When you make a pair of sculls don't you use the same tool to bore the holes with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yea—I don't take a receipt from persons who buy sculls for ready money—we generally have ready money from watermen—I never painted any other sculls with that green—I have only got two men, and I know what they do—I could not say that they were Thatcher's sculls if I had not seen the green underneath—miny persons have my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H R</hi> 8).

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is a very common thing for one waterman to buy a pair of sculls from another. I bought these of a man at the Tower Stairs, and have been using them ever since. The man come to me and said he had lost a pair of sculls, and he would have a pair, right or wrong, and he made a boast that he could get half a dozen people to say they were his. I told him they did not belong to him, and never did, and I told the policeman just the same. The maker only goes by the green paint, and nineteen boats out of twenty are painted green; it is a common colour. My boat is exactly the same colour as that green. There was no name on them when I had them. I painted these sculls with varnish to keep the water out, and they don't get so heavy. I did not conceal them at all, they were in my boat. I bad plenty of opportunity to make away with them, if they had been stolen—I worked with them all the time.</p>

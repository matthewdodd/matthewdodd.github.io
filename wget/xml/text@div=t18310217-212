            . On Thursday, the 27th of January, at six o'clock in the evening, I saw this cloth safe in our front shop window, which does not open - I missed it about half-past seven; I am certain it was not sold - it was for garments; we seldom sell cloth - it was Shepherd's plaid for making trousers; there were twenty-three yards in one piece, and nine and three-quarters in another - I saw, at Marlborough-street last Friday, thirteen or fourteen yards of one piece, and the other of nine and three-quarters - one piece has a mark where I had cut out a pattern; I found that mark on it precisely the same, and was confident of it being the same cloth - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You have only one partner? A. Only one; I employ nobody in the front shop, but have three apprentices in the workshop - the apprentices and workmen pass through the shop; they leave at eight o'clock - I had gone out about half-past six, and left my people in care of the place; when I came home I found a pane of glass broken or cut, and quite out - it had been cracked the day before by accident; the cloth could be got out there - I discovered it the moment I went into the shop; I was the first to discover it - I found my servants still at work; the shop door cannot be opened outside without a key - I had cut the pattern out myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the space in this cloth appear the same size as the pattern cut out? A. Precisely so - I have not got the pattern to compare.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 3rd of February, about noon, I went with Goddard to No. 9, Fullwood's-rents, and found these two pieces of cloth in a room on the first floor; nobody was in the room - a person who lives in the first floor gave me the key; I left Goddard there. On the following morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I went again with Goddard - the prisoner was not there, and we brought the cloth away; I saw the prisoner that afternoon, at Marlborough-street, in custody - Mr. Benfield did not see the cloth till Friday, the 18th; he brought two patterns, and claimed it - it was two pieces of a different pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who gave you the key at the house? A. Mrs. Davidson - she went up with us, and I think unlocked the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3rd of February I went to Fullwood's-rents, with Ballard; Mrs. Davidson opened the room on the first floor - we found the cloth; I waited there till one o'clock in the morning; the prisoner did not come in - I saw him at the office the afternoon of the next day: Mr. Benfield claimed the cloth - on the Tuesday after the Friday, when the prisoner was brought for re-examination, he was sitting in the clerk's-office, but the examination had not commenced; he stated to me that he had bought the cloth of one or two persons who called at his door in Fullwood's-rents, for 1s. a yard, and he could bring a person forward to prove it; he called it stuff for trousers - there was no other stuff for trousers in his room; no owner had been found then - this cloth was not examined about that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he? A. Sitting on a form in the clerk's-office; I mentioned what I had brought from his lodging when he stated this - Schofield was there, but I do not know whether he heard it.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at his lodging, in the first floor front room, in Fullwood's-rents - he was making inquiry about this cloth at the time I went in - I heard him told that two officers had taken it away; he said he could account for it, as he bought it at the door for 1s. a yard: I took him to the office, and heard him make the statement to Goddard - there were a few waste pieces of cloth and remnants about his room; he did not mention the name of who he bought it of.</p>
               <p>MR. BENFIELD. I am confident this is my cloth; the piece is cut out here - 2s. 2d. a yard is the wholesale price; I never bought any lower - I have not got the pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said one piece had a pattern cut out? A. Yes; that is between thirteen and fourteen yards - I cannot swear to the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a similar cloth to the other in your possession? A. Yes, but have no particular mark on it - it was precisely the same sort and length, nine yards and three-quarters - the other was longer when stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the stuff found in my room of a man who hawks linen about; I was called down by a person who lives in the house, to look at it - as to the gentleman swearing to it by the piece being cut out, I have cut patterns out myself.</p>
               <p>MR. BENFIELD. The pattern hole is precisely the same at this end as I left it - I do not find that any other pattern has been cut; I cannot say to whom I gave the pattern.</p>

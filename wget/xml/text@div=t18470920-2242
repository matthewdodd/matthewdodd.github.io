                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at 9, Princes-street, Union-street. On the 11th of July the prisoner Phoebe came to me, told me she was a cap-maker, and wanted part of a bed—I took her to sleep with me—I took her for a single woman—on the Tuesday before she left on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the prisoner William came—they had an interview—they did not say what relationship there was between them, they both break fasted with me that morning—I went out between twelve and one o'clock, leaving them in my room, and nobody in the house but a little girl twelve years old—I was away three quarters of an hour or an hour, came back, and found the prisoners had just dined—they left between seven and eight o'clock, leaving no one in the house but me—he said to her, "Now, my dear, shall I take your box;" he went away taking her box—two hours afterwards I went to my drawers, I found them locked as I had left them, and missed my money which had been in a little brown bag—nobody else had been in the house—I did not see the prisoners again till they were in custody—I had given her warning—I never saw bag or money again—there was nearly 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it.</p>

               <p>I am footman to Mr. Dickinson: I was standing behind the coach at the time the robbery was committed; a man came on the left hand with a crape over his face; he called three times, Stop, coachman; there was another on the road with a crape over his face; the man on the left hand opened the door, glass and all; the man on the right stooped down in order to look into the coach, but did not open the door; the man on the left hand asked for watches and jewels, the other for their money; I observed them all the time; I looked on the left hand side, and observed the man's face as plain as possible for any man to see another's face through a crape; but I will not positively swear to the features of that man that stood on the left hand, he appeared to me to be pale, long-visaged, and pock-frettened; I could not distinguish the colour of his eye-brows, but believe him to be the prisoner Ogilvie, from the circumstances I have mentioned, that he answered the description of the idea I had formed to myself; I will not be positive that Ogilvie is the very man, but I believe he is; I took much more notice of the man who was on horseback on the right hand, and who stooped down by the window; I am positive that is Dover; I am more positive to him than I could be to the other, because as he stooped down, the crape hung loose, and there was a wind at the same time which blew it away from his face, so that I had a full opportunity of contemplating the features of his face for upwards of two minutes; I was ordered by the man on the left hand to look back; I put my hand upon the back of the coach, and instead of looking back, I turned my back to the man on the left hand, and looked stedfastly at the man on the right; I am positive that was Dover; after they had robbed the ladies they rode off, presently afterwards Mr. Elliott came by on horseback; I made signs to him that those two men that were riding off were the men that had robbed the coach. Dover had on a brown close coat with a red collar, had his hair clubbed behind, and had a yellow metal buckle in his stock; Oglivie had a brownish coat, I took it to be a frock, it was made in a frock fashion, and something of a brownish collar.</p>

               <p>I live at the White-lion at Paddington ; Ogilvie is almost like the gentleman that brought the horse to our house, it was upon a Friday, at near four o'clock.</p>
               <p>The Friday before Michaelmas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the horse appear to have been rode hard? - Yes; he was all of a sweat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160040"></xptr>What account did he give of himself? - He told me to take great care of the horse; he did not tell me where he came from; he walked away to town.</p>
               <p>Did you never see any more of him? - No; he never called any more at our house.</p>
               <p>How came you to find out that it belonged to the man in Gray's inn-lane? - It was advertised, and he had his horse again.</p>
               <p>To ELLIOT. Where was the horse put up? - At the Wrestlers at Highgate; the proprietor of the horse has got him now.</p>
               <p>How came that? - He gave us the value of the horse; at least as much as satisfied us.</p>
               <p>COURT. The persons who take highwaymen are entitled to the horse he rides; it is proper stable-keepers should know that.</p>

On the 12th of April I met the prisoner and another young man in a public-house in North-street, Knightsbridge—I had two shawls on—I missed one in a house which the prisoner and another man, named Butcher, brought me to—they were strangers to me—I am an un<lb></lb>fortunate girl—I had the shawl loose on me, and as the prisoner was going out of the room, he took it, and put the light out as he was going out—I said to the other young man that I had missed my shawl—he said it must be about the room—he got a light and looked about the room, and it was not to be found—Butcher and I came out of the house—I gave Butcher in charge as I came out, and he told where Thomson lived—this is my shawl—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

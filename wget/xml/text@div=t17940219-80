            , I did not see the other till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did she come to your house? - She came to get a glass of liquor, sometime about the 25th of January last, the same day as Mrs. Taylor speaks of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come before or after the other? - After the other; I was in the bar when the other came, but I did not see her, Bowling came in and asked for a glass of liquor, which when served, she tendered me down a six-pence, which I supposed was a bad one; this might be five minutes after the other, it was not more, I gave her the gin, and she tendered me in payment the six-pence, I thought it had been a good one at first, but on inspecting it more particularly, I found it to be a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that sixpence? - I have got it in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Mrs. Taylor on that occasion? - There was nothing passed between me and Mrs. Taylor about that six-pence, but about the former one; I was sitting in the corner of the bar at tea, and Mrs. Taylor got up to serve the little one, Cooley, and she gave me a six-pence, which she shewed to me before she gave change; I returned it to Mrs. Taylor again, and I thought it was a good one, Mrs. Taylor put it in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put it in the till? - Yes. One of the officers came in and asked whether there had not been a little woman come in to ask for some drink, and what she gave? Mrs. Taylor said, she gave six-pence, and he desired to look at it, and she took it out of the till, and gave it to the officer; I got up, and while we were talking about the sixpence, the other woman came in. I have got the six-pence taken from Cooley, and the six-pence taken from Bowling. While the officer and me were talking about that six-pence, the big woman came in (Bowling.)</p>
               <p>Q. After Bowling came in, and tendered the six-pence to you that you have got, what happened then? - While I was talking of it to the officer, the other woman came in, and asked for a glass of gin, and she offered a bad sixpence, which I have kept, and Jostling the officer, he went to a place at our bar, at a distance, and when I pronounced it a bad one, he went and laid hold of Bowling, and took her into the room, and searched her; the other two officers brought the other woman in, and they were searched both together, I was there present; the officers brought in the other while we had got hold of the great one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the three officers and women go both together in the other room? - Yes, there were some halfpence, and some good half crown pieces found, I cannot particularly say to the number, the litil cone dropped a bag on the ground, I heard it crop.</p>

               <p>These two six-pences produced by Mr. Willis, are counterfeit; this six-pence produced by Jostling is counterfeit; this six-pence taken from Cooley's hand, is the same; these two in a bit of blue paper, they are both the same, the nineteen are all counterfeit, every one, and the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. To Willis. Were the prisoners searched before or after you had taken that six-pence of Bowling? - After; there was some monies found in Cooley's hand after that, and Bowling was not searched till the two officers had come in with Cooley, when they were both searched together; the prisoner Bowling, dropped the six-pence first, before the other was brought in, the bag was dropped from Cooley after that.</p>

As for this woman I don't know her, I never had but four-pence and four shillings, and I was going to my children, and at Water-lane I went in to get a two-penny loaf, and I went into this gentleman's house, and I called for a glass of peppermint, and he refused the six-pence, sir, says I, if you don't like it, I have got another, and Mr. Jostling laid hold of me; as for this woman I know nothing about, I have got people here that will give me a good character, of being as hard a working poor slave as ever lived.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooley. I was going to Fleet-market, and I met this woman, and she told me that she found that money, that silver, she said if it was good, she would make me a present out of it, and desired me to go into a seed shop, to get half a pint of split pease, and he objected to the sixpence; and she sent me to get half a pound of eight-penny butter, and I missed her when I came out, presently I see her come out of a baker's shop with a loaf, she asked me then to have something to drink, and to go into that shop? I told her no, I would not go without she went with me, but she insisted that I should go, and I gave that lady the six-pence, she shewed it to a gentleman, and he said it was a very good one, and I came out, and she gave me the bag, and the two runners came and took me, and when I went in she denied me at first, but afterwards she owned me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bowling. I never knew any thing of her, and Jostling gave her a shilling at the Poultry Compter, to say what she did.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners called three witnesses each, who gave them good characters.</p>
               <p>Court to Willis. Did you take the sixpence that Bowling offered? - Yes, I took it, and gave her change.</p>

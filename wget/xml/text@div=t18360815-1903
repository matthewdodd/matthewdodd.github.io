                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Miller, a bookseller, in Oxford-street. On the 2nd of August, I was standing at master's shop door, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I saw a man at Mr. Burt's window, hanging about, and presently saw him came by walk<lb></lb>ing very fast, and put a book under his coat—he went towards Dean-street—I went into the shop, and found they had lost a book—we went into Dean-street, and found the man delivering the book into the prisoner's hands—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "<hi rend="italic">Stop thief</hi>"—he dropped it down, the area on seeing us—he was about six doors down Dean-street—the prisoner could not see the shop where the book was—I had frequently seen the man hanging about our window—the prisoner must have been about twelve doors from the shop—there is a corner—he took the book from the man—he was taken into custody by Mr. George—the man had just given the book into his hands when I cried, "Stop thief"—I did not hear them speak—I was two doors off—I cannot say this is the book which was in the area.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the service of Smith and Turner, brewers, and live at 4, North End, Chiswick—on 30th December, about 11 p.m. I was in Morson Road, Chiswick—I saw some one come out of the door of No. 4, Morson Road—he had two pictures under his arm—he put them through the rails of the gate on to the path—he returned to the house again, and brought out two bags, which he threw over the gate—he pulled the door behind him as he came out—he got over the gate on to the path, picked the bags up, and put them on his shoulder, and the pictures under his arm—I pass this house every day—no one lives at No. 4—Mr. King lives at No. 3—I followed the man and spoke to him; the man was the prisoner—I told him he had not shut the door—he said he had not come out of any door, nor yet bean near any door, he only put the things down on the path to have a rest—I told him he must go back with me—he said if he had to go</p>

On this night I met Harman and Charlton with the prisoner—Hannan said "Here is a man for you; he has been into No. 3, I believe; I saw him come out of No. 4"—I said "You hear what they say, have you anything to say?"—he said "Nothing"—they were carrying two pictures and these other things—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner to the station—I afterwards went to 4, Morson Road, and found the door open—I traced footsteps from No. 4 over the wall to No. 3—I found the window broken open and raised; the hasp was broken—I got through the window, and went into the front parlour, and found these two chisels and this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—most of the drawers and cupboards in the house had been forced by one of the chisels—I went in all the bedrooms, and in one room I found seventeen keys lying on the bed, tied together.</p>

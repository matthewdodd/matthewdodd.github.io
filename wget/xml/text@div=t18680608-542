                  </hi>. I am an archery manufacturer, of 34, Whiskin Street, Clerkenwell—on 20th April, a young man called at my shop and told me to take a sample at 3 o'clock—I took the sample and saw John—he wrote this order out for ladies' bows and gave it to me—the value is about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said they wanted them for a gentleman who was going to speculate—I wanted a week to execute the order.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a picture frame maker, in Shoreditch—a young man came to me, and in consequence of what he said I took a dozen picture frames to 44, Hatton Garden—I saw John Gilbert, who told me he would send his brother down the following day and pay for the dozen, and give another 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order—I left the goods—William came next day and selected other goods, which he said should be paid for on delivery, and the last dozen as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the last witness—in consequence of what he told me, I took fourteen dozen pictures and frames to 44, Hatton Garden, and saw John first—he told me to take the goods in—I did so, gave him the bill, and asked for the money—he looked the bill over, went into the office, came back with a piece of paper, and asked me to sign it—I said that I should like to see first what it was, as he had his hand over it; and I said, "Let me see what you are going to give me"—he gave me a bill of acceptance, payable at the London and County Bank twenty-one days after date, for the whole amount—I said that I would not leave the goods without the money—he said that as they were sold he could not let me take them back again—they were both present then, but John mostly spoke—he said that if I liked to leave it till next Tuesday he would pay me then; that they were wholesale looking-glass dealers, and would do a good deal with us—I refused to leave them without the money, and took them away, but I did not take the dozen back.</p>

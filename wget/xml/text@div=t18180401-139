            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. On the 21st of March the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me if I bought silver? I said, Yes. He said he had found a spoon in a ruinous building in Somerset-street, which he produced. I observed two crests on it - He wanted 1l. for it. I said I could not give above 15s., and would give him that, if he would let me go and find to whom the crest belonged. He said money was of more use to him than the spoon. I suspected he had stolen it, and offered him 10s. for it - He agreed to take it. I made an excuse to send for change and got an officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He made no attempt to deface the crest.</p>

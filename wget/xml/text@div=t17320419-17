She said he had lodged and boarded there for 2 Years, and had paid her but for 6 Weeks; but tho' he was poor, she believ'd he was honest. Sometime after, Mrs. Collier told me she intended to buy a Parcel of Tea, and desired me to go with her, and give her my Judgment of it. While we were talking the Prisoner came in. I ask'd Mrs. Collier if she could spare Money enough to buy so much Tea as she spoke of? Yes, Madam, says she, I have receiv'd 6l. of my Dividend. You shan't want Money, says the Prisoner, I'll lend you 5 l. You lend me 5 l. says she, You may as well pretend to lend me 50 l. By God, Madam, but I will, says he, and I'll be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190011"></xptr> damn'd if I don't. Wednesday the 16th of Feb. was the Day agreed on to buy the Tea. Before I went out I saw that every thing was in Order; my Desk stood in a sore Room on the Ground-floor, and I had a large Box, I believe it weigh'd about 80lb. in my Bed-Chamber. In my Desk I had 16 Guineas, a Spanish Piece of 36s. and a half Broad-piece of 12 s. 6 d. a Pocket-Book that gave an Account of Mr. Huxley's Mortgage, a Reading-glass, 2 Wills of mine (one was a Duplicate) and a Paper on which was a Memorandum of the Numbers and Value of 3 Bank Notes. In the Box were a Silver Coffee-pot, Mr. Huxley's Mortgage, all the Writings of my Family and Hereditary Estate, and there 3 Bank Notes. I lock'd my Desk and my Box, took the Keys in my Pocket, and went out with Mrs. Collier about Noon. The Prisoner, the Maid, my Daughter, and an old infirm Gentlewoman were left at home. I return'd between 4 and 5, and was surpriz'd to see my Child look very much disorder'd and frighted. I ask'd her what was the Matter? and she told me I had been robb'd, my Box of Writings carried away, and my 'Scrutore broke open. How could this be? says I, You may be sure, Madam, says the Prisoner, that they got in at the Window. I went to the Window to look. 'Tis impossible, says I, that any Body could get over these Palisades, and a cross this wide Airey into the Parlour. For God's Sake, Madam, says the Prisoner, don't spend your Time in considering which Way your Goods were lost, but how you may get them again. Had you any Bank Notes in your Box? I told him I had Three. Then, says he, lose no Time, but let's go immediately to the Bank and give Notice. I look'd in my 'Scrutore for the Memorandum of those Bills, but that Paper was gone too. We went to Mr. Crouch at the Bank, who took the Numbers of the 2 Notes that were in my Name, which I remember'd, but the Number of the other, which was payable to Mr. Walde, I had forgot. I gave Bond for the former 2 Notes. In going to the Bank I met my Son John, and desired him to wait for me without. As I found I should stay a pretty while in the Bank, I sent the Prisoner out to desire my Son not to go without me, but bid him not tell my Son what had happen'd. The Prisoner, went and returned to me again. When I had done my Business at the Bank, we came out together, and my Son went home with us. I was too much disordered to sleep that Night, and so I chose to sit up. The Prisoner was very officions in offering his Service to set up with me, and told me he did not doubt but I would hear of my Writings again. And all this while I did not suspect him in the least. I desired him to go with me next Morning to my Friend Mr. Ashton, an Attorney in Surry street, to ask his Advice. As we went out ('twas 5 a Clock) I could not forbear looking at the Palisades. Lord, Madam, says he, 'tis an easy Matter for a Man to get over here ; and with that he laid his Hands upon the Rails, and made an Offer to jump, but came away without getting over. As we were going along he said to me, Never fear, Madam, for by God I'll help you to your Writings again. When we came into Lincolns-Inn-Fields, I could not restain from Tears. He ask'd me why I cry'd? I told him I had no Money left. Don't be so concern'd, Madam, says he, for I shall receive some Money next Week, and I'll lend you 30 or 40 l. if you want it. Then it was that I began to suspect him, for I knew he was very poor. When I had consulted with Mr. Ashton, my Suspicion encreas'd, but I thought I must play cunning to get my Box of Writings, which were of far more Value to me than the Money and Notes that I had lost, and therefore I was afraid to take him up. I desired him to draw up an Advertisement for the News-Papers: He wrote one, but did not like it when it was done, because Mrs. Collier's Name was in it, which, he said, it would not be proper to mention, and so he drew up another. He told me, however, there was no need of advertising it at all; for, says he, If you will but follow Discipline ( those were his Words) I'll find your Box again. He went out with my Son under pretence of looking after the Writings, and at Night when he came home, he said he had been abroad upon the hunt, and there were People in the World, and they talk'd about the Box, but they were upon very high Terms, they talk'd of 200l. You talk of People, says I, and they, and they! for God's Sake who are they? Nay, says he, there must be no naming of Names, but if you would get your Box again you must follow Discipline. I was very much provok'd, and thought of taking out a Warrant; but on Saturday Morning I receiv'd this Letter by the Petty-Post, which (by comparing the Hand with these Advertisements which I saw him write) I believe was written by him.</p>

The Prisoner came in, and said to me, Madam, don't be uneasy, I have got a Letter here, says I, that was sent me Yesterday ; pray, Madam, read it, says he, which I did, but I read two Words wrong on purpose to see if he would take Notice of it, for Merchantilin, I read Merchandizing, and Principle for Precipice; he took no Notice of the first, but said the second was wrong, the Word should be Precipice ; Madam, says he, which is as much as to say, they stood in great Danger, for its a dangerous thing to help People to stolen Goods, and those that deal that way have been very cautious in it ever since

               <p>S. Calf.

How came you to know it was unlok'd ? says I. Why, Madam, says he, I happen'd to go into your Room, tho' I can't think what Business I had there; nor I neither, says I, except you went on purpose to see whether it was lock'd or no. This was two Weeks before I was robb'd.</p>

               <p>S. Calfe. No, I only bid you tell him that I would speak with him. Prisoner. Will you swear that you never charged them both, or at least one of them with this Fact? And that you did not say that no Body else could make use of the Writings?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190013"></xptr>S. Calfe. If I did say so of my Sons, it was only to amuse the Prisoner, for I was afraid I should never recover my Writings, if he should suspect (before I got them) that I intended to charge him with the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you never say that your Son had robb'd you of a Pair of Snuffers, a Ring, and a Piece of Money? S. Calf. My Son was a little too saucy and refractory, and I only said I thought it was strange how the Ring should be gone. Prisoner. Have you not told me you was afraid your Son would rob you, and cut your Throat? And have you not desired me to sit up with you to prevent it?</p>
               <p>S. Calfe. My Son is but a Boy of 19; he is indeed, as I said, apt to be pretty saucy, and had behaved himself one Night in a manner that did not become him; upon which I told him I would bear his Insolence no longer, and so desired the Prisoner to turn him out of Doors. Prisoner. When you found the Box again, was any thing missing out of it, or had it been open since you lock'd it, till you open'd it your self ? S. Calfe. No.</p>

            . About Noon my Mamma and Mrs. Collier went out together, Mrs. Collier had Orders for her Maid to go out at Two, which the Maid did, and soon after a Man came to the Door, and told me, my Mamma was Sick at the Fountain Tavern, and desir'd me to come to her immediately. I ask'd the Prisoner what I had best to do? He said, he would have me go by all means, and if my Mamma was not there, I could but come back again. So I went about half an Hour past Two, and left none but the Prisoner and an old Gentlewoman at Home. My Mamma was not at the Tavern, and so I return'd Home at Hour past Three. Mrs. Collier's Maid let me in (she came Home while I was out) and I found my Mamma's Apartment in a dismal Condition, the Windows were open, and the Curtains drawn; the Desk was broke open, and the Chips of it lay about the Floor. The Prisoner was below in the Kitchen, I call'd him up, and shew'd him what had happen'd ; he said he could not imagine how it could be done, and he not hear any thing of it, for he had been in the two Pair of Stairs Room all the time. I was very much frighted, and desir'd him to go with me to see if any Thieves were about the House. We look'd in every Room, but could see no Body, and then I pray'd him to stay with me ( for I was still afraid to be left alone) till my Mamma came home. He said, that soon after I was gone out, two Men like Sailors knock'd at the Door, and ask'd for my Mamma, and that he told them my Mamma was not within. A little before my Mamma went out, I saw the Prisoner using a Hammer to knock up a Brass Nail to hang the Brush on in the Parlour, and then he took the Hammer away with him; and when my Mamma's Box was found in the Cock-lost, that Hammer was lying upon it. My Mamma came Home between Four and Five.</p>

            , Constable. I had a Warrant to search Mrs. Collier's House, and in the Cock-lost I found a large Box that weighed I believe near a hundred Weight, and this Hammer was lying upon it. Mrs. Calfe open'd the Box, and I saw this Silver Coffee Pot, three Bank Notes, and a Parcel of Writings and other Things in it. And looking among a Parcel of Shavings, I found this reading Glass and some other Writings.</p>

            . On the 16th of February, between Four and Five in the Afternoon, as I was going thro' Grocer's-Alley in the Old Jewry, I met my Mother and the Prisoner ; Son, says she, I am going to the Bank, pray stay a little till I come out. I waited an Hour in the Bank-Yard, when the Prisoner came, and said my Mother would not have me go without her, that she had been robb'd of her Writings, among which was a Mortgage-Deed of Mr. Huxley's, and some Bank Notes, on which Account my Mother was now at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Court. Would a Man that had stolen the Notes have gone directly to the Bank to order them to be stopp'd?</p>
               <p>J. Calfe. I never knew that my Mother had a Mortgage-Deed of Mr. Huxley's, till the Prisoner told me, and I can't imagine how he should come to know it and that it was stolen among the other Writings. I went home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190014"></xptr> with my Mother and the Prisoner, and saw how the Scrutore was broke, which I thought could not be done by a Stranger, and the Prisoner be in the House too at the same time, and hear nothing of it. On Friday Morning the Prisoner told me, he had been at Rag-Fair the Day before, to enquire after the Writings, and he had seen a Parcel of People, and was in hopes of getting the Writings again, if they were not advertis'd, for the People said if there was any Advertisement put out about them, the Owner would hardly ever have them again; because People had been stopp'd in such Cases, when they brought home the Goods.

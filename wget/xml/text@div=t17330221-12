I said, about Nine; and suspecting them to be Rogues I run for it. They followed, and one coming close after me swore by God, he wou'd make me remember running; I held up my Stick, upon which another said, Damn him, does he resist? Kill him. Then the first struck at me with a Stick, I warded off 2 or 3 Blows, but at last I was knock'd down and stunned, and got a mighty Cut in my Head. I had some Rice and Prunes, and Stone Blue, in a Paper, which was taken from me, and about 19 Pence all Copper, in my Pocket. I had a Cag of Treacle too, but they did not take that; when I got up they run away. There was 4 or 5 of them in Company.</p>

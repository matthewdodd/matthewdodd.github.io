            . I am the wife of Isaac Hattrell - we live in the Commerial-road. I have a child nine years of age, named Mary Ann. On the 15th of March, I sent her to St. George's school; about one o'clock she had a whittle about her shoulders; she returned in about half an hour crying; in consequence of what the child told me I gave information; I saw the prisoner at Lambeth-street office, on the 18th, with the shawl; she is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN HATTRELL. I am nine years of age. I went out to go to school, with the shawl about my shoulders; the prisoner asked me how my mother did, I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070051"></xptr>did not know her; she said she nursed me when I was little; she then took me up a short street and said,</p>
               <p>"I live here, will you lend me your shawl?" I did not make any answer, but pulled it round my shoulders - when I got round the corner, she ran after me and took it from me; she ran up the street - I could not run so fast as she did; I did not see her again till I went to Lambeth-street; I am quite sure she is the woman.</p>

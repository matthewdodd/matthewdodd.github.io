                  </hi> I am publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper, at 105, Shoe Lane—one day in the beginning of October, about half-past one or a quarter to two, I was in the Arches, a turning out of Farringdon Street—there was a great disturbance—I stood on one side to see what was going on—there was a rush, and the prisoner took hold of my chain and dragged my watch from my pocket—I caught him by the collar and held him five or six minutes, and gave him in charge—while I was struggling with him some other man cut the remainder of my chain—I have not found my watch.</p>

Q.</hi> What makes you certain of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because while he had his hand on my chain I had my hand on his collar—it was the middle of the day, and there were a great many people about—this is a betting place—there was a very large crowd, and people were close to me all round—I had the prisoner in custody when the other man took hold of the remainder of my chain—I did not keep him in custody, but he did not go nearly so far as you are from me—he was not twelve or fifteen yards from me before he was taken—the whole space is nothing like so wide as this Court—I never lost sight of him till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 455). On 9th October I saw the prosecutor and prisoner in Farringdon Street—there was a tremendous rush, and I saw the prisoner place his hand on the prosecutor's watch-chain—I was five or six yards away—I took the prisoner, who was rescued by the mob from the prosecutor's custody—I had a struggle with him and got him to the station, but no watch was found on him—he said, "I know nothing about it; the prosecutor knows I was not there"—I did not lose sight of the prisoner, I was not five-yards away, and I had known him by sight for some weeks.</p>

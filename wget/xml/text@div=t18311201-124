            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 17th of November, at half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our lodging; the watch hung by the window - he went away about seven; he called again about a quarter past two o'clock next day, and was not up stairs more than twenty minutes - the watch hung in the same place as before; while he was there my bell rang - I was obliged to go down to answer it; I was not absent more than five minutes - the prisoner passed me as I stood at the door, and said he was going to call on his uncle, who lived in Warwick-street, and would call again in the evening; he had said up stairs that he was going to Wakefield, that he had booked his place for Thursday, and would take anything down for us - my husband came from there; I missed the watch the instant I went up stairs - I went out to look for him, but could not see him; he did not come in the evening - I gave information at several station-houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Had you been out of your room that day? A. Yes, once, but am certain the watch was there when I went to answer the bell.</p>

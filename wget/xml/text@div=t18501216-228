                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 26). On Saturday evening, 30th Nov., I was with Funnell, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, in Bishopsgate-street Within—I found the prisoners near their masters' premises, Messrs. James and Sons, wine and spirit merchants, and dealers in ale and stout, 112, Bishopsgate-street, next the Flower-pot—Bowles had a flat basket, with a dozen bottles in it, on his arm; they appeared fall—Smith had this basket, which appeared to have something heavy in it—they went down the yard of the Bull Inn, and changed baskets—Smith took the basket that Bowles had, went into the bar, and came out without it—he spoke to Bowles, and I saw Bowles open this basket, and take from it this quart-bottle of stout, and give it to Smith, who concealed it under his jacket, and took it down-stairs into the kitchen of the Bull, that is under the coffee-room—I followed him, and took it from under his jacket—Bowles was still standing in the yard with this basket, not within hearing—I searched Smith, and found a pint-bottle of ale in his trowsers pocket—on the following morning I went to Smith's lodging—I found a quantity of bottles of a similar description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, in partnership with my father and my brother, at 112, Bishopsgate-street Within. Smith was our head cellarman—Bowles was in our service, under Smith—it was his duty to obey Smith's orders as far as the cellar-work was concerned—if Smith told him to take out a dozen of port to a customer, it would be his duty to obey him—seven o'clock was their usual time to leave—the owner of the Bull Tavern is a customer of ours—we had an order on Saturday after<lb></lb>noon for some stout to be taken there, and this basket, containing one dozen of stout, was part of the order—I went to Smith's lodging on the Monday, and found a number of bottles—Bowles lodged with his father, at St. Mary's-hill—I had sold him a cask of ale on the Saturday night; the amount was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in part, and was to pay the rest on the following week—there was no time stipulated—he was taken by the police before taking the cask of ale home—he had been in my employ not quite three months—we wanted an extra hand, and Smith brought him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. James's errand-boy. On 80th Nov. I heard Bowles ask Smith for his wages—Smith said he had not change, but he was going to the Bull-yard, and, if he went there, he would get change for a sovereign, and give it him—Bowles said he did not want to go; he had bought a firkin of ale of Mr. James, and he wanted to make haste home to take it to his father, and be could get change at the Flower-pot—Smith said he should not go there, as he was going to the Bull, and when he came back he would help him with his ale, as he was going that way for some corn for the horses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant E</hi> 12.) At a quarter to twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 20th of July, I was on duty in Titchfield-street, and saw the prisoner with a parcel under his arm—I asked what he had got—he said, a pair of boots, they were his brother's; he was going to pawn them—I told him to take me to his brother—he then, in going, said they were his sister's—he did not know what number she lived at, but she lived in Titchfield-street—I said I would take him to the station—he said he would not go—I took him there—he said, in going, that a man gave them to him in the street—I asked if it was a man named <hi rend="italic">Snob</hi>—he said, "Yes"—I had seen <hi rend="italic">Snob</hi> on the opposite side of the street.</p>

Yes, on Sunday morning it was locked up, but if any person got into the shop, they could get at the drawer, where the arsenic was; the drawer was not locked, but I forewarned him of it, when he first came apprentice to me, and my errand boy and all, I told them it was poison, and never to touch it; it was what I had to kill rats.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are an apothecary, living in Clerkenwell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The witness brought you some coffee. - A. Yes, in the morning of the 6th of April, about half after eleven o'clock, he brought some coffee grouts mixed with a white substance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it. - A. I examined it at the time, it was in such a situation as is unusually to be met with, it is generally in a large mass, as you may have seen it, it was irregularly powdered.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it. - A. White arsenic, it is generally made use of in a fine powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Goldsmith, and his wife, and child were all very ill. - A. They were all very ill and sick.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of white arsenic did you see. - A. I saw six or eight grains in irregular lumps.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the quantity that you saw sufficient to make the people sick. - A. It was more than sufficient to make them ill, that which I saw in the saucer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160062"></xptr>Q. You tell us it is white arsenic, how do you know that. - A. I examined it on a burning iron, which is one of the best tests, it evaporates in a white same, with a strong garlic smell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then have you any doubt of its being arsenic. - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. You impute the sickness from this arsenic to these persons. - A. To the suspending of the arsenic that they drank; when you boil arsenic up, it impregnates the water, the arsenic itself is not soluble in water.</p>
               <p>Q. If this arsenic was boiled up again and again, it would have been the same to all the water. - A. Not if it was not suspended, held up in the water.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I live with my mother, who lodges on the ground floor in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when the prisoner returned with the coffee. - A. Yes, I suppose then it was about half past nine o'clock, after the breakfast I met Mr. Goldsmith on the stairs, he looked very bad, I asked him if he was not well, he said no, he believed he was poisoned with the coffee, and his wife and child too; he requested me to go up stairs, which I did; I found Mrs. Goldsmith and his daughter retching very much; afterwards Mrs. Goldsmith desired me to look at the coffee, and I did, I observed a white substance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Luxton of 61, Minories, a licensed victualler. On Friday, 3d December, in the afternoon, the prisoner came with another man, who I had known for some time as a respectable man—the prisoner asked for some hot water, gin and peppermint, and treated the other man to it—he then desired him to go next door, to the cook's shop, to get something, and being tired of waiting, left—about five minutes after the other man left, the prisoner came, asked for a glass of six<lb></lb>penny ale, and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I opened the till to get change and he could see the silver in it as plain as I could—I shut the till, and went into the bar parlour to stir the fire; I had not had time to do so when, on turning round, I saw the prisoner lying on the counter with the till pulled out, and I distinctly saw his hand in it—his hand was full of silver—I screamed out and ran into the bar—he jumped off the counter, and ran out at the door which was close behind him—I am sure he is the man—it was a little before 3 o'clock—I counted the money in the till, and there was only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left; I missed about 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 7th, about half-past 2 in the afternoon, the prisoner was brought back by the other man—that was four days afterwards—the other man said in the prisoner's presence that he had found him in King-street, Tower-hill, and when he told him what he was charged with he wished to get away, and said that there was another person in the bar at the time—there was nobody there but the prisoner and my<lb></lb>self—his friend had gone out before this occurred, but I knew where his friend was to be found, and sent a detective to him—his friend is not here—the prisoner did not contradict what the man said, but denied taking the money out of the till, and said there was another man in the bar, but there was not a creature there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There was a man sitting on the other side of the bar with his hands on his face—he said, "Cannot you drink the ale?"—I said, "No, it is not hot, it is quite cold. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no discussion between me and you, as to whether the ale was hot or cold—I am perfectly certain that you are the man.</p>

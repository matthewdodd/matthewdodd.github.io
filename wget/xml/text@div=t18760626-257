I am-a-mason of 116, Cotton-street—on 29th April I was at a coffee-stall in Whitechapel, I unbuttoned my coat and took 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver from my pocket to find a penny—I put it back again, and five or six persons round me began to blackguard me—one of them hit at me, and the prisoner came behind me took my money out of my pocket and kicked me on my ankle—they all ran away—I went after them as well as I could, and saw the prisoner with a policeman; he pointed at me and the police<lb></lb>man released him and caught hold of me—he was running off again and another policeman stopped him—he dropped some money out of-his hand, some of which went on the pavement and some down a grating, which was obtained the next morning—my head was cut open by stick or a stone, and I was all over blood and was kicked about the shins.</p>

Just after midnight on Sunday I heard cries in Commercial Road, Whitechapel, and saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning with several others—I said "What have you been up to"—he said "Nothing, you have got the wrong man"—Maynard then came running past without a hat, and his coat unbuttoned, and the prisoner said "That is the man you want"—I released the prisoner and followed the prosecutor but some one sang out that I had the right one—the prisoner was stopped by Sergeant Purchase, and the prosecutor came up and said "I shall give that man in custody for stealing 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my trousers pocket—I asked the prisoner what he had in his hand, he said "Nothing"—I endeavoured to open his hand and felt money in it, which he threw away—I afterwards picked up 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was very violent and I had to draw my truncheon to deter him from using violence.</p>

I am a tailor, of 4, Little Compton Street, Soho—on 19th April I was at this coffee-stall and saw Maynard there, he took out some money and a fight commenced, but the one it commenced with got off—the prisoner fell on Maynard, and I said "Don't kill the man, pick him up"—I saw the prisoner's hand come out of Maynard pocket, he ran away as hard as he could, and I followed—a constable caught him and let him go—I still followed him—the sergeant caught him and I heard the money fall from his hand—the mob was so great that the policeman had to draw his truncheon.</p>

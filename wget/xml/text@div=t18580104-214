                  </hi>. I am barman, at the Unicorn public house in Blackman Street, in the Borough. On Wednesday, 16th Dec., the prisoner came with another woman about 9 o'clock—the prisoner asked for half a quartern of gin—shetendered me a shilling, I said it was bad; she said she did not know it—Itold her it was not the first, second, or third time she had been there—I went round the counter and looked for a constable; I did not see one—one of them attempted to get out; but I kept the door, and sent over to the station; an officer came and took them in charge—I walked between the women to the station; and in going along I saw the prisoner drop something out of her hand—I picked it up and gave it to the constable, it was a counter<lb></lb>feit shilling—I also gave the constable the shilling that was tendered to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. These two shillings are counterfeit, and these two shillings amongst the good money found on the prisoner are the patterns from which the moulds for these bad ones have been made—these good ones have been used for patterns.</p>

I gave him another; he took it, and gave me the change; this young man then came and said, "Let me look at the shilling?"—he took it, and went to fetch the policeman; the other that he picked up in the street I know nothing about it.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money on my account; he had been with me four days. He was sent to a customer of the name of Cole, on the 5th of June, to carry some goods; when he returned he said they were to be booked - he was to account for goods as soon as he returned - he said Mr. Coles had had goods to the amount of 1 s. 3 d.; I have never received the money. I went to Mr. Coles the same day, and then charged the prisoner with the offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Manning-street, Limehouse. I am in the employ of Messrs. Bousfield, of Haydon-square—I know a person named Richard Roberts—I received this letter from him on 31st March (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Harriet Newman, 8, Manning-street, Limehouse-fields. 31st March—Dear Harriet,—I wish you to meet me this evening, at five o'clock, as I have something to say to you particular; I shall wish you to meet me alone, as I shall be alone myself, and will, if agreeable, see you home, and hope we shall he happier than we have been. Yours unhappy, R. Roberts." In consequence of that letter I went by the Ben Jonson at Stepney, at five o'clock, but did not see Roberts—I saw the prisoner while I was waiting—he asked roe if my name was not Harriet Newman—I said, "Yes"—he asked if I was not waiting for Richard Roberts—I said, "Yes"—he said if I would come with him, he would take me to Richard Roberts—I asked him the reason that Roberts did not come himself—he said he was ashamed to come himself; and I said be might well be ashamed; I followed the prisoner down by the Ben Jonson—he then stopped and beckoned a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> from the stand, took hold of my arm, and told me to go with him—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> came up, and took hold of my arm—I screamed, and told him I would not go with him—three men and a woman came up, and asked what they were going to do with me—the prisoner said it was nothing to do with them, I was his wife—they got me into the <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> Day got in with me—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> got on his seat, and drove on very fast—after a little while, Day held my hands while he put a handkerchief over my mouth—I recollect nothing more till I found myself on a sofa in a large house, which I have not been able to find—I saw a young woman sitting opposite me, who asked me if I was any better—I said I did not know I was ill—she made a communication to me, and gave me a knife—an elderly woman came in, and told me I must stop there all night, and gave me a glass of something, and told me I must drink that, and then I should be better—I drank some of it, and directly made an attempt to come out; but the old woman stopped me—I held the knife up to defend myself—the old woman made a noise, and three gentlemen came running down-stairs—I was then in the hall, with the knife in my hand—two of them came up, spoke to me, and forced me back again into the room—in the struggle, I cut one of them over the hand with the knife; it fell from my hand, and the old woman put me on the sofa again, and said I should not leave the house—they tried many times to get me up-stairs, but I continued to resist—one of the gentlemen put a watch and chain round my neck; I threw it on the ground—one of the gentlemen called Day into the room, and told him to go and bring a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my senses then seemed very much stupefied,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185105120116"></xptr>
               <p>but I could distinguish Day's features—he came in again and said, if I was quiet he would take roe to my father—I then left the house, and went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Day; I asked him the reason he took me there—he said it was only for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> with his chaps—he said nothing more till he got me into a very dark street, where the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped—Day got out, and said he would walk the rest of the way home with me—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove off—he walked a small distance, put a direction in my hand, and told me I must find my way home the best way I could, and left me—I found the use of my limbs was leaving me, and set myself on the step of a door—I have no notion what time it was, and know nothing more till I found myself in the hospital—when I was in the house, the young woman told me if I was a respectable woman she would advise me to go out of the house—the old woman told me I must make myself happy there for the night, for I should be made a lady of—some of the men asked me to do what I felt improper to be done—I saw Day again on the Saturday night following—there were a number of persons there, and I pointed him out, and described his clothes—corduroy trowsers, a black coat, a black neckerchief, and a cap, I don't remember of what kind—he was not dressed so before the Magistrate, nor at the beer-shop.</p>

               <p>or from any drug: she was under my care from Tuesday till Saturday before she was quite recovered—I gave her an emetic at first, which weakened her very much—she was in a debilitated state, but was not really ill—my medi<lb></lb>cine was not such as would be the effect of keeping her in the hospital till Saturday—such a state might be produced by extraordinary intoxication; I examined her person the same morning—there were no signs of recent inter<lb></lb>course, and not the slightest mark of violence on her private parts or on her body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 18, John-street, Limehouse-fields. I have known Harriet Newman seventeen or eighteen years—she is about twenty-three years of age—I have written several letters for her—two years ago I wrote letters for her—I wrote one or two letters for her in the latter end of Feb. or the beginning of March—I know that, because I removed in those months—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one to the prosecutrix</hi>) in the month of March—Harriet Newman came to me early one morning before I was up, and told me she wanted a letter written—she dictated this letter herself; and when I asked her the reason, she said, "Oh, Mrs. Woodfield, it is only a <hi rend="italic">lark;</hi> Richard Roberts and myself are going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> amongst us"—she told me I was to write it in a very large hand, a man's hand, for if her young man Richard Roberts's hand would be known, and it would spoil the <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—I know nothing about their being unhappy, and wishing to be happier—I also wrote these two directions by her desire (<hi rend="italic">the directions found in the prosecutrix's hand</hi>)—I did not ask her the reason—Robert Coachford opened the door to her—she brought the writing-paper in her hand on that occasion—while this investigation was going on, I saw her a dozen times—I told her it was a very serious thing, and begged of her not to go on the last day of his being remanded—I said I would let it rest while it remained at the Thames, but if he was committed, I should feel it my duty to speak; she replied, "If you <hi rend="italic">split,</hi>" these are her own words, "I am a rained young woman"—I said, "Then you don't mind ruining the young man?"—she went with me, and showed me where Day's grandmother lived—that was within a week of his last hearing, somewhere about the Monday or Tuesday that he was going to have his last hearing at the Thames on Saturday—I had asked her mother to allow her to go with me to the grand<lb></lb>mother's, which she did, but the grandmother was not at home; she had gone to see her grandson, at the House of Detention—I saw the aunt—the prosecutrix was not with me then; she was waiting at a public-house close by; she did not hear what passed between me and the aunt—when I first knew her, she lived at Rhodeswell-road, near Bow-common—I have a daughter, who is much younger than her—when I first became acquainted with Newman, my daughter was somewhere about seven or eight years of</p>

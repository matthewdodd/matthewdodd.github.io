            . I am servant to Mr. Johnson, a pawnbroker, the corner of Russel-court. The prisoner at the bar brought several things to our house to pledge in the name of Mrs. Garnet. The silver cup, gold buttons, several spoons, the rings and cloaths; she had some away, and brought them again. The rings and buttons were taken in the 17th of September, we had had them before several times.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. When did you miss the rings and buttons?</p>
               <p>Garnet. I missed them the 21st of September; I took out a warrant, and she was committed on the 22d.</p>
               <p>Alison. The cloaths she pawned were taken away to the justice, and I don't know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner lived at this time?</p>
               <p>Alison. No, my lord, we did not; she said she lived over the water in Lambeth; and when she came with Mr. Garnet, she desired he might have the things she had pledged in the name of Mrs. Garnet.</p>

               <p>Fell. We asked her divers questions about the goods; she told us once she must bring a quart mug. We said we must go and ask her master first about that; the next time she came, she said her master had done without sending that; after we suspected her she came no more.</p>

            . I live in Long-Acre, servant to Mr. Rawlings. About the middle of June, the prisoner came to our house, and brought a pair of gold buttons. I asked her where she lived; she told me her husband was a carpenter, and lived in Westminster. About five or six days after, she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175010170005"></xptr> them away again. She has brought several things since; she once brought some rings, and redeemed them again. About the 13th of September she brought a shirt; she also brought, at another time, a marrow-spoon, two tea-spoons, and a strainer.</p>
               <p>Q. to Garnet. Had the prisoner these things in her care?</p>
               <p>Garnet. She had the keeping of the plate and the linen. I once missed the cup, and she brought it again the next day, or the day after. I once missed a pint pot; that was put before me the next day at noon. Thus I was deceived. The things were produced in court; they were found at the three pawnbrokers houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What was pawned was for money for housekeeping; when I have asked him for money, he'd say, what have you done with the money you had before? when I told him it was laid out, he would say, why, if you have not money, you have money's worth in your hands.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did you ever give these, or any of these things to pawn?</p>
               <p>Garnet. No, my lord, I never did; I believe there are people now in court know I live in better reputation.</p>

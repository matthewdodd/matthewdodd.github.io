                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, in Little Hermitage-street, St. John's, Wapping. On Friday night, the 11th of Oct., about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner was at my house with two friends, for three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour—I then cleared my house, and he went away with the other customers, peaceably and quietly—about half-past twelve I had occa<lb></lb>sion to open my door to let one of my lodgers in—the prisoner came across the street to me, and wanted a bed—I told him I had not a bed to spare—he said he insisted on a bed—I was in the act of going in and closing the door, when he caught me by the collar of my coat, and pulled me out of my door—he pulled me into the street, and in the scuffle we fell—when I disengaged myself from him I found my hand was cut—I did not feel him cut it—there were some slight marks in my cheek—there were two cuts in my trowsers, and one on my left sleeve of my coat—Mr. Gorratt, a medical man, saw me—my hand is very nearly well now.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 12th of Oct., the prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Brewer, in the street—I observed some blood on Mr. Brewer's hand—I told the prisoner he must go with me—he said, "I will go"—in going to the station, Mr. Brewer said something about cutting his hand—the prisoner said he did cut his hand, and he would have cut his head off if he could have got hold of it—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found on him a knife and two razors—the razors appeared quite new as though they had never been used—I saw a slight mark of blood upon the handle of the knife, but in conse<lb></lb>quence of its being in my pocket, it is not now to be seen—I saw two cuts in the prosecutor's trowsers, one about two inches long, the other not so long—the prisoner had been drinking freely, but seemed conscious of what he was doing—he seemed to answer every question very clearly.</p>

I am a surgeon, and attended the prosecutor on the morning of the 12th of Oct.—there was an incised wound on die back part of the right hand, about an inch and a half in length—it was not a bad wound—I have seen him three or four times since—he is not well now—it was done by a knife or a sharp instrument—I form that opinion from the clean edge of the wound, and the quantity of blood he lost.</p>

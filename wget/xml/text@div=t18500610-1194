                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 261). I was on duty near the Ravensboun river, at Greenwich, on 23rd May—I saw the prisoner coming towards me—I saw he had something under his jacket—I asked what he had got—he refused to tell me—I said I could not let him pass till be had told me—he took this parcel from under his jacket and threw it over a wall, fourteen feet high—one pair dropped at his feet—I took him to the station—I came back and found the parcel—it contained these twelve pairs of braces.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Blackheath-hill, and keep a shop. These braces are mine—I had missed them one or two days before the policeman brought them to my shop, which was about an hour and a half after he took the prisoner—they have my mark on them—they had been on a shelf at the back of the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had them but a few minutes in my possession, when the police<lb></lb>man took me; I was drunk at the time, and when I get drunk I am rather obstinate, but I never stole anything in my life; I wanted the officer to bring up the other man, and he would not.</p>

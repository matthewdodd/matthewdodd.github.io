             sworn. - I am a gangsman: we take care of merchant's property; and what deficiency there may be, we must make it good.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you responsible for the sugar in the cellar the last witness spoke of? - A. Yes. There is no communication with the cellar but through this slap; it had been wrenched, and the man must have been there all night, for he could not get out when the man locked up the gates.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you last seen the cellar safe? - A. Not for two or three days before; that cellar was fast, and nobody goes into it but me; there was but one hogshead in that cellar that was drawn, and we do not go there for a fortnight together, sometimes; the next morning, when I came, after this happened, I missed two hundred weight and three quarters; we found a quarter of a hundred in a bag in the cellar. (The constable produced the bags and the sugar).</p>
               <p>Blake. This is the sort of sugar that was in the cellar; all the bags that we found had had sugar in them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down to ease myself; I was very much in liquor, I did not see this place broke; I fell down the cellar, and there I lay as I fell, for three hours.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Spinney). Was he in liquor? - A. No; he was perfectly sober.</p>

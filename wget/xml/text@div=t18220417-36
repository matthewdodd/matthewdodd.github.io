               <p>"Where are you going, are you going to run over us" - he went a little further down, turned back, and came towards me; but not so fast; he stood and went back again towards Tyburn, at a fastish trot up the road. He came back in about an hour and a half fall gallop, whipping his horse all the way; I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't go so fast, you'll run over somebody," he did not answer, but kept whipping his horse - I was below Bond-street. I knew the deceased very well, his name was

            . I am a Hackney coachman. I saw the prisoner go up the road, and afterwards return up Oxford-street towards St. Giles's, driving as fast as the horse could gallop; it was about one o'clock. He was continually whipping his horse under the belly. I was on my box, and hollowed out,</p>
               <p>"For God's don't go so fast, you will do mischief." Mine was the first coach on the stand. Downs was crossing from the middle to the side to get out of the way. Several people hollowed to him, but he took no notice. The cart came so quick on Downs that he turned himself sideways, and the shaft and the horse's shoulder caught him, and struck him about the head and shoulder, shoved him forward about a yard and a half, and then the off wheel went over him - the prisoner continued whipping his horses more and more to get out of the way; he was followed but got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did his wheels make a great noise - A. They made a rattling. It was not a covered cart.</p>

            . I am a coachman. I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner in a cart galloping; I never heard him call to the man to get out of the way - the horse knocked him down, and cut his head open. I saw him whip his horse twice after he went over the deceased. He certainly must have seen and known that he had ran over him. I took him to a chymist's shop, then to a surgeon's, and then to the Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far off were you when you first saw him A. Not six yards; I was on the north side, and the deceased was on my side, between two and three yards off the curb.</p>

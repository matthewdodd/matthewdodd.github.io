                  </hi>. I am an appraiser of 16, Sussex-place, Old Kent-road. I produce a distress warrant for rent from Mr. Roberts, which authorized me to enter the house 22, Thanet-street—I went in the middle of the day, when the prisoner was not at home—he was a lodger there—I told all the lodgers they must take their goods away—I first saw the prisoner between four and five o'clock, when I was in the kitchen seeing the lodgers clear out their things—he came down to me and said, "Are you the broker?"—I said, "I am"—he said that was a d—d lie—he said, "Have you got a certificate?"—I said I had got a warrant, and it was in my man's possession up-stairs—he said he was a lodger—I told him he might take his goods away if he liked, the greater portion was gone, and he might take the rest away—his wife was engaged in removing them—he rushed up-stairs for a pair of pistols, saying he would clear the house—he tore up-stairs—I heard the cries of children, and a piece of timber came over the top of the stairs—he then came down-stairs with this piece of a bedstead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and struck me on the lip and nose with the end of it—here is blood on the end of it—I fell down, and laid stunned for two or three seconds—I then got up and inquired for him—one of the men said he had gone down the street, and I followed him—he tried to get away, and I said he must go to the station—he said he should give me in custody—I told him he could if he liked—we went to the station—I became faint from the loss of blood, and the officer can tell the rest—I lost a great deal of blood—</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Arthur-street, Old Kent-road. I had the warrant, and was in the parlour when I heard a piece of wood tumble over the banister—I went out, and saw the prisoner come down with this piece of timber in his hand—when about four stairs from the bottom, he cried out, "Stand clear! stand clear!" and threw it at Mr. Wickers, and struck him in the face—the prisoner ran away, Mr. Wickers got up and followed him—I had seen him when he first came borne, and his wife told him there was a distress in for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Bring me my pistols! bring me my pistols! I will soon clear them."</p>

I live at 8, West-street, St. Martin's-lane, and am a licensed victualler—the prisoner came about three months ago and asked for half a quartern of gin—she gave me half a crown—my son was just coming down stairs at the other end of the bar, and he cautioned me to look at it—I went to the till, and found it was bad—the prisoner had gone out immediately, and I put it aside, and afterwards gave it to Constable, 185 C—on Saturday, 20th January, the prisoner came in again, and I recognised her at once—my son served her with a half-quartern of gin, for which she tendered another bad half-crown—I went out for a policeman, and on my return charged the prisoner with uttering a bad half-crown—my</p>

I am barman to Mr. Greaves—about three weeks before the prisoner was given in custody, she came to the bar, and was served by me with a half-quartern of gin—she gave me a florin—I tried it found it was bad, and gave it back to her—she paid me for the gin with a good sixpence—I should not call her a customer of the house, for she only came in occasionally, and not very often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Edward Greaves' son—the prisoner first came to our place about seven or eight months ago for a half-quartern of gin—she gave me a bad half-crown—I tried it found it would bend easily, and returned it to her—she then paid me in good money, and I allowed her go—the next time I saw her was about five months after that—I recollected her directly—my father served her, and when she went out I told him to look at the money—he went to the till and took out a half-crown, which he said she had given him, and which was bad—on Saturday, 20th January, she came again at about 9 o'clock—I served her with twopennyworth of gin, for which she gave me a bad half-crown—I spoke to my father, and he went for a constable, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner attempt to leave, while the constable was being fetched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she has occasionally been a customer at our house, but only with the intention of passing bad money—when she came the second time, and was served by my father, although I knew her to the person who had been to the house before, and tendered bad money I let her go without attempting to stop her—I was busy, and she was just going out at the door.</p>

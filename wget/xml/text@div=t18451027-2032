                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of the London Dock Company. I was on the North Quay of the London Dock on the 3rd of Oct.—the prisoner is a labourer in the Dock—I saw him that day—he had a jacket under his left arm—I saw a bottle of brandy fall from it—I left it lying on the quay, and made a communication to my principal, who picked up the neck of the bottle, in my presence, within a minute, and I could smell that it was brandy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am keeper of No. 3 Vault, London Docks. Darke came to me on the 3rd of Oct.—while he was communicating the circum-stance to me the prisoner came up—I accused him of having had the bottle in his possession—he said he had no bottle—I took him to his warehouse-keeper—he sent for an officer, and gave him in charge—I went with Darke, and picked up the neck of the bottle, and found it had contained brandy—there was a seal on the cork, with "P. H. Goddard and Co., Cork," on it—we had many bottles with that name on them stowed in the warehouse at that time—the prisoner had no access to that warehouse—he could have got there if he pleased, but he had no right there.</p>

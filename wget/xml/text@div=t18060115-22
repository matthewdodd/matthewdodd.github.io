               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Williams a housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether the prisoner at the bar ever came to your mistress's house? - A. I think that is the same man, I am not quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. I think it was on the 7th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning: a person, whom I think was the prisoner, came to enquire for the place, I told him to walk in and sit down in the hall; he walked in; I asked him where he lived, he told me he lived three years in his last place in the country, I cannot tell his master's name. My mistress called me up stairs, I left him sitting on the bench in the hall, I went up to her bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing alarm you after you was gone up stairs? - A. As I was going up stairs I saw the man open the hall-door that goes into the street. He went into the parlour and took a basket of plate out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I do know that I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing? - A. My mistress heard the plate basket move.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the parlour door open into the hall? - A. Yes, and the dining-room, they both open into the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you at the time that you saw the man open the door that leads into the street? - A. I saw him from the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? - A. I missed him out of the hall then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the door? - A. No, I could see the hall from the two-pair of stairs, and I looked down to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this, seeing him open the door? - A. I ran down stairs and called my fellow-servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got down stairs, was he in the hall? - A. No. I ran into the parlour, and the plate was missing from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the plate in the parlour? - A. That morning, I carried it into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed it? - A. On the tray-stand in the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it? - A. There was a silver bread basket, a silver slop bason, two silver waiters, two silver salts, two silver salt spoons, two teaspoons, one desert spoon, one table spoon, eighteen silver four-pronged forks, a silver soup ladle, a small silver skewer, a silver snuffer stand, a silver butter knife, a pair of silver sugar tongs, and two silver bottle stands.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they entirely of silver? - A. No, the rims were silver, and the bottoms wood.</p>
               <p>Q. These things you were carrying in the morning, and you missed them when you come down stairs; did you ever see them again? - A. Yes, we got them all again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go into the parlour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the parlour? - A. No, only go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner brought back to the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to enquire for the place was not brought back? - A. No.</p>

            ? - A. I was below stairs setting the breakfast things for my mistress. In consequence of the alarm I ran up stairs, (I heard my mistress call out); I looked round and I could see nobody, the door was nearly shut, I pulled open the street door, and as soon as I got out, I saw the prisoner at the bar with the basket of plate under his arm. He was about half-way up Welbeck-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he moving with it? - A. He was running with it, he had the basket and the plate in it. I ran after him down Great Marybone-street. A gentleman that is here, hit him on the breast with an umbrella, and the plate fell out of the basket and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to him when you came up to him? - A. I was very near to him when it fell from the prisoner's arms, I came up to him directly and picked it up, I carried it home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? - A. He was taken to Marybone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Welbeck-street in Marybone parish? - A. I believe so, I do not exactly know; he was taken to that watchhouse. I took the plate home. It was taken to Marlborough-street. I went in the coach with it and my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the plate that you picked up? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150018"></xptr>- A. A bread basket and slop bason, and tea spoons.</p>

             sworn. Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 7th of September? - A. I believe I did, he is extremely altered now by dress, or something or other, I cannot take upon me to swear that he is the same man; I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Between ten and eleven o'clock where was he? - A. On my going along High-street, Marybone, I heard the cry of Stop thief, by Franklin, a former witness; upon hearing the cry, I turned round immediately, and I observed a person, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the bar, running towards South-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He is so altered in appearance now that you cannot be positive as to his person? - A. Extremely so indeed; he had at that time a basket (which is at this moment in court) under his arm, I heard a great jingling in the basket, I supposed it to be glass bottles at the moment, I endaevoured to stop him, but thinking he might knock me down, he run so violent; I had an umbrella in my hand, the point of the umbrella went against his chest, he ran so violent that he ran against it, and every article fell out of the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles? - A. Those are the articles that I believe came out of the basket (pointing to them).</p>
               <p>Q. What did they appear to you to be? - A. I conceived them to be plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see them drop down? - A. By the umbrella coming against him, the basket flew off his arm, and a great jingling was the consequence; I believe it was that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was something that jingled, the question is whether you saw what was the contents of the basket? - A. Not till after the prisoner was secured; immediately the prisoner passed me; I followed him instead of looking to anything that come from off his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he run from you? - A. About two hundred yards up South-street, until he was stopped by the last witness; immediately upon his being secured by the last witness, I accompanied him so far as High-street only.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the road to the watchhouse? A. It is, at the corner of High-street, I left the prisoner, and went to Mrs. Williams's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry of Stop thief by Franklin? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that was running? - A. I saw no person but the prisoner and Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that you stopped the same person which the witness Fynnymore took into custody? - A. I believe him to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he run this two or three hundred yards, how far was you from him? - A. I was very near to him almost the whole time; I dare to say he gained upon me at one time forty or fifty yards, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole time did any body else join in pursuit besides you and Franklin? - A. There were several persons endeavoured to stop him, but I could not perceive any body forwarder than me that was running after him, there might be but I did not see them; I was certainly the most forward at the corner of High-street; in South-street there possibly might be another or two following him before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150019"></xptr>me, I cannot say that positively, I did not see them to notice them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to the person of the prisoner having passed you with the basket on his arm? - A. I do not speak positively to the man, I have every reason to believe it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you collateral facts; you are not able to swear that is the man? - A. By no means, I never saw his face so as to make that observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going? - A. He was coming from Marybone-street towards the end of South-street, and at the corner of South-street was the very place that the umbrella hit against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was the jingle of glass-bottles? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the curiosity to see whether it was glass that was picked up or plate? - A. I had not</p>

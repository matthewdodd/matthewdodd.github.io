On the 13th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went into the shop and saw the prisoner at work—he said, "I shall want some bobbins, you had better go and get them"—I went down stairs, and while I was there I heard a hammering in the shop where the pri<lb></lb>soner was, alone—he came down and had some bobbins, and went on with his work—he came down and said,"I shall leave off directly"—I went up in two or three minutes, and he was gone—Mrs. Watson's is a patent sash-line ma<lb></lb>nufactory—the prisoner worked there—it was about half-past seven o'clock when I missed the prisoner—his usual time of leaving was about a quarter past seven—he left the street-door open—this wooden box was opened by the constable—it was found behind a press in the shop, and this lead, that had been in the box, was gone—the box had contained lead—I had used it on the week before—I had moved it at five o'clock on that day, and found by the weight of it that there was lead in it—I know this lead by the marks on it.</p>

It was so - I met the prisoner that very morning as I was going to lodge the information, I met her very near St. Sepulchre's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, at that time, give her a parcel of bad money, and desire her to keep it till she saw you again; upon your oath, did you or not? - A. I did not; we had a glass of gin together, but I gave her no bad money.</p>

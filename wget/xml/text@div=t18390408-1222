                  </hi>. On Saturday evening, the 23rd of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I left three bundles of brocoli in a basket at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn—a young man selling baked potatoes said he would give an eye to them—I went up Holborn, trying to sell some more which I had, and when I returned, in little better than half an hour, the others were gone—in consequence of information, I waited there till put nine o'clock, and then saw the prisoner crossing Holborn—I collared him, and asked him what he had done with my basket of brocoli—he said he knew nothing about it, he had not seen it—I gave him in charge—I have never seen my things since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gray's Inn-lane. I was standing at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn, selling baked potatoes, and saw the prosecutor's basket of brocoli there—the prisoner came and said the man it belonged to had sent him from a public-house to take it to him—I have known him some years—I told him he had better not take it, but he did—about a quarter of an hour after, the prosecutor came and inquired for it—I told him who had taken it—he afterwards took the prisoner into custody, and asked me if he was the man that had taken the basket—I said he was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I am a native of France. I was in England on the 5th of July, and went, with some friends, by the <hi rend="italic">Falcon,</hi> to Grave send—I had a pocket-book, with a number of French notes, one for 1000 francs, separated from the others, and ten others, of 1000 francs each, and one for 500—when I got to Gravesend there was a push while landing—about twenty minutes before that I had felt my pocket-book safe—I missed it in about fifteen minutes after I got on shore—I immediately returned to town—I have seen one of these notes since at Mr. Smart's—I had pointed out means to Mr. Smart to identify the note.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a refiner and foreign money-changer, in princes-street, Soho. On Monday, the 6th of July, a man of the name of Davies came to me, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—he produced this note for 1000 francs, and wished it changed—I requited a name and address, and got one—I had received information from the pro<lb></lb>secutor that a robbery of French notes had been committed—I refused to give him the money, but proposed to send to the house to which he had given the address—Davies then said it was not his name and address, but the name and address of the man who sent him—he said his name was Da<lb></lb>vies, a publican in the neighbourhood—I declined to part with the note—he said he should send the man who owned it—I said, "Very well," and he left the shop—he came back in about an hour, and the prisoner with him—Davies said, "This is the man who owns the note"—the prisoner did not say any thing—he neither denied nor owned that he was the person—he heard what Davies said—the prisoner then said, "I shall have no ob<lb></lb>jection to go with you to Berners-street"—I had told Davies, the hour be<lb></lb>fore, that I had had information of the robbery having been committed on a gentleman living in Berners-street—Davies, on that, asked me if I would give him a written acknowledgment that I had detained the note—I said, "Yes"—while I was writing it the officer entered, and they all went out together—I went before the Magistrate—Davies was admitted to bail, and did not come back.</p>

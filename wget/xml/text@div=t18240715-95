            . I am a watchman of the Savoy. I was about a hundred yards from Exeter-change, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran, and got near to Wellington-buildings; the prisoner was stopped by my partner; I did not see him stopped. He was searched, and no property found upon him, but next morning we found the ribbon and seal in the place where he was taken, in the road.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Stop thief! it came from Savoy-street, near Exeter-change - I saw the prisoner come running along; when I got up to him he stood still; I took him to the watch-house, and found nothing upon him; but next morning we found the seal on the spot where he had been. There was a gentleman at the watch-house, who said he lived at the Salisbury Arms, public-house, Durham-place, who said he had seen Mr. Moon talking to some females, but I cannot think that, for I had been there just before.</p>

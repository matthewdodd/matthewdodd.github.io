                  </hi>. I am a Trinity pilot, of 20, Stanesbury-road, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar—my house was broken into on 1st August between 2 and 3 in the morning—I was in bed—my wife awoke me, and told me there was a noise—I got up, and listened some time—I heard nothing, and I then opened the window, and saw what I took to be a man lying down on the top of the larder in the back yard—I asked who was there—there was no reply—I said, "If you do not speak I will shoot you"—I got no answer—the figure still remained there—I was about to dress to go down, and Mrs. Leigh called my attention to a man running away—I saw him—he came from the back part of the premises, towards the house to where his coat was lying—it was his coat that I had taken to be a man—he looked up and said that he had nothing of mine—he picked up his coat, and then ran through the yard again—I called, "Police"—he scrambled over the gate, and the policeman caught him just as he was outside the gate—I went down stairs afterwards, and found my house had been entered by the dining-room window—part of a pane of glass had been broken out—it would admit a man's hand right on to the fastening—the fastening had been undone, and the window opened—I missed only a cloth cap which had been left on the table in the dining-room—I have since seen the cap—the policeman showed it me—it was mine—I saw the prisoner directly afterwards in the policeman's hands—I saw him go into the policeman's hands.</p>

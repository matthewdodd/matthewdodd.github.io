                  </hi>. I am out of employ, and am eighteen years of age—about a quarter to 10, on the day in question, I was in the Waterloo-road, and saw Williams sitting on a door step, in Granby-street, with another person—she got up, took hold of my arm, and said, "Will you come in-doors a little while?"—I said, "I cannot stop"—she said, "You need not stop, and I want you"—I went in with Williams—the door was shut directly I got in, I cannot say who by—Williams asked me to come into the front parlour—I did so, and she shut the door—I did not look to see whether the shutters were closed—she asked me to give her some money—I said, "What for? I want to go, it is getting late"—she said, "You must give me some before you go," and she opened the door, called Carldon into the passage, and said, "He will not give me any money"—Carldon said, "You must give me some before you go"—I said, "I have got none"—she said, "You have," and I gave her a two shilling piece, which I took from my left trousers' pocket, but did not take out any other money—they were both standing in the passage, not far from each other—Carldon said, "You have got some more money," and I gave her another shilling out of the same pocket—she said that I had got some more money—I said that I had not—she felt my trousers' pocket, and said, "You have got a purse there"—I said, "Yes, I know I have; but there is nothing in it"—she said that she knew there was, and she would make me show it to her before I went—she caught me by the collar, and I felt very much frightened—I pulled my purse out, and tried to hide the money under my thumb—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, wrapped up in a piece of paper—she snatched it out of my hand, took the money out, and said, "I thought you said you had not got any money, what do you mean?"—I did not say anything—she asked me if I had got any money to get home with—I said, "No"—she gave me the florin and shilling back, and opened the door and let me out, and I directly called the police.</p>

On 18th June, I saw Williams speak to the prosecutor, and saw them walk up Granby-street and into No. 95—as soon as they were in, the parlour shutters were closed, and the street door shut by somebody inside—I remained outside about a quarter of an hour, when the door was opened and Armitt came out on the step and called police—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I have been robbed of two sovereigns and a half"—I ran into the back parlour, and saw the prisoners—he pointed out Carldon as the person who had got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her hand—I caught hold of her left hand—she had it closed very tight—I said, "You have got some money here belonging to that gentleman"—she said, "I know I have"—I said, "Give it up"—she said, "I shall not"—the sergeant came in, and with his assistance I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold out of her hand—she said, "I suppose if the gentleman gets his money he will be satisfied?"—I said, "The gentleman has not got the money at present; it is in the hands of the police, and will not be given up.</p>

               <p>and assisted him in getting the money from Carldon's left hand—she resisted very violently—we had great difficulty in getting it from her—she said that she supposed if the prosecutor got his money he would be satisfied—there was a short pause, and then Williams said the same.</p>

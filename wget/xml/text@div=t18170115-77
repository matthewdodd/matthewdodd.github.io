I went to bed on Wednesday night, about twelve o'clock, my house was fastened that night; I was not up the last in the house; an entry was made, by breaking into the Court-yard, at the back of the house, into the area, and getting through the door; there was a latch to the door. I did not see it before I went to bed; the area is covered over, and the covering is connected with the house, running up against it, the hole was broke through the covering. When I saw the area next morning, the hole was broke in the wall; it is a wall of lath and plaster, with boards an inch and a quarter thick. There is no communication without the house to the area, we found this rope (producing it) suspended to one of the joists of the wall of the area, by which means, they must have got down, the hole was eight or nine feet from the ground; my servant was up between seven and eight, and I got up at eight.</p>
               <p>LUCY TURNER. I went to bed at half past twelve o'clock. I was last up at night. I got up rather before eight o'clock in the morning. I went down, and found the back door, which leads into the area, open; upon looking further, I found a glass frame, taken from off the iron grate, and several flower-pots had been removed; a large sheet of lead had been taken off the wall; and there was a hole in the ceiling; and the side board had been ransacked. I heard no noise in the night.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GILL. re-examined. Upon examination, I I found nearly all my plate gone. I lost the articles stated in the indictment; there were a great many plated articles in the same place, but they were not touched.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL HUGHES. I am a watchman. On the night of the 12th of December, I was calling four o'clock in the morning, it was nearly half-past four; I came by Mr. Levy's house, in Wentworth-street; I saw the prisoner standing in the court there; I did not know him before, I thought he might live in the court; I went up the court, and took particular notice of his dress, as I passed him; I went on, and returned again; I missed him; I went up the court, and saw Levy's side door was open, it is in the court; I returned to my box, and in a few minutes, the prisoner came by my box; I stepped out, and called to him, he stopped, and I crossed over to him, and asked him what he did at the house round the corner - He said,"what house," and seemed strange. I asked him, what he had got upon him, his pockets appeared full, and bulky - He said, "nothing at all," and that he was of a different character, to what I took him to be. I asked him if he had any thing in his hat, I did not observe any thing in it - He said, he had nothing. Levy's house is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150035"></xptr>considered a receiving house; I have been on that beat fifteen months; Levy has lived in the neighbourhood some time; the door in the court is not usually left open; but there is a light burning in the room all night. I took the prisoner's hat off; I saw some lace, wrapped on a piece of blue pasteboard; I asked him, what he was going to do with it - He said, he was going to take it to his old woman. I said, "Who is she" - He said, his wife. I asked him where he lived - He said, in Frying-pan-alley; I took him to the watch-house; he wanted me to let him go; but, I refused; I put his hat on again, in taking him to the watch-house; as we were going along, he took his hat off, took out the lace, and took it off the pasteboard, and tried to put it in the puddle, in the street; I laid hold of his wrist, and he said, I wanted to rob him; I then put the lace into his left hand breeches-pocket, and took him to the watch-house, and told Barrs, that the prisoner had got some lace, Barrs asked him for it, and he pulled it out of his pocket, and gave it to him; the cap-caul was with the lace.</p>

               <p>HUGHES. I picked up a piece of lace the next morning, at the very spot, where the prisoner tried to drop it, I gave it to Barrs.</p>
               <p>BARRS. I produced it.</p>

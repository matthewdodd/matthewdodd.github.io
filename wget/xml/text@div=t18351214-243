                  </hi>. I lodge in Upper Marylebone-street; the pri<lb></lb>soner was my servant, and attended my wife in her illness. I went home, and found the key of my apartment under a mat at my door—I opened the door and missed the property—the watches were mine—a shawl, bonnet, and two gowns were missing they belonged to my sister, Sarah Catherick—they were all safe when I went out, to the best of my belief—the prisoner was taken a short time afterwards—I asked her if she was not ashamed of herself for giving away and robbing my apartment—she said she was ashamed to look me in the face—I asked her what she had done with the watches—she was going to tell, and then said she would not tell till before the Magistrate—she then did tell—the two watches are found, (these are them;) but no other property.</p>

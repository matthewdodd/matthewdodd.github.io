The young man came between eight and nine in the evening, of the 3d of April (he knocked twice at the door) with Miss Campbell's compliments to my mistress; would be glad to know what time on Monday she would send her things; or whether she should call on her; I received the message, and went up stairs and delivered the message to the ladies; they had some suspicion, and desired I would run down; as I came down stairs, the street door bell rung.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner that delivered the message to you, in the passage, when you came down again? - He opened the door, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner at the bar? - To all appearance it was him; it certainly was him; I never saw him before; James rung at the door; the young man opened the door, and let him in; James ran after him; I did not miss any thing till the ladies came down and examined the parlour; and the plate was gone; I examined after, and found three silver waiters and some spoons were gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man that brought the message, till this man was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was you sent for to go and see him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You expected to see the man? - Not without. I knew him.</p>
               <p>You was told that such a man was in custody? - I was told by the description I had given.</p>
               <p>Was not you told that a man was in custody that had robbed other houses? - I was told three men were in custody; and I picked him out; that was about six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>So that you saw him in custody for this sort of offence? - I really thought it a real message.</p>
               <p>Therefore, of course you had nothing to attract your notice of the man? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>He was gone before you got down, out of your sight? - He was.</p>
               <p>It was between eight and nine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard the two last trials? - I have.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry for it. Who was the person that gave your mistress this information? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who went with you to the place? - Another young woman in the same street, at whose house this young man had been.</p>
               <p>Had that young woman seen him? - Yes; and swore to him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Had she seen him before you went? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had not that young woman seen him at the watch-house? - She saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Did she not tell you as she went along, that she was quite sure he was the man? - She did not.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - Nothing: nobody asked me to see whether that was the man; I had no talk at all.</p>
               <p>You knew from her, that the man had been at her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This gentlewoman heard you say, to all appearance, this is the man that came to our house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I should think, as a conscientious woman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260038"></xptr>where a man's life is at stake, you would not carry it further? - I have no reason to doubt it.</p>
               <p>Do you think you could swear to me to-morrow? - I dare say I could.</p>
               <p>Not without this wig, I think you could not? - I saw you at Guild-hall without a wig; and I could swear to you then.</p>

               <p>I lived with Mrs. Sayer the beginning of April: I was the person that was let in on Saturday, the 3d of April; I went for oysters about eight, and returned about half after; I rang the bell, which I had no sooner done, than a man let me in, and went out; I had no suspicion, as people are continually coming, but was going to shut the door; the cook came down and said, where is the man? that struck me; I made haste after him, calling stop thief! he got clear off; when I came back the ladies were all in a fright; they missed the plate; and I missed the things; the side-board was stripped of what plate was on it at eight o'clock: I would not swear to the prisoner; there was five table-spoons, one large waiter, and two smaller, and some desert spoons; but how many I cannot say; I suppose the value of the large waiter, about fifteen pounds, a great deal under value; the two small waiters, about eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your plate has never been found? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did you pursue the man? - A considerable way.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak to the man? - No.</p>

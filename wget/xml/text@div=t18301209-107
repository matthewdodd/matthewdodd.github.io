            . I am a working-jeweller, and was in the employ of Mr. Thomson; I went into his service the latter end of August last - he lives in Berwick-street, Soho. I became acquainted with the prisoner in September or October last; I first saw him at his shop in <placeName id="t18301209-107-crimeloc618">Princes-street, Soho</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who stole these things? A. I did, Sir; I had been in the habit of stealing things for about a month before that - not longer, though I had been in the employ of a jeweller for three years - I am sorry to say I stole a good deal; I have sold to about four other persons, who all keep shops as the prisoner does; I was found out on the 1st of November, when my master missed different things - I had stolen nothing that day, but I had on the Saturday before; on the Tuesday I was taken to Marlborough-street - I named all the persons to whom I had sold stolen goods, and the prisoner among the rest, and on the Friday I saw him there; the Magistrate let him go to appear on his own recognizance, but I was not present then - I never was examined as a witness against him, and he never knew what I had to say, that I know of; I went into his shop like another customer - I mentioned Chelsea, but did not say I was a silversmith or jeweller there; the first article I recollect carrying to him was a swivel of jeweller's gold, not such gold as sovereigns are made of - it is a paler gold; it was about the fourth time I saw him that I said I lived at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you apprenticed to your master? A. No - I went decently dressed to the prisoner.</p>

Potter was in my service; in consequence of something that occurred I had him taken up, and afterwards went to the prisoner's shop, with Avis, the officer, and another person, whose name I do not know - this was on a Tuesday, about three weeks ago; the prisoner was at home - the officer told him he had an unpleasant piece of business with him, and here was a person who had been robbed; I told him he had bought several things of a boy of mine, who had stolen them - he said he did not know what it was, what was it? I told him of several different things, and, among the rest, of a chain; I described the boy, and begged he would let me know what he had bought of him, as every thing he had sold him was mine; he said he had bought nothing of him that he knew of, and said, "What does he say he sold me? you are welcome to look, if there is any thing of yours you may have it;" I told him of a silver chain, with double loops - he denied having had it, and I have never seen it since; I then mentioned a coral-drop which he had purchased - he drew a drawer out, and I found it; I then said he had got some black work - he took out a box, containing some black work, and I found some of mine in it; I looked into a cup of gold, and found two pieces of gold drops, some cuttings, and some silver wire - I found these three gold watch-key loops, and these gold cuttings in a wooden bowl, or cup, in his window, covered with a number of other things and cuttings - I identified the different articles, and as I did so, he said of almost every one of them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090058"></xptr>"That is not your's, I am sure;" he almost denied every thing distinctly - what I did identify were rolled up in a paper, and given to the officer; he was taken to Marlborough-street, and remanded by Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you been unfortunate in business? A. Yes - I understand the prisoner has married a Mrs. Wolfe, who was a creditor of mine; I went through the Insolvent Debtor's Court, but I was remanded for ten months through the inattention of my attorney, I may say; I believe it was said, "Because the said prisoner has fraudulently made away with part of his property, let him he remanded for ten months" - I remember being at the Police-office on the 9th of November; I was in want of money that day, and have been all my life - I would not think of compounding a felony;

I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house; Mr. Thomson put several questions respecting the things that we found - the prisoner appeared lost at the moment; he pulled out one bowl, and then another, in which the prosecutor found some property- the prisoner said he bought them as old gold, and gave a fair value for them; the prosecutor then challenged him about a chain that he had said he knew nothing about, which he pointed out in the window - I have some key-loops, some of which were in a bowl, and some in a little obest of drawers.</p>

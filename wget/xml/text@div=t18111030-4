            , a watchman. I went into my dining room, opened the window, and asked what was the matter; he told me to came down I looked round, I saw nobody; I went to my bar door, it was locked. I found my cellar door smashed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open - A. Yes. I went forward to the street door, I held up the light to the private door of the bar, a pannel of wood was forced in. I turned my head on the right, I saw the prisoner laying in the bar on the floor, with his head on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the private door of the bar of which the pane of wood was taken out, was that door open - A. It was open. It was fastened when I went to bed with a drop bolt, if you put your arm in that pane you could shove the bolt up. I unlocked the street-door, and let the watchman and a man of the name of Leach in; they took hold of the prisoner by the collar and pulled him up. The prisoner said nothing, he appeared to be dead drunk. He was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner completely dressed - A. I did not observe that any part of his dress was off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his shoes on - A. That I cannot say. I unlocked my bar front door, I found on the counter a dark lanthorn, an iron crow, and a little bottle in a tumbler; they were not there when I went to bed. Then I went into my cellar, I found my cellar flap, one dog was quite off, and the other hung by one nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these dogs part of the fastenings of the cellar flap - A. Yes, they are the front part of the flap that goes into the solid oak frame. The bolts are on the opposite side, and the bolts were shot, they could get under the shutter by pulling the dogs out. I found in the cellar a small bunch of matches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either that little bottle in the tumbler in the bar, or the bunch of matches in the cellar there in the night when you went to bed - A. No. The bottle would light a match in a minute, I have tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the flap of your cellar the night before - A. Yes, I fastened it myself I bolted it with two bolts a little after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose by forcing the dogs on the opposite side of the bolts the flap could be got up - A. Yes, and they could get under it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not lost any thing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bar was safe the night before, and the cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. What time had you gone to bed that night - A. A little before twelve, and then my house was quite safe. I always take my keys up stairs, and put them on my drawers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The publican went to bed before ever he shut up the house; two of his lodgers shut up the house; he went to bed quite tipsey.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was the last up in the house, and took the key up stairs with me. My lodger fastened my shutters, I went down and saw them all safe. I myself fastened the cellar flap.</p>
               <p>- OSBORNE. I am a watchman in the parish of St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. In going your round on the night of the 21st had early in the evening tried any of the fastenings of that house - A. Yes; the shutters of the window were safe at eleven o'clock at night. I went round every hour. I was going my round at two o'clock, a gentleman knocked at a door at the opposite corner to the Bell; the landlord let him in, and from what he told me we tried the flap of the cellar and found it open. On that we called Mr. Finch, the landlord of the Bell, up; he got up and let me in, and a gentleman that is here, he is not the landlord of the next house. I saw the pannel of the bar out, I lifted up my lanthorn, I found the prisoner in the bar, he was laying across two chairs lengthways, as if he was asleep. I went and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Finch, the landlord of the house, point him out to you first - A. No, he was at the door at the time, I did not perceive any body find him out but myself, I took hold of his collar and said, my friend rise up; the prisoner said, oh, that is all he said then. I took him to the watchhouse; he walked to the watchhouse with his shoes off. He had no shoes on when I found him. At the watchhouse the prisoner asked for his shoes, and a little girl brought them, he did not put them on till the morning.</p>

            . I am an excise officer. I was on my duty that morning, I was coming from Barbican up the court into Red Lion Market, I found a gate loose in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this public-house lay in a court - A. No, at the extremity of two courts. My curiosity was arisen at seeing the gate loose; a man rushed violently by me as if from Mr. Finch's down towards Barbican, he was going at a quick pace.</p>
               <p>Q. That man you did not know - A. No. I scarcely bad turned round before another man came in the same direction as if from Mr. Finch's house, it rather alarmed me. I proceeded up the court and heard distinctly a bolt drawed back at Mr. Finch's, I did not know it was a public-house then, I know it now; I heard a bolt or something making a noise, which attracted my attention, and seeing a light on the right hand side of the house on the opposite side of the alley, I knocked at the door, the master came in his shirt and shoes with a lanthorn, him and me applied to the watchman; the watchman was deficient in candle;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300005"></xptr>the man said, there is plenty in my house; I went to his house and got a candle; they were stationed one of each side of the cellar flap; I saw the shoes found on the outside of Mr. Finch's house, a pair of thick shoes with large nails in the heels. The neighbour took the shoes into his own house. This was previous to Mr. Finch's door being opened. We tried all that we could to wake Mr. Finch with our voices, we could not; we knocked the shutters with such violence that soured him, he came to the door and let us in. I observed this square of wood was out of the casement, and when the light came nearer I observed the prisoner plainly, his body couching down a if to conceal himself, and not as has been observed living along the chairs. I caught hold of him by the right hand, the watchman pushed the door open, and we brought him out. I having seen the shoes so and the first thing I did was to look if he had any shoes, I found he had none. We took him to the watchhouse, and there he asked for his shoes; I asked him what kind of shoes they were; he said, I shall know them again, they have got nails in the heels. There was a little girl and another standing at the watchhouse, I told them where they were to be found, and they were brought. The next day I saw him put there on, they appeared to sit him. I staid in the watchhouse untill they brought in the implements they had found, and they were shewn to the prisoner.</p>

            . I attended at the office, Worship-street the next day when the prisoner was brought, on Tuesday the 22d, I was desired by the magistrate to go with Mr. Finch. This iron laid on the table. When the prisoner was examined it was brought by Mr. Finch, or some of the witnesses. There was one place in the flap of the cellar that corresponded with this iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the iron - A. It is called a Sawyer's Dog. it is not what they call a crow. It may be used as a crow, and it appeared to have been used to one part of the cellar flap. When I went to Mr. Finch's, I saw this pannel laying in the bar, it appears to bear the impression of the broad part of this iron. This dark lanthorn and a bit of candle was produced to me at the office at the same time, and a few matches and a phosphorus bottle, which I have had ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found this iron in my bar. This is the little bottle that I found in my tumbler glass, and these are the matches that I found in the cellar, they were afterwards taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend with Armstrong when the iron was tried to your bar and to your cellar flap - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, I had been drinking in the house in the night. I cannot say how I came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the True-to-the-Core, Newington Causeway—on Saturday evening, 23rd September, about 5.45, the prisoners came in for two bottles of ginger beer, which came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they gave me a half-sove<lb></lb>reign; I found it was bad, and asked them where they got it—one of them said "We got it from a bookmaker in the Kent Road, over a bet on the hone Hannah"—I think he said it was three half-sovereigns to one, or 3 to 1—I detained it and marked it; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—one of them asked me to return it—I refused, and said that I was not satisfied, but if the party who gave it to them would come with them, and he was a respectable man, I would return it—they paid with a good half-sovereign—I think it was Pescud—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and they left—I watched them from the window for a few minutes, and then went round Southwark Bridge Road, and met them—they waited in a gateway ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and then went to another gateway for a quarter of an hour—they then went and stood opposite the Sportsman public-house, and one of them went in for a light for his pipe; he came out with a spill in his hand, and they walked on to a beer-house, and stood there about twenty-five minutes' talking—they then went towards the Borough, and I told a policeman—all this took an hour and a half—Pescud then went into a baker's shop, and called for a quartern loaf—I went into the shop, and saw him place a half-sovereign on the counter, which the <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> was looking at rather suspiciously—I said "Is that a half-sovereign he has tendered to you?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Allow me to look at it?" and I bent it with my thumb and finger, and told him he must come to the station—we had a struggle outside, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am assistant to the Crated Bread Company, Blackman Street, Borough—on the evening of 23rd September, Pescud came in for a half-quartern loaf, which came to 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me the half-sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Pryer came in and called my attention to it—I found it was bad, and marked it—the prisoner left the loaf, and went out of the shop with Mr. Pryer—I heard him say that he had done nothing.</p>

I took Edwards about 300 yards from the baker's shop, and asked where his mate was—he said he believed he had gone to buy some bread—I told him I took him for being concerned with another in passing counterfeit coin—he said "I am a hard working <hi rend="italic">chap;</hi> I know where I got the money; I got it from my master"—I took him to the station, and found on him a half-crown, a sixpence, a penny, a key, and a duplicate—I received these two half-sovereigns from Pryer and Humphreys.</p>

On Friday the 18th of June between nine and ten o'clock in the morning I was called into my shop, the prisoner was in the shop looking over the thread lace edging box. When I came into the shop she asked for some blond edging; I shewed her some, and she had a yard and a half cut off, and she bought a yard and a half of blue twopenny ribbon; she then begged me to cut her out the pattern of a bonnet; that she was going a little farther, and would return for it in a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Did not you miss it while she was there? - No, the pieces were put into the box together, and we did not take notice then.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - A piece of thread edging thirty-four yards.</p>
               <p>What was it worth? - Two shillings a yard.</p>

               <p>I am a waterman.</p>
               <p>Do you ply near London Bridge? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you remember taking Mrs. Myers, the prisoner, into your boat on the 18th? - I do.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to know it was the 18th.</p>
               <p>I was going up to Hungerford without this lady; I happened to ply the gentleman and lady; I asked the gentleman if he would give me 6 d. rather than stay, the gentleman said he would. I rowed away against wind and tide; when I came up the clock struck twelve; I was near an hour in rowing against wind and tide.</p>
               <p>It was twelve o'clock when you landed her at Hungerford Stairs? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to know it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070017"></xptr> Friday? - I did not work on Saturday nor Sunday; on the Tuesday this man came to me, and asked me if I remembered carrying such a fare; I said, I did.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I believe you went before the justice? - I was asked to go, but I could not go.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What time of the morning was it that you set off with Mrs. Myers from the house of Mr. Long at Rotherhithe? - About ten o'clock on Friday morning the 18th of June.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to recount the progress you made from thence to town, and the different places you were at? - At about ten o'clock we set off from Mr. Long's; we took a boat at Cherry-Garden Stairs; that waterman carried us to Billingsgate; there he set us on shore; that was near eleven o'clock. We walked from thence to the Old Swan; there I took another boat, he conveyed us directly up to Hungerford Stairs. We walked up St. Martin's Lane to the house we were going to take, the King's Arms, the corner of Hog-Lane; I was never out of her company all that time; we got to the publick-house between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then from nine in the morning till near one o'clock you never had been out of her company? - Not five minutes. At one house she went into, in the market, she went backwards, and I had a dram at the bar; after that we proceeded together to Hog-Lane; we got there between twelve and one o'clock; we did not stop at the publick-house five minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I have been a publican many years, but have left off.</p>
               <p>Counsel. You went to see if this publick-house would answer? - We did.</p>
               <p>You have known her some years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What character does she bear? - A very good one.</p>
               <p>You remember her being charged with this fact? - I was with her at the time.</p>
               <p>She was searched? - Yes; over the way at the Bear.</p>
               <p>There was no such piece of lace found upon her, was there? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you may know that she then told the same story you have been telling now before the Justice? - She did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any bail given for her? - No.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday she returned again before the Justice? - She did.</p>
               <p>Had she all the watermen there that she has to day to give the evidence for her. - There were a great many witnesses there, and I was there.</p>
               <p>Did she not give the same account there that she has given now? - She did.</p>
               <p>You was in her company all the morning? - I was.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the prisoner proposed to call witnesses to the character of the prisoner, but the court and Jury declared themselves perfectly satisfied without examining any more evidence.)</p>

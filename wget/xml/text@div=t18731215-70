               <p>as wharfingers, at Millwail—on 26th September I had a person named Barker in our service; he absconded in the early part of October—the course of business is first of all an order from the owner, then an entry in a delivery-book—there is a register of the delivery kept on a file—I have the file here of that day—I have looked through it, there is no register of ten barrels of turpentine on that day, nor any entry in the delivery-book—we have a great quantity of turpentine in different barrels on our premises; there is a note delivered to the Carman, and it is his duty to take the note, with the load of goods, to his employers, he having previously signed for the goods on the counterfoil—on 26th September I was accidentally passing near the West India Docks, and saw a small van upset, containing some barrels; I knew they came from my wharf—afterwards, from information, I saw some barrels at the house of a man named Austin, at Rye Lane, Peckham—Austin was charged before the Magistrate and discharged—I have received back four barrels out of the five, and a tub, which was a portion of the fifth barrel; it had been emptied and cut into two tubs—we mark our barrels with stencil plate, with the letter or mark of the particular cargo on the head, and we cut in the running numbers on the head; that would appear in the order—the barrels are tared previous to filling them from our cisterns—that is specially the duty of Thorogood, but if we are busy it is occasionally done by other men, Jones or Harwood—I have seen some wash tubs—I believe it is a common thing after barrels have been emptied to cut them into wash tuba, but it is more generally done with paraffin and petroleum barrels—the barrels I have seen came from our wharf—I know Barker's handwriting, I found his handwriting on two of the tubs; it is not writing, we term it <hi rend="italic">scribing</hi>—I can tell Thorogood's marks generally, not so well as Barker's, I believe them to be his—I went to Monk's on 21st October, with the detective Norman, 8, Manor Street, Chelsea; he was not at home, the shopman said he was at the other shop—we went on to the other shop in the same neighbourhood, and he came back with us to Manor Street—after we had searched the cellar Norman asked him if he had any other premises—he said no, those were all—the cellar runs under the shop—I noticed that there was a building attached to it—he did not take us into that shed—I saw some barrels in the cellar; I saw one I thought to be mine from the marks on the barrel—I can tell all my lawful deliveries for years past; we are able to detect every one of them by the ship's number, the entry, and the case—I only identify the marks, I can say it was once my property—my books would show every legitimate delivery, but no register or record has been kept of this, it has not passed through my books as if it was a regular transaction—the value of the ten barrels is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I was examined, cross-examined, and re-examined on several occasions at the Police Court; the first occasion was the 21st October, the same day that I went with Norman to Monk's place in Manor Street—on that occasion I swore positively that the one cask that was removed by the police was my property—Monk was not taken into custody then—he did not then produce an invoice of Sir Charles Price &amp; Co., in reference to two casks of turpentine; he searched a file for a long time, I saw him take two papers from the file—when we got to Arbour Square ho was under a sort of surveillance—he told the inspector that some papers were taken from him, or that he had given them to Norman, and he wanted them taken care of—I did not hear him say that this particular</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187312150010"></xptr>
               <p>paper referred to the cask of turpentine which the policeman had taken—I did not hear him say that he had brought the invoice with him for the purpose of giving information to the Magistrate, or for his protection—at the shop, when he took the two papers off the file, Norman said "What have you got there?" and he said "I must protect myself"—those two papers were produced in Court by Norman—I don't know how they got into his possession—I was not present on 28th October when an application was made that somebody from Price &amp; Co. should go and see this particular cask; I heard of it—I believe the cask was then at the police-station; I did not see it there—I was not present when Mr. Archer, from Price &amp; Co., saw it—I said on 28th October that I could not swear what ship the turpentine came from—I said I did not remember seeing them at all before they were stolen, because we take turpentine out of our cisterns, turpentine kept in bulk, and I could not say who was the consignee—I can swear to any casks that leave my premises—if a cask leaves my place unmarked I could swear to it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I have thousands of such casks, I can't swear to any individual cask")—I can swear to individual casks—I think I was asked if I had any book in which these stolen casks were entered—I had no such book—Barker took very good care to keep no record of it—if it had been a legitimate delivery it would have been fairly entered in my books—I do not know from what consignment of turpentine this was, who was the consignee, or the number of the ship, because I store turpentine in bulk—all I know is I shall have to pay for it—we occasionally have consignments of turpentine from Price &amp; Co., of Thames Street—we have done business with them—I am a public wharfinger—I bank goods the same as a banker does money—the casks from ships are not in all cases emptied into tanks—sometimes a mer<lb></lb>chant won't have it done, and we store it in our cellars—it is coopered by us, that is a very extensive item in our business—when we get a cargo that is not to be bulked whole we tare for average; we tare about every tenth cask, 10 per cent.—when we land the casks we simply chalk the tare on them, when we deliver them to the dealers, we put the pounds on them, not the odd quarters—that is done when the cask is empty with a scribing iron—I cannot swear to any mark but the tare on the cask that was taken away from. Monk's—I have seen six tubs altogether, including Austin's—I identify two by numbers in the head of Barker's scribing, and the tares by Thorogood, and there is no shipping mark upon them, which there ought to have been if it was an honest delivery—I do not know a person named Low, I want to get hold of him—I did not deal with him—I have a person named Bright in my employment—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this appears to be an invoice of five barrels of petroleum, purchased by Low, receipted by Wright—my transactions are very numerous, they do not all pass under my observation—I never heard of the man before—if a man produces a proper order, the goods would be delivered to him, the same as a cheque presented to a banker—petroleum casks, in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, are painted blue in the body and white at the head, and turpen<lb></lb>tine casks are unpainted in the body and the heads painted red—petro<lb></lb>leum may sometimes be put into turpentine barrels after being cleansed by superheated steam—I think I went three times to Monk's premises with Norman—I may very likely have remarked that I hoped to give Monk five years—I don't remember it, but it is a thing I should be very likely to say—that must have been after he was remanded—I think I was seven</p>

               <p>times at the Police Court, from 21st October up to 3rd December—I think evidence was given on every occasion—everything was done with my sanction—I attended before the Judge at Chambers, and opposed the application for bail—I thought the ends of justice would be defeated if he got at large—if he had been locked up before, I should have got hold of Low.</p>

I am in Monk's service; he keeps a shop at 8, Manor Street, Chelsea, and also at 201, King's Road, where I served—they are about 200 yards apart—I remember Norman the constable coming to the Manor Street shop on 23rd October—I showed him a shed at the back of the premises there; that shed is in Monk's occupation—the entrance to the shed is in Manor Gardens, by folding doors—it was used for stowing away barrels and things.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I attended principally to the King's Road shop, and I went to Manor Street when required—I kept no account of the things that were delivered at Manor Street—I remember two barrels of turpentine being delivered from Messrs. Charles Price &amp; Co., and one of those was taken away by Detective Norman—I was not present when Mr. Ingall pointed it out and said it was his property—my hours are from 8 o'clock in the morning till 9 o'clock at night—I am constantly going from one shop to the other—this is the invoice for the two barrels of turpentine, one of which was taken away by Norman—they were delivered on August 6th—after a cask is sold out it is cut in half and sold for wash<lb></lb>ing tubs; that is also the case with petroleum casks; one of those casks had been used in the ordinary course of business, and the other one Norman took away—I have not seen it since—no turpentine was delivered at my master's place after the 6th August, to my knowledge; that was the last lot, as far as I know—I was daily over the premises to fetch out things required in the business—empty barrels were kept in the shed—there is some paraffin there and treacle—I was there after Air. Monk went down to the Police Court—I am still in his service—I went into the shed often in the months of September and October—there was no turpentine there.</p>

Mr. Ingall was with me when I went to Monk's place—I found Monk at King's Road—I believe after we came out of Manor Street he asked whether I should like to look over the premises in the King's Road—after Mr. Ingall had identified the cask, Monk said that he had bought two casks of turpentine of Price's—I would not be positive that he said that the cask so identified by Mr. Ingall was one of those two—I won't swear that he did not say so—I asked him to go down to the station—I did not ask him to go and give evidence—when I left Chelsea I had not made up my mind to give him into custody—Mr. Ingall and I con<lb></lb>ferred together, and we thought the best thing would be that he should be charged—I took him into custody at the Police Court—I told him he would have to come to the station; he did, and Mr. Ingall charged him—the barrel of turpentine was left at Monk's place—I placed a mark on it and Mr. Ingall did the same—it was afterwards taken to the Poplar police-station and rolled up against the four other casks which had come from Austin's—I have been perhaps nearly a dozen times to Monk's since the 21st Octo<lb></lb>ber—on 21st October, I saw a man at the Arbour Square Station, whom I now know as the witness Archer, from Charles Price and Co.—at that time the barrels were at Poplar—I did not object to the attorney for Monk seeing them—the inspector did not refuse to let a person from Charles Price &amp; Co. see it—there was no actual refusal—Davis said that two or three barrels were rolled up the court, and two were left in the channel—I would not undertake to say that Davis swore at the Police Court that all five were rolled up</p>

               <p>whether Mr. Gue is in or not—I knew of my master being in trouble, and he knew that I had let this van—I was at the Police Court, but I was not called—he was defended by a solicitor—I don't know who Mr. Lofts is, or where he lives—I considered him an honest man because he looked like one—he was a casual customer—he told me he wanted to remove a few goods from Millwall to Camberwell—he did not tell me he wanted to remove tur<lb></lb>pentine—I booked five casks to Chelsea and five to Peckham, when the man came home at night—the 27th was on a Saturday—it was Friday the 26th I let the van out—the next day Mr. Gue would not allow the van to go out without a driver, so he sent <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> Davis with it—I first saw the turpentine when Savage brought it into the yard—I helped to unload it—I it was about 6. 45—the man desired us to keep it in the yard till the next I morning—I have not seen Lofts since. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I knew Lofts had been a customer on more than one occasion—I knew him by name, and so did my master.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES INGALL</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-called</hi>). I had a conversation with Carr as to the letting of vans, Mrs. Gue being present—Norman and I went to see him some day subsequent to the 21st October, and we asked him whether he had anything to do with the letting of horses and vans—he said he had not, he came occasionally to write up the books, and the entries were made on a slate, from which he wrote up the day-book, which was written in pencil, and his duties were those of an occasional clerk.</p>

I got a search-warrant; we found Mosely at work, at a house in Rosemary-lane, where she had gone from my house - the officer searched her, and found some duplicates on her - we went in a coach to her lodgings; we found Sparey sitting there; she said something to her - the officer found a quantity of things there; they have my wife's name on them; my wife died a few days after this, it gave her such a turn when she heard of it - she had been ill for some time.

I said I had a warrant, and they had better give up the things, which she did - Sparey said, "Moseley had brought them, and told her the sheets would do to shift her bed;" she seemed near her confinement - Moseley said Sparey knew nothing of it.</p>

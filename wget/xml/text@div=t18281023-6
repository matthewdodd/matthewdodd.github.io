I was alarmed about four o'clock in the morning  - I sleep in the back-room, first-floor; I lifted up my window, looked into the yard, and saw a number of watchmen coming up the steps which lead from this passage to my back yard; I went down stairs, and found my yard-door fastened inside, as I had left it the evening before - before I left my bed-room I saw the prisoners apprehended by the watchman in the yard, in the water-closet, and when I went down, I found them in custody - I returned into the house, and went into the back kitchen, which I had left safe the night before; I missed nothing from there, but saw it in great confusion - the cupboards had been emptied, the linen taken out and put on the floor, but not carried away; it was all right the night before - I went up to the front-parlour and found the cupboards there had been opened; they were not locked - the plated spoons and cruet-stands were taken out, and thrown about the floor - Mr. Green's desk, which was found, was in the front-parlour when I went to bed; I missed nothing of my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any other name? A. No: I only left the servant up to let in the lodgers, who were out - she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lodgers might not have gone to the back place? A. They could not force the locks; Mr. Palmer, a merchant, who lives in the same street, keeps the key of the gate of the back-passage, leading from the wharf; I have a back-door from the house to my yard, and another door from the yard to the passage - I found the back-door of the house locked in the morning, but I had left the key in the lock, outside the door; I had fastened the back-door of the house - the persons had got in at the staircase-window; it is the kitchen staircase-window- I had shut that window down myself; it had shutters to it, which I did not fasten - they had moved a ladder to get at it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Salisbury coal-wharf, Strand, which is close behind this house. On the night in question I perceived the iron gate, leading to a passage behind Clint's house, and to some wine-cellars, was broken open - I opened the gate, went in, and picked up a lock, which had been forced off; I proceeded up the passage about thirty yards - the passage is under ground; I there saw a writing-desk, a cash-box, two gentlemen's cloaks, a parcel of papers strewed about, and some letters - I returned, and went into Salisbury-street, closing the gate after me; I got four watchmen - we went through the passage, till we came to No. 7, and I perceived the back-door of the yard wide open, and on the steps I picked up some caps and two veils; I looked about the yard, opened the water-closet door, and saw the two prisoners sitting there, in a sleeping posture - it was four o'clock in the morning, and dark; we had lights: I took them to the watch-house. I found in the pan of the water-closet a large chisel, a stock, two centre-bits, a skeleton-key, a phosphorus-box, matches and candle; the mark on the padlock forced off the gate exactly corresponds with the chisel.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HENRY GREEN. I have apartments in this house, as a place of business. I left a desk and cash-box there a few minutes before five o'clock in the afternoon, in the front room, locked up, and in the morning they were gone; I saw them at Bow-street.</p>

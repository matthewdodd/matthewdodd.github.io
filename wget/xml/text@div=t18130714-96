I gave him some ale; after that I went into the billiard room, and took part of two or three pints of wine, gave the prisoner some, and some sandwiches. When the gentlemen had done playing he played two or three games of billiards, and we were coming home; it was half past ten, or rather later. I was a little forward in liquor; a coach was there waiting for me. I told the prisoner he might ride home to town: he got into the coach, and sat on the right hand side; I sat on the left. After I had been in some time I fell asleep; he awoke me with his right hand in my waistcoat pocket; he took some silver out of my waistcoat pocket: I had a watch without a chain in my pocket; he took that out, and took the silver that was under it; he let the watch fall; that awoke me. After a few minutes he put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took all my silver out of that; he then took my silk handkerchief out of my right hand coat pocket. I let the coach go on until I came near the <placeName id="t18130714-96-crimeloc560">Angel, Islington</placeName>

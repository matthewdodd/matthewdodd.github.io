                  </hi>. On the 1st of January I was at Mrs. Griffith's lodging—I had slept with her the night before—the prisoner came there about nine o'clock in the morning, came into the room where I was, and demanded to come into bed, and to turn my daughter and her baby out—the prose<lb></lb>cutrix said she would not turn a helpless baby into the street for him, and told him to leave the house, for he had no business there—he then took her by the hair of her head, dragged her out of bed into the passage, and there was a scuffle between them—she being rather a powerful woman, got rather the better of him, and got up—as she got on her feet he knocked her down, and, when down, struck her with a knife on the cheek-bone—I saw the knife—she bled—when be struck her, he said, "Take that for what you did in Jones the waterman's case"—she replied, "I was bound over by the Magistrate to do it"—he then ran away.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. On the 17th of October I was in the yard, where the poor of the parish of Shoreditch were breaking stones; Church was there, breaking stones - he took up a hammer and threw over the railings, and shortly afterwards I saw Green go over the bridge with it in his hand, putting it under his waistcoat.</p>

Church was employed there that day; we have missed a dozen hammers - Green was not employed there that day; he had been in to get work, but I would not give him any - I had given him a hammer the day before, and missed it; these two boys were employed to assist their father in breaking stones - they gave information, and the prisoners were apprehended; this hammer belongs to the Trustees of the Poor of Shoreditch.</p>

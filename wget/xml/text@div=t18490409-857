                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, in Chiswell-street. On Sunday, 25th Feb., about ten minutes after nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and bad a cup of coffee, and a slice of bread and butter—they came to three halfpence—he gave me a shilling—I gave him change—I noticed that it was a new shilling of Victoria—I put it into the till—there was one other shilling there of George the Third—the prisoner left, and the officer came in, in about two minutes—from what he said, I took out the shilling which I had received from the prisoner—I cut a piece out of it, bent it, and gave it to the officer.</p>

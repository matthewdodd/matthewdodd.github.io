                  </hi>. I keep a linen-draper's shop in Paradise-street. Chelsea. Redman came to me on the 7th of November, and said she wanted a dress that Miss Coomber had seen in my window—I said I did not know which it was—she said if I showed her tome she would show me the pattern—I took down a quantity—she said tone was it, and would I allow her to take three or four more for Miss Coomber to look at—I knew Miss Coomber very well—she keeps an establishment for ladies, close by me—I allowed the prisoner to take five dresses of mousline-de-laine, which was about fifty yards, but not knowing her, I watched her to Miss Coomber's house—she went in, and I was satisfied—she came back to me in about a quarter of an hour, and said Miss Coomber had selected this dress for herself, but would like her sister to have this other one, but as her sister was not at home, would I allow her to take and leave them—I did so—she did not return—these three dresses now produced are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. About two o'clock in the morning of the 1st of December, I went to Woodland-street, Dalston, where Bird (Redman's mother) lives—I saw her in bed—after searching a room, which was pointed out by the husband as Redman's room, I asked Bird if she had seen her daughter bring home any mouseline-de-laine dresses, or shawl, or had seen her in possession of any watches—she said she had not brought any there, and she had only seen her with a gilt watch, and if her daughter had done any thing wrong, she was innocent—I searched the house again, about five-o'clock in the afternoon, after the examination be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate, and in the front parlour, which was Bird's room, I found in the neck of a bottle, thrust in as a cork, three duplicates, one for a watch, pledged for five guineas—I then questioned Bird—I said I had information of some mouseline-de-laine shawls and watches being brought home—she most solemnly denied that such things had been brought there—on the following Friday I went and found this dress there—I said to Bird, "I have called once more to know if you still persist in your story, that your daughter has brought nothing home?"—she said she had not—I said, "Have you not redeemed any thing since then?"—she said, "Oh, my God! I have, I did it to save my daughter"—this dress had been pledged while Redman was under examination, and redeemed that night.</p>

Q.</hi> The dress was not hid away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was wrapped up with other articles, as it came from the pawnbroker's—Bird appeared very much distressed and agitated—I did not go and question the daughter in prison—I went with a message from her, but I found my error, and left—I had no conversation with any one, from the time I saw the daughter till I had the conversation with the mother—I took a note of the first conversation—the daughter told me nothing of the mouseline-de-laine.</p>

I am a detective officer—on 20th June I saw the prisoner Elizabeth Stevenson in a cab in Sprake's custody—he said "this woman has some of the silk and crape that was stolen, in her possession"—she said, "I will tell you the truth, it was given to me by a man to pledge"—I said, "Do you know that man?"—she said, "I have seen him before; I keep a coffee-house, and he uses it; though I do not know his name, or where he lives—my sister and son can tell you more about him"—I took her to the station—she gave her address, 5, Winkworth Place, City Road—I afterwards went there with another officer—it is a coffee-house—I saw Thomas Stevenson and Fleming in the front room on the ground floor—I asked Stevenson for Thier, the man I supposed to keep the house—he said Thier was in the country—I then went back, and a servant showed me a bedroom where I saw Brewer in bed—I told her I was a detective officer, and that her sister was in custody on a charge of stealing some crape and silk, and had said that a man had brought it there, and that she could tell me about it—she said she knew nothing at all about it—I then pointed to some goods that were in the window, and asked her to whom they belonged—at that moment Fleming came into the room, and she said, "Go out, John"—he went out and she then said, "that young man brought them"—I told her I should search the place, and take her into custody—I left the room that she might get up and dress herself—I returned in two or three minutes, and then searched the room, and, in a drawer of the looking-glass, I found seven duplicates, the whole of which relate to silk and crape pledged on 19th June for the sum of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked how she accounted for the possession of those, and she said that she knew nothing at all about them—I then went into the front room—I found the five pieces of crape and two pieces of silk produced in the adjoining room to that in which the prisoner was in bed—I found also a large quantity of goods in the same room in which Brewer was sleeping—they do not relate to this transaction—I asked her who those two men were down stairs—she said one was a waiter who came there occasionally, and the other was a customer who came there by chance—I then went down stairs and saw the two male prisoners and two women that I knew about the town—I asked Stevenson what he was—he said his name was Stevens, and he was a waiter—I then asked Fleming his name, and he told me, and said he was only a customer—I asked him if he was the young man who was with the woman upstairs—he hesitated a little, and said, "I am"—I said to Stevenson, "I think your name is not 'Stevens,' but 'Stevenson,' you come from Shadwell, and are the husband of the woman now in custody"—he said, "I will tell you no lies, I am"—he was taken to the station.</p>

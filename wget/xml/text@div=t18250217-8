On the 7th of February, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, he came in to go to work, and was alone in the bake-house. I concealed myself, and saw him take a bag with flour in it, and secrete it under the flour bin. I said nothing; but about twenty minutes past eight o'clock next morning, when he left to go to breakfast, I got an officer, who took him; 3 1/2 lbs. of flour were found in a paper bag in his hat, with my name on it, and two rolls in his pocket. I allowed him 23 s. a week, and bread and beer to eat in the house, and three 2 lb. loaves for his wife - he had no authority to take flour or rolls off the premises without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are not your men allowed bread, so that they do not take too much? A. No. I never told Shepherd that I permitted the prisoner to take what bread he liked - I said what I allowed him, and that if he asked for more I should have given it to him; I always gave it to him, and did not permit him to take it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did he secrete the flour under the bin? A. He took it from the shop into the bake-house, and put it under the bin, so that nobody could see it without going on their knees, and looking right under.</p>

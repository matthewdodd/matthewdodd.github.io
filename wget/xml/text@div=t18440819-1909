                  </hi>. I live in Gun-street, Spitalfields. On the night of the 15th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in Petticoat-lane—I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I turned round, and laid hold of his hand—he got his hand out, and my handkerchief in it—he had got the hand<lb></lb>kerchief clear out of my pocket when I laid hold of his hand.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody—I found a great number of people about him—some parties were attempting to rescue him, when I first went up—his coat was off his back—the prosecutor had got him by his neckerchief, with his left hand, and his own handkerchief in his right, which he said he had taken out of the prisoner's hand.</p>

Last Thursday evening, as I was coming home, I saw a crowd of persons in Petticoat-lane, and heard a cry for a policeman—I went up, and saw the prosecutor having hold of the prisoner—I heard the people say he was not the man, he was not guilty, that three boys who had run away were the thieves that took the handkerchief—the prose<lb></lb>cutor answered, "No, he is the man"—I did not see the three boys.</p>

On the 1st of August, about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came in and called for a glass of porter; my hat hung by the yard door, in the passage - he asked me to show him backwards: he would pass my hat - he came out of the yard, drank part of his porter, and wanted me to take the rest; I saw some bulk under his coat, and suspected him - he left the house, and in half a minute I missed my hat; I went and overtook him about ten yards off - he ran about two hundred yards; I followed, and saw him stop, then walk on a few paces, and pull my hat from under his coat - I immediately collared him, and gave him in charge; he had his own hat on.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

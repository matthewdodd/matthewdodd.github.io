I had just come from the country on the 26th of October, and was inquiring for work in Kingsland road. The prisoner came up and asked if I wanted work. I said I did. He said his master wanted a man, and would give 25 s. per week. He then took me towards <placeName id="t18181202-94-crimeloc526">Whitechapel</placeName>

I did so, he took it, and immediately ran away with it. I followed, but lost him. I went and inquired for him where he said his master lived, but found it was false. I afterward met him in Kingsland-road, and gave him in charge. He said he had pledged the frock, and gave me the duplicate.</p>

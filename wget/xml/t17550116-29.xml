            . On the 27th of December, our doors were fastened at ten o'clock, when we went to bed. I was the last that went to bed. We have two doors, one to the street, the other to the yard; in the morning the street door was fast, as usual; there was no place broke to get in; we know not which way the thief got in, except, he got in before we went to bed, and concealed himself in the house, and then let himself out at the back-door, which we found open. The next morning, from off a horse behind the kitchen-door. I missed three pair of stockings, an ironing-cloth, a short gown, two scarlet cloaks, and a damask waistcoat, and some thread from out of a drawer. My husband went down into the cellar, and called me down; there they had been trying to steal the lead from the copper; it was loosened all round, but I had got up betwen twelve and one, and I suppose that had sent them away. The officer of the night came to me, and asked me if I had been robbed? I said, yes. He asked me, if I could tell the things when I saw them? My daughter looked on the inside of a pair of pumps, which he brought; there was her name wrote in them. Then we went to Sir

            . I was coming to my labour about a month ago, I don't know the exact day, Ratcliff clock had struck two I thought; I heard somebody walking after me, but I could not see any body. When I came to the bottom of Farthing-fields, coming into Gravel-lane, I saw this watchman knocking at a door; I went on; I heard some body call out stop thief; I had a stick in my hand, and a dog with me; I went to the bottom of the place, and stood under the shadow of the house. I heard a running, which I took to be two or three persons. I saw the prisoner turn at the corner, I stept over to him, and said, where are you running? He made use of some bitter oaths, the watchman still kept crying out. I laid hold of the prisoner, and delivered him to the watchman; he carried the prisoner to the watchhouse, and I carried his bundle along with him.</p>

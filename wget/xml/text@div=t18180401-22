On the 12th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, my father was out - He asked the price of a gold curb-chain which he saw in the window, I told him, two guineas at random, I did not look at it. He requested me to shew it him, which I did. He asked me the weight of it? I told him I did not know. During this time, a lady and children came in - I went and called my mother-at that moment he ran out with the chain in his hand. I immediately pursued him, calling Stop thief! - He ran down Northumberland-alley - A person ran with me; the prisoner threw the chain down an area as he ran; he ran up a court where there was no thoroughfare, we took him, and brought him back - I never lost sight of him. A man shewed us the chain in an area, and said he saw him throw it down - I gave him in charge; the chain was taken out.</p>

            . I am a clerk. I followed the prisoner with Taylor. I first saw him running about ten yards from the house. I pursued down Northumberland-alley, and took him. He said he had not stolen any thing. As we went back, a person said the prisoner had thrown it down the area of an uninhabited house. Taylor got it out with a rake.</p>

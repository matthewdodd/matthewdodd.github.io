On the 12th of July, at two o'clock in the morning, I thought I heard a noise; I got out of bed and heard the church clock strike two, and my own clock also; I listened for ten minutes, and hearing no further noise, on getting into bed again, I awoke Mrs. Pascall - I heard the noise a second time, and got out of bed - I could not find the key of my chamber door for some time, and it was three o'clock when I got down stairs; when I heard the second noise it was light enough to see some distance - the noise was the falling of the Venetian blind; I found the bolts of the parlour door strained open, and missed every thing from the side-board except a large carving-knife, which was placed there as if for self-defence; I missed all the things enumerated in the indictment; I cannot say that I saw them all there the night before; the outer sash of the window was lifted up, and the lower hinge of the lower inside window shutter was burst open, and so the bar was pushed up. On the 14th, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, Levy called and informed me he knew where the property was - I had before that offered a reward of 50l.; in consequence of what passed between me and Levy, I and a friend went to Dr. Beal's, at nine o'clock at night, and met Levy - we went with him into the neighbourhood of the prisoner's house; Levy stationed us where we should find the prisoner - it was then about half-past ten o'clock; we all went to the prisoner's door in Well-street; I saw him and brushed against him - I had four or five persons with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140017"></xptr>me; he said "What the devil are you doing here;" Levy said "That is the man;" and I collared him; he hove me down, and I fell upon him; he had a canvas frock on, and in the scuffle an immense quantity of glass fell from his person - it was part of the property I had lost. He was secured and taken to Dr. Beal's, and sent to the watch-house. Levy proposed we should go to a hedge in Bow-lane, about half a mile from Well-street, and after looking in the hedge with a light, we found a quantity of my property (a pair of bronze candlesticks, and other things) which I knew to be mine; from there we went to the watch-house - the prisoner had then been searched; I said"Oh, Hayes, I am sorry to see you in this situation;" his reply was that he had found the things. I knew there was such a man before, and have occasionally employed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You had employed him? A. I sometimes employ three hundred men in a day; I do not recollect employing him, but I am told that I have. I offered a reward on the evening of the 13th- Levy had not called then; the prisoner was searched before I got to the watch-house; it was dusk when we apprehended him; Levy was near us when the glass fell from him - some of it broke, and some was picked up whole; the glass was not marked; the value of the property found in the field is about 25l., for the watch was not found; some of the glass was in the field. I value all my property at 50l., including the watch - I gave 5l. for that, and eighteen guineas for the chain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came down at three o'clock, was it light enough to see a man's countenance? A. No; the day had began to break; there were two men under my window, but I could not see what colour their jackets were. My bill offers a reward in proportion to the property recovered, on conviction.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Borer's-buildings, Cutler-street, Houndsditch, and am a dealer in foreign curiosities. I first saw the prisoner on Friday, the 14th of July - he came up to me in the middle of Poplar, and asked me if I would buy any things of him; I asked what things - he said cut glass; I had seen bills about the street - it struck me they might be the same goods, and I said I would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill advertised a reward? A. I was too much agitated to think of the reward - I was thinking more about the prosecutor's robbery. He took me to his house in East India-court, Well-street, Poplar, and told me to call on him at nine o'clock. I left him, went about my business for two or three hours, and then went to the prosecutor's, supposing it was his property, but I did not know it. I went at nine o'clock by appointment, and found him at his house; he took me to a field behind a hedge, in the road leading to Bromley, Middlesex, by Bow; before we got to the field he shewed me a silver hunting watch, with a ribbon to it; he said "The things I am going to shew you are queer;" I understood his meaning - he took me to the field, searched along the hedge for two bronze candlesticks, and two cut wine-glasses; he said "D-n it, I cannot find these - I suspect somebody has found them;" he searched further, and found a silver salt-spoon, a china knife-rest, and four shells; he said "I must leave this place, and come somewhere else;" he crossed over the hedge, took me to a ditch, knelt down, pulled up his sleeves, and pulled out two decanters, a handkerchief with eight wine glasses in it, three cut-glass salt-cellars and stands, two cut-glass butter pots and stands: he asked me to purchase these things of him; I asked how much he wanted for them; he said 30s. - and, not with a view of buying, I offered 15s.; he said he would not take it, but I should have them for 18s. I accompanied him towards home, and when he came to the hedge where he had been before, he crossed over, and put some of the cut-glass there: we proceeded on towards Captain Pascall's; he said "You may as well have these things - we are near the place I took them from." We went towards his house, and on the way he asked if I would have them - he would not take less.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get to his house? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I had stationed the prosecutor and his friends in a court; I went to the prisoner's house with him, and directly after he was taken by the prosecutor and his friends - he was giving the glass to his wife in the court. I went out of the court, gave Captain Pascall a signal and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say he came up to you in the street, and told you this story, all at once? A. He did; he was a perfect stranger. I had seen the bills up very near his house - he had the same opportunity of seeing them as I had - the bills were in High-street - he lived about three minutes walk from there - I went to no officer but went to the prosecutor about seven o'clock; I intended to do it at the time, but had business to attend to at two or three places, where persons had goods to dispose of; I met him about one o'clock - about three minutes walk from the prosecutor's; I had to go to Blackwall - it would be out of my way to call on the prosecutor going there; I thought if I went when I had done my business it would be just time to attend to the prisoner at nine o'clock; I did not get home till one o'clock at night; I went to the prosecutor's about six o'clock; I was agitated, but was determined to attend to it; I knew a reward was offered.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath is it for the sake of the reward, or public justice that you do this? A. Public justice; I do not care about the reward a bit; I certainly expect it as it is offered, if the prisoner is convicted, as it is on conviction; such a thing never happened to me before; I have been about the neighbourhood daily for four years, and he might know me by sight; I never spoke to him nor saw him before; he did not tell me where the things were - it was not the first time I heard the word queer - it means stolen; I do not keep a shop - I deal with eight or ten respectable tradesmen; I sell goods as I buy them, and keep them at home - I live with my father; I met the prisoner three or four miles from my house; I told nobody of this till I got to the prosecutor's; I had seen the bills about eleven o'clock that morning; I did not tell him of the bills; it would be giving him an opportunity of making away with the property. I was agitated but knew what I was about; as he told me to call at nine o'clock I did not suppose he would take the property away before; he took me to his house - his wife was present - I could not tell what the property was till he shewed it me, and could not be certain it was the prosecutor's; he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140018"></xptr>not tell me I was to go to the fields, but said he would take me somewhere; it was agreed that the prosecutor should wait at Dr. Beal's, while I went with the prisoner, and saw if they were the goods; nobody saw him shew me the property in the fields; two persons passed but took no notice. The prosecutor does not claim the watch which he shewed me.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's service.

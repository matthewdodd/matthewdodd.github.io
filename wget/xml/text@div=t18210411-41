I was employed by the prosecutors to pay bills for them, ever since 1818. On the 24th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the coach-office, and brought the box containing this money home. I opened the box in the shop and took it into the back room, to count ready for the clerk when he came - the room joins the shop. I have a little warehouse behind. I found it all right, and put it in separate papers, and put it in a chest in the middle room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it in the box in which it came - A. No, I put it in a chest, my wife came in the room at the time I was counting it. Johnson and the other prisoner, who is my son, were in the house at the time, passing backwards and forwards; they were filling a water butt, which my son had asked him to assist in filling - he was an acquaintance of my son's; his father is in the spinning way. I went up stairs for five minutes or more, as I had left a glue pot on the fire. When I came down, I believe they were still in the house, but cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them after you came down - A. Yes, I saw them several times in the course of the morning, going backwards and forwards; then both went away before the clerk came, which was about eleven o'clock. I do not think they left half an hour before that; when they left, one went to the right and the other to the left; they did not go out at the same time. I think my son went out first, the other about a quarter of an hour afterwards. When the clerk came for the money, I went to the chest, and found it was gone. I had left the key in the box; I wrote to inform the prosecutors of the loss - there was nobody in the house except them and my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who came in or went out while you was up stairs, you cannot tell - A. Nobody came in to my knowledge. I opened the box on the shop-board, any one passing might see it, but I did not undo the papers till I got into the room; they were wrapped up in paper, and string round them. I did not shut the back room door - the clerk came about eleven o'clock. My son left the house about an hour and a half after the parcel arrived. They surrendered themselves before the Magistrate. My wife told my son of the loss immediately as we missed it - he declared he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the room was the chest - A. Close by the door leading from the shop - the shop door was open.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Could any one in the street have seen you put the property in the chest in the back room - A. I should think not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in their hands - A. No; Johnson had been on the Tuesday before, and bought a pair of shoes for 10 s. 6 d., which he paid for in silver. I saw nothing in his hand.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. I found Walker at his father's house, on Saturday, the 31st of March - he was in his business. I examined the lower room, the chest was pointed out to me; I observed its situation, and think it was not possible to be seen from the street - I did not go into the street to look; it was placed in a nook on the left hand of the door. I believe the hinges of the door are on the right.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the extremity of the box from the door - A. About nine inches. I should think there was not more than sufficient room for a person to stand between the box and the opening of the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the shop door in the middle - A. The shop door is on the left hand, and the room door on the right; there is not a direct view through the two doors. a person looking through the window, can see into the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable, I took up the prisoner; he confessed he had received the snuffer stand of Metford (who was executed for stealing the plate last Friday at Kensington) and sold it for thirty-two shillings to a Jew; he said Metford told him one captain Cowley was dead, and had left him the plate, and he brought it to his house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had the misfortune to break my leg last summer; I met Metford in the street, he was overjoyed to see me, he took me to a public house, and gave me some beer; he said he had been at sea four years, and the captain owed him thirty pounds, and he would be a friend to me; he went out, and in two or three days returned, and said he was but just in time, the captain is dead, and was buried on the Saturday; that he had made his will, and he should have all his money at the year's end, and he had given him all his plate (he was a great favourite of the captain's;) I asked him where his hat-band was; he said, the executor has got it; said I, what have you in your bag; said he, this is the plate, and out he pulled a silver tea-kettle, a snuff-stand, five large spoons, and other things; said I, this is a very fine present indeed; said he, there was another spoon, but I have pawned that, for I had no money. I lodged in New-street, Seven-Dials; we had some dinner and strong-beer; we went to bed; the next day, when we got up, now, said he, I told you I would be a friend to you, I will make you a present of this snuffer-stand, and gave it me; I said, God bless you, I am greatly obliged to you; I went and met a Jew in the street, we went under a gate-way, he had scales and weights, he gave me a crown an ounce for it, it came to thirty-two shillings, I paid away some of the money where I owed it.</p>

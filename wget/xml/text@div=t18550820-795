I remember the prisoner coming to business on Mon<lb></lb>day, 30th July, about half past 9 o'clock—about half past 12 or 1 o'clock he asked leave to go away for half or three quarters of an hour—I told him to be back as quick as possible; he left and did not return that day or the next—I then went to him and asked him where Mr. Rasch's watch was—he was down stairs taking his breakfast, it was about 1 o'clock—I asked him if he was ill—he said, "Yes"—I said that I did not think he looked very ill—he said that Mr. Rasch's watch was at the office—I asked him if he was quite sure; he said, "Yes; I have no watch at all about me;" showing his pockets—I asked him a third time, and he said that he was quite sure—I searched everywhere for the watch before and after that, and the workmen searched with me, and we could not find it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I received a little after I had been at the prisoner's house on Tuesday; it is in his writing—no, this came on Wednesday, by the post mark—I received two or three letters from him of the same description, and that is the reason why I did not remember—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir, I started away from home this morning with the intention of coming to business, and calling on the doctor on the way, although far from well; and he advises, if possible, to stay away. Under these circumstances, I must beg of you to excuse me till to-morrow, when I shall be quite well, and fit for business. I will call in the afternoon, if I can. "Addressed, "Mr. J. Stauffer.

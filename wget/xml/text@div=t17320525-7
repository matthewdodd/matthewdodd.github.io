               <p>Henry Watkins. I made fast my Doors and Windows about Ten at Night, and went to Bed. I was called up between Four and Five next Morning, and found my back Window was broke so as a Man might get in. My fore Window-shutter was unbarr'd, and the Casement open. I miss'd my Goods. Mr. Brown afterwards inform'd me that some such Goods as I had lost had been offer'd to Sale in the Neighbourhood by the Prisoner. I got a Warrant and searched the Prisoner's Lodging. I found these 2 Handkerchiefs in his Pocket; my Bed, and these two Plates in his Room. On farther Information, I found more of my Goods in Hog-lane, where they had been sold by the Prisoner.</p>

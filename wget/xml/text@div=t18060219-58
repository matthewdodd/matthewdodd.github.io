               <p>Q. Was he at that time employed under Mr. Miles. - A. Yes, he is his apprentice. On the 15th of February, I observed him coming down the yard from the carpenter's shop, on our premises, I observed something bulky on one side of his frock, I immediately went out of the accompting house, and stopped him in the passage; I asked him what he had got there, he said it was a piece of wood, upon which Mr. Lee came out of the accompting house to know what he had got there, he said it was a piece of wood; Mr. Lee lifted up his smock-frock, and took from him the bag and the nails; he was taken into the accompting house, and detained there till Mr. Lee had paid the workmen, and then he was taken to the public office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account about these nails. - A. He did not; I produce the nails, they are the property of Messrs. Quinton and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live near him? - A. Yes; very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what parish it is? - A. In St. Leonard's, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being near that house about the end of August? - A. On Tuesday, the 31st of August, about eleven in the forenoon, I was in my own privy, where I had a view of the door of Mr. Brady's house; I saw the prisoner go in at the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No; but I am sure he is the man; he went in at the front door, he had an instrument in his hand, which I saw him very plainly move; the door opened; and he went in.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any body with him? - A. There was another in company, but he did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut afterwards? - A. Yes; as soon as I saw him go in, I called to my man that was at work for me in the shed, and told him to bring a stick, and follow me immediately, for there was a thief gone into Mr. Brady's house; I immediately ran, and called upon Fitzgeorge; as I went along, I desired Fitzgeorge to go round to the back door, and sent my man to watch upon the wall even with the front of the house; and I kept the front door myself; I had alarmed all the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the door to see if it was fast? - Yes, and it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the door at which the man had gone in? - A. Yes; I might wait five, or six, or ten minutes, for any thing I know, or somewhere thereabouts; people came about, but nobody would believe there was any body in the house; my man was impatient, he jumped down from the wall, and looked through the key-hole; I immediately looked through the key-hole, and saw a man; I desired one of the people to fetch an axe, and I would break the door open on a minute, and immediately upon that, the door was opened from within; the prisoner forced himself against me, and tried to force me backwards; my man immediately assisted me, and we took him; Fitzgeorge and I searched the house; I left the prisoner in custody of my man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. I observed the bed thrown off the bedstead on to the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the upper chamber? - A. In the one pair of stairs room; the sheets and blankets were on the floor, on the right hand, by the side of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they loose upon the floor? - A. All, except the bolster and one blanket, and a matrass, which were on the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they folded up, at all? - A. No; loose in a heap; then we took the prisoner to Worship-street; I saw him searched, and there were found upon him two picklock keys, and an iron crow, one of the keys had a double end.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. They were in his breeches pocket, between the breeches and the lining; one key and the crow were on one side, and the other key on the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Courthorpe. Q.These things appeared to be just thrown down, in such a way that the person last up might have thrown them there? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not previously locked the door? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember your master calling for something to break open the door? - A. My master placed me upon the wall; I would not believe there was any body in the premiles, and I got off the wall, looked throught the key-hole, and saw a man stooping down, and doing something to his shoe, but what I cannot tell; I was coming to the wall again, I heard my master call for a large axe, and immediately saw the door open, and my master got hold of the prisoner; I immediately laid hold of him, and held him while my master and Fitzgeorge went into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not go into the house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Speak of the house where the wife lived? -The house that the prisoner went into, is not the house Mrs. Brady lived in; there is a party-wall between the two houses; it is now Mr. Brady's</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he had it in his possession for the use of his own family? - A. I cannot say; I think, as near as I can recollect, five or six months, I am not certain; it adjoins to his own garden, and the green-house extends from Mr. Brady's house to this little house adjacent; I went with another man, a baker, and fixed him upon the wall while I went over into Mr. Morris's garden, and just as I was jumping over the sence, the man had unlocked the door, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who the man was that came out? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, or Burland, first go up stairs to the bed-room? - A. We all three went up togethers, as near as could be; I found the clothes and the bed on the floor, except the pillow, which laid upon the matrass, with a blanket solded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner searched? - A. No; I left Mrs. Marsom, and other people, to take care of the house till somebody came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment of the whole of these things? - A. The three blankets were worth at least a guinea and a half, and I would not make the bed under ten pounds.</p>

               <p>On last Thursday evening, while my master and I were damping these cloths, he was on the outside and I the inside of the shop; as he damped them he laid them by him. I heard my master cry, Stop thief! and ran down the buildings. I went out of the shop and round the buildings to meet him; I met the prisoner; he appeared much out of breath; I stopped him; he said, What do you stop me for? He had not got any thing. My master came up at this time with the pieces in his hand, and said, the prisoner had dropped them.</p>
               <p>- HOLLER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the Compter. When he was asked if he was guilty, he said he was guilty. Somebody laughed, and then he said he meant he was not guilty.</p>

               <p>The man stopped me, and said I had taken some of his master's linen. I wonder how any man can swear to a person's back.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did you at any time lose sight of the prisoner? - I did not.</p>

I said, Yes: said he, I have got a few houshold-goods to dispose of, that may be of use to you, or any poor man; I said, what are they? he said there are some copper pots and some plates: I said I would buy them, if they were within my reach; I told him where I lived. They brought the goods the night following, about nine o'clock: Murphy had the great copper on his head, Lee had the other parcel on his shoulder, that is, a fire-shovel, tongs, poker, a pewter pot, a dozen of plates, a brass cover, and a saucepan; when I saw them, I said, I would not be concerned if you would let me have them for six-pence, therefore take them away. Murphy seemed to be daunted at these words; then I said, if they would set a price on them, and come on the next day, I would pay for them. The next day I had an opportunity of seeing the news-papers, and found they were advertised; when they came, I put them off, and apply'd to the prosecutor, and from thence to Justice Welch: they sent Mr. Langree with me, and a warrant; then Mr. Peterson came, and they put me in the Round-house.

             took two brass candlesticks out, and pawned them, and brought in two pots of beer with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, then he did not: we came home again that night, and Murphy and I sat up in Fox and Knot court, to black the pots and saucepans, to make them look as if they had been used. The next morning, we took the rest of the goods in a hamper and a bag, to Mrs. Innis's, and Courtney and his wife went about to some brokers, to see if they could sell part of them. Courtney brought a broker, and when he came, Courtney bid me go out at the door: after that, they said they sold the two beds for 12 s. after that his wife said it was but 9 s. Courtney carried one of the beds away to the broker's; Muckleroy was waiting for us at the Wheelwright's arms; there we went and divided the 12 s. Murphy told me that Courtney's wife had pawned one of the small pots, for 4 s. so we divided 16 s. we had liquor and victuals, which we all paid part towards. Then we went to Mrs. Innis's, in order to take the rest of the things to Mr. Kelley's house: Courtney said, nothing should be touched, saying, he had as much right to them as we had, and he struck Muckleroy. We came away, and Murphy went back to lie there: that same evening. Muckleroy and I carried the other goods to Kelley's: he looked at them, but did not like them: he lent us a couple of shillings, and said money was short with him, but if we came in the morning, we should have the money. In the morning, Muckleroy, Murphy, and I went there; he put us off till night, but we did not go that night. On the Saturday night, Murphy and I left Muckleroy's lodgings, and went to Mr. Kelley's, to take the goods away, or be paid: Murphy would go no farther than London-bridge and said he would wait there till I came. If I had brought the goods back, we were to carry them into Kent-street, but Mr. Kelley stopped me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170014"></xptr> Then I told them where to find Murphy, and went with them to London-bridge, where they took him, and carried him and I before Justice Welch. Mr. Welch granted a warrant to search Mrs. Innis's house, but they had taken care, to that none of the goods we left there could be found.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is this warehouse part of your dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It joins to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door goes out of your house into the warehouse, without going out into the street?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, there is not. There is only a door that opens into the street.</p>
               <p>Muckleroy's Defence.</p>

            . I live in Short's-gardens. Muckleroy has lodged at my house two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Lee at your house?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. from Muckleroy. Whether I was not at home that night this fact is sworn to be done?</p>

               <p>Macartney. I know he was in my house that night, and the next morning about 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was that?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I hear it was about the 24th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I cannot say rightly what day of the week; it was on a Saturday night I think, but am not very sure: I saw him go to bed, and he lay in bed till 11 o'clock on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go to bed?</p>
               <p>Macartney. Between 10 and 11; my wife and I lie in the same room, in another bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Lee lodge?</p>
               <p>Macartney. He lodged at my house; he in one room, and Muckleroy in another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many weeks ago is this?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I don't know. I know Muckleroy lay at home every night he lodged with me: I was at work at home (I am a piece of a taylor). I always saw him go to bed every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Lee often?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I did: he lodged with me about six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Muckleroy and Lee much acquainted?</p>
               <p>Macartney. I cannot say whether they were or not.</p>

               <p>Murphy's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to carry the goods to Kelly's house, at Lee's request, but did not know that they were stolen: he said they belonged to his aunt. I am but lately discharged from the army.</p>
               <p>Courtney's Defence.</p>
               <p>Murphy and Lee came to my father-in-law's house, about seven or eight at night; they asked me whether I could let them have a gallon of beer? Lee asked me if I could pawn some things that belonged to his aunt: I said, I could not: a woman there said she could. He gave her two candlesticks, and she went and pawned them, and they got some beer; that is all I know.</p>

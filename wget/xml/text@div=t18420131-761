                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Tottenham Court-road. On the evening of the 21st of January the prisoner came there, and had a cup of coffee—I saw him take a "Times" newspaper, and put it into his bag—I immediately went and called a policeman—he said I had accused him wrongfully—I went to the station, saw his bag searched there,</p>

               <p>and the "Times," the "Sun," and "Bell's Life in London," with two of my knives, found in it—on going home, I missed a "Sun" end "Bell's Life in London," of the same date as those found in the bag—I know the "Times" by marks of ink on it.</p>

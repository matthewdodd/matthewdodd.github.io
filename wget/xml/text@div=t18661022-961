                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Greenwich Board of Works—during the time of the cholera the prisoner was appointed inspector of nuisances for that district—it was his duty to destroy the bed<lb></lb>ding and clothing of persons dying of cholera, and to apply to me for money to purchase articles in substitution of them—he would bring me a list of the things and the value, which I would get properly certificated by the Board, and then pay it to the prisoner—I know his handwriting perfectly well—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing, and also the receipt appended to it—the receipt purports to be that of Robert Poole—it was presented to me by the prisoner, and I handed him the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., believing that he had paid the money to Poole—on the 22nd September my attention was called by the Chairman of the Board to this case of Poole, in consequence of which I called on the prisoner at his house, at Deptford—I said, "I want to speak to you with regard to Poole's case"—he took me into a kind of taproom—I told him I did not believe he had disbursed the money according to the bill which he had produced to me—after much hesitation he told me he had only paid 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was a very bad case, and he must give me the difference at once, which after still further hesitation he did.</p>

I am the son of Lucy Poole, who lately died of cholera—I have no brother or relation of the name of Robert Poole—I can write my name, but I cannot read—I did not make the mark that is to this receipt—about a fortnight after my mother's death I met the prisoner by appointment at the "Mitre" tavern—he did not pay me any money—he asked me my name, and I told him James Poole—he then asked me whether I would have the money then, or whether he should bring it round—I said I would rather have it then, as it would save him the trouble of coming round—he then looked in his book, and said he had not put our claim in, but we should have it on Monday or Tuesday—I was coming away, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have never received any other money from him—he never asked me to sign any paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker, of No. 7, Greenwich Road—I remember being at the "Mitre" tavern with the prisoner on a Saturday—the lad Poole we met outside—we all went inside, and the prisoner asked for pen and ink and a bit of paper, which were supplied him—the prisoner wrote something, but I do not know what it was—he said to the boy, "Put your mark here," and the boy made his mark—I saw him make the mark—when we got outside the prisoner said to the boy, "I wont detain you, you go about your business, and I will see to this and see you again."</p>

I find nothing but the bedclothes"—I also told him that the nurse com<lb></lb>plained that she had not been paid her money—he said that was quite right, he had not paid her, but was going to do so; he also said that he had money in abeyance belonging to the boy Poole, and was going to hand it over to him—I told him that if he would act upon my suggestion, instead of giving the boy the money, he would lay it out in some useful manner for him—he said he thought he would act on my suggestion, and then left my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse slaughterer, and live in East Mount-terrace, Whitechapel. On the 13th of Jan., about eleven o'clock, I went into my loft near the slaughter-house, and found a horse's heart and liver which had no busi<lb></lb>ness there—the prisoner was my servant—I returned about two o'clock, and they were gone—I went to a corn-bin, and found a pail about half full of horse-grease—I had the prisoner watched—I had marked the heart and liver, and know it is mine, because I had a horse in the place without a heart and liver—the fat had no business where it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to Monk's, concealed myself, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go to the stable where the loft is—I went out into the court, and the pri<lb></lb>soner passed me with a sack over his shoulder, and looked very hard at me—I followed him into Whitechapel-road—he looked back two or three times—I said to him, "It is a rough night," and asked if Monk was over in his yard—he said no, he believed he was over at the Nelson—I went into Monk's house with the prisoner, asked to see Mrs. Monk, and asked her to see what was in the prisoner's sack—I heard her ask, "What have you got here?" and found the heart and liver at his feet.</p>

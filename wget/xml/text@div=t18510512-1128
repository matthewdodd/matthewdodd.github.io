I produce a sheet pledged by the prisoner, on 19th April—I am sure of her, I had seen her before—she came again on the 24th, and brought this other sheet, with the corner cut off—I asked her if it was her property—she said, "Yes"—I went to see my master about it, and when I came back she was gone, leaving the sheet.</p>

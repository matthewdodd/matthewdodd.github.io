               <p>Q. Was any body near enough to take them away beside the prisoner? A. Not a soul was near besides her and the lady - the lady could not have taken them; they were worth 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. She had been to your stall before? A. Yes - she never bought any thing; I never knew her husband before she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not her husband stop you at Acton for hawking shoes? A. I never was a hawker in my life; I was selling shoes at Brentford - I go to public markets; mine is a stall, about eight feet long - there was no other person near enough to take them; the market was not crowded - it was between 12 and 1 o'clock; the market was nearly over; she was pregnant - I do not know that she was lame; I followed her as soon as I could, but could not find her - her artfulness prevented my finding her; I did not know whether she went into the crowd, or down the passage to her house - I understand the passage leads to her dwelling, which I did not know before; I sent for the constable and the market-keeper, and described her to them that day; I swear positively that she took them - I made this charge seven weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible she could be about the market two hours without your discovering her? A. I think it was impossible; I never told her if she paid 4s. 6d. she she might go - I was three times before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on one occasion, swear you saw her with the boots; and on another occasion, only that you missed them after she was gone? A. No - she was bailed; certainly, the solicitor wished to compromise the business, but the Magistrate said he would not allow a compromise; she attended the office voluntarily twice, when the Magistrate was not in attendance; the constable had given her notice to come forward.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. No; Mr. Robinson ordered me to come here as a witness for him - he did not take me before the Magistrate; I was ready to go up, but was not called for - he did not ask me to catch her for him.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Widow Furze, who goes out washing - I live at Isleworth. On the day the prosecutor lost his boots, I was in company with the prisoner - we went to his stall: he said, "Good morning, Miss;" and I said, "Good morning, Sir;" that is all that passed - if he has said she was alone, he has sworn falsely: she tried on a pair of shoes, not boots - she bent the soles back; he said, "They are a serviceable pair for you;" she said she was not much in want of them that day: he put them down on the stool himself - we came away, and he wished us good morning; we were publicly about the market together for two hours afterwards; she was lame, and with child - she was confined soon afterwards; she could not have taken the boots or shoes without my observing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The market is held every week, how do you know on what day he complained of losing his boots? A. As near as I can say, it was seven or eight weeks ago; I was with her on the day the boots were lost - it was this day eight or seven weeks; the market day is every Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not with her every Tuesday that she is in the market? A. Yes, very nearly - I always go to market with her; I heard of the boots being stolen about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, I do not know which; I know it was the day he lost the boots, because he says so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you on what day it was? A. No; I know I was with her, because she tried on the button shoes; and he said he lost his boots the day she tried on the button shoes - I was with her all that day: I went before the Magistrate, but was not called for; I was told not to say any thing before I was called - I was persuaded by the people in the Court-room not to speak; I have not mentioned to any body that I was with her all day, from that time to this - I have heard it talked of, but never told any body that I was with her; her husband is employed by a coal-meter - I am a shoe-binder.</p>

No; I declare she never did on any day; I did not tell the witness that it was the day she tried on the button shoes - I have never seen her from that day to this, and never told her any such thing - I never told any person so.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen that you did not give intimation to the person at the next stall, that the prisoner had stolen the boots? A. I merely said to the lady, "Sit still, a person has stolen a pair of boots," and I immediately ran after her; I sung out, "The woman has stolen a pair of boots;" I told the Magistrate I had two witnesses, right and left of me, who would come forward, but he said there was no occasion - the other one was close to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live at Mr. Leader's, a pawnbroker, of Brentford. I was at the Magistrate's office. at Brentford, four or five weeks ago, when the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing the boots; he said he missed the boots after she left the stand; her husband fetched her to the office; the prosecutor said he would give up the charge if her husband gave him 4s. 6d. - she said she would do no such thing, for she was innocent of the charge, and would rather go to prison and perish than pay for what she never had; he said, "So you shall;" she was admitted to bail at the last examination, on the 16th of October - this conversation was on the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was it you heard him say this? A. At Mr. Clark's office - no Magistrate was present that day; Mr. Clark, the Magistrate's clerk, was present, and must have heard it - he said nothing then, but he said afterwards, "Bowley, I think you had better pay the 4s. 6d., and have done with it;" he said, "No, Sir, my wife declares herself innocent; I don't like to pay for what she never received;" she was examined before the Magistrate a fortnight afterwards - this was said at the office - the charge was made at the office, and her husband fetched her there, but the Magistrate was gone; and on the next Tuesday he was ill; on the following Tuesday the case was heard; I was present, but I did not tell the Magistrate of it; I have told different people of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Robinson charge the prisoner with stealing the boots? A. Certainly, and Mr. Clark heard it; he said a pair of boots were taken from the stall, and he supposed that woman to have taken them; he charged her with stealing them.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Magistrate's clerk advised the husband to give 4s. 6d.? A. He said he had better give it; I know the last witness; she was by when the words were made use of; and more than that, Robinson came within ten minutes, and asked the husband to pay 4s. 6d.; the husband said she should go to prison, for she said she was innocent; he said, "So she shall;" he told the Magistrate the first time, they were leather boots, and afterwards that they were worth 5s. 6d., and if he had the 5s. 6d. it was all he wanted; the Magistrate said, "Most people like to have their rights; and some people want more than their rights." I am acquainted with the prisoner's husband.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON re-examined. I did not say if 4s. 6d. was paid, it was all I wanted; the Magistrate did not say what this man has stated, nor any thing of the sort.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and have a house at Hounslow, as well as in London; I attended the office twice, but in consequence of the illness of Mr. Crighton no examination took place; on my cross-examining the prosecutor before Mr. Clithero, I asked him if he had not offered to give it up for 4s. 6d.; he said he had not, but if he was paid for his goods that was all he wanted. Colonel Clithero said people often wished the value of their goods; he admitted having told the husband that if they were paid for, he would not go any further; I did not enter into any conversation with him the first or second time; I was attending on other business as well; as there was no Magistrate the prisoner was allowed to go away, and attended next time, and after the examination she was bailed - the witness Furze stood very near the prosecutor, for the purpose of stating what she knew, and I told Colonel Clithero I had a witness, who was with her at the time, but he said, "He has sworn to the thing being stolen, and you must put in bail;" I am certain, however, that the prosecutor acknowledged then that this woman was with the prisoner, explicitly and expressly; he said, "That woman was with her;" I put it to him whether any woman was with her at the time she stole the boots; he turned round, and said, "Yes, this woman."</p>

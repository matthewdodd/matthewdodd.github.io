On 13th November, about 5 o'clock, I was standing with Garry at the corner of Basinghall Street and Gresham Street—I saw the three prisoners and another woman—the male prisoners were walking in front and the two women behind—I followed them with Garry to the middle of Basinghall Street, which is dark—two of the men stopped there and waited for the women to come up—they all four stood in a group, and appeared to be in conversation for some minutes, and then parted, the two men going in the direction of Fore Street, and the women in an opposite direction, through Mason's Avenue, where we followed them, and through Moorgate Street into Fore Street, where the men came up and spoke to them—they stood in conversation some minutes, and parted again, the women going up Fore Street, and the men down Fore Street towards Finsbury Circus—we followed the men into Camomile Street, where they stopped, and King left Jones and went to the Salisbury Arms, and looked in at the window—Jones then came over and joined him, and they walked to Houndsditch, to the corner of St. Mary Axe—I met Tew and spoke to him—I then seized the two men by their collars over an iron grating—King struggled, and I saw him throw a packet from his right hand, which made a jinking noise, like money—I stooped down and saw a tissue paper packet lying on one of the bars—I picked it up—it contained this bad florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "This is it, is it?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I found nothing on them at the station—on 14th November Hall was brought to the station, and I identified her—I have also seen her on a former occasion—she said that she could prove she was somewhere else at the time.</p>

I am a carpenter—on the evening of 13th Novem<lb></lb>ber, I was in a court in Basinghall Street, with Mitchell, who drew my attention to the prisoners and a second woman—the men walked in front, and the women behind—I followed to the middle of Basinghall Street, and saw King give something to Hall—I was four or five yards from them—they separated, and the men went down Basinghall Street, and the women through Mason's Avenue, round Moorgate Street, into Fore Street again, by the corner of Moor Lane—they stopped there a minute or two, and then the man came up—I am sure Hall is one of the women, and who King passed something to—the men then followed the women into London Wall, up Wormwood Street into Camomile Street—King went and looked in at the Salisbury Arms—Jones joined him, and they went to the corner of Hoimdsditch when Mitchell seized them both, and I saw King pass some<lb></lb>thing from his hand, and heard a jingling noise—it fell on an area, and Mitchell picked it up—Tew seized Jones, who struggled into the road, and tried to get away—he threw something from his right hand, which I picked up—it was the bad florin—I went with Tew to Houndsditch—he went into the area where they had stood, and down which I had heard something jingle, and I saw him find these two bad florins there.</p>

            , who then carried on business in Oxford-street. I employed Avis, the officer; a person was to call and buy some goods on the Saturday, with marked money; Avis marked that money, and he was to send the person - I saw the person who brought the money - she laid out 10s. 6d.; Inches put only 9s. 1d. into the till - I went to the person's house to inquire what she had paid; what the prisoner put in was only 9s. 1d. - I always gave a cheque; the cheque is not here- it was only for 9s. 1d.; the prisoner was afterwards searched by Avis, and some marked money was found on him; the prisoner then wished to speak to me privately, but the officer would not allow him - he said he hoped I would look over it, as it was necessity that compelled him to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner had no salary? A. No; I know that his friends are respectable - his father is a reduced officer in the army; he had been with my brother from fifteen to eighteen months; I have reason to believe he had no means of clothing himself - my brother advanced him, I think, 5s. about three weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he no compensation for his services? A. No; none whatever - he was to serve us two years to learn the trade; we searched the till, and there was more money in it than what I have alluded to - we have no other means of knowing what was put in except by the cheque; he was sometimes employed until eleven o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Supposing a man had half a crown, and put it into the till, and took change, might he not have had this shilling? A. Yes, he might.</p>

As soon as they had finished the conversation which they were upon, I said, how do you do, Mr. Turner; he turned himself round, and said, I was mistaken, he turned towards me from Mr. Sherrott; I said, I could not be mistaken; I said, that he must know me, and I must know him; I told him my name was Robinson, I said, he must know me in the corn market; I said, you live with Messrs. Stonard and Ryland; he said, he did not know me; Mr. Sherrott got warm, said, that he not only wanted to defraud the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, but to ruin him and his family; he was immediately taken into custody; he made answer to Mr. Sherrott, whatever you are loser by it, you shall be paid again; Mr. Sherrott immediately called in the beadle, who was at the door; he said, he was in the hands of justice, and it should take its course.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to look at the receipt - is that the sort of receipt that would be produced to effect a transfer in that stock? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to say that it is necessary to effect it? - A. It is part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many transfers made out without any receipt? - A. Surely so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is a receipt between buyer and seller, and the only receipt that the buyer has under consideration; the transfer is entered agreeable to a ticket that is brought in by Mr. Sherrott for 7000 l. to

               <p>Q. Nothing more then is necessary, than the appearance of the proprietor, in order to sign the book? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. So with respect to the purchaser, and with the person selling, they, according to the monies that pass between them, have a receipt? - A. Justly so.</p>
               <p>Q. But to the transfer it is necessary to have the signature of the clerk of the Bank, and the number? - A. The clerk of the Bank signs the execution of the transfer at the time the proprietor or his attorney signs; with respect to any witness to a receipt, that may or may not take place with the clerk of the Bank, because the witnessing clerk to the receipt has a ticket with the number that the stock is transferred.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You do not consider that as a receipt? - A. That receipt was filled up, and ready to be witnessed by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After the transfer is made, and signed by the proper person of course, and the receipt signed, and the money paid that changes the property, then it would be wrote down on the accompts in the book; you have nothing to do with the receipt at the Bank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Except when it is brought to shew you when it is entered? - A. Certainly, it is an article of reference to us. (The receipt read.)</p>

               <p>W. Waltham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That transaction was only in its progress, without it was signed at the time by the clerk, it is of no sort of use; it could not have the effect of a forgery? - A. It could not.</p>
               <p>Court. The receipt as far as he had any thing to do is perfect; if it had been witnessed by the clerk it would have shewn that he had received so much money, it is in order to shew that something had been done, in another place that upon producing that they may without difficulty come to the transfer, that is the only use of it to the witnessing clerk, it leads his eye directly to the book, but till it is so signed the purchaser of stock only knows that this is the person that sells him the stock, and the witnessing clerk is only a voucher that the transfer has been entered; still this is a receipt; you are right that he has not obtained any of it, but he has executed one instrument, and that one instrument is the receipt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Without the witnessing clerk had signed it, it is not a receipt for money, it is requisite that he should have signed it, and therefore a receipt should be given after rather than before.</p>
               <p>Court. I should think rather before the transfer, for when the transfer is executed, the party has conveyed away his interest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Therefore it is like the conveyance of an estate, they should be done at the same time, afterwards to be delivered over to the purchaser,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200027"></xptr>when the purchaser delivers him over the money, because the broker or the principal will not pay him the money till he sees all the ceremony complete.</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me that the offence with which he is charged is signing a receipt for money; your question is whether this is a receipt for the money, I say a receipt for the consideration of money is a receipt for the transfer; he has signed a receipt for money after all, and in point of fact it matters not whether he did it first or afterwards; he has signed a receipt for the transfer, but when the transfer is complete, there is some mark put on the receipt by the officer of the Bank; then it is a transfer, the other is a receipt; he is not indicted for forging a transfer, he is indicted for forging a receipt; he has put his name upon an instrument purporting to be a receipt, there is something more to be done to it in order to make it a transfer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. This indictment is for forging a receipt, it has nothing to do with a transfer; whether this instrument was for a transfer of property is not the question, that is the use he meant to make of it afterwards, which is immaterial to this charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I used to keep the Robert Peel beer-house at Plaistow—on 23rd February, about 8 o'clock, I was at Blackwall—the prisoner came in and asked me if I knew his wife—I said "No," and that I did not want to know him or his wife—he used bad language to Mrs. Sunderland, and I told him he ought to know better—he said "I will do something to you directly," and made a rush at me—I saw him draw something out of his pocket, I saw it shine—he struck at me with his right hand, and I struck at him with my left, and the knife cut my trowser's leg—I flung him on the bed and then felt something run into my back—I shouted out "He has stabbed me!"—I felt him turning something in my back and I lost all power—he had ran away—I had seen him once before, but never spoke to him—it is Mrs. Sunderland's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Sunderland, of 2,—Queen's Terrace—on the night of 23rd February Meek was at my house—I saw him come in—he asked me to allow him to wash, his hands and face, and I got him a basin and water—the prisoner came in and Meek said "Mr. Lamprell, do you know anything about my wife," and he said "No, and don't want to know"—the prisoner used bad language to me—I was just outside the door—Meek told him not to use bad language—he said that it made no odds to him—the prisoner said "If that was a sister of mine I would punch your head," and made a rush at Meek—I did not see any more, because the table went over and the lamp went out—Meek said. "Bring a light, I am stabbed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband was at sea—the prisoner said "What are you doing with that man in your bedroom and <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> at sea?"—he had been in my room about five minutes before that—he lives down by the Victoria Docks, I do not know how far off that is—I had not seen him before on that day, but I had the day before, when I met him by accident, and we had a glass of ale at the Woodstock—when he came in he took the light out of the room where we were, and took it into the bed-room—I went in after him, when I heard them having a few words; the table was not overturned then; they had not began to fight then—when the prisoner made the rush the table was overturned and the lamp went to the ground, but I saved the bottom of it with my hand—they then fought in the dark—I did not see the prisoner with a knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 9, Queen's Terrace—I examined Meek and found a small angular wound of the shape of the letter L between the seventh dorsal vertebrae and the lower part of the blade bone, about 2 1/2 inches from the spine; it was composed of two incisions, each about an inch deep—there was no danger from the wound itself, because it struck against the bone; if it had penetrated the chest it would have been very serious.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Anything very sharp would do it, but not a piece of glass, because the clothes were cut so clean—the point of an iron nail would not do it; the edges were clearly incised.</p>

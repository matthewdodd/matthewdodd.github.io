A great number came up, and placed themselves in the same position with their backs towards me - there were fifteen or twenty of them, they walked backwards towards me all shoulder to shoulder. I was alarmed, and tried to force out from them by pushing between them and the wall with my shoulders; they forced me back again, and hustled against me - the prisoner was one of them. They enclosed me all round against the wall. I felt a hand come against my watch-chain, and collared the prisoner, who held my watch-chain; I am positive he is the man, I had seen him three or four times before, and am as certain of him as of my own existence - he had been pointed out to me as a thief. I held him by the collar, and saw him pull the watch from me; a hand came between us, and received the watch from him - I have not recovered the watch. Somebody seized my hand, and held me fast; I held the prisoner with the other hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have I got you?" I called out A thief! and immediately they all fell to striking me. My head was so swelled with the blows I could not put my hat on for several days, my neck and shoulders were much bruised - they struck with their fists. I was totally senseless, and do not know what happened to me. When I came to myself I was on the ground, I had forgot what had happened, and felt for my watch - the men were all gone then. I was only senseless a short time, for the crowd with the procession had not got up on my recovering. I saw the prisoner again on the next Friday evening, and knew him instantly. I had a good view of his face, and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you acquainted much with thieves - A. No, only two; the prisoner and another had been pointed out to me as such; when he was pointed out his nose was bleeding, a young man had struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the officer before you came here - A. No. It was about ten minutes before eleven o'clock; the procession had not got up. They all enclosed round me - the blows were struck before my watch was taken - I saw the prisoner take it, I had such a view of him as to identify him immediately - I had an oblique view of him. I think it was the second Saturday after the death of the late King that he was first pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you could swear to him by the colour of his coat - A. No, never in my life. He had an olive brown frock-coat on, black velvet collar, a high shirt-collar, and a fashionable bell-crowned hat; he was always dressed genteel when I saw him. If he was tarred and feathered all over except his face I could swear to him. I described him at the office, and mentioned his particular walk. I could only see the hand of the man who received the watch.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor described the prisoner; one Wright apprehended him, and brought him to me on the Friday following the robbery. I put him with ten or twelve others, and sent the prosecutor into the room, he indentified him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Friday the first time you saw him - A. I saw him on the Tuesday, but was not certain he was the man, and there being two or three together I did not like to take him. The prosecutor described him minutely. I told the prisoner I thought I wanted him, and to come up at seven o'clock in the evening - he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he was tried last Session - A. Yes. I was once an officer of Bow-street, but left in consequence of a family quarrel, and I have a better situation. I have said I believed the prisoner was innocent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say so - A. Because he was very poor, and had nothing about him. I thought if he was a thief he would be better dressed, and there is a man about Whitechapel very much like him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of December, I saw the officer in Salisbury-street, and asked him if he had heard of my being imprisoned for a thing I knew nothing of? he said he had heard of it, and wanted me for a gold watch got near Northumberland House on Monday; I said I could prove where I was. He said if I came up to the public-house at seven o'clock in the evening, he dare say he would make it all right. I did not go, and on Friday another officer took me; I was in the public-house by myself about three hours, and about half-past seven o'clock the officer called out</p>
               <p>"Mike," and told me to go into the parlour to see if the man knew me. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man, I can swear by the colour of his coat." I was at the Swan, public-house, from Friday night till near two o'clock on Monday.</p>

            . I keep a coffee shop in Swan-yard, Drury-lane. About eleven o'clock on Sunday night, the 10th of December, the prisoner came with a female, and engaged a bed - he called her Julia. They passed the night at my house, and next day about a quarter past one o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came down, and ordered a cup of tea and toast, as the female was rather unwell; he went up stairs again. When he came down he had some shoes, or something in his hand to be cleaned; he had not his shoes on, they were only slippers. It was a dirty day, and they appeared dry - I should have observed if he had been out. He returned up stairs - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100007"></xptr>did not see him again.

On the 10th of December, I met the prisoner in the Strand with his brother, about eleven o'clock at night, and walked almost to Westminster-bridge with them; he turned back with me, and went to Swan-yard. I was in his company all night; he got up about a quarter past one o'clock. He did not leave the bed before one - he sent me up some tea.</p>

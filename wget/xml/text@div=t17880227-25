               <p>I live at No. 3, Gun-court; on Saturday, the 9th of February, about a quarter after ten at night, I was coming home with my wife from market; as we were coming into the court, I heard a noise at No. 1, where the prisoners lived; I peeped into the room, it was a casement, and it was not quite shut; I saw the prosecutor lying on the bed, struggling very much; I saw Cowden lying upon him.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was Cowden? - Because I saw her very plain with a light that was upon the mantle-piece; I had known her before she came to live in the court; Storer had her hand on his mouth, and Cutler stood with her backside against the door; I sent my wife to call the watchman; but before the watchman came, Mr. Solomons came out, and said, I am robbed, I am robbed; two women came out, but neither of the prisoners; after that, I saw Cutler run out; then I ran in and saw the prosecutor without his hat; Cowden then gave him his hat again.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutor then in the house, or out of the house? - Just within the house; the watchman came, and we brought Cowden and Storer to the watch-house; about half an hour afterwards, Cutler was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How was this bed situated? - Just as you come in at the door; the window was at the side of the bed, so that you could see any part of the bed, and the foot of the bed came towards the door; upon the Monday they were taken before Justice Wilmot and committed.</p>
               <p>Cutler. Did you see me in the room after you had taken me up by a warrant from the Rotation-office? - Yes, I saw her in the room, with her backside against the door, I had taken up Cutler and Storer that night about seven o'clock, for abusing me; Storer had cut my hand with a knife, and Cutler had taken up a poker, and struck me over the head, and cut my hat, but they were discharged, and were home again before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What business are you? - I deal in old copper and brass, and buy bad shillings.</p>

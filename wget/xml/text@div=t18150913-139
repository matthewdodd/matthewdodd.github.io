The prisoner had apartments in my master's house, and left on the 25th of June; she had five children, two nursery maids, and herself. A man of the name of Carter used to come every day. She usually dined between four and five. She dined on Saturday, the 25th, at about half past one; after dinner was over, the spoons were brought into the kitchen. The servants and four of the children left the house at half past two; Lady Price and her eldest daughter remained behind; she rang the bell, and I answered her; I was called up stairs, and she said, bring up the spoons; I took up one, and put it on the sideboard; Lady Price was in the room then, and nobody else; her daughter was in the yard at the time. They afterwards left the house; the key was not left in the door; I don't know who took it out. Lady Price did not return that night, nor any of her family. The next day a letter came, with something like a key in it; my master opened it, and the key of the dining-room door was in it. We made search, to see that all was right; and the table-spoon was missing, and a pair of sheets. We found no spoon in the lodging. These things were let with the lodging.</p>

The next day I received a letter, which letter contained the key of the dining-room door.

She never afterwards called at my house. I afterwards found her at 56, or 57, Gee-street, Goswell-street. I was not present when the lodging were let.</p>

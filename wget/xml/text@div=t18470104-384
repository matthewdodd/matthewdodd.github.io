                  </hi>. I am landlord of the British Lion public-house, Caven<lb></lb>dish-street, New North-road; the prisoner was my pot-boy. On, Saturday, the 5th of Dec., a little after three o'clock, I gave him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, to get some tobacco, and to get change for the note—he went out, and did not return—at ten minutes past four I went to look for him—I went down Pit<lb></lb>field-street to Mr. Allen's, where I had sent him, to ask if he had been there—I did not find him—I found him when I came back—he said he had lost the note, but he had found the bag in Pitfield-street—I had been there to look for him—I did not find him in the way where he said he had been looking for it—he might have returned home in three quarters of an hour, even if they had kept him a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. The house No. 9, Cook's-court was occupied by myself and partner as offices—the deceased, Ann Broughton, was our servant there for eighteen months—she was the only person latterly allowed to live in the house, that I know of—about three months after she entered my service I found she was married, but I did not know her hus<lb></lb>band ever slept there, and never but once knew he came there—I did not know where he lived—on Saturday night, the 28th of January, about half-past ten o'clock, the deceased let me out, and shut the door after me as usual—I think she was about thirty-eight or forty years of age—she ap<lb></lb>peared to be in very good health—she was a strong, hearty, healthy looking woman—I desired her, on quitting the office, to lay the office fire on Sunday, (but not to light it,) as I must be there on Sunday—I went about five o'clock on Sunday afternoon and knocked and rang several times, but could gain no admission—about a quarter to seven o'clock Mr. Lovett, the surgeon, fetched me, and I saw the woman in the kitchen, by the side of the fire-place—she was dead—she was sitting on a chair by the side of the</p>

B.," but the shirts were not marked—they were men's shirts, and washed, but not ironed, rough dried—I have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>he said, "Broughton"—I loosened him, and he walked into the room on the ground floor, where I was sitting; he sat down on a chair, and I said to him, "Broughton, this is not the coat you had on when you left the house before"—he said, "No, it was not, "He had been to his master's in Little Bruton-street and changed it"—he asked me then to go down stairs into the kitchen—I told him, no, I would rather sit where I was—he then asked me whether I had teen his wife—I said, yes, I had—he sat a few minutes, and said it was a very bad job, but he did not know how it happened, that he found her lying at the bottom of the stairs about eleven o'clock on Sunday morning when he came down, with her head downwards and her feet upwards, but not quite dead—he then took her up, carried her into the kitchen, and laid her down on the carpet before the fire—he afterwards took her up and sat her on the chair, where I saw her sitting when I first went into the kitchen—I then took him into custody, and took him to Bow-street office, where he was examined, and blood found inside his waistcoat—I did not see the fire in the copper-hole, but I smelt a great smell of fire—I did not find any shirt—I did not observe any blood on the carpet.</p>

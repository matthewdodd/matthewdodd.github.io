                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Eastham, who keeps the Military Train Arms beer-house, High-street, Woolwich—the prisoner, accompanied by a person named Sawtree, came there on 13th October, about half-past 5 o'clock—I had known Sawtree some four or five months before—he has frequently been to the house—the prisoner asked where my husband was—I said he was out, and they said they would return in about ten minutes' time—they went away—I went into the bar-parlour to prepare my money for the brewer—I put down one sovereign and two half-sovereigns for the brewer, on the bar-parlour table—I was called out to the bar to serve a customer, and left the money there—while I was away, William Hall, a young man employed there as a musician, went into the parlour with some tea things—I saw him come out, and as he came out the prisoner and Saw<lb></lb>tree returned—he made way for them to pass him—the prisoner went into the bar-parlour first—Sawtree remained at the bar with me to ask me to send for some beaf steaks—I did so, and on my turning round, after he had given the order, he went into the bar-parlour to the prisoner—I turned and saw the gas was not lighted there; it was lighted in the bar, and the light was sufficient to see anything on the bar-parlour table—they ordered two</p>

               <p>glasses of ale—I went and drew them, and changed a half-sovereign for Sawtree—that put me in mind of my own gold—I turned to the table to take it up, and it was gone—I asked Sawtree if he had taken it up by mis<lb></lb>take among the change he had taken from the table—he said, "No;" and showed me the change to convince me that he had not—I had not given the prisoner any change—I then turned to the prisoner and asked him if he had by any mistake taken up the money from the table in any change he might have had there—he said he had no change to take up, and he said to Sawtree, "You know, William, when I came into this room I had but two and six-pence in my pocket"—I said that the money could not be out of the room—I took a candle to look on the floor, but could not find it—I afterwards went up to speak to Hall, after which I came down—I conversed with these two about it, both before and after I went upstairs—my husband came downstairs with me, and William Hall also—a policeman was sent for—the prisoner then went out at the front door and ran down the street—he was followed by William Hall's brother and the policeman, and brought back—I was not present when he was searched.</p>

I brought from home with me a shilling, and I got a savereign on my way at a house I called at, and changed the sovereign when at the London-bridge station. I got half a sovereign in change for the sovereign, and, when I got to Woolwich, Sawtree took me, to a house to have a beef-steak and a glass of ale. He told me the people of the house were acquaint<lb></lb>ances of his, and we should get it properly attended to. The landlady asked us through the middle room into the bar-parlour. Sawtree called for a pint of ale, and had some conversation with the landlady; there was no light in the room. Supposing Sawtree had got no money, I said I would pay for the pint of ale, and I gave him half a sovereign to pay for it, and the landlady brought in the change and put it on the table. Sawtree shoved the money to me, and said, 'That is your change.' I took the money up and put it into my pocket; I did not examine it. A little while after, we were drink<lb></lb>ing the ale; the landlady came in, and Sawtree asked her about the steak. She said she had to send for it. She then went to light the gas, and Sawtree assisted her, and she then said she had missed, I don't know whether she said 'two sovereigns' or 'a sovereign and two half-sovereigns.' Sawtree got up and asked her if she was quite certain she left it there, and she said she was. I said I did not see it, but, as there were no others there, she had a right to have us both searched; I told her I was quite willing for it to be done to me. She went upstairs and left us in the parlour, and some time after that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270162"></xptr>
               <p>her husband and these other two men came down. I told the husband I was willing to have my pockets examined, and after that the constable came in. We were then brought to the station, and I had no knowledge whatever that there was any gold in my pocket. The only way in which I can account for the money is, that it was taken up in the change when it was pushed over to me."</p>

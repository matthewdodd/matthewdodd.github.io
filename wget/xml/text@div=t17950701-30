               <p>I am a constable. On Tuesday, the 26th of May, the prisoner Chamberlain was brought down to Bow-street; on searching of her, I found the duplicates on her of the gown and breeches; with that she said it was a young man that had gave her the duplicate; and by the description Mr. Cox thought it was one of the persons that lived in the house. We went to the house, and that was not the person; in the mean time Mr. Harrison's man came and said he had stopped two women, and I went to the two women, and Spencer said she had the things of one Jones, and I went and took Jones into custody; but before that I went to Bambridge-street and there found this crow in the room; then I went with it to Cox's room, and this instrument fits one part of the impression against the door; there had been two instruments used, and this fits one impression. Spencer took me to Jones's lodgings, thinking to find him, for she said his wife was in trouble, and when we came to Bow-street there she was in custody.</p>

               <p>I went with Treadway to Dyot-street, to apprehend the prisoner. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Saturday night, the 23d Day of the Month, I happened to go up to this young woman's room, and I sat down for the space of five or six minutes, and she was then doing something to that petticoat, which she said she had given her that night, and the bonnet, by one of her young men; and he had left there a pair of breeches for her to pawn, and she asked me if I would be so kind as to go and pawn them for her? which I went and pawned them, it was between ten and eleven o'clock. The pawnbroker asked me where I lived? and I could not rightly recollect the street where she lived, and I said, Tottenham-court-road. I went to her and gave her the money and ticket, and slept with her that night. Sunday morning this young man came and knocked at the door, and we both got up and put our clothes on, and when he came in he said, I think, ma'am, you do it; what he meant by it I don't know;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010066"></xptr>he then asked her whether she had done what he desired? she said, yes; and she gave him seven shillings, which I received from the pawnbroker; and we sat down all three and had breakfast; and then I went, and I never see him since. On Monday I went again, and slept there that night; on Tuesday morning this young woman got up about nine o'clock, and I had but three halfpence in my pocket, I had two waistcoats and I said she might take the under waistcoat and pawn it, to get a breakfast; I was still in bed; and after she had been out some time, she sent an elderly woman to me(I was still in bed, having the head ach with drinking too much, it being holiday time) to desire me to pawn a petticoat and bonnet; and I thought it was an odd thing for me to go and pawn, and I saw these two young women, and I asked them to pawn them for me, as my wife was in trouble; and this young woman came out and said the pawnbroker had stopped them, and I went to the public house, and told the young woman where I was, and they came with the constable and took me.</p>

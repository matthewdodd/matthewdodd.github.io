On the 9th of June I went into another lodger's room; I had not gone to bed - I left my room door open, and a light there- I returned in a quarter of an hour, and missed two blankets, a sheet, and a quilt, which were safe when I left the room - I went down, and found the watchman in the passage with them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 9th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220068"></xptr>June, at half-past one o'clock, I saw two men come out of the prosecutrix's passage; I believe it was the prisoners; they had nothing with them - they were dressed as the prisoners are, in black coats, and one of them had a light waistcoat; I went into the passage, and saw these articles - I left them there, and went to the corner, to look after them; I saw the prisoners brought to the watch-house just before two o'clock, and I believe they are the men who came out of the passage.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Moorfields. On the morning of the 9th of June the two prisoners passed me and Mr. Almond - one of them came back to the other, and pulled his hat over his eyes; I stooped down: there was a gas-light, so that I had a good view of their features; I had known them by sight before - this was about forty yards from Rose-lane; Hubbard then came, and asked if two men had passed that way; we listened for a moment, and heard them running across the way; Almond spoke to one of them, and he said he was going home, but he ran off in a different direction; we ran different ways, and Almond took them in Whitechapel-road; Gent said at the watch-house, "I only did it out of a lark - I hope you won't lock me up" - Scott said nothing.</p>

            . I was with Glayton in Wentworth-street, near Rose-lane, on the 9th of June, between one and two o'clock in the morning; I saw the two prisoners running - Gent was first; I asked if they were going to bed; the watchman called soon afterwards; I ran one way, and Clayton another: we secured them. When we got to the watch-house the watchman said they were the two men who had taken the blankets; they made no reply, but, when the prosecutrix looked at the things, Gent said they only did it for a lark.</p>
               <p>GENT'S Defence. I know a young body in the house, and happened to go into the prosecutrix's room; I took the things off the bed, and put them on the stairs - I said"She will find them now." I went away, but did not run.</p>
               <p>SCOTT'S Defence. I was coming from the Theatre, and met the other prisoner; we went to the night house, had something to drink, and then Mr. Almond came and took us.</p>
               <p>JURY to Mrs. ABBOTT. Q. Was the bed made ready for you to go to bed? A. Yes; and the things were found rolled up in the passage. The prisoners are not known at our house.</p>

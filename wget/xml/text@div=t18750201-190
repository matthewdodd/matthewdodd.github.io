                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, we have been married twenty-one; years next month—he has indulged in habits of intoxication, for nine years past—in consequence of that and other circumstances I separated from him in July last—we carried on a business in stewed eels—in October last my father purchased the shop and business of the prisoner at 49, Snow Fields, Bermondsey, and put me in it to carry on the business for myself and children—I have six children by the prisoner, five living, three at home—prior to 29th December the prisoner was lodging next door but two to me—he very frequently came in since October—soon after I separated from him I saw several placards like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about the neighbourhood—two were shown me by my little boys and one was given me by a neighbour and the prisoner used to carry one about with him and show it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a hand-bill offering a reward of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l. for the dead body of his missing wife, with a N.B. stating that no reward would be paid if she was brought home alive.</hi>) On 29th December, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, I was at tea with my son Thomas, a lad of 15—he came in from the Southwark Police Court and said "She (meaning my daughter) has not had it all her own way"—I said "I am glad of it"—I knew he had been to the Police Court—he said "She had a neighbour with her," and made use of bad language about the neighbour—I said "Don't make that remark, you have a bad toe yourself, and you would not like a remark of that kind made about you"—he said "My toe is very likely to be bad for twenty years"—he seemed very angry—I asked if he would have some tea—he said "I don't want none of your tea, I want to know when I am to bring back my bed"—I said "I can't say, it is my father's house now, once it was mine and yours, then I could say what I liked"—he said "I want to know whether I am to bring back my bed to-night or not"—I said "I can't tell you"—he said "Well, if you can't decide it I will"—he then went out into the yard—we keep the knives that we use in the business on a table there—he was there a very few minutes—during that time my son and I went on with our tea—the prisoner returned from the yard and shut the door, and came into the kitchen where I was sitting, and in a moment of time I received a stab in my neck—I was in the act of getting up to put some water in the teapot and had the teapot in my hand; I did not perceive for the moment that I was stabbed—my son got up and ran out—I received another stab while he was gone—I turned round and my husband came again, holding the knife over me—I saw the knife, it was one that we used for trimming the eels—my boy had only gone a very short time when be returned and threw a basin at his father—the first stab was in the side of my neck and the second was in the throat, near the same place—I am suffering from the throat now and cannot speak very loud, I think the first stab nearly stunned me—the prisoner bowed his head when my son threw the basin at him to escape it, and then he ran after the boy with the knife still in his hand—I ran into the shop and pushed by him and got out into the street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010067"></xptr>
               <p>as he was standing on the step with the knife in his hand—there were two or three persons outside the door, a policeman came across the road and I gave him in charge—I was taken to the hospital and was under treatment there a fortnight and two days—I am not well now, the wounds are a good deal better—I do not go to have them dressed now, I dress them myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was aware that my husband had been to the Southwark Police Court that day in consequence of a summons of my daughter's—when he said she had not got it all her own way I replied "I am glad of it"—I was glad of it because I wished him well, he was my husband and I did not wish that a daughter should have any control over him—I was not a party to her taking him to the Police Court, I had nothing to do with it, it was not with my consent—I meant what I said, I was glad; it was not said in a. jeering manner by way of irritating him, I said it meaningly—if I had seen any reform in him from his drunkenness I should have been willing to live with him again—I had no dread of him at that time, although he has ill-used me many years—I had forgiven him many times—we had led a very unhappy life; there had been a great many disputes between us—I had no fear of personal violence from him at this time, although I had for years past when he lived with me, I used to hide knives and many things out of his way—at the time he had these bills printed he had two pros<lb></lb>titutes in the house after I left the shop—I can't tell you what I supposed he meant by the bill, I suppose he did want my dead body, by the bill; I thought it was to annoy me, I thought it was a very wrong thing—I had often asked him to have a cup of tea, I could not see the father of my children come in and out without asking him such a thing—he was a very few minutes in the yard, I could not say how many—he was not in a very nice temper when he refused the cup of tea and went into the yard—I did not hear him say anything when he came in and I received the stab—im<lb></lb>mediately after I received the stab my son left the room and he made a stab at the boy as he left the room—I remember the boy falling, I heard the noise—I received the second stab while my son was gone, because I had time to get up and face my husband and he had the knife over me and then the boy returned—he did not strike me a third time, he was in the act of doing it when the boy returned and threw the basin, he got the basin from the shop where the basins are kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness and the prisoner—I am fifteen years old—I was living with my mother at 49, Snow's Fields, on the 29th December—I was at home between 4 and 5 o'clock when my father came in—he began talking about my sister, that she had not had all her own way with him and then began talking about a neighbour who went with my sister and began swearing about her—my mother said "Hold your row, Thomas, you have got a bad toe yourself, you would not like anybody to call you names"—he said "I might have a bad toe for twenty years"—he then asked mother to go upstairs—she said "No, speak to me down here, the two children will go out into the shop while you speak to me"—so I and my little sister went out into the shop and stopped two or three minutes—when I came in again he said "I am going to bring my bed in here to-night"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187502010068"></xptr>
               <p>—she said "No, you must not"—he said "I will if I get thrown out of the top-room window"—mother then said something to him, I can't recollect what it was, and he said "I did not say I would bring my bed in"—afterwards he said "When shall I come home?"—she said "I can't decide, Thomas, it is not my house, it is father's house"—on her saying she could not decide, she would have to ask grandfather first, he said he would decide and he went out into the yard, we kept our knives there on a table—while he was in the yard my mother and I went on with our tea—the kitchen looks into the yard—I did not hear anything in the yard—he came out of the yard and shut the door after him and stood beside the door, and I heard like knives tingling against each other, as if he was sharpening a knife on a steel or something; I heard that seven or eight times—he stood inside the kitchen all the time—I asked mother to give me some more tea, and as she was getting up to put some more water in the teapot and turned halfway round my father took two steps towards her and stabbed her with a knife, at least I don't know what it was—mother called out "Don't Thomas, you have stabbed me, look at the blood"—I went to run to him and he held his hand up as if to make" a stab at me, I nearly fell down and ran out of the shop into a neighbour's house—I could not see what was in his hand, I saw a blade or something glitter, but could not say what it was—I returned with a friend, I saw my father with the knife up in his hand, I could not see where my mother was—I took a basin off the counter and aimed it at him, he bobbed down and came to run out after me—the young man I brought in with me took me by the back and pushed me out of the shop and I ran away—I did not hear him say anything during all this time—I have seen him ill-treat my mother on other occasions—a fortnight before this he came in drunk and was going to knock her about with a poker and he threatened to knock her brains out—I don't remember any other occasion shortly before this, but all last summer there were several occasions—after I was pushed out of the shop by my friend I stepped across the road—I saw my mother out in the street and saw her speaking to a policeman—my father was in the shop at that time—I saw him go away with the policeman and my mother taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were frequent disagreements between my father and mother—when he threatened my mother with the poker he went to make a strike at her, but I got hold of it—there was a good deal of bad language used occasionally, not on both sides—on this evening my father used some foul language—he became angry when my mother said he could not come there that evening—she said he had got a bad toe of his own—she did not say that in a provoking tone, she said it very quietly—he has got a bad toe, he has had the gout—he had spoken about the woman my sister went with as a fat woman with the small-pox, and it was then that my mother said "You have got a bad toe yourself"—that did not seem to aggravate him—I saw him when he was in the yard at the table—I did not hear or see any knives until he came back into the kitchen, I then heard what I thought was the sharpening of knives; I did not see any knives, he had his hands behind him and there was a steel behind him—it might be a minute or two from the time he came in from the yard till my mother called out.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at 41, Grove Road, Denmark Hill—I am a surgeon—on 29th December I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I was called by the dresser to see Mrs. Lucas, I found she had two wounds, one on the side of the neck the other more behind—the one nearest the front. was an incised and punctured wound, that is the tissues had been cut at the: same time they had been pierced by an instrument—it was about an inch long—it was a dangerous wound under certain circumstances, and in a dangerous part—the force required to cause such a wound would not be considerable, still it required a certain amount of force—it would depend in a great measure on the sharpness of the instrument used—the second wound was cleanly cut—a sharp pointed knife would be very likely to have caused the wound in front, the other wound might be caused by any knife, without a sharp point—if the instrument had gone perpendicularly down it would have gone through the large blood-vessels of the neck instead of going beneath the skin only—a small artery was divided—she was under my treat<lb></lb>ment till the end of my house-surgeoncy, that was to the end of the year; it was then taken up by my successor—I saw her afterwards at the Police Court and examined her—the scars of the wounds were remaining on her neck, they were not completely healed, a process of healing was taking place called scab<lb></lb>bing—there will be a loss of sensation over a part of the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the carotid artery had been divided it would have been very dangerous—these wounds were not dangerous under proper treatment, as she had at the hospital—the wound dipped for about an inch beneath the skin—I did regard it as a dangerous wound, because the artery that was cut was at the bottom of the puncture and there was a very great difficulty in finding it, until we found it there was danger from bleeding; when we found it and stopped it the danger ceased; we <hi rend="italic">torsed</hi> it, twisted it with peculiar forceps.</p>

I am an accountant, and live at 7, Southerton Road, Hammersmith—on 2nd July I went to the Castle public-house, Portugal Street, Lincoln's Tnn Fields, to see a gentleman—I saw the prisoner there; I had seen him before, but never spoke to him—he produced this pawn ticket to me, and asked for a loan of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I was not in the habit of doing this sort of thing—he said he was hungry, or something of</p>

               <p>that description—I said "I suppose it is all right and genuine"—he said "Yes, and if that money is not to be repaid in the course of a few days you can redeem the pledge"—I lent him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I kept the ticket till 1st September, and on 1st September I sent it to Attenborough's—it had Attenborough's printed heading <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the top—the ticket was stopped—in consequence of what I heard, I went in search of the prisoner—I saw him that same day at the Castle—I told him there was some mistake about the ticket; that it had been detained, and Attenborough's had sent down to know where I had got it from—I asked him to go with me to Attenborough's—he said he would see me b----first—I gave him into custody some few days afterwards, I gave him another chance of accompanying me and the policeman—I have never seen the prisoner write—I saw a letter that he produced at the Police Court, and which he said he wrote that morning—I saw him hand it to the solicitor for the prosecution—I have compared that letter with the writing on the ticket, and I have not the slightest doubt the writing is the same.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 252). On 1st September the prosecutor gave the prisoner in my charge for obtaining money by a ticket which was not true—the prisoner asked if he meant to press the charge—he said he should if he did not go with him to the pawnbroker's and explain the affair—he said he should not go there—finding that Allcock was going to press the charge, he asked him to let him go, and he would return the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Allcock said "I can't let you go now," and I took him to the station—I was present at Bow Street and heard the prisoner state that he had written this letter that morning—he handed it to Mr. Hope, the solicitor for the prosecution—I have compared the handwriting of that letter and that on the duplicate, and I believe it is the same.</p>

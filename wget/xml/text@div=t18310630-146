On the 13th of June the prisoner came to his shop, and asked for some silk handkerchiefs which were in the window - I took them out; he chose one - while he was doing that, I observed him concealing something under his apron, and when he was going out I got over the counter, and stopped him; this is the handkerchief he had chosen, and this other I took from his person under his apron - he had paid 1s. 6d. for one; the one he took is worth 3s. 6d. - it is silk; he appeared to be trying to tuck this one under his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Was that handkerchief laying loose on the counter? A. No, it was hanging up behind him - it might have fallen down; I only saw him fumbling - I had not seen this particular handkerchief to notice it the whole day, but I know I had hung it up there the day before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you some of that pattern hanging in the window? A. No, they were tied in a bundle, but this one was hanging up singly, apart from the bundle - there were several other handkerchiefs hanging in the same place, but not of this pattern.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 144). It is my duty to stand at the gate of Woolwich Dock Yard, when the men are going out at night—I am authorized to search them if I think it expedient—I was on duty at the outer factory gate about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and the prisoner attempted to go through, (he is the leading man or foreman of the labourers)—a sergeant of my division was with me who touched the prisoner, and I searched him and found in his jacket pocket three pieces of leather, thirteen pieces of candle, two whole candles, and a brass sheath (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pieces of leather were between his waistcoat and shirt—the candles were wrapped up as they are now—I asked him no questions, but he said, "It is a bad job," and seemed very much confused—I left him in charge of the inspector inside the gate, and went to a locker in the Dock Yard and found this piece of leather (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found the key on the prisoner when I searched him—next day I showed it to him, and he asked if it was the leather that was found on him—I said, "No, it was found in your <hi rend="italic">cabin"</hi>—he said that he had it in his <hi rend="italic">cabin</hi> for the purpose of mending straps which were used in his business—I compared the band of leather with the pieces found on him, and they cor<lb></lb>respond as if cut from one another—an hour after I took the leather to him he said that the candles and leather he could give no account of, or something to that effect, and the sheath he picked up while going round the yard with a gang of men, and placed it in his pocket, with the intention of giving it up to the proper authorities—he had actually reached the gate, and was passing out when he was touched by the inspector.</p>

               <p>said that it was usual to have pieces for his work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not say that it was usual at the time I searched him—I did not see any of the pieces of leather upon him before I searched him; they were between his braces and his shirt, and he had on a jacket and a waistcoat, which were buttoned up—there may have been a pocket inside the jacket, but not in the waistcoat—the sheath was in his outside pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ann Street, Woolwich. I am leading man of the stores in the dock yard—the prisoner was leading man of the labourers; he has been in the employ of the government twenty-seven years; his wages were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—these pieces of leather are of the same description as other leather which forms a portion of Her Majesty's stores—I believe this leather to be Her Majesty's property—the prisoner could have access to it—he had to work with leather occasionally, but had no business to carry it about on his person—these candles are similar to what are served out; they have a coloured thread which I know them by—the prisoner has not access to them; they are issued by me—he has no right to take any candles or pieces out of the dock yard—there are no perquisites; this sheath has the govern<lb></lb>ment mark, the broad arrow, on it; he had no right to have it in his possession—if he picked it up in the yard he ought to have deposited it with me at my store, which is within the gates—the gate by which he went out is 100 or 180 yards from my store.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you undertake to say that these candles and the leather are the property of Her Majesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can swear that they are similar to what are used in the dock yard—this coloured thread in the wick is always used in the dock yard candles—they are not commonly to be bought; they do not get into the hands of marine store dealers or grocers when a ship comes home that I am aware of—there is a faulty place in both pieces of this leather—the prisoner superintends labourers, and has a large body under him—he has a little leather occasionally for their use—if he has too much the <hi rend="italic">cabin</hi> is the proper place for him to keep it; and every thing which he has to use—this sheath is worth 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as old brass; the leather 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the candles about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have known the prisoner in service there upwards of seventeen years—he has brought me pieces of brass which he has picked up on other occasions, three or four times—he would not be entitled to a pension after a certain number of years unless he was in the factory depart<lb></lb>ment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any doubt that the candles are the peculiar manufacture used in the dock yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt; if a person bought a lot of them at a marine store dealers, he could not get them into the dock yard without carrying them through the gates; but they do not search people going into the dock yard—the prisoner had the key of the <hi rend="italic">cabin</hi>—our candles are not wrapped up in this way; these were not wrapped up by my direction.</p>

The prisoner is an attendant in the British Museum, in the service of the Trustees, and has been so ten or twelve years—I purchased a shell similar to this at a sale, in 1836, for the Museum—I had seen it about two or three months ago—I do not swear to the identity of the shell; but Mr. Sowerby took a drawing of it, and took the shell out to compare it with the drawing—I pat it back again—that shell is not there now—there has been no sale of shells from the Museum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in cariosities, and live at No. 282, High Holborn. The prisoner has brought me several shells to sell—on the 12th of March he brought me three—I think I should know them again—this seems to be one of them—it is such a shell as he brought—I sold it to Mr. Sowerby—I inspected it very little—I laced it in my win<lb></lb>dow—I am sure it was the same I sold to Sowerby—I had it about three days—I gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three shells.</p>

                  </hi>. I purchased this shell of Evans, on Monday, the 19th of March, with four or five others—I saw another shell in the window, and then I went in and bought this one, giving 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—my daughter had made a drawing of it before, when it was in the Museum, and I knew it not only by the particular marks of the shell, bat there being a small hole on one side of it, which I remembered from the first time I saw it—I made a communication to the Museum—I believe I am considerably versed in shells—I never saw such a one as this before—I consider it worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at least.</p>

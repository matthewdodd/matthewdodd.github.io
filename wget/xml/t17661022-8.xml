On Saturday the 11th instant I was obliged to go into Crooked-lane, after it was dark; I left nobody in the shop but my wife, she was behind the counter; I came home in about half an hour; she told me she had been frighted by some men; after that the prisoner came to the window; she told me that was one of them; I was serving a gentleman, seeing the prisoner at the glasses, I left what I was about and went to the door; I was just going to bid him go about his business, but he went without bidding; he went about 30 or 40 yards, and came to the glasses again in about four minutes time; then I went round to the door, and saw there was a hole in my glass; he had his thumb and finger through it, and had hold of a silver buckle wriggling and shaking it to get it out; he did not observe me; I took hold of him and brought him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner taken it out?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he removed it out of its place?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He had; we put them one upon another in pairs, and he had removed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep did it lie beneath the glass?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It lay about three quarters of an inch from the glass; there had been a crack in the glass before, but he had broke a fresh place.</p>

               <p>I had been to Deptford about some business, and in returning home, a gentleman came out and pulled me into his shop, and said I had broke his glass; I never offered to meddle with his glass.</p>

Last Wednesday week, about half past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoners in Bow-street, as I was going to the Rainbow, public-house, King-street, to sleep. I heard somebody talking, and met them coming up Bow-street - they asked me to give them a glass of something to drink - I went with them to the Brown Bear, public-house; I drank nothing. We left the house - when we came out they asked for something to eat; I took them to a house a door or two from the Brown Bear, and gave them something, but took nothing myself. We came out; they asked me to go home with them; I walked up Bow-street with them to <placeName id="t18230409-42-crimeloc219">Broad-court</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230409-42-crimeloc219" type="placeName" value="Broad-court"></interp>

Previous to this, as we went up Broad-court they stopped behind several times, and whispered to each other, and when I turned round under the archway, Francis said to the other, 'now now'; they immediately came, and both clasped me round the waist, and Scott snatched my watch from my fob - they both ran off as hard as they could, and I after them; Scott turned round, put out her hand and gave something to Francis as they ran; I could not see what it was. When they came down to the middle of the court they ran different ways - I followed Scott, and took her half way down the court - I felt my watch taken; I had looked at it in the eating-house, and am sure I had it in the court. While I was holding Scott, and calling Watch! the people collected, and six or seven minutes after Francis returned, and asked what was the matter - I have not found the watch; it was worth 10 l., with the appendages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PENDERGAST. Q. You were going up Bow-street, and turned towards them - A. No; I had drank a little, but was perfectly aware of what happened. I was very near them when I saw something pass between them - she handed out the same hand as she took the watch with.</p>

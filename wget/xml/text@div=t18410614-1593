                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the Chartered Gas Company—I have been engaged lately in laying down main pipes in Lincoln's-inn-fields—the prisoners were in the Company's employ—it was Dooley's business to take care of the tools and property while the man went to dinner—on the 20th of May he was employed in that capacity, and Bullen as a workman—from information, I had suspicion of Bullen having taken some lead—I sent to his house, and he came back with the person I sent—I taxed him with having attempted to take some lead—he said he had not placed it under his jacket and he did not know who had—I again taxed him with it an hour or two after, and he then said he had not placed it under his jacket himself, but he knew who had—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman to the Gas Company—I was in Lin-coln's-inn-fields a few minutes after twelve o'clock on the 20th of May, went to the trench, and saw the prisoners in the act of putting something into a jacket or coat—knowing me, Bullen sat on the jacket, and Dooley took a shovel and began filling the trench—Bullen sat some minutes, and then got up, and began to unload the wagon—in a few minutes after the men came from dinner—he went to the pot in the place where the other men were collected, then went a few paces, and took the jacket—I told him I must see what was in it—he said, "Never mind," or something—he then took it back, and returned it from whence he took it, and out of the jacket he took a pig of lead, and walked towards the pot—I have no doubt it was the Company's lead.</p>

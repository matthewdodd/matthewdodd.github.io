The prisoner came to my shop on the 6th of August, and said she came from Lady Duncannon for some gloves; she wanted some long white kid and some short ones, and some of three different sizes for some children of seven, eleven, and thirteen years of age - she then asked me to show her a pair for herself; she tried them on, and asked me to allow her to take them, and they were to be paid for when the others went home - when Mr. Garton brought her back, he found on her this other pair, not the pair she chose for herself; it is one of the pairs she pointed out as the proper size for the children.</p>

She had two pair of shoes and some other things, all scattered about; I asked if she would allow me to put them into paper for her - it appears to me that these gloves must have been put into the shoes, but I did not put them there.</p>

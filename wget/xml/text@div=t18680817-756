                  </hi>. I am a gasfitter and decorator, at 4, St. George's Circus, Southwark—on 20th July I went into a urinal at the corner of Christ Church, Blackfriars Road—while I was there four men came in, two on each side—they pulled my arms back, and robbed me of my watch, my pin, and eyeglass—they then let me loose, and ran away—I came out immediately, and saw the prisoner running with them—they were within a yard of me—I saw two men at the Police Court, but I could not swear positively to them, and they were discharged—I ran after them—I called "Stop thief!"—I lost sight of them, and then waited till I saw a policeman coming along with the prisoner in custody—I immediately recognised him, and said he was one of them—he had only one arm—I noticed that when he was running.</p>

On 19th July, a little after 12 o'clock, I hard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I went in the direction of the cry, and saw a constable of the name of Mansfield with the prisoner in custody—I had seen him about 11.50 in company with four others—two others were taken, but were discharged—Mansfield, the constable, is very ill indeed, and unable to travel; he has broken a blood-vessel—I produce the doctor's certificate—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">and stated that Police Con<lb></lb>stable L</hi> 51 <hi rend="italic">was confined to his bed with spitting of blood</hi>.)—I saw him yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, in the employ of Henry Simmons, who has a little house near the cage, in the Greenwich-road. On Monday morning, about seven o'clock, when I went to work, I missed some horse-shoes off some pegs in the workshop, under a window, which I had seen safe on Saturday afternoon, when I left work—the wire-work which had been nailed over the window was torn away sufficiently to get a hand in, and the frame-work broken in—the glass had been broken before, and the wire was put to prevent a hand being put in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday, the 14th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I was in the yard of the Horse and Groom, at Blackheath, when the prisoner offered some horse-shoes for sale—I asked him where he got them—he said he found them in Back-lane, Blackheath—I asked if any one was with him when he found them—he said his younger brother Was, and they were wrapped up in an old horse-cloth—I told him to go and fetch his brother, and the cloth they were in—I waited for him half an hour—he did not return, and I went in search of him—I found him on Blackheath-hill afterwards, and took him into custody.</p>

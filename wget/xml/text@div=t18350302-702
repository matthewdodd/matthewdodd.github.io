                  </hi>. I live at Bethnal-green. I was called, on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 7th of February, and told my gates were wide open—I went down, and missed a large sow and three pigs, about three months old—I ran in different directions, and inquired of every policeman I met—I re<lb></lb>ceived some information, but have not found them—the sow was black and white, and the pigs were very poor, according to their age.</p>

I was on duty at a quarter past six o'clock that morning, in Globe-street, Bethnal-green, which is a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—I saw a large pig and three little ones—the large one was in good condition, had a black head and black back part, and white in the middle—the little ones were very poor—the prisoner and another person were with them—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner to be a pig-driver—I afterwards went to the prosecutor and saw one of his pigs, which corresponded with those the prisoner was driving.</p>

On the 15th of September, the prisoner called, and asked if I had room for a phaeton to stand, which belonged to a dancing master in Frith-street; he said he himself lived with Smith, a stable-keeper, in Clipstone-street, and wanted to borrow harness to bring the phaeton, and then to take away a chaise. I asked if he knew Smith's brother, who kept a public-house in Oxford-street; he said, Yes, he was a stout man. I saw my man deliver the harness to him, and saw no more of him nor the phaeton - he was apprehended on the Friday following, and denied ever seeing me before. I was flurried, and perhaps if it had not been for the officer, I should have knocked him down. He was frightened, and said he sold it at Westminster, for 15 s.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker, and live in Marlborough-place, Great Peter-street. On the 12th of September, the prisoner sold me a horse collar for 1 s., and said he had an old chaise harness, which he had bought of Mr. Richardson, the lottery-office keeper's coachman, and would bring it next day, and on the 15th he brought it, and asked 25 s. for it - I agreed to give him 18 s., paid him 2 s. 6 d. in part, and on Wednesday paid him the rest.</p>

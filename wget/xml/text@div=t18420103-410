                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist living on Holborn-hill. On the 13th of December I sent Hunt, my boy, out with 6lbs, weight of cigars—these produced are part of them.</p>

                  </hi>. My master sent me with some cigars about six o'clock in the evening of the 13th of December—as I was going up Oxford-street the string broke, and some of them fell out—I went to the step of a door to tie them up—the prisoner came and asked if he should tie them up—I said, "Yes,"—I thought he could do it better than I—he was about half an hour tying them up—he asked where I was going—I said, "To Edgeware-road"—he said he was going to Star-street, which was part of the way—I took them to the place—they were three-quarters of a pound short when the gentleman weighed them, and he would not take them—the prisoner was with me as we came back—he asked me to go to a coffee-shop to ask for a man named Jackson, who owed him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was not there—he then told me to go to another coffee-shop on the other side of the way—the prisoner had the parcel of cigars in his hand—there was no Mr. Jackson there—when I came out the prisoner and the cigars were gone—he was brought back by the policeman in about five minutes with them—he left me by Bainbridge-street.</p>

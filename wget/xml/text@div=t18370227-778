                  </hi>. I am one of the three Directors forming the acting committee of the Argus Company. The prisoner was book-keeper to the company originally—it was his duty after receiving the letters which came by post, after opening them, to bring them up at twelve o'clock to the daily meeting of the acting committee—here is the minute-book of the proceedings of the acting committee—if money or bills came in letters from the country, it would be his duty to enter in the amount of it in this book, and to enter the substance of the letters also—not to copy the letter into the minute-book—there is a book in which letters sent to the coon<lb></lb>try are entered by the book-keeper—there is no entry of letters received from the country, except the memorandum in the minute-book—there was a cash-book kept by the prisoner, in which the amount of money re<lb></lb>ceived was entered—there is no memorandum in the minute-book of any communication from Mr. Ferris, on the 14th of May, neither of the letter nor remittance—no such letter or remittance was ever produced or notified to the Directors, by the prisoner in my presence—if he received a bill from Mr. Ferris amounting to £85 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it would be his duty to produce it to the Board with the letter of remittance, and send it to the bankers, Veres and Co., for them to receive the money—he should indorse it first, if it was payable to his order—I have made search for Mr. Ferris's letter, which is said to have enclosed that bill, but have not been able to find it—our letters are put up in separate pigeon-holes, according to the initials—I have searched every where there was a chance of its being—the 13th of December was the day appointed for the prisoner to render up his accounts, and the board to audit them—the prisoner had been apprised of that, and he summoned the members of the committee himself for that purpose in consequence of our orders—he did not attend the committee on the 13th—I did not see him that day at all, nor till he was in custody—he had the custody of the cash-book by virtue of his office—I saw it last on Saturday, the 10th of December, in the board-room—I had it there myself—I do not recollect who gave it to me—it is a necessary book for the ex<lb></lb>amination of accounts—I never saw it after the prisoner's departure—I have made a diligent search for it, but have not been able to discover it—after the retirement of Mr. Barrett, in July or August 1835, the prisoner under-took the duties of Secretary, combined with his former office—his salary then was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he lived in the house, and his brother and mother were permitted to reside with him—they left on Monday, the 12th of De<lb></lb>cember, the day before the audit was fixed.</p>

               <p>committee of Directors generally—I have done it—I do not think I did it before Mr. Barrett ceased to be secretary—the act requires, that the names of the Directors, and shareholders, and secretary shall be registered in the Court of Chancery—that was done I think in July last—there was no appointed secretary then—the deed provides that there should be one—the duties of secretary fell on the prisoner—Mr. Barrett had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year as secretary, and resided in the house—the prisoner had 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—I believe Mr. Barrett is now studying for the bar—his uncle is a Director still—I have never asked the prisoner to change a cheque for me—I believe Mr. Barrett has done so—I have never seen it done—I have heard Mr. Barrett say it has been done—I do not know of it having been stated that the prisoner ap<lb></lb>propriated the cash of the company to change cheques for the Directors—our audits are quarterly—the banker's book, and cash-book, and the general account-books of the office are then produced—it was at the particular re<lb></lb>quest of the Directors, that the audit in question was appointed for the 13th—there is no fixed audit day—it depends on the pleasure of the Directors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a customer came into the board-room, did not you describe him, and refer to him as your secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am not aware of it—I have not noticed any of the directors call him so—Mr. Barrett has been a Director during all my time.</p>

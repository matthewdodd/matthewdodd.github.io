I went out on the 5th of June, and returned about eight o'clock, and there was a boy of the name of Smith talking to the prisoner - I asked what he wanted - he said he came to ask for work - I told the prisoner to lock up the place - I went home and got my supper, and dozed in my chair till about eleven o'clock - I wondered the prisoner was not come - I went down to my shop, and found the door was open - the watchman had fastened it with a nail - I went there the next morning, and missed the materials for two waistcoats.</p>

            . On Wednesday morning, the 7th of June, the prosecutor told me the prisoner had gone away with some articles - I met the prisoner on the Saturday following, and asked him to go with me to his master - he said he would not then, but would in the evening, after he had been to Somers'-town to see his sister; while we were talking, the street-keeper came up - I went for his master, who came and asked what he had done with the property - he said he had made them up, and pawned them.</p>

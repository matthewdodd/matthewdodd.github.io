                  </hi>. I am a watchman on Hibernia wharf. About three o'clock, in the morning of the 2nd of June, I was in the counting-house on the wharf—the barge <hi rend="italic">Rayner</hi> was moored by the side on the river—I saw the barge <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi> coming alongside, with the three prisoners in it—I saw Gage go off the <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi> on to the <hi rend="italic">Rayner</hi>, pick up some large lumps of coal from the <hi rend="italic">Rayner</hi>, and give them to Taylor, who stood in the <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi>, and be handed them to King, who took them down the forecastle—they took a great many lumps in that way—I came forward where I could see them more distinctly—Taylor looked up and saw me, and then the others saw me—they ceased from taking the coals—Gage got on to the <hi rend="italic">Louisa</hi> again, and they brought her up at the wharf—I afterwards went on board the Louisa with the inspector—the forecastle was locked—we asked for the keys—King produced them, and un<lb></lb>locked it—we went down, and found some coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Trimen, of 27, Gordon Street—on the 22nd November, shortly after 12 o'clock, I was in bed—I heard a noise at the back window—I looked out of my bedroom window and saw three men on the roof of the scullery, close to a closet window which I had seen closed about 10.30 that evening—five iron bars were fixed in that window—I called out "Thieves"—they stopped as if to hide themselves—I continued to halloa out, and the tall thin one of the three said "Do not halloa, mother; it is all right"—he then ran across the skylight beneath my window; the other <hi rend="italic">two</hi> ran across the roof of the scullery and over some trellis-work at the back of the yard, which gave way, and two men fell into the adjoining yard—one of the two got over the wall into a spare yard, and I lost sight of him then—the shorter man tried to get over the wall and fell twice; he appeared to try to hide him<lb></lb>self, but finding no place he got over into No. 1, Gower Place—I continued to call "Thieves," and as the prisoner was getting over the wall I heard other people at the back, and went down to the front door—the prisoner was then being brought to the front, with another man, by John Bradford—he was struggling to get away—he was taken into custody—I afterwards went with the policeman to the window at the back, and found three of the five bars I had seen safe had been taken away, and the window was broken open—shortly afterwards the policeman brought this bar to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The men were about 10 feet from me when I first saw you on the right-hand side—there is a lamp on the other Bide of the back wall—there are two walls between our garden and the street—I do not recollect being asked at the police-court if I could swear to you—I do not remember saying I could not—I am confident you are the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Hawarden Castle—on 22nd November I was in my bedroom—I could see from my window the roof of the scullery in 27, Gordon Street—shortly after 12 I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I looked out of the bedroom window, and saw three men on the roof of the scullery of No. 27—they were at the window, where there was a little light—I called out "Police," at which the three men separated—I saw the prisoner's face only—he ran along the party wall nearer to me, and I saw him jump down into a yard, and I put on my waistcoat and ran downstairs—I had just got out of the private door into the mews, and was in the act of going over the wall when the prisoner came over on to me—I held him by the leg—he got away and ran 150 yards—I ran after him and seized him again—I never lost eight of him—I said "Stop a minute"—he said "Let me go"—I said "I will not; you have been breaking into a house"—he struggled, to get away—another man came up and assisted to take him to the front door—his hands were muddy and his coat was damp with mud—I held him till constable Smith came up, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The two other men ran the other way—you fell twice, at first on to the woodwork in a yard—you fell to the left—I said at the police-court you were 100 yards off when I saw your face—that was a mistake; it was between 40 and 50—there was a moon—I could swear to you.</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief" a little after 12 on this night—I went to Gordon Street, and saw the prisoner and Bradford at the door of No. 27—Bradford was holding the prisoner, who was trying to get away—Bradford said "This man has been trying to get in at the back of this house—the prisoner's clothes were very dirty at his knees—I took him to the station and searched him, but found nothing on him—I afterwards went to the window, and found that the fastening had been broken off and three of five bars removed from the inside—I afterwards went into the adjoining yard and found three bars, which I showed to Irvine, the servant.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner here put in a written statement to the effect that, being out with two others, he left them to go to a watering-place, and was kicked down and then charged with being on the wall, but that he knew nothing about it</hi>.)</p>

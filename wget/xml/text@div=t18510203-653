                  </hi>. I am a musician, and live at Spencer-place, Brixton-road. On 16th Jan., at a few minutes past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Newington-place, going home, and saw a woman coming in a contrary direction—it was Collis—she was about twenty or thirty yards from me when I first saw her—I saw no one with her—the pavement is rather broad—there was plenty of room for her to pass me—I did not alter my course, but she must have altered hers, for she came and pushed against me, and I immediately received a thrust in the mouth with an umbrella from a man who was behind her, which was followed by a violent blow with his fist on the lower part of the face—he must have been walking behind the woman for the purpose of concealment—he said, "That woman is my wife; you have insulted her"—I think I said I had not—he followed up the attack directly, and I closed with him, and to threw him—he got up, give the umbrella to Collis, and commenced a very violent attack with his fists, hitting right and left—we closed, and I threw him, and fell on him—I fancy Collis struck me with the umbrella while I was down—I called "Police!"—Bond came up, and I gave them into custody—when I met them my hands were in my pockets in front, and my coat collar turned up—it was a sort of drizzling rain, and I was walking rather fast.</p>

CARTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe as a singer you attend public dinners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had been at a dinner at the London Tavern, professionally—I had also participated in the dinner—I did not take more than four glasses of wine the whole evening—I left soon after ten o'clock, and then had six penny-worth of brandy and water, and smoked a cigar, and then went by an omnibus from Grace church-street to the Elephant and Castle—the last omnibus was about half-past eleven—it was not a very light night, it was not foggy-Collis appeared to spread out her dress to hide the man—I heard no noise before I got up—I did not run against her, and chirrup like a bird; on my oath I did not put my hand upon some part of her person before the man came up at all—I have not been fined for beating my wife while I was drunk—I believe I have been before a Magistrate for being drunk, not more than once—I had a disagreement with my wife on that occasion—I suppose it was a breach of the peace, or I should not have been before the Magistrate—I was not fined, I was bound over to keep the peace—I did not hear Collis call "Police!" while I was struggling with the man—I will not swear she did not—when the policeman came I charged them with assault not with intent to rob, I think—I felt no hand in my pocket—My coat was buttoned up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman,</hi> L 61). I was on duty at Kennington, and saw the prisoners first opposite the Horns, Kennington-common, three or four yards from Newington-place, walking one behind the other—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them upward, of 200 yards towards Newington-place—I did not know either of them before—I crossed over, and spoke to them-a few minutes after that I heard the cry of "Police "three or four different times.—I went to the place, and found Mr. Leftler and the prisoners wrestling together—he gave them in charge—Mr. Leftler was bleeding very much from the mouth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see any wound on his mouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, under his lip, and one of his teeth was nearly knocked out-Tingle had a cut on his thumb, and another on his knuckles—he charged Mr. Leftler at the station with having bitten his thumb—when I first saw them they were swearing at one another, like people who were a little intoxicated—it sounded like a man's voice which cried, "Police!" it was gruff; and almost at the same time I heard a female scream," Police!"—I do not think she cried above twice—it was a drizzling night—there were three or four persons looking on, not interfering in any way.</p>

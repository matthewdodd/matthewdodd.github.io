                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Three Colt-street, Old Ford. I was at the White Hart public-house, Mile-end-gate, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 12th of April—I remained there about twenty minutes—I afterwards stopped at the door with an acquaintance—I had then a sovereign in a tobacco-box in my right hand trowsers' pocket, and a shilling, a halfpenny, and a farthing in my left trowsers' pocket—I</p>

               <p>walked down the road, and called to my friend, "Bill," and he called me "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>"—the prisoner then came up to me and said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, how are you?"—there was another woman with her—the prisoner then asked if I would treat them to some gin—I said, no, I did not keep company with lewd women, and if I had been ever so desirous of treating them there were no houses open—I was going on, and they came one on each side of me, and as I put one off the other came on—the prisoner put her hand into my left hand pocket, and got the money—I caught her hand before she got it out of my pocket, but she had got the money fast—I told her she had criminated herself for a very little, and if she did not let it go, I would give her in charge—she made nothing but scorn and laugh of it—I kept her, and gave her in charge of the policeman—I lost a shilling, a halfpenny, and a farthing.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not show us a farthing, and say you could not say you was without money, and force my hand into your trowsers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the only way in which I touched her was, to press her off from me, not wish<lb></lb>ing her to advance—I had a hole in my trowsers, at the top of the thigh, but it was not near where I had my money—I felt my money after I came out of the house, and had my hands in my pocket, as I went down the road—I took my hands out to beat the prisoner and the other woman off, first on the right and then on the left—I did not tell her I had lost all my money through a hole in my trowsers—I do not know how the prisoner knew I had a hole in my trowsers—I mentioned it before the Magistrate, but it was a rent between the legs, not at all attached to the pocket.</p>

On the 6th of January, which was Twelfth Day, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, bought a 10s. 6d. twelfth-cake, and offered me a 5l. note. I asked her what address I was to put on it? she gave me the name of "Moore, No. 29, Bury-street, St. James's." I told her I knew a person of the name of Moore, at No. 5, and asked her if she had not made a mistake? she said, No; she lived at No. 29, Bury-street, and repeated the name and number several times over. I gave her the change, and offered to send the cake home - She said she would take it herself (looking at a note)-this is the note. I have known a person of the name of Richardson to have lived at No. 29, Bury-street, for the last twelve years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. ANDREWS. It was a busy day. I only took one 5l. note on that day - I had other 5l. notes in the house. All the notes I take in a day are put into the till, and then into a bag - They are afterwards put with other notes. I know this to be the note by my own handwriting. I have looked over all my other notes, and will swear this is the one she gave me. She said Bury-street, St. James's. I asked her if it was St. James's? she said, yes. I have not been to No. 29 since I received it. There were no other customers in the shop - She was there about ten minutes; I swear she is the woman. I saw her again on the 26th or 27th of January, and knew her immediately I saw her.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Had you never taken any 5l. note with "No. 29, Bury-street, St. James's," on it - A. None. I am positive she is the person.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live at No. 6, Titchfield-street. On Twelfth Day, in the afternoon, the prisoner bought a half-guinea twelfth-cake at my shop. I served her; she tendered me a 5l. bank note to pay for it, for which I gave her change. Before I gave her change, I asked her to favour me with her address - She gave me the name of "Wise, No. 11, Golden-square," which I immediately wrote on the note, in her presence (looking at a note)-this is the note she gave me. I have since seen part of the twelfth-cake. I have made inquiry at No. 11, Golden-square, and found no such person lived there, but a Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. No. 11, Golden-square, is a shop. I had no suspicion of the prisoner. I put the note with others, but know it to be the same by the name and address The prisoner was in the shop five or ten minutes. I had never seen her before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSTIN. I live at No. 11, Golden-square. I lived there on the 6th of January. No person of the name of Wise lived there at any time whatever. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

In the early part of December, the prisoner came to our shop, and bought flaunel and other goods to the amount of 18s. - she paid me a 5l. note; I asked her for her address - She gave me the note of "Jackson, No.76, Whitechapel." I gave the note to

             to indorse, and saw him indorse it, with "Jackson, 76, Whitechap," before it was put into the till (looks at one)-this is it. I have no doubt of the prisoner's being the person. She was there twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She was a stranger - She was alone; I am sure she is the woman. I believe I went into the parlour while Grigg was indorsing the note - He had began to indorse it before I left him.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIGG. I am shopman to Mr. Waller. I remember the prisoner buying some goods at our shop the beginning of December - She gave my master a 5l. note, my mistress gave it to me to indorse. I asked the prisoner for her address; she said, "Jackson, 76, Whitechapel"-(looks at it)-this is it. I know it by the indorsement.</p>

            . I keep a grocer's-shop, at No. 18, Golden-lane, Barbican. On the 7th of January, the prisoner came to my shop, bought some things, which came to 3s. or 4s., and gave me a 1l. note. I asked her for her name and address - She gave me "Mrs. Atkins, No. 12, Mitchell-street, Brick-lane," which I wrote on the note (looking at it)-this is it - I gave her the change. I have tried to find out such a person, but cannot.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live at No. 36, Princes-street, Soho. The prisoner came to my shop in January last, after Twelfth Day-it might be a fortnight after. She bought a few cakes, and a quarter of a pound of ratifias - She tendered a 1l. note in payment. I asked her for her address - She said, "Mrs. Jones, Windmill-street," which I wrote at the bottom of the note (looks at one)-this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw her at Bow-street afterwards, and knew her immediately. I have no doubt of her being the person.</p>

            . I am a bank note inspector (looking at the four 5l. notes offered to Malley, Sewell, Milbourn, and Waller)-they are all forged in every respect; the plate, paper, dates and signatures are the same-the handwriting is the same (looking at the 1l. notes uttered to Howard and Poole) - They are forged in every respect; the paper and plate are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They are good imitations - I have seen better. Malley said positively he knew the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The note, 15,071, for 5l., dated the 4th of August, 1817 was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had any notes but what came from my husband or brother. When they gave them to me, I asked them what names and addresses were to be put on them? I thought the names were those of the persons they took them of. If I had known them to have been forged, I would not have passed them. My brother's name is Burnsley Goodluck - He is now in the house of correction. I was his housekeeper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Albert</hi>, lying in the London Bocks—she arrived on 16th June—the deceased, Charles Heckley, was first mate—the prisoner was cook—on 16th March the ship was lying at a place called Appevista, on the coast of Africa; that is on the high seas—I was writing in the cabin, about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, and heard a scuffle—I sent somebody to see what it was, and then went on deck—there is a ladder, up which you have to go from the deck to the poop, which is raised between four and five feet above the main deck—as I came out of the cabin I saw the mate staggering towards me; he appeared much intoxicated, and was on the steps to go down to the cabin—I said, "Mr. Heckley, you don't go down into the cabin in that state, to make the cabin in a mess"—the prisoner, who was behind him, snatched hold of his belt, which was round his waist, and dragged him very fast from the companion towards the edge of the poop—there is a rail there, but not across the gangway—I cried out, "Leave the mate alone! don't strike him"—I was afraid he had been thrashing him, because he was throwing himself about very furiously—the prisoner left him alone for a second or two, and the mate turned round and stepped into the front of the poop from two steps of the ladder going down to the main deck—he still appeared to be in a state of intoxication—he stood on the front of the poop, and was aiming a blow at the prisoner, and I being behind the prisoner, expected the blow as well, therefore I turned over from the larboard side to the starboard, and as I was crossing the deck I heard the mate fall from the poop on to the main deck—I then went, and saw him lying down on the main deck—I went down on the main deck, and said, "Mr. Heckley, this is very bad conduct of you"—he made no reply—he was lying on his back, with his face upwards—I did not speak to him a second time, I touched him—he was very much flushed in the face, and mutilated rather about the cheek bone and about the lips; I mean bruised; it was black, and swollen about the lips and both cheek bones—I called the second mate and the carpenter—I raised the deceased's head and shoulders, and tried every means to animate him, but was not able to do so—he died about a minute or more after I first went to him—I examined him, and found two small wounds on his eyebrows, which I compassed next morning with the prongs of the cook's tormentors, which is a sort of fork to get meat up with, and found that they were rather nearer together than the prongs, but I can account for that by the prongs contract<lb></lb>ing a little (I had not seen any fork in the prisoner's hand on this occasion)—they were not serious wounds—I rather think his nose was broken—he became discoloured behind the ears immediately after I went to him—I tried a blood vessel on the arm, but the blood would not flow—I know, from the prisoner's statement to me in the afternoon, that there had been a quarrel between him and the mate; he said that the night previous the mate had gone forward about midnight and thrown a deal of dirty water on his bed—I told him to go to his cook's house, and not to speak to the mate at present, as I thought he was rather intoxicated, and I did not wish to broach the subject; that was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

I was steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Albert.</hi> On 14th March I went on deck when this noise was heard—I got up before the captain, came, and found the cook beating the mate, who was lying on the poop, with his open hand; I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand—he gave him two or three more knocks on the side of the head, along the mizen mast and safe, knocking his head against the mizen mast and safe—the safe is where they keep the meat—the mate then got up, and was starting</p>

               <p>towards the captain to go into the cabin, who was coming up at the time from below, and who had sent me to see what it was—the captain told the mate not to come into the cabin, and make it in a mess, and called out, "One or two hands, come and take Mr. Heckley away from the cabin door"—the prisoner was the nearest; he came and dragged the mate hastily towards the poop by his belt—whether the mate fell down the first time I cannot say; he got off the poop into the main deck, but I cannot tell whether he fell or not; he appeared tipsy—he came up to the poop again, with his head down, as if he was going to strike the cook, who was on the break of the poop—the cook gave him a push, and he fell down on to the main deck between two casks, and struck his head against a palm oil cask—I heard the captain speak to him after that, but he did not speak or move afterwards.</p>

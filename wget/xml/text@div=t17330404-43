               <p>Dr. Stevens. I live in Covent Garden. On St. Paul's Day in the Evening, I went with my Daughter to visit a Friend in Silver-street. About Eleven I sent for a Hackney Coach, for as I expected to stay late I had discharged my own Chariot; the Coach waited at the Door about an hour and a half, and then I and my Daughter stept in. I suppose some Street Robbers had taken Notice of the Coach's standing there so long; for at the End of Foster-lane my Daughter told me there was a Couple of Men that follow'd us. The Coach going faster in Cheapside, she observ'd that they mended their Pace accordingly; Pappa! says she, how those Gentlemen run! She took them to be Gentlemen, for they were well dress'd. We went down Pater-noster-Row, and in <placeName id="t17330404-43-crimeloc178">Ave-Mary-Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17330404-43-crimeloc178" type="placeName" value="Ave-Mary-Lane"></interp>

A Man came to the Coach-door, and holding a Pistol to my Daughter's Head, he said, Don't be frighten'd Madam! but God damn you if you squawl, I'll shoot you thro' the Head! I had a Purse with 10 Guineas in it, which I secur'd, and gave him only a half Guinea, and a Spanish Dollar, which were loose in my Pocket. God damn you, says he, you have more! No I ha'nt, says I, you shall search me if you will. My Daughter gave him her Purse; he ask'd her what was in it? She said, Not above 3 or 4 Guineas. And then he bid the Coachman drive on.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the Person that robb'd you and your Daughter?</p>
               <p>Dr. Stevens. Yes, I am pretty sure it was that young Fellow there, he in the Blue-grey Coat, 
               <persName id="t17330404-43-person247">
                  Edward

            . As soon as he was gone, says I to my Daughter, you told me there were two Men, but I saw but one ? Pappa, says she, there was another, but he stood at a Distance. The Coachman likewise said there were two, but neither my Daughter nor he saw any more; and therefore I can't apprehend that Powers and the 3 Prisoners could all be there.</p>
               <p>Miss Stevens. My Father and I were robb'd by one Man. I gave my Purse to that Man. I can't say how much Money there was in it, any farther, than that there was above ten Shillings. I know none of the Prisoners, nor who it was that took my Money. The Account my Father has given is true, and I can add nothing more to it.</p>

            . The Prisoner Elms and I went to Will. Morris's Mother's (in Eagle-Court in the Strand) to sell some things that we had stole; we staid there till 9 at Night, and then I ask'd Will Morris to go out with me; but he not being well, refus'd; then Elms and I agreed to go together; he had two Pistols, and I had one, and a great Knife. We went down Holbourn, and so to Cheapside, where we met the other two Prisoners, Kemp and Taylor. They ask'd us to give them a Dram, for they said, they had been picking of Pockets all Night, and had got nothing but two Handkerchiefs, but they must get something else or it would never do. We went to a Gin-Shop over-against Stocks-Market, where we had half a Pint of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040008"></xptr> Gin, and we agreed to go out together, and get some Money.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that Agreement made in the Shop?</p>
               <p>Powers. No, it was as we were coming out.</p>
               <p>Court. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Powers. It was between 9 and 10 at Night. I don't remember the Day of the Month; but I think it was on a Friday. We went as far as Fleet-Street, and return'd thro' St. Paul's Church-Yard, and so to Cheapside again, before we met with any thing; but then we saw this Coach and agreed to rob it. It was then between 12 and 1 a-Clock. We all follow'd it to Cheapside-Conduit, and there we agreed that Elms and I should still follow the Coach, which went down Pater-noster-Row, and that Kemp and Taylor should go thro' Paul's Church-Yard, and meet us. We did so, and met in the Street that is over-against Warwick-Lane, and turns out of Pater-noster-Row into Ludgate-Street; I forgot the Name of the Place, and there we stopt the Coach.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you all four together then?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, but not very close. We were in Sight of one another.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that Kemp and Taylor agreed with you to rob this Coach?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, we agreed so to do as soon as we saw it, and they two agreed to go thro' Paul's Church-Yard for the same Purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. And how did you dispose of your selves when you met?</p>
               <p>Powers. Elms bid the Coachman stand. Says I to Taylor, the Watch is hard by. But says he, they don't see us; but for fear they should disturb us, it was agreed that he should stand and keep an Eye upon them. Then I went to the Coach-door, and desir'd the Doctor to deliver. The Doctor gave me a Dollar, and something else, but I don't know whether it was a half Guinea or a 6 Pence, for I dropp'd it out of my Hand. Then Kemp came and robb'd the Doctor's Daughter.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that kemp robb'd the young Lady?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, I am positive of it. I sold the Dollar for 4 s. 4 d. to a Silversmith in the Hay-Market in the Borough; 'tis on this Side the King's-Bench, and almost over-against Blue-Maid-Alley.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that Silversmith here?</p>
               <p>Powers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. And whither did you go after the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Powers. We went to Smithfield, and there we shared the Money in the Street. There was 11 s. 6 d. in the Purse. I had the Dollar for my Share, which they reckon'd at a Crown, and said, it was more than my Due. Then I cross'd the Water, and they went over the Bridge, in Expectation of meeting their Wives who walk'd the Streets.</p>
               <p>Elms. Where was I ever drinking in your Company, or in any Robbery with you?</p>
               <p>Powers, I have known Elms three Years. He never robb'd in my Company before, except only trifling Things, as when we took some Goods out of a Sash Window in Chancery-Lane. I was with him in the Poultry-Compter, where he robb'd two Taylors, and it cost me six Guineas to have the Bill brought in Ignoramus. And we have been in Newgate together too.</p>
               <p>Court. Call the Turnkey; swear him; Have you seen Elms before?</p>
               <p>Turnkey. Yes, my Lord; he and Powers were both Prisoners together, in the Common Side in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Elms. I was sent to the Compter only for an Assault.</p>
               <p>Kemp, to Powers. When we were in the Brandy Shop [at Stocks market] was any Body else with us? Powers. No.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Was I ever with you since you have been an Evidence?</p>
               <p>Powers. No, I have been in Jail ever since.</p>
               <p>Kemp. I mean, before you was an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes, when my Lady Page dy'd, he carry'd me down to Greenwich to cut Pockets at the Burying, and we follow'd her to Bunhill-Fields.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Was I ever drinking with you?</p>
               <p>Powers. Yes often, but we never were in any Robberies together, except in picking of Pockets, of Handkerchiefs and such Trifles.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Powers took me in Bird-Cage-Alley in the Mint, (on the 15th of February) to bring me on this Side of the Water. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040009"></xptr> resisted, and desired to go before a Justice, and so I was carried before Sir

            , Coachman. Not by Name; but if this is he, I have seen him before; he robb'd my Coach. I took up Dr. Stevens and his Daughter in Silver-Street. He bid me drive to King's-Street in Covent-Garden. That Day was three Weeks, about 3 in the Morning, I had taken up a Fare, to carry to the Sun in Clare-Market, and going behind Paul's my Fare was robb'd. And therefore not thinking it safe to go that way again, I drove down Pater-noster-Row. I was got but a little way down, when I saw two Men by my Coach side, one kept even with my Fore-Wheel, and the other with the Hind-Wheel. If I trotted, they mended their pace. There was no Watchmen on that side of the Way, but there were some on the other. I having been robb'd so lately, I had a Suspicion of them, and taking fast hold by my Seat. I stoop'd down and look'd hard at them betwixt the Wheel. I saw they were well dress'd, and Zookers, thinks I, why should I have an ill Opinion of these Persons, they look like Gentlemen? So I drove on; but in Ave-Mary-Lane, before I came to Stationery-Court, one of them catch'd hold of my Horse's Head, and the other went rou nd to the Coach Door, and open'd it, on that Side next to the Watch, which I thought was a little bold, for the Watch stood but at the Corner of Pater-noster-Row. When he had robb'd my Fare, they did not run away, but stood still, and bid me drive on, which I did. I look'd back three or four Times, and saw them both walk leisurely off together.</p>
               <p>Court. Both? Did you see but two?</p>
               <p>Headly. I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they both go to the Coach-door?</p>
               <p>Headly. No; but one of them, and that was Powers.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure of that?</p>
               <p>Headly. Yes, I am certain of it; for the other all the while walked to and fro by the Horses Heads, and cried, Hoy! - Have a Care! - What's the Matter? - Stand away! - to make believe that the Coach stood still to set down a Fare.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the Prisoners - go nearer - Did you see either of them there?</p>
               <p>Headly. I think that Man [Elms] is very like him that stopt the Horses, but I can't be positive; I would not swear away any Man's Life for the World.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Stevens, I think, Sir, you said, that the same Person who robbed you, robbed your Daughter ; are you positive as to that Particular?</p>
               <p>Dr. S. I am positive it was the very same Person.</p>
               <p>Court And are you, Madam?</p>
               <p>Miss S. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. And neither of you saw any more than two Men. Both. No more.</p>
               <p>Court. The Coachmen swears the same; and yet Powers has sworn, that there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173304040010"></xptr> four concern'd in the Robbery, and that self robb'd the Doctor, and Kemp the young Lady: This considerably lessens the Credit of Power's Evidence.</p>

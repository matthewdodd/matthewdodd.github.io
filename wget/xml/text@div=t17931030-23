On the 20th of September, being informed I had lost some property of this sort I went and found it in my stable; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300027"></xptr>two bags of raisins and several lumps of sugar; I then took them into my apron and carried them all home; they were there an hour and a half or more; my buyer who goes into the sugar market, he came home, and -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Don't tell us what your buyer said. - The man confessed himself that it was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Before his confession to you what did you say to him? did you advise him to confess the truth? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hint any advantage to him? - I did not promise him any thing. I said, when I found the goods, where did you have these from? Sir, says he, I will pay you for them all if you will be so good as to let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did not he first of all deny it, and then afterwards you threatened to send him to prison if he did not give an account of it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more but what he said? - There was a direction given him on the 19th, which I asked him what became of it, and that direction was found on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the key of this stable hang up in your shop? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not watching your key all the day? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body might have taken the key that was in your shop? - Undoubtedly; but there is nobody has any business there but the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that direction here that you spoke of? - The other evidence will bring it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of last month I went to take in nine trusses of hay that came out of the country, and I went up into the hay loft, and I was looking and there, up in the corner, laid a parcel of white sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who put it there? - I do not; it was in the hay rick, up in the corner.</p>
               <p>- GOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of last month, when I came home there was in the counting house four pieces of sugar, and sixty-eight pounds of raisins in two bags which had been found; we agreed to put them where we found them; on the next day we found they were removed, and we had a constable and had the prisoner taken up, and we made a further search in the stable and searched under the manger, and there they were; we brought them home and found they were half of them gone; when I came home I told the prisoner at the bar, I was sorry for what he had done. I am clerk to Mr. Axford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a direction with these things in the stable? - There was a direction found before in the parcel, which I have got in my pocket; this direction was given him the day before to take out; it was found by Talbot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct the prisoner to carry the things according to that direction? - I left word for him to go according to that direction.</p>
               <p>Court to Talbot. Where did you find that direction? - In the bag where the plumbs were, which was found in the stable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you left the parcel on the counter before you took it out again? - Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was in when you left it on the counter you cannot tell? - No, but I know I took it out.</p>
               <p>- WARREN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was the officer fetched to take the man into custody; I went home to his lodgings; I have got some sugar and raisins.</p>

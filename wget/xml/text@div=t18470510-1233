                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Gravel-lane, Hounds<lb></lb>ditch. On the 20th of April I was in the Pavillion in the Whitechapel-road, and went from there with my journeyman to a public-house close by—after having some ale I was coming out of the house—the prisoner Tedgell kept the door shut, holding it fast with one hand, to prevent us going out, and ap<lb></lb>peared to be picking up money—my journeyman, Crosby, called out, "Why do not you let us pass, and pick up the money afterwards?"—at that time Tedgell turned round his head, and I felt a snatch at my waistcoat-pocket—he was close to me at the time—I had a watch and guard-chain in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—I saw the guard hanging down, and the prisoner Phillips drawing his hand away—my watch was gone, and the swivel broke—he was</p>

               <p>close at my left-hand side—both prisoners had been at the door—I hallooed out, "Crosby, this man has robbed me of my watch."—Philips ran away—I did not take notice of Tedgell, but he ran away afterwards—I and Crosby ran after Phillips—Crosby was first—I followed him, calling "Police"—Crosby caught him—the policeman came right in his face—he could not run any further—it was a gold watch—it was not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Snapper, and live with him—I was with him at the public-house—coming out there were two men, one threw same money on the ground—I did not see the prisoners inside the public-house, nor at the door, to know them—I ran after Phillips, because as Mr. Snapper came out of the public-house he called out, "Crosby, he has robbed me of my watch"—I saw Phillips running away, and ran and caught him.</p>

I was on duty in Whitechapel-road, coming down towards the Pavilion—I heard a cry of "Police, stop thief!" several times, went into the road, and saw a dozen people running, and Phillips running in front of them—I ran right in his face—at the same time Crosby laid hold of the back of his neck—Snapper came up, and charged him with robbing him of a gold watch in the public-house—I took him in charge—he was taken to the Police-office, remanded, and afterwards discharged, as I found nothing on him—I searched him at the station.</p>

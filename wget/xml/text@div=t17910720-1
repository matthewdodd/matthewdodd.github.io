Smith felt for my buckles; says he those are silver; yes, says I, they are; says he, we must have them: they took no farther notice of my buckles, but seeing my chain, they asked for my watch; my buckles were very strong made, however massey they are, in trying whether they were silver or not, one of them was broke; I then pulled out my gold watch and gave it to them, and a metal chain, and three gold seals. I had very fortunately made a present of a gold chain which I had a few days before; just as I was handing the watch, says Smith, to me, I do not believe there is a guinea in the purse; yes, says I, you will find there is: and says I, there are some papers of consequence; I had a draft for two hundred guineas in the purse. I must confess that their behaviour towards me was such, that gave me, notwithstanding my fright, some degree of courage; they did not use one bad expression, they behaved extremely civil, more than I could expect; I then said, gentlemen, it is a metal watch, and a metal seal, they are of little consequence to you, I should be obliged to you for one of the seals, which has my coat of arms on it: the man that held the bridle, says, why d - n me, give it to the gentleman, give it to him; that is the man that is not here. Smith tried to tear off the seal, but he could not; and I said it goes on a swivel, if you will give it to me I will take it off; but Smith would not trust me with the watch, and he held it while I took off the seal. I said, have you spit your spite? they said yes: then says I, shake hands, and Smith shook hands with me, and he wished me a good night, and I wished them good luck; that was full eight minutes, it was the longest day. I wish I had the least doubt of them, I wish I had.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt? - Oh, none; I swear to him both by his face and his coat: I wish I had any doubt, I should be glad to save the lives of two fellow creatures; they had their hats on, round hats; these two men were quite near my chaise, the other man I could not positively swear to; I did not see them till I saw them at the Justice's the Tuesday following: I believe this was on the Tuesday before. I never recovered any of my property.</p>

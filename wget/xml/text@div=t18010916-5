               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Were they the property of your late husband? - A. No; they were intrusted to him to clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they are not property that you could possibly identify? - A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT NEWMAN sworn. - I am a constable; Mr. Harris sent for me to take charge of the prisoner; Mr. Harris was alive at that time; the prisoner then had the breeches on; Mr. Harris said, in the presence of the prisoner, I will swear these are my breeches that he has now got on; I had them to clean; he said, Mr. Harris had given them to him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Harris.) Q.Had you ever seen these breeches yourself, in the cellar? - A. I had, nearly three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant in the house? - A. He was a weekly servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were there any wages due to the prisoner at the time? - A. I don't exactly know; when he absconded from our service, I believe there was half-a-crown due to him,</p>
               <p>Q. The breeches are worth, what? - A. I don't know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Harris had been in the habit of lending the prisoner a waistcoat or breeches? - A. I had once lent him a waistcoat and breeches of Mr. Harris's own wear, but never any thing of a customer's, and when I told Mr. Harris of it, he blamed me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, there is no mark upon them by which any person here can identify them to be Mr. Harris's breeches? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been often disappointed of my wages of a Saturday night; I asked Mr. Harris the favour of this pair of breeches, to lend me them till I could get my own out of pledge, and he said, never mind it if it is for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010916-5-verdict22" type="verdictDescription">

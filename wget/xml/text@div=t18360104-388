On the 13th of December, be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was sent for, and these hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs had been left at my shop for me to look at—the prisoner Franks came afterwards, and asked if I would buy those handkerchiefs which had been left—I asked if she came honestly by them—she said they belonged to a young man, who was going for a soldier, and he wished to dispose of them—I said we had received information that such things had been stolen, and I thought they were part of the property—she said she did not think it was, or something to that effect—the officer then came, in whom I had spoken to before—he asked how she got them—she said she had been sent to my house to know if I would purchase them, and that they had been brought by Eliza Lacey; that the young man was outside, and he had got some merino—the officer took her, but could not find the man.</p>

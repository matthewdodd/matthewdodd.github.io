               <p>DR. BEAZLEY. These copy-books and pens are mine; I bought the pens a few days before, and ex<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290017"></xptr>amined them particularly, because I bought them of a Jew; my school-room windows swing in the middle, and fasten with a button; my house is in the parish of Hillingworth.</p>

            's Defence. I had been out spending the evening at a public-house, and on going to Mr. Lloyd's to sleep, I saw two men rush out of Mr. Cox's park, and drop a bundle - I thought it was game, and took it up; I found what the contents were, and put them into my pocket - I gave it to my mother in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. LLOYD. He had no bundle when he came to my house, that I saw.</p>

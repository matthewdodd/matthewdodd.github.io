He struck me with his fist, and the two other men came up, and struck me likewise; and when I was falling back with the blows, Tubbs took hold of my watch-chain, and pulled my watch out. He snatched it out of my pocket. I fell with the blows, and my eye was cut, by falling on the curb-stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner is the man - A. Because I could know him in two years. I am positive sure he is the man. I took notice of the man when he struck me. When the other men told him to strike me, I noticed him so as to know him again. When he took my watch he made away. This was on the Sunday. I saw him again on the Tuesday, at the Two Brewers, in Shoe-lane. I was sure he was the same man. I told the publican, as soon as I saw him, that he was the man that knocked me down. The publican told me to go for an officer. I went for an officer, and gave charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. No, not at all. It was a dark night. I saw his face. The lamp stood over his face, and I looked under his hat. I shewed the officer where I was knocked down. My mistress was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your mistress - A. My wife. We are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280048"></xptr> not lawfully married, but I make her my wife. We live together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Did not you tell the magistrate that she was your wife - A. I suppose I did. I told the magistrate she was my wife.</p>

            . I am a grocer and chandler. I live at 84, Shoe-lane. On Sunday evening, about ten o'clock, I found the prosecutor laying in the kennel. I picked him up. He appeared lifeless when I first rose him up. He bled profusely. I went in for a candle. I was with him ten minutes. I never heard of any loss that night. On the following morning I did. I do not know the prosecutor nor the prisoner.</p>

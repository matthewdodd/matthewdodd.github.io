On the first of August, when the prince's cup was fail'd for, we went to bed about eleven o'clock; our dogs made a prodigous noise in the night; we have a gallery room that does not join to the house, it is a place built for gentlemen to fit in to have the pleasure of the water. About noon, on the second, I went into it and miss'd the things mentioned. The India prints were nail'd up with brass nails, every one was drawn out. I advertised them on the Saturday, with a guinea reward and no questions ask'd; on the Friday I had information, by a person that is oblig'd to attend business at this time, of the prisoner; we took him up, and before the justice he acknowledged the fact. His voluntary confession was read in court, wherein he acknowledged the taking them and how, sign'd by his own hand.</p>

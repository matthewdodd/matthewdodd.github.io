                  </hi>. I live at Ludgate-hill, and am assistant to a chemist and druggist. On 18th May I had been supping with a friend; I was returning home about a quarter past 11 o'clock—I passed Hare-court, Shore-ditch—two men rushed out and knocked my hat off—I stooped to pick it up, and one of them kicked it up the alley—I went up, and several persons seized me, and dragged me into the alley—one of them put his arm round my throat, and I became insensible—when I came to my senses I missed my watch, and chain, and hat—I found a woman standing over me—I went to the station, and gave information—I saw the two men who assaulted me at first—the prisoner is one of them—there is a gaslight over the alley, and three or four lamps from a public house—I felt my head aching very much indeed—I gave a description of the prisoner to the policeman, and he apprehended him on the following Thursday—I saw him on the Thursday evening.</p>

CARTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, on Sunday night, a few minutes before 11 o'clock; I had been dining and supping with a friend in Hackney-road, and was returning home—this was not a dark alley, it is a paved court, leading to some other street—five or six men were engaged—two of them rushed out as I was passing, and knocked my hat off—one of them I had an opportunity of seeing, that was the prisoner—I was going to pick my hat up, and one of them gave it a kick, and four others came to me and dragged me into the alley—they pulled me a short distance down—I had never seen the prisoner before that I was aware of, he was perfectly unknown to me—I could not give a good description of either of the other men—I speak to the prisoner as one of the two men that came out—I could not give such a description of the other two as I could of this one—these two men dragged me first—the pri<lb></lb>soner was on my right hand, the other on my left—I looked more at the one on my right than at the one on my left—I became insensible by one of the four men, who were waiting in the court, passing his arm round my throat—the whole transaction continued three or four minutes—I stooped to get my hat, and one of them kicked it—I discovered the features of the prisoner when they were dragging me down the alley—the prisoner was on my right, I looked at him very closely—a crowd collected very soon—I gave a description of the prisoner to the policeman.</p>

On Sunday night, 18th May, I was in Shoreditch, about 20 minutes before 11 o'clock—I passed the prisoner and four others at the corner of Hare-alley—I afterwards took the prisoner—I told him it was for stealing a watch from a gentleman on Sunday even<lb></lb>ing—he said, "It was not me, I was in bed by 9 o'clock."</p>

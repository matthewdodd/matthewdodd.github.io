               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you known me?- A. Three years to the best of my knowledge; I always had that opinion of him, that I could have trusted him as I would myself; I never had any suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>JOHN JUPT sworn. - I am a chairman: On the 9th of July, I was at my own door, in Dorset-street, between ten and eleven in the morning; I saw the prisoner run by me, the porter was in pursuit of him; then he ran up Spring-street; I then saw him throw the linen over an area, and while the porter pursued him, I went and picked it up. (The napkins produced, and deposed to by Mr. Israel.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called eight respectable witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

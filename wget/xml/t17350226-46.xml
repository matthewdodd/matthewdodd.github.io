The Prosecutor happening to come home, we seiz'd upon him at the Gate and carried him into the Stable and bound him as we had done his Men. We left Bush and Turpin to stand over them with Pistols, and then I and the four others went to the Door of the House and knocked: The Maid opened it, we pushed in and bound her and the Daughter. The old Gentlewoman crying out, Fielder broke her Head, and set her in a Chair, and Gregory stood over her to keep her quiet. We searched the House, and took a Silver Punch Ladle, Cup and Strainer, a Gold Watch with a Chain and Seal, and a Picture, four Rings, two Shirts, two Pair of Stockings, and a great many other Goods, ten Pound all but eighteen Pence in Silver. As for Guineas I saw none, and if there were any they sunk them upon me. When we had got all ready to go off; we threatned the Family that if they made any noise we could come back to them, and so we left them all bound and went away.</p>

Upon that they presented their Pistols and carried me into the Stable, where they bound me with my Men. My Eyes are bad, and I can't swear to their Persons.</p>

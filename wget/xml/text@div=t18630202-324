                  </hi>. I live at 24, Tower-street—I am married, but am separated from my husband, and now live with my mother—the prisoner is my brother, and lodges with my mother—there was a quarrel between them; he used violence to my mother, and I called "Police"—he ran out—he returned about two hours afterwards, about 10'clock—I was then in bed—he made use of a very bad expression, and said he would do for me for trying to get him into custody; and he took up a knife that lay on the table, and stabbed me in the temple and in the arms—I gave an alarm, and some one went for a policeman; but before he returned the prisoner ran off a second time—the constable took me in a cab to the Charing—cross hospital—I had my head bandaged and dressed, and returned home that night—the prisoner came in late in the evening, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I am resident surgeon at Charing-cross hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there on 27th January—she was suffering from a wound over the right temple, about three—quarters of an inch in breadth, and a quarter of an inch deep, leading down to the bone and dividing in its course a branch of the temporal artery, which had been bleeding profusely—she had also a wound of the right arm—they were incised wounds, such as a knife would produce—I have not seen her since—I only dressed her wounds, and she went away—I advised her to come into the hospital, but "she wished to remain out—the wounds were doing very well—they were not dangerous; erysipelas might have supervened, but it has not.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of December, about a quarter past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the corner of Angel-alley, Bishopsgate, and saw the prisoner and another man cross the street, with a chest of tea between them - I immediately ran up, and laid hold of the prisoner - he slipped from me, and ran across the way; the other ran down the alley. I got a man to mind the chest, while I secured the prisoner, who was never out of my sight. I then returned, and took him and the chest to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not at first see only one man with it? A. No, both were carrying it between them. The man who I left in care of the chest is not here - I was absent about two minutes. A carman came up and owned it. I took notice of it, but not so as to know it by any mark.</p>

            . I am carman to Peter Palmer, of Somerset-street. On the 7th of December, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and about ten yards from Angel-alley I missed a chest of tea from my cart, and found it in two minutes. I had six chests, and was taking them to Mr. Pickman, and had a permit.</p>

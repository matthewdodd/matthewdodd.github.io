            . I sell fish in the street. On the 8th of July, I was in Drury-lane, within ten minutes of ten o'clock at night; I went into Smith's public-house and saw the prisoner there and others in company - I was going in to sell pickled eels and perriwinkles; the very minute I went in I saw this company and never went near them - I turned round to another company and said, "Gentlemen pickled eels and perriwinkles," and the very minute the prisoner saw me he came and pulled up his trousers and said, "Kick that dirty stocking;" I said, "No, my good boy, go away from me, I will have nothing to do with you in the name of God;" he was tantalizing me a long time to kick his shin, I would have nothing to do with him - he went up to the end of the tap room and brought a piece of wood, and said he would have my life; he was prevented from doing that - he went out and came in again, and said he would not leave the place till he had my life: he went out again, and Smith said to the officer "Look out, for there is to be something this night;" and I was given in charge of the officer to protect me; I went as far as Parker's in <placeName id="t18330905-2-crimeloc9">Broadway, St. Giles'</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was that before you went out of Smith's house? A. Yes; he struck me, and I struck him, and he fell down; it was not the blow I gave him that knocked him down; I did not hit him very hard - I think it was better than a quarter of an hour after that, that I was stabbed - it is not a very short distance from Smith's to Broadway St. Giles'; I struck him and he fell down - he only struck me once, and I believe I never struck him but twice; I went out of the house immediately on that, and left him there - I was stabbed once on the loin, and again on the shoulder; I was afterwards attended by a surgeon.</p>

            . I am assistant to the surgeon whom the prosecutor came to; he came into the surgery in Drury-lane a little after ten o'clock; he had two wounds, one over the shoulder, and the other in his loins; the one over the shoulder was a very trivial wound, indeed, both of them were very slight; I saw a trowel which appeared to me to be the instrument which would inflict them; the wound over the shoulder penetrated about a quarter of an inch, the other was a slight scratch.</p>

            , public-house, Drury-lane; it is No. 15, near the top of Drury-lane. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner at our house; I saw the prisoner ever so many times pull up his trousers for the man to kick his shins, and he said he would have nothing to do with him; I went out of the house and was out a good bit; I came in again, and the prisoner came into the house and struck the prosecutor, and then the prosecutor hit him again, and then the prisoner went; I did not see any more blows struck, for the prisoner fell down - he did not fall down on being struck; the prisoner then went out, and then the prosecutor went out; the policeman was outside, and the policeman went with him as far as the corner of the street; when the prosecutor came back to my father's door, I was standing outside; but before that, the prisoner had come up, and said he had got something in his hand which would do for the prosecutor; he repeated that several times; the prosecutor came by the door, and the prisoner was there, and directly the prosecutor came by the door, the prisoner came behind him and gave him a stab in the left loin, then the prosecutor went into the house and put down his basket, and as soon as he came out, the prisoner stabbed him again on the right shoulder; the prosecutor hallooed out "I am stabbed," and then the prisoner ran across the road - the officer ran after him, and I followed him; and when I got up to him he had got his arms round him; he tried to throw the trowel away, but could not, and he dropped it; the prosecutor picked it up and gave it to the policeman - the prosecutor had left our house about five minutes before he returned; the prisoner was trying to provoke him to kick his shins some time, and then he struck the prosecutor, and the prosecutor returned the blow; that was all that I saw.</p>

            . I am a policeman; I was not in the public-house - I was on duty on the 8th of July; Smith's son came to me - I went up to the house, and saw the prisoner in the attitude of fighting the landlord; I went up to him and remonstrated with him, and said he had better go away or I should lock him up; he said he would take my advice, and went away; I went round my beat twice, and the second time of coming round, I heard something at Smith's door again, and saw Neville come out of Smith's, and I saw the prisoner with the trowel in his hand, stab Neville in his shoulder; he ran away, Smith ran after him, and I also; he caught him by the right arm; the prisoner tried to throw the trowel away and dropped it in the gutter; the prosecutor picked it up - I have it; it is a bricklayer's trowel; I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

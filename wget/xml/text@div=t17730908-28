               <p>Coleby. I cannot tell the particular night, it was the beginning of the week, I believe the latter end of July; Marriot got down the area and opened the window; I believe he put his hand against it and forced it open; as soon as he got in, he struck a light and lighted a candle; we were alarmed in the kitchen; Peal called out and said somebody had seen us; and with that Marriot left the candle, and we came up again and waited about the door to see if any body saw us; and when we found nobody saw us, we went down again and struck a light and lighted some paper to see if we could find the candle; we could not find any, so we lighted some matches and at the kitchen door we found a bit of candle; then we went up stairs and rifled what places we could, but could not find any thing of any value; we broke open several boxes.</p>

               <p>Coleby. This chissel is one of them; we had two; we took away a pair of stone shoe buckles, a pair of knee buckles, and a mourning ring; there were several small things; there was a gold watch chain, we sold it for a metal one to one Votiere.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any stones?</p>
               <p>Coleby. Yes, the top and the bottom to my opinion of a snuff box; I don't know whether it was for that use of no.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe Votiere has these stones.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this done in the night?</p>
               <p>Backwell. About the hour of one in the night, between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were present at Votiere's, all three of you?</p>
               <p>Coleby. No; they carried them to Votiere's, and I went the next day to meet Votiere, at the Bull's Head in Beadle-street to receive the money for them.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I took this property into my workshop, which is in my dwelling-house. I left the shop at four o'clock in the afternoon, and shut up the workshop. I only latched it, not locked it - it was all safe then; I did not go there again till three o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday. I found the door which is in my garden open, and the property gone. I traced footsteps of a full grown man over some loose mould and sand, from the place over the wall, where I supposed the person had escaped. I could not judge whether they were the steps of more than one person. I went to the prisoner's mother's house last Monday, which was a fortnight after the robbery. I found there a copper box, which I had lost, and which contained the gold; a tea cannister was also there. I found a pair of gold ear-rings at the prisoner's lodging; he was a stranger to me. I was at home from four o'clock on Saturday, till three on Sunday. I am certain I had latched the door.</p>

I saw the property safe at ten o'clock on Saturday morning, and at ten o'clock on Sunday morning I saw the shop door open - I thought my husband was in there, and did not say anything. Between three and four o'clock the robbery was discovered. I think the person had entered by the gate. I had heard footsteps on Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, coming up the yard, which leads to the shop; I supposed it to be the doctor coming to the house, as there was a person ill. There was no appearance of marks on the door, it had only been latched.</p>

On the night the prosecutor says he was robbed, I will take my oath he was in bed and fast asleep at the time - it was a fortnight ago last Saturday - he was not out all day; he was very ill indeed, and went to bed at ten o'clock. I got up between six and seven o'clock and left him in bed, and staid at home with him till ten or eleven o'clock, and then went to the water-side; I returned in half an hour, and was at home all the afternoon - we went to bed together between ten and eleven o'clock. I got up at six o'clock. I came home to breakfast, and never asked whether he was in bed or not. He had a violent pain in his inside. He went to the doctor for medicine on Saturday morning. I recollect it because it was the only day I was at home. I could not sleep sound, for he was so ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 7th of October, I was stationed, in plain clothes, opposite Mr. Bentley's shop, to watch what was going on, and about eight o'clock in the evening I saw Sherwood come out of the shop—I followed him into a marine-store shop, No. 20, I believe, Tower-street, Seven Dials—the female prisoner was in the shop, and a man—when I followed Sherwood in, he turned round and saw me—he then said to the man and to the female prisoner, "Have you got those things ready for me?"—the man answered "Yes, walk into the back-par<lb></lb>lour"—he went into the back parlour—I followed him—the female pri<lb></lb>soner followed him likewise—when he got into the back-parlour he pulled off his hat and placed it on the table—I looked into it, and saw a brown-paper parcel—I then told him I was a constable, and I wished to see what he had got about him—I then went to take out the parcel from his hat, and as I was doing so, the female prisoner came and took something from under the counter in the back-parlour, placed it in her apron, and tried to make her escape out at the back-door—I ran after her, and pulled her in<lb></lb>side—I found the parcel in his hat contained these nine pieces of soap, which I produce, and in further searching him at the station, I found two pieces in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a perfumer, and live in Holborn—Sherwood was in my employ nearly twelve months, as a soap boiler, and was employed only in melting and cutting up soap—I can swear to these pieces of soap by the perfume—each perfumer has his own perfume—I have not the slightest doubt they are mine.</p>

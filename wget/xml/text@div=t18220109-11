               <p>"I laid my watch here last night, and it is gone," he said I suppose Mr. Reynolds has played a joke with it; nothing more passed till breakfast, we were then altogether in the room, and I asked Mr. Reynolds if he had played a joke with my watch, he said</p>
               <p>"No". The prisoner helped me to search the house all over, and then he went out for a walk with Mr. Reyolds, and at dinner time, I insisted on finding it; the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think I have got it;" I said, I did not know, but as only we slept in the room, and I barred the door, I thought nobody but him could have it - he said if he was suspected he would apply to the Magistrate directly; I charged him with it, he denied it. I recollected he had a gold seal on his own watch, which he had not got at this time - I asked where it was, he said he had lost it. I sent for a constable, he acknowledged having the watch, and took us to a chandler's shop at Tottenham, where it was tied up in a parcel; his seal and key were hung on my watch.</p>

            . The prosecutor and prisoner spent the evening at my house. I became acquainted with the prisoner three or four months ago; I invited him to my house, to introduce him to a watch maker, as a seal engraver; he stopped till half-past twelve o'clock - I said he could have half a bed with my man, and next morning he asked if I had played a lark with his watch. About eleven o'clock, the prisoner enquired for a hairdresser, and half an hour after, he went out to see the floods, I went with him, suspecting him - he said,</p>
               <p>"You go to the butcher's, and I will follow you;" he went into the shop, I stood outside, he came out, and said,</p>

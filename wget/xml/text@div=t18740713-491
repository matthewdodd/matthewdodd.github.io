                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 69). On 16th May, some time after mid-night, I heard a disturbance in Vent Street, Deptford, and found two men in a corner making a disturbance and the prisoner at the bottom of the street holloaing to them backwards and forwards—I told the prisoner to stop that noise and go home quietly, and he struck me a blow on my mouth with his fist, ran across the street, picked up two stones and threw them at me—he was picking up a third when I got hold of him—we struggled and fell, I on the top of him—he begged me to let him get up—I did so, and he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187407130051"></xptr>
               <p>no sooner on his legs than he hit me a severe blow with something which he had in his fist and knocked me down, fell on top of me, and seized me by the throat with both hands and held me till he was pulled off—I pulled out my rattle to spring for assistance, but the prisoner seized me by the right wrist and prevented my doing so—I snatched it away and hit him on the face under his left eye, which fetched blood on-his cheek—he called out <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, three more men came to his assistance, and I received a very severe blow on the right side of ray head, which knocked me off of the prisoner on to my left side—I do not know what it was with—the prisoner was then dragged from under me by his companions and he drew out my truncheon and gave me two severe blows with it in the same place on my head—I became insensible, and he got away—when I recovered I was laying in the road and no one was there—I struggled up on my hands and knees and the neighbours bathed my head with cold water—it was bleeding from three, different wounds—I have not had my truncheon since—I have been off duty ever since, and have now got a month's sick leave—the prisoner was brought to the station about 2 o'clock and I identified him directly.</p>

I am a railway porter, of 6, Angle Street, New Cross—I was in Vant Street about 12.30 on Sunday morning, heard a tremendous noise and heard Hewson speak to them—the man said that he was not making any noise at all and knocked Hewson down and knelt on him and put his hand on his collar—I heard Hewson moaning and went to his assistance; the man had his knees on his chest pressing him—I got him off, and in about two minutes he knocked him down again and pulled him up again—Hewson then got the best of him and got on top of him—as I went for assistance I heard Hewson call out "Oh, oh," and saw him go to a house and there they washed his head—I did not see Hewson strike the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Rotherhithe—on 17th May, about 10 a.m., I examined Hewson's head; it had been dressed and strapped up; I found three wounds on the right side, one was an inch and a half long, and another about an inch—they were clean cut wounds down to the bone—in wounds of the head you have them very clean cut in consequence of the resistance of the bone—they might have been inflicted by a policeman's staff—he is still under my care—he is still incapacitated from duty—they must have been very severe blows—he also suffered from inflamation of the throat, which might have been occasioned by the pressure of a man's hand.</p>

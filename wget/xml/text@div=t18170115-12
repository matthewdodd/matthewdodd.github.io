            . I was chairing at Mr. Flemming's. On the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner on the stairs, on the third floor, she had a bundle in her apron; I asked her what it was, she said it was nothing to me. Knowing she had no business in the house, I stopped her; she had got two sheets and a quilt, rolled up together; she said, let me pass. She was secured. She said she was sent to fetch them, and was to be paid for her time.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner go from his house at Hammersmith, on Sunday, the 24th of February, about eight o'clock in the morning; he went to the pig-stye in the yard, with something concealed under his coat - I saw him come from the pig-stye again, apparently with nothing; I saw Mr. Reynolds take the mutton from the stye about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long have you known him? A. About three months; this is a common yard to seven or eight houses - the stye is about twenty yards from the house I live in; I know Goddard, but I did not see him with any meat - I am married, but my husband does not live with me; I get my living by shoe-binding - I have never been in custody for robbing my master.</p>
               <p>JOHN REYNOLDS (Police-constable T 1). I produce the meat; I got part of it out of the prisoner's pig-stye - I then searched his house, and saw the mark of a chisel on the boards, as if they had been raised with it; I found this chisel in the room - I raised the boards, and found the other piece of meat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. On the Sunday afternoon; I had been there in the morning, and found the prisoner and some children - the prisoner was about the yard; he asked me if I wanted a hammer, and I said Yes - and he brought me one; I did not search the pig-stye then, but I did the privy and some of the houses in the yard; I went up stairs to search the prisoner's house, and found some little bits of suet there - he said it was some tallow he had dropped from his candle the night before; I then went away, but was not satisfied; I went again, and found the meat as I have described, in the pig-stye - any person might go to the pig-stye; it is in a public court.</p>

On the evening of the 18th of April I went out about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock - it was then dark; I fastened the door, and left nobody within. I returned about five minutes before ten, and found the stable door unlocked; it had been opened by a false key, for the lock was not injured; I then went up to my room, and found that door unlocked also; I had locked it, but left the key in the door - on going in I missed two livery coats, one from behind the door, and the other from off the bed; they were provided by my mistress, but were worn out, and were mine; I went to my box, and missed two pairs of breeches, a jacket, overalls, and waistcoat; they were all in the room when I went out; I also missed two stable jackets. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone-office. I have known the prisoner for three years; on Saturday night, the 28th of April, at a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock, he passed me in Dean-street, Lisson-grove, with a bundle under his right arm; the instant he passed he turned, and seeing me following he flung the bundle down; I followed him about fifty yards, calling out Stop that man! the streets there have a number of turnings, and I did not pursue further, but turned back and picked up the bundle, fearing I should lose it; I am sure it is the same bundle. I saw him again next morning, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, standing at a corner shop in Lisson-street, with his face towards me - I was about fifty yards off; I suppose he saw me, for he turned his face, and looked into a shop: I ran up, and caught him by the collar of his coat; he did not run away; I said, "You ran from me last night, but I have caught you this morning, and you must go with me;" he asked what for - I said for the bundle which he had flung down; he then laid down, and said he would not go unless I fetched a coach - I took him to the office. I am positive he is the man, for I have seen him about twelve times a week for the last two or three years. I produce the bundle.</p>
               <p>T. HARPER. Here are two pairs of breeches, two pairs of overalls, and a pair of livery breeches, all of which are mine, and were in my room when I left - the coats have not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about them.</p>

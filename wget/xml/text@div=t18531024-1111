                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>), I am a native of Poland; I live at No. 12, Featherstone-buildings. I arrived in London from Paris on 1st Sept.—I saw the prisoners three or four days after my arrival in London, at an hotel, No. 23, opposite the Post-office, where I was then living—they spoke first to me, and asked me what I was doing—I told them—I am not certain which spoke—they both spoke; they said that they knew Mr. Nicoll, that they were intimate with him; they did business with him, and they could do business to the amount of 10,000 or 20,000 francs a week or a month, I am not certain which—they asked me about my power to manufacture certain articles—that was embroidery, to embroider shirt fronts and different articles, and particularly embroidering gold for uniforms—they spoke both, but it was particularly the male prisoner—I told them I could reply to that request, that I could do them; not yet, but perhaps in a little time after—I told them I could embroider the shirt fronts directly, but the gold embroidery in a little time—I said we could do business together first to a small amount, till we saw how we got on, and then to a larger amount—they gave their address in Oxenden-street—I do not recollect the number—they ordered a piece of cam<lb></lb>.</p>

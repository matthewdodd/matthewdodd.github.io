               <p> SARAH BATTOMLEY. On the 16th of August I was in the front parlour, from one to two o'clock. Then I tied my weeks linen up, belonging to the whole family in a bundle, I placed that bundle in an arm chair, at the further end of the room from the door. I went away exactly as the clock struck two. I shut the front parlour door. I have the whole house; the outer door of the parlour in which these things where was shut; then I went to attend my school room, which is close to my parlour; there is not a great distance from the two doors. At half past four I had occasion to go into the room, and I missed my things. I made an alarm, and a neighbour of mine gave me some information; her name is

            . There were in the bundle, the things mentioned in the indictment, and other things. The most valuable of them have not been found. All the things might be worth thirty shillings; I saw part of them at Lambeth-street, and knew them again.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON BATTOMLEY. At the time I found the prisoner in the act of pledging part of the property a shirt, and a waistcoat, in one of my own pocket-handkerchiefs. The shirt and waistcoat were not my property. The bundle was in her right hand, And the instant I went into the shop, I said that was my handkerchief, and the pawnbroker told me to be very circumspect, as there were many handkerchiefs alike, it was my handkerchief. She said she had bought it fifteen months before in Bethnal Green Road. She was going with me to shew me where she bought it, and about for or five steps from the door, two of Mr. Richardson's young man came after me with the bundle, and asked me if it was mine; and I made answer that the hankerchief was, as well as the property that was inside of it. I had not the bundle there. I observed that the handkerchief was mine. When I took the prisoner back to the pawnbrokers, I specified what things were my property. I opened the bundle, there I discovered the childrens frocks in the bundle, and I knew the things all to be mine except a waistcoat and shirt; that was the same bundle I had seen in the pawnbrokers shop with the prisoner, The prisoner then said that it was her sister at Bethnal Green sent her to pawn them and it was a cruel thing. Then I took her down to Lambeth-street office immediately; going along, a great many people tried to rescue her. When I delivered her in charge to the officer, he searched her, and she made an answer and said, that all the things in the bundle were not mine; she said just the same before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I live with Richardson the pawnbroker. I remember the prisoner coming to Mr. Richardson's shop on the 16th of August; he brought with her a shirt, waistcoat and an old handkerchief; I did not see anything else with her then. She proposed to pawn them. I afterwards saw a bundle in the shop which she had dropped. The prisoner, when she dropped the bundle, pulled the woman that was next her over it; that was to hide the bundle from Mr. Battomley's seeing it, and when they were gone, the woman pulled it out; I know that woman did not bring that bundle in. Mr. Richardson and I then went, and that handkerchief matched the other which Mr. Bottomley had.</p>

            . I live right facing of Mrs. Battomley's house. On the 16th of August, I saw some one go into Mr. Battomley's house, I don't know the time, as I have no clock. I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Battomley's house; I am positive of it; she went in at the street door, I saw her come out again; she remained in a very few minutes; she had nothing with her when she went in, but when she came out, she had a bundle with a silk handkerchief carefully thrown over it; she turned to the left, I can't tell rightly what the hour was: it was after my dinner. I work at a mangle, I was terribly busy, This was on a Friday, which is a very busy day with me.</p>

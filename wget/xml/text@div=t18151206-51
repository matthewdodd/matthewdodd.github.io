When I got home with her, I thought it too little, and gave her seven shillings extra. We had some spirits to drink, and we then went up stairs, and I began to undress myself, and she took three three shilling bank tokens out of my waistcoat pocket; I did not care a b-r about the silver, and therefore she might have it. I put my clothes under the pillow, and she under a pretence of adjusting it, took the two one pound notes out of my pocket; instantly she flew down stairs. I did not think it safe to pursue her, not knowing who might be below, as perhaps there might be a combined party, who would take my clothes too. I reported it to the landlady, and she gave me leave to stay all night. When it was day light in the morning, I took down the number of the house, and the name of the alley, and observed, that exactly opposite the chamber window, there was the sign board of one Locke, a carpenter. I then went and informed an acquaintance of mine, named

            . In consequence of information we received, we went to the corner of Short-street, Old street road, where the prisoner had some articles left in lieu of a triffle of money she owed them; she had a trunk, and some things, and I concluded as she had got money, she would pay the debt and come and take them away. We waited there all the day, and in the evening, sure enough she came; we then apprehended her, and had her taken into custody. I am positive as to her person; I was quite sober.</p>

            . I have known the prosecutor for some time. I assisted him in the search after the prisoner. I was in his company the evening previous to the robbery, and therefore he came to me the first thing in the morning. I went with him to the house at the corner of Short street, and waited with him until the prisoner came in; we then gave her in charge of Mr. Harding, the City constable.</p>

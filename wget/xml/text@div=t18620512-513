I live at 13, Sydenham-park, and am a gentleman—on 14th March I was at the corner of New Oxford-street, about ten minutes to 10 at night, waiting for an omnibus—the prisoner seized me by the coat, and then, with his right hand, I think, he took a valuable brooch form my scarf, and then struck at me and I fell on the ground—it was a thrusting hit from him, not a severe blow—he turned and ran away immediately—I saw him within two minutes afterwards in custody—I was shook very much—when I got up he was in custody of the police—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I live near Gray's-inn-lane, and am a porter—on 14th March I was coming down by New Oxford-street about 10 o'clock—I saw the prisoner take a brooch out of Mr. Winter's scarf—Mr. Winter fell down—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him from the corner of Tottenham-court-road to the corner of Crown-street—I had him in sight all the while</p>

               <p>—I put out my hand to catch him, but missed him, and he ran—I caught him a second time and we struggled together—he tried all he could to get away, but I was his master—he tried to kick me, but missed the first time, the second time he kicked me violently between the legs—he aimed the blow there; and he also tried to kick me a third time—when he was on the ground he tried to bite me, but could not—I was a-<hi rend="italic">top</hi> of him when police<lb></lb>man, E 32, came up—we were both on the ground—I did not see anything of the brooch—he was taken in custody—if I had looked for brooch I should have lost him—I am all right now, but I have lost my situation through attending the Court, and have been out a month and four days.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. I was on Snow-hill about one o'clock, on 22nd May—I stopped to look in a window about two minutes—Munro stood by my side—Cullen was three or four yards from her, and said to Munro, "I am going"—at that instant Munro drew her hand from my pocket—I missed my purse, with two half-crowns, three shillings, and a sixpence in it—they went into a public-house—I spoke to a policeman, who took them—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Munro, but no purse.</p>

I was on duty on Snow-hill at a quarter past one o'clock—I took Munro coming out of the public-house—I took her to the station, and went back and took Cullen—she called on several of her companions to split my head with a quart pot—she had a key in her hand—I saw her try to pass it to her husband—I caught her hand—she had a half-crown and some halfpence in it—I tried to get it from her—she threw me down—I had to call another officer to get the money from her.</p>

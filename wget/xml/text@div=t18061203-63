               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I never saw her before I saw her at the magistrate's. I lost these things on the 22nd of November, they were in the back yard; the napkins were in a tub of water, the neck handkerchiefs and stockings were dry, hanging on the washhouse window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house door kept open in the day. - A. Yes mostly; I missed these things between five and six o'clock, I had seen them about an hour before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I know her by seeing her that night, I am positive she is the woman that I saw on the 22nd of November, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030053"></xptr> half after five o'clock, she was in our passage sorting the wet from the dry; I saw her just as I was going into the door of the house, where I live. I said to her halloa mistress what have you got here, she said they were her own things. There were clothes in our yard all day, I called out to the people above and below stairs, they brought a candle, and the woman knew her; one of the woman of our house said, you hussy, where have you brought these things from, you have no child of your own; the prisoner took them up and was going to make her escape, some neighbour pushed her up to the justice's. Going along she said that she was an unfortunate woman, she was in liquor, she said she could not find the yard that she took them out of.</p>

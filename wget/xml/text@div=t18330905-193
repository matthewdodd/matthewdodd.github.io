             (police-constable T 36). I was on duty, and heard the two prisoners and the prosecutor coming up to my beat - the prosecutor asked them to give him his half-crown, or the first policeman he met he would give them into custody - I then went over and took them under a lamp; I found on Davis one half-crown piece, two sixpences, and fourpence-halfpenny in copper, all in the same pocket - I found nothing on the other prisoner; the prosecutor was not quite sober, but he knew perfectly well what he was about; I told him the nature of the charge, and that it was a very dangerous one, if he was not well aware of it - he said he was sure Davis was the person who took the half-crown from his pocket; the prosecutor had been drinking, but was perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>McDine. I was intoxicated, he tore my frock, this is it - I then struck him, and we both fell too fighting.</p>
               <p>Davis. The money found on me, McDine gave me to take care of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fowler, of Silver-street, Golden-square, gave McDine a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to William Freeman, a picture-frame maker, at No. 2, Brown's-place, Waterloo-road. The pri<lb></lb>soner was apprenticed to him also—on Wednesday afternoon, the 16th of June, I was rolling some whitening—the prisoner was going along the shop, with a length of moulding, and very nearly struck me in the eye with it, within one-eighth of an inch—I told him not to be so careless, and to mind his work—he turned round, and said I was always <hi rend="italic">magging</hi> him—I said it was false, it was only for his own good—he turned round, and kept on aggravating me—I said if he did not go on with his work I should pull his ear—he still kept on aggravating me, and I gave him a <hi rend="italic">clout</hi> of the head—he put down the moulding, and took up the hammer to hit me with it—I took it from him, and hit him in the mouth with the hammer in the tussle—he then took up a gouge, and stabbed me in the left arm—he was very angry at the time—a man came up directly, and took the gouge away from him—it cut me—I had no coat on, I was in my shirt-sleeves, and my shirt sleeves were tucked up—it was a deep cut—it bled a good deal—he took it up again, threw it at me, and cut me in the right Arm, and then it hit the other man's foot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a workman in the shop. I was present when the two boys were quarrelling—I saw the prosecutor strike the prisoner with his band—the prisoner then took up the hammer, and the prosecutor took it from him, and in the scuffle it struck him in the mouth—it was not so very hard a blow—I believe it broke his teeth—I saw his tooth broke after<lb></lb>wards —I saw him take up the gouge and stab the prosecutor in the arm—it cut the arm—it was a deep wound—another man took the gouge from him, and put it on a bench—he took it up a second time, and threw it at the prosecutor, and cut him in the other arm, and then it stuck into my foot—he was in a passion.</p>

I was married to him, but he had a wife whom he married before me; my child, which I had by him, had played the truant, and was in the habit of going to him; I went to see for him, and found the child there - the prisoner was there, and his daughter; they were all at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get in - A. A young woman went up, and said to the child,</p>
               <p>"Edward, your mother is come after you;" I immediately went into the room; the young woman went out of the room when I went in - I spoke first, I believe; I asked what business he had to harbour my child from his school; he told me not to come and kick up any riot in his apartment; I said I would not trouble him if he let me and my children alone - he asked if I came to expose him, I said I did; he told me two or three times to go out of his room; I said I would not, till I had an officer to take him up, to bring him to justice - he called me a prostitute; I said,</p>
               <p>"I was none, till he made me one." He turned round to his seat, and stooped, but what he got from there, I cannot say. When he first got up, he had been sitting at the dinner table. I do not know any thing that passed afterwards, but we were on the stairs together, and I felt myself stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he turned round to his seat what did he do - A. He took something from his seat, but I cannot say what; he came towards me, I ran towards the stairs, and do not recollect any thing that passed afterwards, but I felt myself stabbed, and him over me; I do not know whether I fell, or whether he pushed me - my own children was close to me, and so was his daughter; I said I was stabbed, and the children screamed Murder!

            , the landlord's son, came, and rescued me from him, and took a knife from him; I suppose it was him that stabbed me - I was stabbed in my bowels, in two places; I was sent to the hospital. Here are the stays which I wore at the time; there is blood on them, and two holes. When I was on the stairs, I felt myself stabbed, and said I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, there was a pretty loud quarrel between you - A. Yes. I did not strike him, or throw any thing at him; I said I would have him tried for bigamy, and would not go till I had brought him to justice; I stamped and raged a good deal, and refused to leave the room, when he told me - I believe I aggravated him; I was very passionate, and aggravated him as much as I could. I reproached him for having other wives, and told him he wished to bring my two boys up as thieves; he was very passionate as well as I.</p>

            . I am son-in-law of the prisoner's landlord. The prisoner had lodged about four months at the house; I saw the prosecutrix go up stairs, I never saw her before. I was sitting below; there was a disturbance up in the prisoner's room, like people quarrelling, only a general noise - I heard stamping with feet; I could not tell whether it came from one or more persons; then I heard something like a falling down stairs - I ran up, and saw them laying in the landing, at the bottom of the stairs; I thought they was fighting - I tried to part them, and in doing so, I saw the prisoner had a knife in his hand; I seized his arm, and took it from him, and immediately threw it into the one pair back room, and pushed him up stairs, and told him to govern his passion; I did not know that he had stabbed her - he went up and I followed him; he said,</p>
               <p>"What am I to do," I left him, and came down, and heard she was stabbed. I went for an officer, who took him. Nelson appeared in a fright.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took him; I found a knife on his seat, which was very bloody. The man in whose room the knife was thrown, told the Magistrate, in the prisoner's hearing, that he came into his room, and fetched the knife. I took his apron off, which had a great deal of blood on it, but the blood did not come from the prosecutrix, as the daughter said she got before him, and was cut herself.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, stating, that the prosecutrix had refused to live with him; he had done his best to support her and the children; that he and his former wife parted by mutual consent.</p>
               <p>"The boy came to my lodging, and said his mother kept him from school, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090015"></xptr>was ill. She came in and abused me for encouraging him. I thought it a planned thing between them, and told her to leave the room; she threatened me with transportation, and shook her fist at me; her language irritated my blood. I had a knife in my hand, I rose to push her out; my passion got the better of my reason; I have no recollection of inflicting any wounds, and my daughter can testify they were accidental."</p>

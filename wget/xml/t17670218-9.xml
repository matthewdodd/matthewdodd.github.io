I had been lame some time about Christmas, and was obliged to trust her with my key, to go to my drawers for money. On the 16th or 17th of January, when I was able to look a little after my affairs, the prisoner went out; I missed the watch, three stone rings, breast buckle, and some other things; I made known my loss, and people went out to see if they could apprehend her; upon pulling out one of my drawers, I found a bunch of keys; then upon examining further, I missed all the things laid in the indictment; the prisoner had told me for about a week before, she had lost my keys; she was soon found, and brought home; I asked her where my things were; she said they were in the drawers: I asked her what was become of my keys; she said they were left; she was rather sullen, and would say nothing about the things; the watch, three rings, and breast-buckle were found at Mr. Allen's, and the stays, silk handkerchief, and cotton hose were found at Mrs. King's.</p>

               <p>My mistress sent me with the watch on the 15th of January, saying, she had a great deal of money to pay; she keeps two disorderly houses, and wanted to pay her rent; I asked Mr. Allen three guineas upon it; he bid me go back and tell her, it was not worth the money; the next day she sent me with the rings and buckles, and desired me to get two guineas and a half upon them; he was not at home; his wife said she could lend but little or nothing upon them; after that, he lent me a guinea and a half upon them; I was coming home, and saw an old woman; I bought a hat of her for 7 d. she took me to a house; I got a little in liquor: when I came home, my mistress fell a quarrelling, and said I had stole the things. I have lost my character by living in such a disorderly house, and have no friends to speak for me.</p>

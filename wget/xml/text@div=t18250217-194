I was in the shop on the 15th of January, a little before five o'clock in the evening; I heard the window break, I jumped over the counter, and saw the prisoner running to the right of the door, in a direction from the window which was broken - I followed, and cried Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him; the watch was found about three yards from where he was stopped, in a ditch; I picked it up myself - it is gold, and worth 8 l. it was marked 12 l.; the intrinsic value of the case was 7 l.; when I returned I saw where the window was broken, and the watch had hung just in that place; it was between the lights, but light enough to see a man's features.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell - I was standing near Drew's door on the 15th of January, and heard the sound of glass breaking, and at that instant the prisoner came running by me, without shoes! I saw Thompsom come out, and cry Stop thief! there was no one pursued but the prisoner; I followed as fast as I could, and never lost sight of him; we took him into custody; I was the first person who laid hold of him; I saw Thompson produce the watch while I had hold of the prisoner - here are the shoes which he left behind him at the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you the first who took hold of me? A. I was the first person who took hold of him; I believe a gentleman had stopped him before.</p>

            . I live at the Painted Red Lion public-house; I was coming by this shop, and heard the window break; I turned my head and saw a man stand against the window - I thought he was one of the young men of the shop; he went a little way off, and then returned and took something out, but I could not see what it was; by that time Thompson came out of the shop; the man who took the thing from the window ran round the corner like lightning; I did not see his face - I saw the prisoner at Hatton-gardon; I said to a young man who came out of the shop, I think there is a pair of shoes under the window.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Holloway to seek for work, as a stenciller; I had been out of work several weeks; I was coming through Islington from the Coach and Horses public-house, where I lodge with my father, who is a labourer; I came by Mr. Drew's shop, and heard the glass break, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I pulled off my shoes in pursuit of a man who I saw run- when the gentleman came up and gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON re-examined. Q. Was there any person near the prisoner at the time? A. No; no one near him.</p>

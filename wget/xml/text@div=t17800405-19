               <p>When did you discover that the house had been robbed? - I went out at six o'clock; I came home again at eight o'clock; I looked for a ball of worsted; I missed the worsted.</p>
               <p>When you went out was there any body in the house? - Some people up in the shop; they are tailors. The things were all safe at eight when I came home. I went out again then, and came home at ten. There were some people up in the shop when I went out the second time, and when I came home at ten I found the door of our room fastened on the inside. I went to the publick-house and fetched my husband and he broke open the door to get into our room. There was a mark in the window and upon a chair, upon which they had stepped.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for thinking they came in at the one-pair-of-stairs window? - Because I found the window open. They stepped into the chair which stood under the window. There was the mark of a foot on it. I found the chair when I came home in the middle of the room.</p>
               <p>Was the mark plain enough to distinguish whether it was a man's foot or a woman's or boy's? - There was just the mark of the sole without any heel, but I cannot take upon me to say whether it was a man's or woman's foot.</p>
               <p>It was a sash-window I suppose? - It was.</p>

She was knitting a stocking at a neighbour's house; she unlocked her door, but it would not open. She came down and asked if her husband was come home. I said I had just come home, but I did not hear him. I found the door was bolted on the inside. Mrs. Plampin sent for her husband; he came and burst open the door. I went in with Mr. Plampin; I saw immediately there had been a robbery done, for there was the mark of a grown person's foot upon the chair.</p>

               <p>I went with Morant to search Bagnall's lodgings again. I found this gown in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the bedroom, on the ground floor. I have the agreement for the house, which I found among Bagnall's papers which were in his drawers which will shew that it was Bagnall's house.</p>
               <p>Do you know yourself any thing of his being taken up out of that house? - I was not there, but his wife went along with me the second time to shew me the house.</p>
               <p>How came his wife to go with you? - Because we wanted to search the house again, supposing the people that searched at first had not searched properly.</p>
               <p>Where did you go from to search it? - From Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said nothing. She went readily.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did you find him? - Just by Chancery-lane, it is White's-alley; to the best of my recollection, but I am not positive, I think it was No. 5.</p>
               <p>Did you go back with them to search the second time? - No, when we received our information, several of us went, some went to the back door, as we had a description of the house. Jealous went in at the fore-door. I went in directly. Jealous took hold of Bagnall and the woman who passes for his wife.</p>
               <p>In what part of the house did you take him? - In the bed-room on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there were any lodgers in the house? - A woman came down; they wanted her to take care of the things while we went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in White's-alley was it, which end of the alley? - We went up a narrow passage and then turned upon the right; it is in a little nook as it were; it is the last house, I think, upon the left hand.</p>

               <p>To Labour. Is that the house you went to? - It is.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect selling that linen to that man? - No. I know we had such a pattern in December, and it was sold on that day as we enter it in our books.</p>
               <p>What was the quantity? - A piece; it is made up in pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. I observe what you have sold is called here a piece of chintz? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear that you sold a piece of chintz of that pattern that day? - By the price of it, this was the piece of chintz.</p>
               <p>Had you no others of that price which you sold that day? - No, it is a very low price for a piece for a gown.</p>
               <p>All you know is you had the pattern at that time, and from the price that this is charged at you judged it was a piece of this pattern? - Yes, and because we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050034"></xptr>entered it in our books, a piece of chintz twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>That figure looks to be a 9? - It is meant for 1 l. 7 s.</p>
               <p>That entry leaves us where we were as to the subject of its being of this pattern? - We never had but two patterns in the house at that price, and I know at the time we had two or three left of this pattern we had none of the other to my recollection.</p>

I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) on the 29th of December between the hours of ten and twelve. I was up and down stairs till after ten at night; the things were all safe then. I had the key of the dining-room in my pocket. I went to bed about twelve o'clock. When I went to open the dining-room door, there was a chair against it; I could not get in till I pushed it away. I went in and found the sash open, the shutter having been fresh painted there was the mark of a hand on it; and there were the marks of feet in the bed-room. There was a pair of blankets found by the dining-room window.</p>

I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) on the 3d of February, between the hours of nine and ten, out of the dining-room. The windows were shut down in the dusk of the evening. About ten o'clock I went to go into the dining-room; the door was locked, I could not get in. We got a watchman and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050035"></xptr>a man got a ladder and got in at the window, and opened the door and let me in. The dining-room window was open. The drawers were all pulled out, and the papers and things thrown about. The things mentioned in the indictment were taken away. The bed in the bed-room was stripped; they went through the dining-room into the bedroom. There was nothing lost out of the dining-room. There were two shifts and a pocket handkerchief found in the prisoner's room. Between nine and ten o'clock I remember to have heard a whistling every time a carriage went by, which was the time I suppose it was done.</p>

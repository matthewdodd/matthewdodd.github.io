                  </hi>. I manage the business of the Queen's Hotel, in St. Martin's le Grand. It is kept by Mr. Edward Sherman—I know the prisoner; he had been staying at the hotel for three weeks, in the name of Captain C. Laurie—he discharged more than one bill while he was there—the first bill was in cash, and the second also—about two days after he had paid the second bill, he came to me, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and two days afterwards he borrowed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me two large cheques as securities, on the Diss Bank—on 15th March he asked me for the two cheques back, to pay me the money which I had lent him, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he went out about 12 o'clock, and did not return till late at night—on 17th March I gave him his bill again, which was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I asked him for my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had lent him, and he gave me this cheque—(Read: "Oaks, Fincham, Bevan, Moore, and Simpson, bankers, Diss, Norfolk. Pay Mr. Sher<lb></lb>man or bearer 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Captain C. Laurie.

               <p>paid the cheque into the banker's for my master—the prisoner said he should remain there till Thursday, and that would give me time to see that the cheque was all right—he continued till Friday morning, the 20th—he was then indebted to me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said he was going to leave early, and asked me to let him have his bill; I did, and he wrote a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the smoking room—he said, "I never draw a bill for less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., give me the change"—I took it, and looked at it—I went back to him, and said I could not give him change, as I had no news of the first cheque, but I should have the news in an hour and a half—the cheque and the bill were in my hand, and he took them out—this was about half past 8 o'clock—he then stated that he was going to leave at 2 o'clock—he remained in the hotel a quarter of an hour afterwards; in consequence of that his luggage was taken back, and he went up stairs, where his things were—I saw him about a quarter of an hour afterwards, smoking his cigar; the last time I saw him he was on the step of the street door, and he walked quickly away—I did not see him again—I saw him write the second cheque in the smoking room, on the table—this is it.</p>

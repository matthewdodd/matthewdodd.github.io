                  </hi>. I am agent for the Mint authorities—on 18th November I went to King Street, Seven Dials, with Curley, Hines, and seven or eight other officers—Hines and Miller were in a house in King Street—about 9 o'clock I went with Curley to a passage in King Street, and found the prisoner in Hines' custody—the prisoner was pushed into the parlour of a house by Curley and Hines, and I said, "Well, Mr. Keefe, you are suspected of passing counterfeit coin"—he made no reply, but held his hand with his fingers on the cuff of his coat—I saw Curley seize his hand, and from it dropped this paper packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing ten florins, and this other packet containing ten counterfeit shillings, with paper lapped between them—I saw that his hand was closed, and called Curley's attention to it, he opened it, and it contained four half-crowns with paper lapped between them—Curley searched him, and found some good silver in his waistcoat pocket, among which was the florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he handed to me—I said, "This is also counterfeit"—the prisoner said, "If the other is counterfeit this is not"—he was taken to the station, and when the charge was read over he said, "Well, if it is bad, you cannot prove I was going to tender it."</p>

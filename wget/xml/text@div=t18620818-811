I belong to Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Supply,</hi> which was lying at Woolwich—on 25th July, I went to Westminster, and went into a public-house near the Horse Guards—I was sober—the prisoners were there, and Williams asked me if I would have a drop of ale—he was drinking out of a pot, and I supped out of it—Turner was with him—they asked me to take a walk; I said, "Yes," and went with them—I stood some run, and took, I think, a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my right-hand pocket, the only pocket a sailor has—I took a glass of the rum—we came out together, and Williams asked me if I would go homo with him to his house—I did so—there was only one chair there, with three legs to it, no curtains, a blind, and a broken-down bed—Williams said, "Well, my wife is out; I cannot get you any tea; will you have a drop of beer?"—I said, "Yes," and gave him some money, and he sent Turner down for some beer—Turner came back with it—I drank some, and Williams said, "Well, you look very dozy; will you have a nap?"—I said "Yes," and laid down in the bed and fell off to sleep—I I afterwards awoke in a great fright, and found Williams kneeling on my chest, and Turner at my pocket with his hands—I asked him what he meant and he said, "I mean to rob you"—I felt his hand on my pocket, and he got my money out—I tried to prevent him, and he made motions to the other man—I had a gold ring on my finger, and I am very sorry that I have not got it on to-day—I tried to prevent their taking it, and Turner used a very bad expression, and said, "If you do not let me have it I will choke you"—I had a watch and a chain round my neck—they broke the</p>

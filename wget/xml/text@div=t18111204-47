               <p>Q. Do you know how your house was upon the 9th of November, whether it was fast or not - A. I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first missed the coat - A. When the prisoner was brought in with it about eight o'clock. I only know the coat is mine, it is worth ten shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. No, not that I saw. I went in the shop and saw a great coat lay upon a mat near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you at the shop door - A. Yes, at the time I was scraping my shoes at the door the prisoner came out; seeing the coat on the mat, and the prisoner coming out I had suspicion. I then went backwards into the workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the door close - A. With a hasp. I shut the door and went into the back workshop: going along I looked back several times expecting him to come back. I saw him come back and take the coat; I immediately told the porter, he pursued him, and I followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. Yes, but I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the London and Suburban Bank, 206, Fulham Road West—this account of Arthur Taylor, in this book, is in my writing—he deposited 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in February—on 18th February a bill was deposited, but no other assets were paid in—I also find, on the same day, a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and on 6th February he drew a cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that left him indebted 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 31st March the balance due to the bank by him was 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—several cheques of his, pre<lb></lb>sented before 1st April, were refused by the bank to be honoured—I have a book in which I enter an account of all cheques not honoured by the bank—besides those cheques which were honoured, six cheques were pre<lb></lb>sented before the 31st March which were not honoured because there were no assets; we put on them, "Refer to drawer," or "Not sufficient," as the case may be.</p>

                  </hi>. At the time the prisoner was summoned I called at the London and Suburban Bank, saw Mr. Burrows, and gave him this paper—he read it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "About 8th January, 1869, I handed one Jacobs</p>

               <p>A. bill to discount for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He got the London and Suburban Bank to dis<lb></lb>count it, and did not hand me the money. From this I was ordered by the manager to open an account, and I paid in a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a cheque for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 759<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not ask the manager to let me draw against the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, but it was agreed that I was to draw three-fourths on account of the 279<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was then agreed that I should attach the balance lying in the bank in the name of Jacobe—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The manager promised me he would not part with it but to me. I paid in two bills about six weeks since, one for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Gray's bill, was dishonoured a few days before Potter's 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. become due. Potter went to the bank and offered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in payment, or he should stop payment; this prevented the manager paying the cheque, under the advice of the directors, I believe. This is every word correct, so help me God.</p>

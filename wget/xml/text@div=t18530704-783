                  </hi>. My husband is a corn dealer, and lives in Leather-lane. On 14th June the prisoner came, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I served him with half a quartern of flour—he gave me a half Crown—I gave him a shilling and two sixpences—they were all good—I am sure of that—he shook the change in his hand for two or three minutes, and then he said he would not take the flour; he would send his mistress for it—he required the half crown back—I told him I was quite sure he did not want the flour when he came into the shop—he put down the change which I gave him, but I found the shilling which he put down was not the one which I had given him—the shilling I gave him was a Victoria shilling, a new one—the one he put down was an old one, and much worn—I told him it was not the same shilling immediately—he declared that it was—(he had been in the shop before on a similar errand)—I took the shilling which he gave me, marked it, and gave it to the policeman—I went up stairs, and called my servant to fetch her master from the yard—the prisoner wished to leave the shop; in fact he did leave it for a moment, but our man prevented him—when I came down he was asking our man to let him go, and the man would not—the prisoner declared that I had given him the bad shilling—I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge, with the shilling, to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Sweet. On 14th June my mistress called me, and said the prisoner had come in; he asked for half a quartern of flour, and said it was too dear—she said, "I suppose you want me to give, you your half crown back;" and she went to take the change up, and said, "This is not the shilling I gave you"—he declared it was—my mistress told me to call my master; and as I was going she said, "No, I will call the servant"—when she was gone, the prisoner took up the flour and the change, and was going out of the shop—I went behind him, and told him wherever he went I would follow him—he stood a minute, and came back, and I said to him, "It shows you are guilty; why did you want to take the flour and change, and go out of the shop?"—he said, "I will go now if you will let me"—my master then came, and I was sent for a policeman.</p>

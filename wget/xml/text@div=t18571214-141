               <p>expressed an opinion to that effect, but there, although the learned Judge enter<lb></lb>tained some doubt as to the necessity of the proof, he received it, and left it to the Jury. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">referred to Rex v.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CROWDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the evidence was hardly of a nature to be presented to the Jury; the case of Rex v.

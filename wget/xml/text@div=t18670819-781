                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. James Edgcombe, who lives at Wood Lane, Shepherd's Bush—on Sunday, 11th August, I went to bed about half-past ten—I saw that the house was secured—all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>. were safe then—I got up about twenty minutes past five on the Monday morning—I found the window open and the table cover gone, also my master's coat and a lindsey dress.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's house on Wednesday, 14th August, and found an entry had been effected by shifting the catch of the dining-room window by means of a knife—be<lb></lb>tween two and three on Monday morning, the 12th August, I was on duty in Cromwell Road, South Kensington—I saw the prisoner, with two or three other men, on the opposite side of the road—the prisoner was carry<lb></lb>ing a bundle—I asked him, "What have you got there? "—he said, "Nothing belonging to you "—I said, "Let me see what you have got"—he threw the bundle on the ground and I opened it, and found the articles</p>

               <p>produced—I asked him where he brought them from—he said from his mother's, at Hammersmith—I then asked him where he was taking them to, and he said to his wife, at 6, Pond Terrace, Marlborough Road—when I spoke to the prisoner his companions left—one of them said, "Go with him, Tom, to the Marlborough Road, and see if it is not right"—I said to the prisoner, "I doubt your statement, and I shall take you into custody for the unlawful possession of this property"—he said, "All right, old fellow, I will go with you "—I made him carry the bundle, and he walked quietly for about twenty yards; he then threw the bundle on the ground and said, "Will you let me go? "—I said, "No; I have already told you you are in custody, and you must go to the station"—he said, "If you don't let me go I will kill you," and he drew from the left sleeve of his coat this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.—I tried to get it away from him, but he struck me with it above the left ear, and knocked me down—I got up, pursued him, and caught him—I struck him on the chest—he fell, and we had a struggle on the ground for about ten minutes—he got away, and ran down Thurlow Hews, and got on to a hoarding—I pulled him down and struck him with my truncheon—we were on the ground, and he said, "If you will let me get up I will go quietly"—I let him get up, and he drew this knife (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>. and said, "If you don't let me go I will rip your b—guts out"—we had another struggle on the ground—he tried to get my truncheon away—another constable came to my assistance, and the prisoner was taken to the station—I am suffering now from the injuries.</p>

The prisoner came into the shop last Tuesday night, and asked if I would make him a good wig for a guinea? he said, he had a good deal of money to take for service on board a ship: I left him in the shop, and the razors on the table; they are my master's razors: when I was returning back, I saw the prisoner in the possession of my master and the constable.</p>
               <p>Charles -. I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I was in the shop at the time the last witness went out to dinner; then I shaved the prisoner, and he took the razors, and went out, without paying for shaving; then I went and told my master; we followed him, and took him: I saw him throw the razors down.</p>

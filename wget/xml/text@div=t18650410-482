I am storeholder in the Royal Arsenal—I have charge of the condemned stores; I have the superintending of the sales of all of then—I have seen the leather produced here to-day; this large piece is seat-leather, to cover cloaks, and for other purposes—leather of this kind is never sold; it is new serviceable leather, unconverted—this hide is Govern<lb></lb>ment leather blacked; that is also new, serviceable leather—this is some more of the same not coloured—I have seen it all—I find the broad arrow on some of it, and the War Department mark.</p>

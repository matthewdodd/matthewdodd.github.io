                  </hi> (City Policeman 921). About five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 8th September, I was on duty in Bishopsgate Street Within—I met the prisoner coming from towards Bishopsgate Street Without, close to Wormwood Street—he was carrying this box underneath his arm—it was wrapped up in some brown paper, and also covered over with one of these napkins—I followed him till he got the other side of Thread-needle Street—he then went into a gateway in Bishopsgate Street Within—I followed him there—he then spoke to me, and said, "It is a very wet afternoon, sir"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I then told him I was a police officer, and asked what he had got underneath his arm—he hesitated for a couple of minutes, and then said, "Oh! it is a thing"—I asked what it was—he did not tell me—he was uncovering it at the same time—I said, "Is that silver?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he got it from—he said, ""From home"—I said, "Where are you taking it to?"—he said "Home"—I then asked whether he had had it given to him—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you made it then?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Have you bought it?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he bought it—he said, "I refuse to tell you"—I then said, I shall take you to the police-station"—he said, "Oh! I knew that"—he also said, "I know where you are going to take me to"—I took him to the station—he then said he had had it left to him by his great grandfather—I searched him, and in his coat pocket behind I found this cruet-stand, mustard-pot, and castor, also this bouquet-holder, three spoons, a pair of scissors, and two napkins marked "Marshman, 12, 65, " also a pocket-book containing this duplicate for a tablecloth—he refused to give his address or any account of himself, and I have not been able to find where he comes from—from inquiries I made, I found the property belonged to Mr. Marshman.</p>

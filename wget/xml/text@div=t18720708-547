                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Gutteridge, of 7, Brunswick Street, Deptford—up to Monday, 21st May, the prisoner Jones and her husband lived in our house, and on Whit-Monday, 20th May, I gave them notice to leave through their bad behaviour—they went out on Whit—Monday and returned between 12 and 1 at night, and when I gave her a written notice, she threatened my life—we were in bed when they came home, but they got in at the window, and I called my husband to go for a policeman as they were swearing—on the next afternoon, 21st May, my husband and I were at home between 2 and 3 o'clock, and the two Jones' and Clark came knocking at the door—Strickland was with them; there were four persons in all—my husband went out the back way, and I told him to go for a policeman, and I went up stairs and looked at the bedroom window; the four persons were then outside the house—they said "Come down you old b—and let us in"—I did not let them in, but Mr. Jones got in at the window—they all four came into the house—I went down into the passage, and Strickland said "Do you mean to turn my sister out of this house?" she called Jones to assist her—I said that my husband would make them go, and Strickland struck me in the face, and Clark said "Give it to her <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>"—the woman Jones then caught hold of my hand and pulled me, and then they all kicked me; I was kicked I should say twenty times—Clark said "Finish her before you have done"—they left, but Strickland and the woman Jones returned—I put up my hand, and Jones said "Ain't you dead, you old b—?" and she jumped on me, and left me in a gore of blood.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Evelyn Street, Deptford—on Wednesday, 22nd May, I was called to 27, Brunswick Street, and saw the prosecutrix—my father had seen her on the Tuesday, and dressed her wounds—he is the divisional surgeon—she was Buffering from a severe wound over her left eye, and a wound behind her right ear—she could not move her left arm, it was so severely bruised, and she complained of great pain in the chest and abdomen, and she had bruises on her legs—her head was very much contused, and I understood she had vomited blood, but I did not see it—I saw blood which she passed from her vagina and bowels, from internal injuries—there was no wound on her mouth—I considered her in a dangerous state—she is in a very weak state still, and it is doubtful whether she ever recovers—blows or kicks would cause the injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> Did she tell you that she had been to some other doctor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she did not say that the doctor told her husband had ill-treated her, and that she was obliged to wear an instrument—she did not say that she was pregnant; I think she is past that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>: "I don't want to say anything. She threatened me with the poker. It is through jealousy."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones produced a written defence, stating that the prosecutrix had ill-treated her on the Saturday and Sunday before, and said that she would make her fight her; that the prosecutrix struck the first blow with a poker, and that she (Jones) struck her in return, but never kicked her.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BROWNING</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any complaint made to the prisoners of any injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but when I went next morning I found a doctor had been called to dress the wound of Jones's husband—no complaint was made by Mrs. Jones of any injury to her by a poker, but summonses were taken out—the prisoners were all three the worse for drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clark's Defence.</hi> I was not at home when Mrs. Jones came. She came to the public-house where I was, and Jones also; he was in a dreadful state of blood, and told me he had summoned his landlord and landlady to the Police Court, and would I walk down with him. We went into a public-house,</p>

               <p>and Mrs. Jones asked me to let Mrs. Strickland <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> with her till the Court was over. I went to work, and when I came back the Court was closed. I went with them, but as to doing any injury, or hitting or kicking, I did not.</p>

I told them to keep their distance, and I passed on as far as the pastry-cook's in St. Paul's Church-yard, when they both came up again; by the light of the window I saw them distinctly. I made stop when I saw them; they said nothing to me then, but passed on, and when I got on Ludgate-hill, I was turning up Sun Tavern-court; I mostly go up there, and take half a pint of porter; there was a loose woman (as I supposed her to be) at the corner; she pushed me on the back, and said, aye, wicked, and left me directly. Then the prisoner at the bar, and another young man with him, seized me; the other man seized me by the arm, and the prisoner at the bar made an attempt to take my watch; when I found that he had snatched, as I supposed, my watch, I pursued him, and about twenty yards down the Old-Bailey I seized him by the flap of his coat; when I seized him, he said, pray let me go; and he dropped my ribbon and my seal, and said, here is your watch; the watchman took him in charge to the watch-house; I was asked if I had lost my watch; a gentleman who saw the circumstance said, it was only my ribbon; I being in a perspiration the watch was left in the fob, he had snatched the string and the pendant from the case, by the violence of the pull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to strike you? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it? - A. I did not; I heard him say, here is your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100046"></xptr>have seen him and the other young man parading Cheapside.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday last I was coming up Ludgate-hill, hearing the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner at the bar running, and Mr. Gold coming down very swift after him, they turned up the Old-Bailey, and just as I came up to them Mr. Gold had seized him by the coat flap; upon which the prisoner said, here is your watch, here is your watch; I thought he had dropped something; it was dark, and the watchman came up with a light, I looked where he had been standing, and found the ribbon, key, and seal. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am entirely innocent of the affair: can it be possible that I should say, sir, here is your watch, when he had it in his pocket when he came to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

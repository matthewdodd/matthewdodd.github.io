On the 28th of October I went with two other officers to the Red Cow public-house, Shoreditch—I concealed myself at the back of the premises in a skittle-ground—in about half an hour I saw the prisoner come to a certain place, and put his hand down to a corner of the wooden fence—I heard the sound of money rattle—he went away, and returned to the public-house—after he was gone I went to the place where he put his hand, and found a bag with 14 half-crowns and 22 shillings, all counterfeit—I took out three half-crowns and three shillings, and gave them to Burcham to mark—I then put the bag in the place I took it from—I then sent one officer to the front of the house, and the other to the back—I staid in the skittle-ground, and in about an hour the prisoner came into the skittle-ground again, and went to the same place where the bag was—I heard the sound of money, and as he was returning I followed, and stopped him—he wanted to know what was the matter—I said, "Nothing particular," but I wished to be satisfied before he left the ground—I sprung my rattle, and Burnham came—I searched the prisoner, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, as bad sixpence, one shilling, and a halfpenny in copper—I went back to were I had left the bag—I could not find it—I then turned on my light, and found the earth was removed, and the bag was covered with mould—no other person had been to that corner between the time I was there and the prisoner going there—I showed the bag to the prisoner—he said he did not know any thing about it—there was an attempt to rescue him, but we got him away—there was no deficiency in the bag—it had been removed about two feet, and covered with mould—I cannot swear that when he first arrived there was no bag there—it was sufficiently light for me to see the man that came first—there—was a light in the passage—I was at the end of the ground, and I could see his person quite distinctly.</p>

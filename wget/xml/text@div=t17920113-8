I told him he was the first person I saw run; I took him by the collar, and Mr. Davis came up and said he was the man; the watch was picked up in the street; he was taken to the public-house, and a constable sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You know that part of the street where the prosecutor says this happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Between that place where he described this to have happened, and the place where you met the prisoner, how many streets were there that branched out from the street you was in? - Cambridge-street and Poland-street.</p>

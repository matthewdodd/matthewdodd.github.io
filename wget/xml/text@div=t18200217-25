            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service. The prisoner was employed there with some painters - he had to sit on the board to keep it steady. I was set to watch them, and heard a piece of cloth tear - I looked between some bales, and saw the prisoner put a piece of calico into his hat. I told Mr. Alleway, who came up, and told the prisoner he had got something about him which he should not have. The prisoner pulled off his hat, took a piece of calico out, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is what you want." Mr. Alleway took another piece out of his side-pocket, and took him down stairs.</p>

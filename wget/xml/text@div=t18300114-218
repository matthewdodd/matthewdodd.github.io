               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Smith here? A. I have not seen him since; I was sober; I was not drunk - I did not strike the landlord at the watch-house; there was not a blow struck - I might push the watchman; the inspector of the night took the chain - I supposed the chain found on Allen to be mine when it was taken out of his pocket, it being a steel chain; I said it was mine, and that I would swear to it - I cannot say the constable changed it; I did not lay, any wagers that night - I threw down two sovereigns by mistake, and then put them into my purse; that was before I went into the tap-room - I had three glasses of warm wine, and one of noyean; no rum - I had another glass of noyean in the tap-room; I had only two glasses before I went there - I had four in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after the light was extinguished that you saw the prisoner do this? A. There was a glimmering light from the fire; no man could get to me so quick as they did after the light was put out - Relf's hand was in my pocket directly; I said to Allen, "You villain, I have transported one man, and will transport you, if it costs 60l.;" a chain and a piece of one was found on him- all the persons in the tap-room fled like a swarm of bees on my crying Murder! I was sober at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you not at that house six half-pint glasses of hot wine? A. I had not; they were small glasses, and are 2d. each; I had five glasses of noyean during the day - I said I only had four at the King and Queen; I think there are two boxes in the tap-room - the right-hand side is open, with a table in the middle; the other persons were sitting round on the other side - I did not perceive any body in the next box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear there was sufficient fire-light to enable you to discern the person of any one? A. Yes, if I was looking at them - but it was done so instantly; Allen was in the box when the landlord came, hustling with me; he got my handkerchief from me after the landlord came in.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. Q. Are you quite sure the chain taken from Allen was part of your's? A. I thought so then, and said I could swear to it; Relf sat outside me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Neither of the prisoners put out the light? A. I do not believe they did; I did not see the cock turned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason for swearing to the prisoners than their being nearest to you, and thinking nobody else could have got to you in so short a time? A. That is my reason; Relf never left my side - Allen's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140100"></xptr>hand was examined before the Magistrate, and a piece was bit right out of his finger - Weeks found the chain on him - I did not see the end of it; I said there were three keys to mine - the constable of the night said there were only two; I said one might have been taken off in the scuffle - I said before the Magistrate that I bit Allen's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect whether you did not say one of the prisoners endeavoured to stop your mouth with a cloth, and you bit through the cloth and the person's hand? A. I did say that; I had produced a sovereign at the bar -Smith and his two friends, as he called them, were at the bar; Relf was one - I do not know the other.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN RENEW. I am a watchman. About half-past eleven o'clock I was two doors from the King and Queen, and heard a call of Watch! and Murder! - I called Williams over, and we both went in; I put my back against the door, and saw the prosecutor with his breeches down and his hat off - he said he was robbed, and gave Allen in charge - he staid at the bar.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am a watchman. I went into the house and saw the prosecutor - he said he was robbed; Allen stood against the bar - Renew sent me for the inspector, and he asked Fairburn if he could point out any body; he pointed out Allen - he was capable of answering me - he at first said he had two sovereigns, but at the watch-house he said two and a half; he said he had lost his watch, but on pulling his breeches up he found that - he was a little in liquor, but gave the name of the watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he drunk or sober? A. I cannot say he was particularly drunk - he appeared a little intoxicated and flurried; I saw him push my partner from the door - I do not know why.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I was called in - the prosecutor was in front of the bar, with his clothes in a disordered state; I saw his watch handed over to the landlord - the prosecutor and Allen were having an altercation; Allen was saying, "Did I rob you?" or, "Was it I robbed you?" I then said,"Did this man rob you?" he said, "If he did not, he knows who did;" he was throwing his arms about and stamping - I cannot say he was sober; I searched Allen, and found on him two pieces of chain, and he handed over another piece - the two I found proved to be a whole chain, and had one brass key attached to it; I found a sixpence and a few halfpence on him - as I took the chain from him, the prosecutor said it was his, but on the Monday morning he disowned it, and it was restored to Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You have heard him say to-day it was not the same chain? A. It was the same as I found on the prisoner - I thought the prosecutor confused, and a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NICHOLS. I am constable of the night. Allen was brought to the watch-house - part of a chain was found on him, which the prosecutor claimed, and afterwards said it was not his; I considered him very much in liquor - he stated what he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He seemed very much intoxicated? A. Yes; he at first said he had lost two sovereigns - then said two sovereigns and a half, and a black leather purse.</p>
               <p>HENRIETTA PARRINGTON. My father keeps the King and Queen; the prosecutor was not sober when he came in - when he came out of the tap-room he complained of losing his purse and chain; Allen said, "If you suspect me take me to the watch-house and search me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him strike your father? A. Yes; he also struck the watchman - when he first came into the house he stood at the bar, put a sovereign on the counter, and wanted to bet about a patent for blowing the gas out; no wager was laid - he appeared to have drank a great deal before he came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did he charge any body besides Allen with robbing him? A. Yes, the watchman that he struck, and he also charged my father with it - I am sure my father had no candle when he came into the tap-room.</p>

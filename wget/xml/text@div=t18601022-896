                  </hi>. I am Captain of the 6th troop of the Military Train—on 9th September, that troop was at Woolwich—the prisoner was Troop Sergeant-major—I gave him two five-pound notes about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he came to me for money to pay his troop—I gave him one five-pound note, and another five-pound note to pay some bills on my account—I told him to bring the bills to me immediately afterwards—I waited in the mess-room where he was to have brought them to me—he did not return, and I had to pay the troop myself—I remained several days without seeing the prisoner—he did not make his appearance on the 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th—I did not see him again till the 17th; he was then in custody, in plain clothes—I had given information—he did not say anything to me about the two five-pound notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kectory-grove, Woolwich, with my father, and work in the arsenal On Sunday morning, 27th Jan., I was in Melton's coffee house, Nelson-street, Woolwich (I had been out on that evening; and was too late to get in at my father's house)—about 1 o'clock Alfred Bailey came in and sat down, arid went to sleep, but I did not go to sleep—about half past 3 o'clock the prisoner came in, sat down by Bailey's side, and took out of his pocket, first a handkerchief, and then two penny pieces—he than went away for two or three minutes and came back, without going out of the shop—he sat down again, and felt in Bailey's next pocket, took some<lb></lb>thing, and went out—Bailey awoke in about ten minutes, and I told him of it, and went with him to another coffee house in Hogg-lane—we found the prisoner there, and Bailey gave him into custody.</p>

About a fortnight before the robbery, I was at the house and saw the water-pipe secure and fixed to the building; it came through the house into the yard. Mr. Harlow had the key. I saw the house when the prisoner was taken, on the 15th of February, and found the waterpipe completely twisted off, and laid on the ground in the yard. It was worth 3s. We secured the lock and heard the prisoner enter the house, and bolt the door after him; we went and found him in the parlour.</p>

            . I am an headborough. About one o'clock in the morning, of the 5th of February, I found the padlock of the outer-door loose. We went into the house and found the leaden cistern taken - We went to the house about six o'clock in the morning, with Byrne and Hall; we found nobody there. We went into the front room, and in about a quarter of an hour, I heard the door open, and footsteps come in; the door was shut. We went into the back room which leads into the yard, and found the prisoner there. We found a crow-bar in the yard. The padlock of the door appeared to have been forced by the crow-bar. We watched the house from ten o'clock till six.</p>
               <p>FLINT re-examined. I was with them. The pipe was taken away, it was safe the last time I was there. The crow-bar was there. I compared the crow-bar with the marks in the sink of the cistern-it fitted. When we went out, we left the padlock on the door, as if it was shut; nobody could tell that it was open. The sink was worth fifteen shillings.</p>

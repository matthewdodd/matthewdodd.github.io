               <p>Q. What time of the night was it. - A. It might be about half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these three men follow your waggon in a manner to call your particular attention. - A. I took notice of them when I turned the corner of Newgate street into Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice them all the way fro them entrance of Cheapside to the corner in Wood street. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you turned down Wood street, did you observe these men go a different way, or did they follow your waggon. - A. Two of these men went of the off side of the waggon, and one came on the near side.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170023"></xptr>Q. Did you turn you horses' heads into the gateway of the Castle inn. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses had you. - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned the heads of your horses into the gateway did you go in with them. - A. I went in with them, and then came back to look behind the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the tail of the waggon what did you find. - A. I found a box laying on the street, and the prisoner was standing about a yard from it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he standing in the highway. - A. He was standing on the carriage way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where were the other men standing. - A. I did not see anything of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing this box in the street, and the man standing so near, what did gou do. - A. At first he says to me waggoner you have lost a box, I said to him I suppose you had a mind to take it, I have taken notice of you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that. - A. He said nothing, but a man who was by, said stick to him, for I saw him pull it off; I laid hold of him then, as soon as I laid hold of him another man came and struck at me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you laid hold of this man did he give himself up quietly. - A. No, he struggled to get away, I got him down at the corner of Maiden lane, he struggled a minute or so, no long time; I never parted with him till he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether that box came out of your waggon. - A. Yes, that box had been loaded on the waggon at Paddington, it had been put on the top of the goods in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded high behind. - A. It was loaded a little higher than the rail of the waggon, there was a rope over across it, it was bound on at Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so secure that it could not come out without violence. - A. It was put on secure, so that we could rely on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rope cut. - A. I do not know, I did not see the waggon afterwards till it was unloaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was taken out, and while it was in the tail of the waggon, would it appear as large as it is. - A. No, it would appear only a foot square.</p>
               <p>Q. It is about four foot long, there was only the end visible, it would appear a smaller box. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had told the prisoner that you had noticed him, can you say whether he was or not in your judgment one of the three men that dodged the waggon. - A. I have no doubt but that he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken the prisoner to the watchhouse do you know whether he appeared to be lame at all. - A. I did not see him walk lame, but when we took him to the watchhouse he appeared to walk lame.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was upon my examination the witness said there were only two men in company, me and a stout man.</p>
               <p>Witness. There were three when I saw you first turning the corner of Wood street, but when I took you I saw no one but you and the man that struck me.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a porter at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 22nd of August did you happen to be in Wood street, near to this man's waggon. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any persons walking by the tail of the waggon. - A. Yes, I observed two men, I cannot say whether there were more or not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the horses were turning down the gateway of the Castle inn, did you observe any body do any thing at the tail of the waggon. - A. The prisoner at the bar and another person came to the tail of the waggon, I saw the prisoner at the bar, he was on the side nearest to me, I was at the off side of the waggon, I saw the prisoner make a plunge at the tail of the waggon; the box came to the ground that was placed at the tail of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box. - A. Yes, this is the box; when the box came to the ground the waggoner came immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the prisoner made a stroke, or a plunge as you call it, at the tail of the waggon. A. Yes, and the box immediately followed it; the box came out on the left hand side, and then the prisoner was between the box and the other man, there was another person stood on the left side of the prisoner, but whether he assisted or no I cannot say, I was of the right side of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the street wide or narrow there. - A. It is just the width that two carriages could pass, I was across the street when the waggoner came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay hold of the prisoner. - A.There was a scuffle, I called to him to stick to him, I believed that was the man that took the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see any body strike the waggoner. - A. I did not, as soon as I saw him and the waggoner begin to scuffle, every thing disappeared, I saw nothing of the second man, he disappeared at that present time, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the second man come back again. - A. When I came to the assistance of the waggoner there was a man in Maiden lane, I called, Watch, stop him; he ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner walking some way before he made a plunge at the waggon. - A. I saw two men, there might be three, walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these men walk lame. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was conveyed to the watch-house did you see him appear to be lame. - Q. When he was taken out of the yard I could not see that he was lame, but when he was taken out of the yard he appeared to be lame, and he said he would have a coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Wood street, going home to my sister to bed, I saw the waggon going along Wood street, I ran across the street, and the box fell as I was going across, I saw the waggoner, I said I fancy this box belongs to you, he said I had a mind to take it, I said I had no such intention.</p>

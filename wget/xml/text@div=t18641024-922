                  </hi>. On Thursday, 13th October, I went to Uxbridge with my master's cart—it was in the evening, about dusk; I don't know exactly what time—I went to Mrs. Holloway's beer-shop—when I went there I had a silver case watch, and a chain—the chain was brass dipped in silver, I believe—I also had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money in my breeches pocket—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket, attached to the chain—while I was sitting there the three prisoners came in together, close one after the other—I did not know them—two of them, Ward and Hay, came and sat down, by the side of me, and Collier sat at the other side of the room—I laid my head down on the table and went off to sleep—when I awoke I found myself outside the front door of the beer-shop—they dragged me up the yard—I did not see any one standing near me—Ward dragged me up the yard—he was alongside of me when I woke—I remained in the yard till the policeman came up to me—he said something to me, and I looked in my pockets—I found nothing at all—my watch, chain, and money were gone—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the one I had with me when I went into the beer-shop.</p>

My husband's name is Uriah Holloway, and he keeps the "Royal Oak" beer-shop in Uxbridge—on 15th October I saw the prosecutor in our tap—I did not see him or the prisoners come in—when I entered the room the prosecutor was sitting with his arm on the table and his head down, and Hay and Ward were sitting by the side of him, and Collier was on the other side of the table—I went to turn out of the room, and I saw Ward with his hand at the prosecutor's neck, lifting his watch-chain—I then went and communicated to my husband—he went and searched for the police—I went in again to the room and saw Ward with his hands round the prosecutor's neck, putting him out of the door—I said, "What are you</p>

               <p>going to do with the lad?"—he said, "All right, he is a mate of mine; I am going to take him to Harefield"—I said, "What a disgraceful manner you are taking him out in; his pocket is turned inside out; and where is his watch?"—the other two—prisoners were then standing by the side—they were all standing together—I did not see the watch—they then all left together—Ward took the prosecutor out at the door, up the yard, and the other two followed.</p>

I proceeded to the "Royal Oak" beer-shop in Ux<lb></lb>bridge about 12 o'clock—I found the prosecutor lying in the Belmont-road—another constable went to the beer-house—he is not here, because he did not go after the prisoners—the prosecutor was drunk at the time I found him—I afterwards went in search of the prisoners—I took Hay into custody that same night—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it, but on the way to the station he said that Collier had taken the watch and given it to Ward—I afterwards, on the same night, went and took Collier into custody—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about the robbery; he only assisted the other men in taking him up where I found him—he said he went up the <hi rend="italic">chapel</hi> with him—I took Ward into custody next morning at half-past 8—I told him the charge—he first told me he knew nothing about the affair—I asked him to come down to Mrs. Hollo<lb></lb>way's, and I said I should take him into custody—on the way to the station he said that he had got the watch; that Hay, a short man, gave it to him—I took this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his (<hi rend="italic">Ward's</hi>) pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of a brig which was lying in the Thames. On the 15th of August I had been to the Tiger public-house, Lower Thames-street, and had some grog—I came away about eleven o'clock at night, and was going round the Tower to my ship in St. Kathe-rine's Dock—the prisoner came up to me as I was rounding the rails near the lower part of the Minories—she wished to have hold of me—I said I was a married man, and was going to my wife on board: I wished to have nothing to do with her—I then missed my purse, which had been in my right hand breeches pocket—she was at that time between me and the rails—I laid hold of her, and called for assistance—the policeman came up and secured her, and I heard something jink in his hand when he took it from her—I saw the purse the next day—I had had seven sovereigns and a half in it—it was a leather purse—I had not been out of the public-house above seven or eight minutes before the prisoner came up—I had paid a bill just before I left, and I am quite sure I had my purse safe in my pocket after I left there, and I had met no one else.</p>

About a quarter past eleven o'clock that night I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling together at the rails round the Tower—he said, "You shan't go," and she said, "Let me go"—I went up, and she tried to run away—I brought her back, and took from her right hand six sovereigns and three half-sovereigns—I had before asked her to let me look into her hand—she refused, and said</p>

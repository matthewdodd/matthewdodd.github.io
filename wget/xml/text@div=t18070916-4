Perfectly; she came to our house on Saturday the 23d of May last; to purchase a piece of veal, she bargained with me and in consideration of her poor appearance, I sold it her worth her money; it came to a shilling; after she went out of the shop, I sounded it on the board, I said to my servant, Thomas, this is a bad shilling, seek for the woman; the man took up the shilling, went out and returned, and said the woman was gone; he gave me back the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same shilling that the woman gave you. - A. I have not a doubt of it; I laid it by itself on the ledge of the window, and it laid there till the woman returned again; that might be an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Heath there then. - A. Yes, he was in the shop; she purchased a lamb's heart of him, it came to four pence; she tendered another shilling to my husband; upon this being tendered to him it was discovered it was a bad one: we sent for the officer Franklin; before the officer came, I said, I think you are the person that was here a good while ago, she said indeed madam I have never been here before; I said you cannot look me in the face, and say you have never been here before, she said she had not; I said you have got the article that you purchased, I dare say, in your basket; then she said Oh, yes, I believe it is the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the basket to see if the articles was in the basket. - A. Yes; I found it in the basket. We gave both the shillings to the officer.</p>

               <p>Court. You said that you had no doubt that the shilling that you put on the ledge of the window to be the same shilling that you had given to the man; did you happen to see any mark on the shilling. - A. No; I have no doubt of my servant changing it.</p>

Yes, a shilling; I had a doubt of its being a good one; I tried it on the steel and cut it, and found it to be a bad one, in her presence; I said to Mrs. Heath, in the presence of the prisoner, is not this the woman that gave you the bad shilling just now; then she said yes, here it is; I took it and tried it upon the steel, I found that to be bad too; I sent for Franklin directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Franklin came did any conversation take place between you and the prisoner, or your wife. - A. My wife said she thought she had got the veal that she purchased; she denied it, and afterwards she said she believed it was the shop, and that was the veal in the basket that she had purchased in the shop. When Franklin came, I told him we had got what I believed they called a smasher. When he searched her he told her to open her mouth, she would not; he took hold of her chin and she swallowed something; then he searched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160005"></xptr>her pockets and found some halfpence; he searched her basket, there he found sugar, potatoes, spinage, and the bit of veal that she bought of Mrs. Heath; they were all in 'the basket in small quantities; I delivered both the shillings to Franklin, and he took her away.</p>

             - Mr. Knapp. You are the constable that was sent for on this occasion. - A. I was. When I came there Mr. Heath said he had got a woman he believed they called a smasher: he gave me the two shillings that he said he and his wife had taken; I produce the two shillings; I have kept them separate ever since. I opened the basket, I found some spinage, I put my hand to the bottom of the basket and found the veal; Mrs. Heath said that is the veal she bought of me. I found in her pocket ten pennyworth of halfpence, all good. Mr. Heath said, never mind, send her about her business; I said I did not think that is right, I shall take her to Worship-street, and told him he must be after me directly. I desired her to open her mouth, I was apprehensive that she might have something in her mouth; she said why; she swallowed very hard; I heard something nick against her teeth. Going over the fields she said why should you wish to hurt me, the man does not wish to hurt me, what would be the use of you sending me to goal for a twelvemonth; I shall see you another day and make you amends.</p>

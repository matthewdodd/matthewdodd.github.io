I had 50l. or 60l. in Bank notes in a box in my bed-room; I saw them safe about three weeks before I missed them - they were 10l. notes; I had received 175l. in all, for cheques upon Messrs. Jones, Lloyd, and Co. Hooper lodged in the same room with me for about two months; I do not think he ever saw, me with the notes - I had had them by me about eight months; Hooper and Higgins are both butchers; I knew nothing of Davis till he was apprehended; there was the mark of a large knife where the hasp of the box had been wrenched off. This money had been left me, and I had sold it out of the funds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does Barber keep a general lodging-house? A. No, it is a public-house - she lets lodgings to single-men; only I, Hooper, and one Cutmore lodged in that room; he and Hooper slept together; I slept alone. There is another bed-room on the same floor, in which Prague and Webb slept; I was living upon this money; I had taken a shop, but was disappointed about it; Hooper was out of a situation: the room door was never locked. Higgins did not lodge there.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Jones, a silversmith, near Waterloo-bridge. On the 11th of September, the prisoner Higgins purchased two rings for 16s., and gave me a 10l. note; I gave him the change; I exchanged it for sovereigns a few days after at the Bank: I asked his name; he said, "Henry Marks, No. 22, Blackwell-street, Clare-market," which I wrote on it in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. No; I did not take the number of the note - it was in my possession till I took it to the Bank: I produced it at the Thames Police Office three or four times, as Higgins was taken into custody on my charge originally, and discharged upon entering into recognizances to meet my charge; he came to our shop between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and remained there about ten minutes.</p>

The prisoner Hooper came to my lodg<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250011"></xptr>ings on the 11th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and asked Higgins, who lodged at my house, to go out with him; I refused to let him go - I had seen Hooper before, but did not particularly know him; Hooper came to my house a few days afterwards, and asked me to go and get change for a 10l. note; I went to Waterloo-house, Cockspur-street, and laid out 8s. or 9s. in linen-drapery, and got it changed; I gave some of the change to Hooper, and paid some of it to a Solicitor to go down to the Thames Police Office; I believe Davis was present when Hooper gave me the 10l. note - I had not seen him before, but he came in with Hooper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Hooper give you the note? A. I think on the 13th of September; Higgins lived with me; I gave Hooper four sovereigns; I paid the Solicitor, and paid some expenses; I could not read sufficient to tell the number or amount of the note, but he told me it was a 10l. note.</p>

Yes; one of them had been with me for three years; Hooper has respectable friends; the room door was never locked - I never locked my own bed-room, I had so good an opinion of the lodgers; whoever goes up stairs from below must go through the bar.</p>

            . I produce the knife which Mr. Barber gave me; I compared it with the marks on the box, and they tallied exactly - it is a very large clasp knife - it being a leather trunk, the marks are very plain; the point appears to have been under the hasp, and the shoulder of the knife has been prized down for the length of an inch and a quarter; the box is about a yard long.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BARBER. I found that knife in the top drawer of the room where Mackay and Hooper slept; I had seen it in Hooper's hands before, and heard him say it was his.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FAGAN. I recollect that all the three prisoners were examined before the Magistrate; when the witness Matthews was examined a second time.</p>
               <p>COURT to AMELIA MATTHEWS. Q. What did you say before the Magistrate at the second examination of the prisoners? A. I told him Hooper came to my house on the 11th of September, and asked Higgins to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about a key? A. Hooper came and told me he had taken the key out of Mackay's pocket while he was asleep, and taken some money out; he had locked the box, and put the key into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I examined the box; the nails had been driven into the hasp again, but it had certainly been forced.</p>

            ; they are in partnership; the prisoner at the bar then stood along-side a pile of planks, twenty-nine in number; I saw him standing there.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not employed then? - A. Not then; I had employed him; I went away, and returned again in about three or four minutes after; I was informed by a man who met me, that a man had taken a plank from the pile; I asked in what direction he went; he told me; I pursued him, and desired the man to follow me; about one hundred and fifty yards from the place, in an alley, called Green-Dragon-alley, I saw the prisoner standing with the plank, one end on the ground, the other against the wall, in the alley, about three yards from the top; he was bending below the plank to ake it on his shoulder; he listed himself from underneath the plank; I took hold of him; when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170017"></xptr>saw me, he came from underneath, and I seized him by the collar; the plank was between us; he catched hold of the slap of his breeches; he told me two men had left it there while he was making water; he entreated me much to let him go, and said he was distressed; I kept hold of him; I did not wish to leave him; in the course of two minutes, the people gathered round, and a Marine-Police officer took him in custody; we took the plank and the prisoner to the office, as such I was bound over to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the plank? - A. Yes; there is a mark in chalk across the middle with a figure, signifying the length; that figure is made before they come to us, to shew the measurement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count the number of planks when you came back? - A. Yes, there were two missing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before that you counted them, and knew the number there? - A. It might be two days.</p>

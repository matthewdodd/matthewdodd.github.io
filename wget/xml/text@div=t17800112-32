               <p>On Monday night I was sent from Mr. Smith's with a box to Blossoms Inn, Lawrence Lane; I went through the market but that door was fast; the prisoner and another man stepped up to me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is one of them? - I am certain of it; when I came to a place that I thought was the passage into the Inn, they both told me I could not get through there; the prisoner took the box from my head and gave it to the other, and said, you take this box into the warehouse; I supposed the person he delivered it to to be one of the porters of the Inn; I did not know the prisoner; he told me he would book it; he called the other man Mr. Thompson,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120054"></xptr>the other man took the box away and I never saw it afterwards; I followed the prisoner as he was to go and book it; the prisoner as soon as he came through the passage set off running; then I thought the box was stolen; I cried out stop thief! I thought till he began to run that he was the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what was in this box? - It was perfumery goods, but I cannot tell what was in it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Smith. What were the contents of this box? - My clerk is here who packed it up.</p>

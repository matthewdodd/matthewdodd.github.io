                  </hi>. I live with my husband at Wood Street, Walthamstow the prisoner entered our service on 8th March—I left home on 1st June and returned on the 11th when I missed some pillow cases, table cloths, and various linen articles, after which I begin to miss all sorts of things—on 22nd July I missed a gold brooch worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my ward-robe, also two rings and property altogether value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th August a detective came and took me to Mr. Laws', a pawnbroker at Stoke Newington, where he showed me my brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this is my handkerchief; I have no doubt of them—I did not authorise anybody to take them to. the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 18th August I received some information and took Mrs. McCall to Mr. Laws' at Stoke Newington, who produced the brooch which she identified at once—Mr. Laws gave me some information and on 20th August I met the prisoner in Lea Bridge Road and took her in custody with another young woman, her sister, I believe—I charged the prisoner with offering a brooch for sale at the pawnbroker's, not with stealing it—she said that she knew nothing of it—I took her to the station and placed her and her sister with three more women dressed simi<lb></lb>larly and she was identified by the pawnbroker and charged by Mrs. McCall—on the 24th I went to Mrs. Kennesses' at Upper Clapton—the servant who opened the door handed me a key with which I opened a box at the bottom of which I found this handkerchief which Mrs. McCall identified—her new mistress went with me to the box—the prisoner was then in prison—she had said nothing about a box—the servant who gave me the key is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of High Street, Stoke Newington—on 2nd June, between 10 and 11 a.m., the prisoner came and asked for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this brooch—I asked her whether it was gold, she</p>

               <p>said that it was plated—I think she said that it belonged to her brother—I asked her if she could fetch him, she said "Yes"—I said "I will keep the brooch while you go"—I kept it, and never saw her again till I identified her at the station—I picked her out from five others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I identified her on 17th August, I believe—I had a telegram asking me to go to the station—it was last Friday month, I believe—I did not make a memorandum—I know that she came on 23rd June, because I made a memorandum at the station; I said at the station that she looked very different to when I first saw her; that I thought she was the person who pledged the brooch, but that dress made a great deal of difference, and that she was very much altered—I have fixed 17th August as the day I saw her at the station, it would surprise me to hear that she was not in custody till the 20th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Raymond-buildings, Gray's-Inn-lane. I have a foundry in Compton-passage, Clerkenwell—I lost from there three copper gutters and part of another—I cannot say that I had seen them safe since they were fixed twelve months ago—I have compared the copper produced with the gutter, and believe it to have formed part of the gutter, and from its appearance I should say it had been recently cut.</p>

On Friday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I met the prisoners in Compton-street, Clerkenwell—Knight had a bag on his shoulder—I passed them and went up to Compton-passage—I there received information that some boys had been on the building—I went back and stopped Knight with the bag—Orford was still with him—Knight threw the bag off his shoulder, and tried to make his escape, but I caught him—Orford ran away—I compared the copper which I found in the bag, with the top of the prosecutor's house, and it appeared</p>

I saw the prisoners together that evening, about ten minutes after ten o'clock—Orford was carrying this bag containing the copper—I went round my beat, saw Emery, who told me something, and about a quarter of an hour after, I saw the prisoners turning round the corner of Compton-street—Emery took Knight—I took Orford—he said he had only been carrying a bag for his father.</p>

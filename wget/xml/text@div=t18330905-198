            . I am a farrier, and live in Hampshire-hog-yard. I was in St. Giles's, and saw both the omnibuses before the accident, driving at a moderate pace - I was standing outside of the Angel Inn - the omnibuses were going by - the child appeared to pass Shillibeer's, and the other omnibus came in contact with her - the near horse knocked her down, and the two wheels passed over her body - I could not see any blame that could be attached to the driver, it was so sudden - I instantly took the child up - I was examined before the Coroner - there was room sufficient for Bardell's omnibus to go by - when I saw Bardell's it was about passing the other - it was in the broad part of the street at that time, and there was sufficient room - the Angel joins the church - the omnibusses were beyond me a few yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050123"></xptr>towards Holborn - they were nearer Holborn - they had passed me near Compton-street - they had not got to Compton-street - it might be one house from Compton-street - I consider Bardell's omnibus was not going seven miles an hour - it could not be going eight - I said before the Coroner that Bardell's, was going faster than the other - not that it was going very fast, but that it was going faster than Shillibeer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand writing? A. That is my hand writing - it was read over to me - I said Bardell's was going faster than Shillibeer's - I meant to say it was passing it - I did not see it pass Shillibeer's - but the child had run across, and must have passed Shillibeer's - when I first saw her, she was under the near side horse's head, about being knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you also said before the Coroner, that these two omnibuses were not racing? A. I did; according to what I considered myself - I certainly did not take particular notice in respect to saying Bardell's was going very fast - for I consider, when an omnibus is going between seven and eight miles an hour it is not such a rapid pace - in my judgment they were not racing - I saw the man who drove Bardell's omnibus, try his utmost to pull up before the child was knocked down - if it had been his own child, he could not have avoided the accident.</p>

            . I am a house surgeon at the Middlesex hospital - the child was brought there; I found her very much bruised on the left side of the belly; she died about half-past eight o'clock that evening, from a rupture of the spleen, and a quantity of blood extravasated in the abdomen, which would no doubt be caused by being run over.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ELIZABETH BALIN. Q. Were you at the hospital? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner's wife there, at the foot of the bed - I saw the prisoner outside, leaning on a post; I had something to drink with the prisoner's wife - there was no offer made on the part of the prisoner, to pay all the expenses of the funeral.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are are several people in the court it appears to me have been false swearing themselves - the grandmother never came near my horses' heads; in fact, the conductor took the child from under the wheel, and ran across the road with it - a man held my horses' heads, and the farrier stood by the fore wheel; there was no woman there at all - they said I ought to be taken off the box, I said "What for?" a gentleman in the omnibus said "What do you want to take him off the box for?" - I staid until the policeman took my name and number; then he gave me orders to go - I never saw the child till it was under the horses; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050124"></xptr>pulled up the moment I knew of it, and it was under the wheel.</p>

            , I am living on my property, at No. 3, Little Marlborough-street - I was in the prisoner's omnibus when this unfortunate occurrence took place; I was as near the horses as could be, looking through the front window; I could see the horses - the one next to me was not galloping; I could not see the off side one- I saw this poor child, I was sitting with my face towards the church; we were a little beyond the church, and looking through the window - there had been a little stoppage just before, and it was impossible to gallop without galloping over a carriage - I saw a child run from my back, she ran almost as quick as a bird could fly, she appeared to wish to get over the road before the carriage passed; I saw her come all of a sudden, and run so fast, I could not tell whether it was male or female - I was afraid there would be an accident; the driver was by no means to blame, he must be something more than man if he could have prevented it - I never saw him before.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Brown, of Ludgate-hill - I was in the omnibus that run over the child; the horses were not galloping they had stopped a short time before, I think it was to take up a passenger; we had got about eight or nine yards from the place when the accident happened - I saw the child leave the footpath, there was no crossing at that place; the child ran into the danger- the driver pulled up as soon as he possibly could; I don't think he could have avoided the accident; he was sober.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you inside the omnibus? A. Yes; if I could see the child leave the path, the coachman could - the other omnibus was between us and the footpath; it was not close to us, we were passing the other omnibus; we had come up to it - I saw the child through the windows; the other omnibus was not between us and the path - I was sitting on the right-hand side, in the middle of the omnibus, on the opposite side to where the child was; and the other omnibus was at my left, and the pathway to my left - there were no better means for me to see the child more than the coachman; he was more forward than me, and higher; he was turning his head when the child was leaving the pathway.</p>

            . I was the driver of Shillibeer's omnibus - I saw the child under the wheel of Bardell's omnibus, after I had stopped and turned my head round- I don't know at what rate Bardell's omnibus was going; I was going about six miles an hour - I was a-head of him; I was not racing against his omnibus; I did not know he was so close behind me; I was not racing against anything - I think Bardell's had the best horses, but the prisoner had never attempted to go by me, all the road from Paddington.</p>

            . I was conductor of Shillibeer's omnibus; I had come with it from Paddington - Bardell's at that time I think had the best horses - on our way from Paddington to the Bank Bardell's omnibus had not made the least attempt to pass us, except when we stopped to take up a passenger - I had the opportunity of observing the accident; the prisoner pulled up as soon as possible.</p>

            . I am a sadler, and live in Edgware-road - I was in Shillibeer's omnibus, on the day in question - I was taken up in the Edgware-road - I rode to St. Giles' church, they came very pleasantly all the way; I should think about five or six miles an hour, at a regular rate - there was no racing - I remember hearing of the accident perfectly well; we were standing still fifty-five yards on this side Moumouth-street, when I saw the child in the road, and I said, "That child will be killed," and it was run over at that very moment; it was not a proper crossing place at all - no blame at all was to be attributed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p> - CLARK. I was in St. Giles's, near Shillibeer's Omnibus; I am a baker and live in Junction-terrace, Edgeware-road; I witnessed the accident, there was no blame to be attributed to the driver of Bardell's omnibus, he pulled up immediately.</p>
               <p> - HAND. I am a milkman, and live at Hampstead. I was sitting in a window, in St. Giles's, and saw the omnibuses going at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour - I observed the accident; they were not racing - no blame at all was to be attributed to the driver - he pulled up as quick as he could.</p>

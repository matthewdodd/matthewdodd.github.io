I have a stable there, which joins my house - there is no internal communication from the house to the stable; it is built to the wall of my house, and opens into the yard of the house, which yard is enclosed by a wall, and a large pair of folding gates, and a private gate - the folding gates have a bar across, and the small gate is locked at night; nobody can get into the yard without getting over the gates; I go from my house to the stable without going into the street. On Monday morning, the 13th of December, about six o'clock, I heard an alarm - it was dark; I got up, and went to my harness room, which is part of the stable, and found the door open; my servant lets the coaches in at night; I cannot say when it was fastened up. I missed five sets of single horse harness, four bridles, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120013"></xptr>a saddle - they were left in my care, and belonged to different gentlemen - they were worth from 20l. to 25l.</p>

On the night of the 11th of December, and the morning of the 12th, I set up till between one and two o'clock; I fastened the gate, and barred the folding gates safe. I had all the harness secure by nine o'clock, and latched the stable door - I did not lock it; I never lock it. I saw all the harness safe at nine o'clock, and saw it at the watch-house in the morning - I am sure it is the same. I got up soon after six o'clock in the morning - it was dark.</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-street, at Mr. Graves', but have now come from the House of Correction. I had known Waller for about a fortnight or three weeks before this; I saw the female prisoner on Sunday night, the 11th of December, but never before - I never saw Dolphin before Sunday night, the 12th; I was in company with Waller and a person, named James Smith, on Saturday, the 10th, at the Black Horse, public-house, Barbican: I was at breakfast with Waller that morning, in Gray's Inn-road - he told me he was to go to the Black Horse, to meet Smith; I went with him at twelve o'clock; Smith came in - Waller and Smith went out and talked together, but I could not understand what it was about - I did not hear what passed. Waller had asked me some days before if I knew any body who kept any stables; I said I knew a person who kept livery-stables, Mr. Thurston, in Southampton-mews, Somer's-town; he asked me where they kept the harness; I said they kept it in the second door on the left hand side of the yard - he asked if the door was kept locked - I said it was either buttoned or latched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met Smith at the public-house, what did you do? A. We had a pot of beer. Smith and Waller went out, and when they came back Smith appointed for me and Waller to meet him at six o'clock, at that house - they did not say for what purpose then; I got there at six - neither of them were there; Smith came in a few minutes, and Waller about seven o'clock, Smith said he could not procure a horse and cart that night, but he had agreed for one on Sunday night, and it was put off till then. Smith told us to meet him there at nine o'clock on Sunday night, at the Black Horse - we all met there, and at half-past nine a man came, named Shays; he said he had got the horse and cart, and had left it at the stables; the Black Horse is between three and four miles from Mr. Thurston's. Smith told me to go to the Benbow public-house, in Golden-lane, and ask for Long Harry - I went, and saw Dolphin at the Benbow; I did not know him before; I inquired for Long Harry - Dolphin asked me who wanted him - I said Jem Smith; he said he was not there, and he dare say he could do as well. He went with me - Marr was outside the door, and went with me and Dolphin to the Black Horse; I found Smith and Waller there. Smith, Waller, and Dolphin went aside, and talked together - I did not hear what they said. There was an Irishman in the room, dressed in a blue jacket - he was not one of the party. Smith asked Dolphin if he could get him some large screws, a dark lantern, and a phosphorus-box; Dolphin told Marr to get him some of the largest screws and a phosphorus box - he did not say where from. Waller was present when he sent her for them - she said she could do nothing of the kind, for if Harry found it out he would kill her; Dolphin said they belonged to him, and he had given them to Harry to mind for him; she said she would do nothing of the kind without Harry's orders. We had three or four pots of beer, and staid there till about eleven o'clock, and went from there up Goswell-street, all five of us. Marr and Shays were with us - Dolphin at last, with a good deal of persuasion, got the woman to fetch the dark-lantern and screws - she went for them; we turned down an alley, about thirty yards beyond Sadler's repository, in Goswell-street, and waited down there; the woman went into a house on the left-hand side, and brought out some screws in her apron, and gave them to Dolphin, with a dark lantern and phosphorus box; Dolphin picked out two of the largest screws, and put them into his pocket - we went to the Britannia public-house, in Golden-lane - Marr was with us; we had three or four glasses of porter; Dolphin, Smith, Waller, Marr, Shays, and I were all there; we then went to the stables where the horse and cart were, at the back of St. Luke's church, and waited in the stables till a few minutes after one o'clock; Smith ordered me, Waller, and Dolphin to meet him at the corner of Tottenham-court-road, by the New-road - we were to go there as quick as possible; Smith and Shays overtook us in the cart at Euston-square; they stopped, and Waller got into the cart (Marr had left us in Golden-lane.) I and Dolphin went round the square, down Southampton-mews, and stopped at Thurston's gate; Dolphin went to the small gate, and tried to unlock it with the two screws - he came to me and said he could not open it - they were too small; Smith and Waller came down the mews, Smith said, "Never mind." I and Smith went round a street, and turned down a turning, which brought us by the side of Thurston's house, where there is a wall, and railing at the top, and by getting over there we could get into the yard; Smith got over first, and I after him - Smith opened the gate; Dolphin came in; Waller staid outside - Smith opened the door where the harness was - it was put to, but neither latched nor buttoned. He handed down the harness to me and Dolphin, and told us to put it down by the side of the gate; Smith, Waller, and Dolphin put it into the cart; Waller and Shays rode in the cart: Dolphin, Smith, and I went to the stable in St. Luke's, and found the horse, cart, and harness there - Waller and Shays were there - we got the harness out of the cart, and put it on a bench in the stable; it was then about three o'clock in the morning. Smith began to sort the harness out; Shays went away with the horse and cart, and brought the horse back without the cart, and took the harness off. Several watchmen came to the gate, and sprung their rattles; Smith got over some palings by the side of the stable; I got over after him, and do not know what became of the others. A watchman stopped me, and took me to St. Luke's watch-house - the harness was brought there. After I had been there some time I told the watch-house-keeper where the harness came from,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120014"></xptr>and where Waller lived as well as I could - he lived in a small square on the left-hand side of Gray's Inn-road. I was eighteen years old last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of the prisoners asked you about what was on the premises? A. Waller asked me where the harness was - nothing else. I had known Thurston's three or four months - I used to help the ostler there; he was my brother-in-law's nephew. Waller asked me if there was a dog there; I said he had a large dog, but it was uncommonly harmless, and would not hurt anybody - I saw no dog there that night. When we left the Black Horse the Irishman was still there, drinking rum and water with the servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. How long have you been in this reputable business? A. I was never in such a case before. I was never in custody before in my life. I was never taken up on any charge. I was examined before the Magistrate - I did not tell him exactly all of it the first time - I was flurried. There were five or six examinations; there might have been more; there might be nine. I was present at all of them. I told the Magistrate all I knew at the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You met some of these persons at the Black Horse? A. Yes, in the tap-room; there was not more than one or two persons there - they spoke low about the harness. - We were on the opposite side of the room to the other persons; it is a largish sized room, bigger than that table. Waller asked me about the stables when I was out with him. Nobody was present at the Black Horse but the Irishman and servant - they did not hear our conversation about the screws; they were talking and larking by themselves.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse, Barbican. - On Saturday evening, the 10th of December, about half-past ten o'clock, I recollect seeing Alderton there - Waller was sitting with him; I was not serving in the tap-room on Sunday evening, as my wife was confined to her bed - I served in the bar. I cannot say who was there that evening, be forehalf-past ten o'clock, when I went into the tap-room - none of the prisoners were there then; there was an Irishman there in a blue jacket, sitting with my servant girl, talking and drinking, and two of my lodgers. I have seen Dolphin and Marr at the house, and had seen Waller there once before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found four persons there? - A. Yes; my room has no boxes - one table goes lengthways, and the other across; there are benches all round the room - it is large enough for persons to talk and not be heard on the other side of the room, if they speak low.</p>
               <p>Q. If five persons at one table spoke loud enough to be heard by each other, must they not be heard across the room? A. I think they must.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If they stood in a cluster together, could they speak without others hearing them? A. I think not; the room is about four yards by five; they could certainly talk so as not to be heard, and strangers might not notice their conversation.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. - On Sunday night, the 11th of December, I was constable of the night, and about four o'clock on Monday morning I heard rattles sprung; I went out of the watch-house, and met the watchmen; I went into a stable, and found several watchmen there, and five sets of harness, a saddle, and five bridles, a dark lantern and a phosphorus box - we took them to the watch-house. I found Alderton at the watch-house, in Benson's custody; he at first said he knew nothing about it - that he was drawn into it, and if he got out of it he would never get into such a thing again. I apprehended one Crook afterwards, on suspicion - he was discharged; I looked him up in a cell adjoining to Alderton. Alderton told me where the harness came from, and directed me where to find Waller, who I apprehended at one o'clock in the day, on Monday, the 12th - I found him in bed, undressed - his boots, which were in the room, were very wet, as if they had been very muddy.

            . I am a watchman - my beat is in John's-row, St. Luke's. On Sunday night, the 11th of December, at nine o'clock, I saw a cart on Europia-place - it attracted my notice - I never have seen a cart in that place before - I missed it soon after one o'clock in the morning, and between three and four I saw it pass my box again - I do not know who drove it - it turned up there again - there was only one person in it, and one came on behind; one of the men asked me for a light, which I gave him - that was Dolphin - I noticed him - he crossed towards the mud-bank; I afterwards gave a light to a man who had the pony belonging to the cart - the pony was all in a sweat; I did not know that man - he had something up to his face - the harness was found in a place near the mud-bank; I have seen Dolphin about that spot before, in the day time; I assisted in taking the harness to the watch-house - I saw Eliza Cale about the place where the harness was.</p>

            . The harness was found in my stable - I had let this stable to Shays and one Crook - Crook rents it still - I live close to it. The night before this happened, just as I was going to bed, Shays and Crook came and asked me for the key; I handed it out to one of them, as they said they wanted to go to market. About three o'clock in the morning I could not rest, hearing a noise, as if they were moving - I heard a horse and cart come quickly to the stable; I got up, struck a light and went down, but my gate was fast - I could not get to the stable; I saw Waller come out of the gate - he said to the watchman "What noise is this? what is this about? they are my premises?" I had never let them to him, and told the watchman I never saw his face before - the watchman opened the stable, went in and saw the harness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About three o'clock - they made a considerable noise in getting away - I never saw Waller before: he said, "These premises are mine" - it was a dark morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Brick-lane - my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120015"></xptr>beat is near this mud-bank; I saw the harness found in the stable. The first man who came out of the gateway of the premises was Dolphin - he ran from me and escaped - when he came out I asked if he was the owner of the premises - he said he was - I asked if he had driven a horse in there - he said he had - I asked if it belonged to him - he said he was in partnership with a man in it - I asked him to come back and let us have a sight of the horse - he immediately flew off - I sprung my rattle - he was taken two or three days after - I had a lantern, and right facing him was a gas light: he is the man I am certain.</p>

I saw none of the prisoners there, nor Alderton either.</p>

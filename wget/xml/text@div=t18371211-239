                  </hi>. I live at Ickenham, near Uxbridge, and am a baker. On the morning of the 1st of December I sent a mare to the Manor-farm—my mare had been to grass there in the field—I could not find it—I had seen it last on the Friday evening—I saw it again in pos session of George Daubney on the Friday following, in Smithfield-market—I had taken her to the field on the 1st of December, and missed her on the 2nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Notting-hill, Kensington. I know the prisoner by sight—I was at George Daubney's house, at No. 6, Uxbridge-street, Notting-hill, when the prisoner, who gave his name as John Webb, brought this mare for sale—he said he was looking for Charles Thomas, who was a horse-dealer at Notting-hill, but had removed to Pad dington—Daubney bought the mare of him for one sovereign—he said it was sent up to be sold to a <hi rend="italic">knacker</hi>—Daubney took his name down—I am sure he is the man—it was last Saturday week, the 2nd of December, about eight o'clock in the morning—I believe Ickenham is nineteen or twenty miles from here—the mare appeared as if she had had a night's rest, and been taken away early in the morning—she did not appear to have been rode any distance, but to have been walked up—it appeared as if it had come off a journey—it was not dirty, more than its legs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Notting-hill. I bought the mare of the prisoner about eight o'clock in the morning—she seemed rather warm, and her legs were rather dirty, as if she had been in the grass, and had not been cleaned—she appeared rather warm—it was rather a frosty morning, and there was the frost on her legs, as if she had come off a journey—the prisoner came to me about eight o'clock in the morning, and asked me to buy a knack-horse—he said he was sent to Charles Thomas—but as he was gone away, a man had sent him on to my house—and the reason it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Notting-hill. On Saturday, the 2nd of December, the prisoner came up to me against the Coach and Horses door, and asked me to direct him to Charles Thomas, who bought <hi rend="italic">knackers</hi>—I said he was moved—he asked if I knew any body who bought such things, and I directed him to Daubney.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I will tell you the truth. My last master, Mr. George Phillips, discharged me, because he had nothing to do—I went to seek for another master, and started after a place, to work at the railway—I had to go through Uxbridge—a man came to me in the market-house there, and said, Are you without work?" I said, Yes"—hesaid, I will give you a job; I have got an old <hi rend="italic">knacker,</hi> which I bought of Mr. Fountain, of Ryeslip, it has hurt one of his, children, and be wishes to, kill it; if you like the job, you may"—I said, Thank you kindly; I have no bread for my wife and child, and I shall be glad to earn a shilling"—he said, Meet me at four o'clock on the other side of Hillingdon, and I will give you the job"—next morning I met him—he said, My name is John Wells, give my name, sell the mare for a sovereign, and I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your day's work, and here is sixpence to spend; meet me here and pay me down the money"—I went there at eleven o'clock, and paid him the money, and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is all that passed—I thought it no harm to earn a shilling, to get my wife a bit of bread—I was always brought up to farming work—master would give me a character for being honest and upright—but I have bad no time to send to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at the Plough and Harrow, Leytonstone. On Sunday morning, 14th Feb., the prisoner was living at my house—I lost some money from the bar—I took the prisoner up stairs, and charged her with it—she denied it—I wished her to turn her pocket out—she said she did not wear one—I wished her to undress—she put her hand under her left arm, and took out a purse, containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "That is your money, ma'am, I hope you will forgive me"—I had counted my money the night before in the cash-box in the bar, and next morning, about eleven o'clock, I went to it, and missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent for a constable, and gave her in charge.</p>

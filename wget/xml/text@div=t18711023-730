I am a stationer, and live at Belmont House, Clap<lb></lb>ton—on 3rd October, about 10 o'clock at night, I was on Hackney Downs—three men attacked me suddenly behind and in front, and took my watch, chain, and locket—I cannot say whether the third man did anything, it was done so momentarily—they ran away, and I pursued them between 200 or 300 yards, but missed them all at the end of a long passage—I was told some<lb></lb>thing, went into a garden, searched under the bushes and trees, but could find nobody—I then came out, and my attention was directed to something lying under the bushes, near the wall; it was the prisoner—I pulled him out—he asked what I wanted him for—I told him I had lost my chain and locket—he said that he did not know anything about it, he was merely having a rest—he was very much out of breath—a man assisted me with him to a constable, and I gave him in charge—my chain and locket were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am daughter of Mr. Henry Glave, draper, 535, New Oxford Street—up to the 12th February the prisoner was in our service as an apprentice—we also had a porter named Ashwood—we sent our money to the bank every two or three days, and it was generally the prisoner's business to take it—whoever went a porter would always follow them—the amount paid in was entered on a slip—the counterfoil we kept, and the slip was sent to the bank—I produce the counterfoil of the paying slip of 12th February—on that day the prisoner took the sum of 251<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the bank, made up in this way;—cheque, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; bank notes, all fives, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; gold, sovereigns, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; half sovereigns, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; cheques, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Scotch note, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had been with us about three years<lb></lb>he took the money to the bank with Ashwood, the porter—he did not return and I did not see him again till 28th February, when he was in custody at Bow Street—Ashwood has never been heard of—it would take about a quarter of an hour to go to the bank and back—the porter had only been in the service about three months—the prisoner had been in the habit of going to the bank with large sums—the porter was paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with board and lodging, and the prisoner had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given him that year.</p>

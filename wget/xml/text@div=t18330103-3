               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Price worked in the neighbourhood? A. Yes, I saw him frequently; he once worked in my aunt's garden.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you swear to Sampson at the office? A. I was frightened at the time when I said so; I did swear to him, but I recollected my words afterwards, the second time I was called up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police, at Bromley. On the morning of the robbery, between four and five o'clock. I was out; I saw the prisoners together, about a quarter of an hour before I heard of the robbery - they were at the corner of Devan's-lane, in close conversation together, Price with his hands in his pockets: I did not speak to them, but looked at them very hard - they passed on, and I soon afterwards heard a scream; the wind blew very hard - I went from there into the Bow-road; I went to Mrs. Price's, and found a robbery had been committed, and on examining the premises, I found there was no marks of violence - they could not have got in without violence, if the house had been secured, and there was no marks of violence - outside; I then went to a coffee-shop in New Bromley, and saw the prisoner Price sitting down with his hat on, and his hands in his pockets: he took his hat off, and put it down by his side - Sampson was sitting by him; he put it down on the opposite side, not where Sampson sat - there were between thirty and forty other persons in the coffee-shop; I said, "My lad, I want you:" Price got up - I said, "Now I want your pall;" and Sampson immediately got up - he had his hat on, I believe; I desired every person there to sit still, and I reached over and took the hat, which Price had taken off his head, and I am sure it was the hat he had taken off his head a minute or two before - I am positive of it; on my taking it up, and while I was in the act of taking a handkerchief out of it, he snatched at the hat, and said something, which I did not hear - I pushed him off, and took out the handkerchief; I examined the hat, and there were two table-spoons, four tea-spoons, a pair of sugartongs, a pair of spectacles, a bodkin, a case, and cruet top; I took them out in his presence - he said nothing to it; I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not some persons in the same box with the prisoners? A. There is no box, it is a round room; there were other persons near them - two persons could not have gone out, for the serjeant was placed outside; I cannot myself swear two persons did not leave the room - I had not an opportunity of seeing; I had returned Price his hat when he got to the watch-house - he made no remark when I gave it to him; he said publicly at the office afterwards, that it was not his, but not to me - that was between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the hat was too large for him, and that his was a silk hat? A. He said so before the Magistrate; I believe it was a silk hat which I returned to him: he said it was too large for him - he put it on, and pulled it over his eyes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to be his hat? A. I cannot say; such men are not particular what hats they wear - I have a letter written to Price; the last witness acknowledged it to be her hand-writing - I have had no conversation with Price about it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was out on the morning of the robbery, between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoners in the coffee-shop; I went in with Garde - I searched them; when I first went in Price had his hat on his head - he took it off, and put it down by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030006"></xptr>side of him; I saw Garde take a handkerchief out of the hat - Price made a snatch at the hat; I laid hold of him by the collar at the time, and pulled him away - I am sure it was the hat which Price had taken off his head, and put down; it was examined in my presence, and these things taken out - I searched both the prisoners; I found 2s. 9d. on one, and 3s. 9d. on the other, and under the bench was a bottle, with a portion of brandy in it - they were taken to the station-house; I examined the premises - there was no marks of violence outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether it was a silk or beaver hat? A. I do not know; it was on his right-hand side on the bench - there was nobody between me and the prisoners, nothing but the table - I had my Police dress on; he could see me as I came in - his hat was turned upwards.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What fastenings were there inside the door? A. A bolt top and bottom, and a latch in the middle; they must have got through the wash-house door, and then to this door - if the outer door had been bolted, it could not have been drawn back outside; I examined other parts of the premises, and found no marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose the prisoners were admitted into the house? A. I have no reason to suppose so; I cannot tell how they got in - the place must have been left unfastened, or they must have been let in.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. What that man has said is false; when he came into the room, my hat laid on the bench, but this is not my hat, nor is the handkerchief the property was in - if you will look at that man's features, his countenance changes in telling the lie he has told about seeing me take the hat off my head; I am innocent.</p>

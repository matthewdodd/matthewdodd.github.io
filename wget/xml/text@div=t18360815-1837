                  </hi>. I keep the George public-house, at Islington; the prisoner was in my service fifteen or eighteen months. On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 24th of July, I was in my kitchen, making some coffee for some people out of the country, and the prisoner said, "Shall I go down to fine the beer"—I said, "Yes"—he went into the cellar, and after doing that, between eight and nine o'clock, I found he was gone down into the cellar again—I saw the wine in a bottle, in the possession of Woodrofe, I sent for a policeman, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Ainge's service. On Wednesday, the 24th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went to get my apron out of the drawer, and saw the prisoner come out of the cellar with a bottle of wine in his hand—I said, "George, what have you got there?"—he said, "A bottle of wine"—he immediately gave it to me—I said, "You had better go back with it, or your master will find you out"—he put some in a pint pot, and gave it to me to taste—it was a full bottle then—he drew the cork before me, and drank himself, and poured some out—I just tasted it, to see that it was wine—he then went and hid it between the rafters of the privy—I went up to my young mistress and told her soon after it happened—I got the wine from where it was put, and gave it to her—she is not here—I told master of it, and he immediately went into the tap-room, and sent for a policeman—my young mistress gave my master the wine—it was port.</p>

I was sent for to the George, on Wednesday, the 24th of July, and the prisoner was given into my charge for stealing the bottle of wine—it was about three-fourths full—as we were going to the station, he said, "What do you think they will give me for this?"—I told him I should ask him no questions, and he did not say a word afterwards that I recollect—Mr. Ainge gave me the bottle.</p>

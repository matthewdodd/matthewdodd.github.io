             of Aske-street. The prisoner came on Friday afternoon to my house, about one or two o'clock; she gave me one shilling, and I remarked there was a lion on the reverse side of it - I put it into the till; the prosecutor came the same evening - I showed him the till, and he found the shillings.</p>

             (Police-constable N 8). The prosecutor came to the station; I went with him to the house, and asked the prisoner for her pocket - she took it off and gave it me; I found in it this half-crown, this one shillings, and this sixpence - I have known her some years; she has had a good character - her husband was a waiter at a tea-garden, but was out of employ.</p>
               <p>MR. BELLRINGER. These are a part of what I marked; the prisoner's husband was at home in the morning and evening - he still lodges with me, and is here now; I believe he breaks stones on the road; I have still lost 4s. - the prisoner must have had a key of my drawers; I kept my money first in the top drawer, and then moved it to the bottom drawer, but still it went - there was nothing found on her husband.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you mark all your money alike? A. Yes, with the point of a pair of sharp scissors; the prisoner lived in the front room on the first floor - she had no occasion to go through our parlour; I am out most part of the day - she could see when my wife went into the bakehouse.</p>

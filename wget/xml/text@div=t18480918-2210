                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband—I now live at 5, Eden-streef, Holborn. About twelve weeks ago, in May, I came home to where we lived, in Webber-street, between nine and ten o'clock at night—my husband was sitting by the fire—he asked the little boy, who is twelve years old, what the time was—he said, ten minutes to ten, I think—my husband spoke about the impropriety of my not being at home before him, and asked me for money—he accused me of being drunk as usual—I denied it—I was not—he asked for some supper—I said it was out of my power to give it—aggravation took place between us to the extreme—I accused him of being drunk—he had begun to drink at six o'clock in the morning—he asked if I could not furnish him with a sovereign next day—I said it was out of my power—he accused me of many things, family matters—he had the poker in the fire, clearing it—I found him in the act to strike me—he made after me, and struck me on the arm—I believe I put my arm up—I do not know where he struck at—I may have told the Magistrate I put my arm up to guard my head, and got the blow on my arm—I heard a noise, as if a basket was broken—there was no basket there—I afterwards found my arm was broken—I fell—I do not know what made me fall—I was then struck again on my legs with a poker, which my husband had in his hand—I was struck four or five times on the arm—I pulled a chair near me—I cannot say whether that saved me—my husband broke it with the poker—some one came in—I was taken to the hospital, and have been there ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant, at 64, Webber-street—the prisoner and his wife lived at 65. On 31st May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in my back parlour, and heard very loud blows in rapid succession, and screams of "Murder!" and "Save me!"—I went, burst the door open, and found Mrs. Morris weltering in blood, and the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing over her with part of a broken poker—I said, "For God's sake, you are not going to kill the woman!"—he said, "She deserves it"—I saw that her arm was broken, and the elbow dislocated—there was blood on the ground—the police came in, and I gave him in charge—he seemed very cool and col<lb></lb>lected—he put his fingers in his waistcoat-pockets, he gave one of his chil<lb></lb>dren half-a-crown to pay for something, and took his snuff-box from the shelf and put it in his pocket, as if nothing had occurred.</p>

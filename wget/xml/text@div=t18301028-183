            . At two o'clock in the morning on the 10th of October, I saw the prisoner coming out of Duck-lane, as I was going down Orchard-street; I asked where he was going - he said to try to get a lodging; I said he had better come to the watch-house, and when there I sent the constable for these two witnesses; when they came the prisoner was sitting down - they both said,"You had not that dress on before, you had a fustian jacket;" I asked him what he had got - he said 7s. 2d., and pulled it out of his pocket; I said, "Have you no more?" he said No - I then felt in his pocket, and found 1l. 3s.; I found his coat was a new one, and asked where he got it - he said he bought it four months ago; the women were then about to charge him, and he was going to speak - I said, "Don't make him any promise;" he then said, "Don't give me in charge, and I can tell you all about it;" he said that a man named Stocker had done it, and put them into the house of a man named Jack Niven; that he was going into that house, and the woman Stocker lives with, told him not to come there, as a man had stolen some coats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to ANN TOPP. Q. What time was this robbery? A. About five o'clock, or a quarter-past- I did not call Stop thief! the people were looking, and said, "A young man has run away with your clothes;" I followed you, and you went into the passage of that house - you are the person that had them, and no one else; he wore a short jacket, and corded breeches.</p>

            . I keep a clothes-shop in Monmouth-street. The prisoner came to me last Saturday night three weeks, at half-past five o'clock, and purchased a suit of clothes; he was dressed in the same coat he has on now - he bought a great coat, and paid a sovereign; I gave him 3s. out - he then bought a waistcoat and pair of trousers; I went to the prosecutor's house myself to save the trouble of coming here, and it took me twenty-five minutes to walk there from my house; I do not know how long a person would be running - the officer has the coat which I sold the prisoner; he might have sold one coat and bought another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live in Old-street, St. Luke's. On the 30th of April I was in Farringdon-street about eleven o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner snatched a pin out of my breast—I gave him in charge—this it my pin.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure it is yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because it is battered at the back—I seized the prisoner—a policeman came up directly, and took him—I cannot say that the pin did not fall out—he made a snatch at it—it was found on the ground—I held him last from the moment that he made a snatch at it, till the policeman came up—I did not go to a public-house with him afterwards—I will not say whether I did so before—I was a little intoxicated—when I accused him, he said, "I am not going to run away"—he did not say anything about the pin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 253.) I was in Farringdon-street. I saw the prisoner, as I was walking my beat, go up to the prosecutor, and snatch at the pin—I immediately made towards him, knowing him—the prosecutor had got him by the hand, and said he had stolen the pin—I took him to the station, searched him, and found nothing on him—I returned to the spot with a lad named Clark, and Clark found the pin in the kennel.</p>

I am a telegraph clerk at the Post-office, Clapham Common—on 18th March, between 5 and 6 p.m., the prisoner came and said "Three shillings in penny stamps," and put down a florin and a shilling—she kept her hand over the money while I was getting the stamps, and when I gave them to her she pushed the money forward—as she was leaving I saw that the florin was bad, and asked a person there to stop her—she was brought back, and I called Miss Pricker, who said "You must have known it was bad;" she said nothing—I gave her back the shilling as that was good—she was given in custody.</p>

I am clerk in charge at the branch Post-office, Clapham Common—I received a florin from the last witness, on 18th March, after the prisoner was brought in—it was obviously bad, it was dark and a very bad get up—I said to the prisoner "You have passed a counterfeit florin"—she said "It is not bad"—I said "It is such a bad get up you must have known it was counterfeit, a child would have known it was counter<lb></lb>feit"—I took a penknife and cut the edge; she repeatedly said "I did not think it was a bad one"—I said "Where do you live?"—she said "In Westminster"—I said "What part of Westminster?"—she said "Near Victoria Station, near the music hall and the public-house"—I said "Can't you tell me the name of the street you live in?"—she said "I don't know the name of it"—I gave her in charge with the florin—she said "Oh, don't, dear lady, give me in custody."</p>

I did not catch the name—the woman said "She has gone this way," and we walked towards Victoria Station—the woman left about Wilton Street—I walked by the prisoner's side as far as Hobart Place, where she stood still and said two or three times "What are you going to do with me?"—I said nothing at first, and then said "I will give you in charge," having sent for a constable who came, and I gave her in charge with the florin—she gave two or three different addresses.</p>

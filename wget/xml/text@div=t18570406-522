I know Emma Green, her maiden name was Mitchell—that is her; she lived with me, as my wife, for nine years, pre<lb></lb>vious to 24th March, and left me to go and marry Green—my wife has been ten years away from me—I have got the prisoner's wife back again, because he ran away from her—she was away from me from Easter Satur<lb></lb>day till the following Thursday; and I took the second wife that lived with him, when he took mine away—directly he found that I took her home, he found another woman, and took her up to his place, and deserted her immediately.</p>

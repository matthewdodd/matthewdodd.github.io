            . I am superintendent of the watch in Bishopsgate. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 26th of January, the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a pocket-book, containing 50l. in Winchester and Bank of England notes; and his purse, and that he had been at that public house; I told him to come to me at eight o'clock in the morning, and I would accompany him to the house to ascertain who had been there - as he did not come at eight o'clock I went by myself to the house - I asked the landlord who had been there, and he could not give me any account - he said he had no doubt he should know the persons if they were brought before him; I went with my brother officer to Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and went into a room on the ground floor, in a house near the top - I found Allen, Relf, Magnus, and Flemare and Lewis who was in bed with another woman; I told Allen I wanted to speak to him - he came out and asked what I wanted; I asked if he had been at the Rose - he said he had been at a public-house; I said I supposed he knew what I wanted him for - he said, "What, for the man that was robbed last night;" I said Yes - he asked if I was an officer, and desired to see my authority; I showed it him, and then told my brother officer to go in and search the room - he called me in; there was nothing but a bed in the room - he placed his back against the door; I searched and found this pocket-book in the bed - it contains every thing but the money - I asked how they came by it, and they all said they knew nothing about it: I took Allen and Relf into custody, because I heard they had been at the place over night - I took them to the Bell and Crown, where the prosecutor was, and he owned the pocket-book; I then went back to the house to get Magnus and Flemare, but they were gone - I brought up Lewis, and two other women, whom I found there, and before the Magistrate, Lewis said she rented the room; we then took them to Worship-street- I went to the Rose, and took Rogers; Lewis said Allen had given her the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. And you found Allen in the room with her? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Allen. he came and said he wanted me, and said,"Were you at the Rose?" I said I was - he said, "There was a robbery committed there;" I said, "I am innocent"- I had no objection to go with him. Witness. He mentioned the robbery first, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DICK. I went to the house, and we found all the prisoners there but Rogers - I heard my brother officer tell Allen he wanted him; Allen said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?" - he said Yes; I said,</p>
               <p>"I have known you from a boy, if you act well I will not ill-use you" - I had agreed to meet Relf in Bishopsgate-street; I went there, saw him meet the pot-boy, and speak to him, and as soon as he saw me he set off - I could not follow him, but I met my brother officer, went to Rose-lane, and took them there; I afterwards went to the Rose, and saw Rogers- I called him out, and asked if he knew any thing about a purse - he said Yes, it was a skin purse that Allen gave it to him, and they burnt it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the room at Rose-lane before the officer was? A. We went together - I knocked; the door was not opened, and I pushed it open - I went in; the room was very dark, but I looked round, and saw Allen.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. You say you was with the other officer when he asked me if I knew any thing about the robbery? A. No; he said, "I want you; I suppose you know what for?" and you said, "What, for the robbery at the Rose?"</p>
               <p>Allen. When the knock was at the door it was opened - Relf was brushing his shoes; he had not been there five minutes - he asked him where Allen was; he said, "There, by the fire;" I said, "Do you want me?" when they got me outside they said there was a robbery last night, and they wanted me - I said I had no objection to go with him. Witness. I am quite sure he first mentioned the robbery.</p>
               <p>Relf. Q. Did not I tell you, if you thought there was any thing, to go in and search? A. Yes, you did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TURNER. I am landlord of the Rose. I believe all the prisoners were there that night, in company with twenty more, except Lewis; they were there the greater part of the evening, but I did not know any of them by name - I saw the prosecutor come in tipsy, about half-past nine o'clock; I had only been in the house six days - the prosecutor sat at the end of the tap-room; I saw no one near him - he went to sleep after taking a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Was he not tipsy? A. Yes, very tipsy - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180072"></xptr>could hardly get the money to pay for the beer; I stood I suppose, ten minutes before he gave me the shilling, and I gave him the change - they all went out together; they all knew of the robbery before they went - the prosecutor first said he had lost 14s., and then 25s.; he then clapped his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocketbook and all his property; it was then ten minutes before eleven o'clock - I said, "Upon my word I think you have not lost any thing, as you give such different accounts, but you can go to an officer, and come to me in the morning."</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Did not I go away at a quarter before ten o'clock? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Magnus. Q. Did you not get me to assist in moving your goods up and down? A. Yes, for two or three days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he did not come in with the others? A. I do not know that he did, but he was there - I thought he seemed to be industrious, and I asked him to assist me - I let him have 5s. to start him in business to sell oranges, lemons, and clothes.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARDNER. I am pot-boy at the Rose. I saw the prosecutor there asleep - Allen was by him at one time, and Rogers was near him at the same time; I do not know that they sat there all the time - I was in and out of the room; I saw them once or twice - they might be near him five or ten minutes; Flemare was sitting opposite him, singing all the evening - the others were a good way off; Relf was near the door - I saw Flemare go out once, that was all; Magnus was just by Flemare -Lewis was there in the evening while the prosecutor was asleep - I suppose she was two or three yards from him, and not at the same table; I heard him say he had been robbed of 14s., and then of 25s. - he then put his hand to his side pocket, and said he had lost his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Allen. Q. Did you see me touch, or take any notice of him? A. No, you were sitting by him - I did not see any of them touch him.</p>
               <p>Relf. Q. Did you see me near him? A. No, you sat at the further end of the room,</p>
               <p>Magnus. Q. Was not I there with a few oranges? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see one of them the next morning? A. Yes, I saw Relf, as I was going for some sugar, and he asked what time the soup would be ready - I told him at twelve o'clock - I left him and two or three more talking.</p>
               <p>Flemare. Q. Was I sitting near the prosecutor? A. No, you were sitting opposite, and went out about two minutes before the rest; Allenwent out at a quarter-past ten o'clock, and came back just as all the rest were gone - he said he had been to get some money to have something more to drink.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHUTTLEWORTH. I am a bricklayer. I went to the Rose about eight o'clock, and sat there till half-past nine; I saw the prosecutor come in, and have some beer, and bread and cheese - I went out, and came back five minutes after ten; I saw Allen sitting by the side of the prosecutor, and Rogers near him, but a girl sat between him and the prosecutor - Lewis was there when I went about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Lewis do any thing with the prosecutor? A. No, nor near him - there was another female with her.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. On the night of the 7th of February I took Flemare from information - I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "I want you;" he said, "What for?" I said,</p>
               <p>"If you will come with me, I will tell you" - he walked about one hundred yards, and then ran from me; he was stopped and I took him to the watch-house - he admitted that he was at the Rose on the evening of the robbery; I could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Flemare. Q. Was I not in liquor? A. I did not perceive it if he was - it was at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM EDWARDS. This is my pocket-book - I had two purses. one a canvas one, and one was the dried skin of a bullock's heart.</p>
               <p>Allen's Defence. I saw the prosecutor come into the tap-room at the Rose - he looked about, and went into the bar; I went to get my pipe filled, and saw him there - he had some bread and cheese in a plate; he came into the tap-room, and sat down at the further end - Relf sat five or six yards from him, and Rogers by the side of him for about a minute; Magnus was sitting there, and Flemare was singing songs - I saw two or three women there, but not Lewis; one of the women shook the prosecutor- I took no notice; she had a plaid cloak, and a white Leghorn bonnet on - in a few minutes I saw her take his arm, and then lay it down - she then went out; I went to light my pipe at the gas, and saw a kind of skin lying - I said to Rogers, "Put it on the fire, it will make a blaze;" I was not half a minute by the prosecutor, and know nothing of the transation.</p>
               <p>Relf's Defence. I came out of the Rose with the prosecutor - he said he had been robbed, and would go for an officer; I went home to bed, and went to Rose-lane in the morning - I suppose the officer watched me; I went to get a brush to brush my clothes, to go after a situation.</p>
               <p>Rogers' Defence. I was in the house most of the evening - the prosecutor came in at half-past nine o'clock; I was by the fire - there were a great many people, and we sat down to make room; I sat near the prosecutor - there was, I believe, one person between us; Allen picked up a purse, and said to me, "Put that on the fire to make a blaze;" I did so.</p>
               <p>Magnus' Defence. I know nothing of it; I went the next morning to get my bag and basket, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Flemare's Defence. I went and had a pint of beer, and on coming out I saw a journeyman baker, named Green- he asked if I knew where to find Relf; I said I might find him, and the next morning I went towards the Rose- the man came out and said Relf was not there; I went to Rose-lane, and saw Relf go into the house - I went and told him Green wanted him; I was there smoking my pipe when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Lewis' Defence. Allen gave me the book that morning - had I known to whom the book belonged, I had plenty of time to have got away; it was ten minutes before the officer returned and took us.</p>
               <p>Allen. If you will allow me to be evidence on the Crown side, I will disclose it all - I know all about it, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180073"></xptr>I am not guilty of the transaction myself, nor do I believe any one at the bar is.</p>

            . Q. Your boy says he saw Rogers near the prosecutor, but somebody was between them? A. Yes, but I do not know who it was - I did not know any one in the room.</p>
               <p>Allen. At the time the woman was touching the prosecutor Rogers was not near him.</p>

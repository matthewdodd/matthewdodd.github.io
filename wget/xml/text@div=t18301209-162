I live in Essex-street, Commercial-road: on the night of the 1st of November I met the prisoner in Leadenhall-street - she asked for some gin, and I went with her to a gin-shop in Leadenhall-street; I had at that time about 13s. 6d. - I spent 3 1/2d. at that gin-shop, for a quartern of gin; we then went to a tart shop in Whitechapel, and then to a public-house in Whitechapel-road - we there had some brandy and water, for which I paid 6d. - I then had 2d. worth of oysters, and we went down the <placeName id="t18301209-162-crimeloc919">Commercial-road</placeName>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the night of the 1st of November I saw the prosecutor at the door of No. 5, Cobourg-street, Commercial-road; in consequence of what he said I went in search of a woman - in about half an hour I saw the prisoner going from the house; a private watchman said to me, "There she goes"- I took her to Green-bank watch-house; on the way I heard a noise, and the prosecutor stooped and picked up 3s. by the side of the gutter - I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found in her bosom a sixpence, and in one of her pockets 4 1/2d.; on the following morning she said this man was to give her half a crown in place of 1s. 6d., and she said she had some of her own money before - the prosecutor was quite sober; I asked the prisoner what was the reason she ran away - she said the prosecutor threatened her life if she did not give him back the money that he gave her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What account did he first give you? A. He said he had been robbed of 10s. 6d. - the money found was 3s. 6d. and 4 1/2d.; the prisoner did return to the same house - there was plenty of time to run away; the prosecutor returned to the house after I had taken the prisoner to the watch-house - I do not exactly know what time it was.</p>

            . I left my place on the Saturday night before the Monday on which this happened, and when out of place I lodge where the prisoner does - I was there when the prosecutor complained of being robbed; I was in bed with a had knee - he did not go out of the house; he stood at the door - he came in again, and I asked what he had been robbed of; he said 5s. - there were a great many words between him and the prisoner; he said he would give her blows if she did not return the money, and if she would give him 6s. he would let her go - I suppose he staid in the house near an hour before the officer was called; he returned to the house again said if we could make him up 6s. he would liberate the prisoner, and was very sorry for having her locked up - he said he wanted to stop there all night, and wanted to lay down on the fire-side carpet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a house is this? A. I believe it is a house for the reception of men and women -I never knew any harm of it.</p>

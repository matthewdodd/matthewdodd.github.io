            . On the 13th of April, I was at the Duke's Head, in <placeName id="t18160529-92-crimeloc495">St. Martin's-street</placeName>

I was robbed when I came out of the house, at about half past twelve o'clock. I was not quite so sober as I am now. A party gave me a shove on the shoulder when I came out. I am sure I did not stagger against any body. They shoved me right off the foot pavement; then another party came up and hit me right on the side of the head, and down I went into the middle of the road. I got up and had one istrike at the man that knocked me down. I never could find the man that knocked me down. There were three together. I think the prisoner was with the man that knocked me down. After I got up from that, a third party knocked me down; and then my watch and hat was taken. I got hold of the prisoner, and he got from me, by his jacket tearing. He was taken the next night; the others ran away, and the prisoner might have run away if he pleased.</p>

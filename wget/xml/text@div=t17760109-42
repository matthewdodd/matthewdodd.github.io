               <p>The tallest of the three prisoners (Cole) pulled his hat off and held it over his hand, and so pushed his hand through the glass of my shop window, and took out a piece of handkerchiefs; the three prisoners were making off; a neighbour coming by, laid hold of this Saunders, and brought him back to my door, and said, this is one concerned: it was about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Did you see the tallest do this? - Yes; I saw him put his hat over his hand, and break the window, and take the handkerchief out; I took Saunders into my shop, and kept him till I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of the tallest boy's face to be sure he is the person that broke the window.</p>
               <p>I am certain of it; I never saw him before that night; I saw him the next morning in the watch-house; I am certain the other two were in company with him; the little one came frequently to my shop.</p>
               <p>Are you certain yourself that the other two were in company with him? - I am not sure myself; but Saunders confessed they were in company with him in my shop before the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; upon Monday the 1st of January a person came, a brother constable, where I happened to be, and informed him of this matter; he asked me to go with him, to the prosecutor's; when we came to the house, we found Saunders in custody; we took him into the back parlour, and he fell a crying, and begged we would not hurt him, and he would tell all that he knew; I did not think proper to hear what he had to say there, because the shop was full of people; I took him into my house; there he said he hoped, he should not be hurt; that it was the first time he ever was out with them; he then said, they had been out all that evening together, and picked two men's pockets.</p>
               <p>Did not you give him some hopes, that he would not be hurt? - No, none at all; he then told me they went into Castle-street, and stole two fowls out of a shop, which they sold for a shilling a piece; that then they came to this shop, and that Mosey was the person that broke the window, and took the handkerchief out.</p>
               <p>How did you know who he meant by Mosey? - By Saunders's account; he said, the name of one was Archy, and the other Mosey; he gave a description of them, and said, they lived in a street in St. Giles's; he shewed us a house, but we did not find them there; then he said, they used a public-house, the Coach and Horses, High-street, St. Giles's: I went there, they were not there; I left him with my brother constable, and while he was making water, Saunders run from him; I was not far off, I pursued him and took him; we confined him in the watch-house, and then went to the Coach and Horses again; there we took Mosey and Archy, the other two prisoners: there were several girls; one of them said, Mosey, will you have any Gin? I said, that is one, be quiet and we shall have some more: then Archy rose up, and said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes, Mosey, will you have any</p>
               <p>"Gin?" We had a full description of Archy; then we laid hold of them both.</p>
               <p>The prisoners in their defence denied the charge, but did not call any witnesses.</p>

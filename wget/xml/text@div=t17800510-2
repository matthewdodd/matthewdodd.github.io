I turned round and saw the prisoner's cutlass. I struck him over the head with my cane, upon which he reeled; I turned my head over my shoulder to look at the other, and I observed he had his cutlass lifted up to strike at me; I knocked his blow off with my cane; I had my arm extended to keep the prisoner's blow off, and he cut me on the under side of my arm; he followed his blow and cut my little finger entirely off, and the next finger quite through the bone, leaving it hanging only by a little bit of skin; upon which I dropped down and asked for mercy. I told them if they would spare my life they might take my money; then the prisoner put his right hand into my breeches pocket and took out two guineas and three shillings; the other man asked for my watch. I had not my watch about me, I told him so; but he searched for one; then they d - d me and bid me go about my business; and I saw them both go up the field towards White-Conduit-house. I went to Bagnigge Wells and sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to say it was the prisoner that used you in this manner? - I was engaged entirely with the prisoner, he was the person I met first, I looked at him when I met him.</p>
               <p>Had you never seen him before this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he any disguise over his face? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a brown coat on buttoned.</p>
               <p>When did you see him again? - On the Sunday after, at Sir

               <p>Do you take upon you positively to swear to the person of the prisoner? - I do; he is the person who cut me and wounded me.</p>

               <p>Your resistance seems rather rash, did you see any body in the field likely to give you assistance? - I did not; I did not see that the other man had a hanger till I gave him a blow.</p>
               <p>The stroke you first gave was supposing you would have only one man to contend with? - Yes, and then I looked over my shoulders and saw the other drawing his cutlass.</p>

               <p>Was that the same evening? - No, the next evening. A person came up in the morning who had found the gentleman's finger. We took the prisoner immediately to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100005"></xptr>Sir

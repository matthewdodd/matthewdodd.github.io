                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Terrace-court, Chelsea. On the evening of the 1st of February I was on my way from Holborn to Knightsbridge, I cannot say which way I went, but I know I went Pic<lb></lb>cadilly way, and I met with the prisoners in a public-house before I got to Piccadilly, and sat down there, and drank—I bad taken a drop, off and on as I walked along—I had not had a great deal to drink—I was a stranger, and was inquiring my way to Knightsbridge—I had been in two public-houses—I bad four sovereigns and a half in my pocket, in the public-house where I met the prisoners—I can prove to have had four sovereigns at the time I sat in their company—I cannot ascertain whether I changed the half sovereign or not—Brown said to me that I had put my money into my coat-pocket—I took it out, and put the four sovereigns into my waistcoat pocket—I wore my apron at the time as I do now—after a little bit I said it was time for me to be starting for home, and I wanted to go to Knightsbridge—the prisoners said that was their way, and they would go with me—we started, and Brown laid hold of my right arm, and the other prisoner walked on the left side—when we got to Knightsbridge we went into another public-house, which was in my way home—I there felt for my money, and missed it—I accused them of it, and gave them in charge—in Sloane-street I beard a sovereign, as I thought, drop on the pavement—I looked round and saw one of the constables pick it up—I saw the constable take from the inside of Brown's collar three sovereigns—I had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in my trowsers pockets.</p>

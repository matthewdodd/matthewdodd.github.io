               <p>On the 19th of May, between seven and eight o'clock, I heard a rustling of something like paper, under a broken wall of a warehouse, in the court, and immediately the prisoner came by with a handkerchief in his hand; I followed him down the court, and he crossed the way, in Mark-lane; I called, young man, come back, and let us see what you have got; he came quietly back up the court; my husband pulled me by the gown, and said, have nothing to do with it, it is a troublesome affair.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce twelve pounds of isinglass, which was delivered to me by Phillips; I have had it in my possession ever since; I have a sample (producing it), which I took out of a cask in the warehouse, which had been plundered; I went the next morning with Mr. Pearson to examine his warehouse, it is in Seething-lane, one part of it comes into Sugar-loaf-court, in Mark-lane; there was a cask, out of which a great quantity had been taken, and there was a hole made through the wall, into <placeName id="t17960622-23-crimeloc135">Sugar-loaf-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You won't swear that this hole is large enough for a man to get in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor could a man with a stick reach the isinglass? - A. No; he could not reach the cask.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Allen). Q. When you heard a noise at the end of the court, did you see the prisoner near the warehouse at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come in a direction from the warehouse? - A. I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Pearson. This isinglass is the same as the sample; I can swear it is our property; I know it by the string it is tied with; you may go to many casks of isinglass, and not find two tied with the same sort of string; the prisoner acknowledge before the Magistrate, that he and another man broke the hole in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that taken down in writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You told my Lord, that this isinglass had a particular string about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There may be other persons in this metropolis, who have isinglass tied with the same kind of string? - A. It is very rare.</p>
               <p>Q. You only swear to it by the string? - A. By the string and the quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I stood at the top of the court making water, and saw a bundle lie in the court, and seeing nobody near the bundle, I took it up; Mrs. Allen called me back, and I followed her; her husband pulled her in; then I thought it was not her property, and went away with it; when they cried stop-thief, I thought I would have no more trouble with it and dropped it.(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character). <rs id="t17960622-23-verdict136" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q.When did you first know any lead was taken from your house? - A. The same evening, I went up with the prisoner's master, and missed the lead, it was over the dressing-room, belonging to the Cold-bath; it is detached from the house, there is a yard between.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any wall runs from the house to the building? - A. Yes, a party-wall, my yard is surrounded by a wall; the lead was a slushing over the gutter part of it, it was over the sky-light.</p>
               <p>Q. When before that had you seen the lead on the premises? - A. I may venture to say I saw it a month before, it appeared to be part cut, and part torn, it was freth done.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you with the constable when he compared it with the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it cover the place, did the nail-holes correspond? - A. They corresponded with the slushing of the lead, I can swear that was my lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at any time on your premises? - A. No, never saw him before; his master's yard joins the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his master at work for you? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that lead near Mr. Mills's premises?- A. Yes, close to my roof that joins his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear recently cut? - A. It did, I examined it that night, some was torn, and some was cut; I went immediately to Mr. Mills's, while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160008"></xptr>he was in custody in the yard; he went directly to the spot, and missed the lead; in one of my pails in the yard, there was about half a hundred weight beat up, and nearly filled the pail, it appeared to be the same sort as that found in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the whole of the lead? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear as much as would sit the place the lead had been taken from? - A. Yes; I had no lead in my yard; I left the gate open, and went to the yard when he was taken,</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did he appear to be in liquor? - A. Yes, he was in liquor; I asked him if there was any body with him, he denied it, he said afterwards, another man brought him back.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PALMER sworn. - I am a watchman, I watched the yard; near half an hour after six, I went down to the shed, I looked about, and the prisoner was stopping by one of the posts that supports the shed; I laid hold of him by the collar. I brought him out of the shed, and called to Mr. Goodyer, here is one.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner?- A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he runk or sober? - A. He appeared to me not much in liquor, he trembled, he could stand and walk, I found nothing upon him; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.No knife found upon him? - A. No; I saw some lead in the yard on the ground, five or six yards from the shed; I saw some lead in a pail, behind some wood-work, in the yard; that in the pail was in small pieces, packed very close, I did not examine that, that in the yard appeared recently cut.</p>

             - they had some straw on a stack of bricks on their premises at Hammersmith; at six o'clock in the evening of the 24th of March, when I left work, I looked to see that all was correct; the prisoner was about the premises, but did not work there. On the morning of the 25th, I missed a truss of straw -I tracked it by pieces in the hedge and on the ground, to the prisoner's residence, where I found it; he was standing by it - I said it was my straw; he said, if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150083"></xptr>was, he would take it back: he took it back to the stack of bricks, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How much of the straw had you? A. Six loads; it was rye-straw - I had counted the trusses out of the waggon, on the bricks; I saw the straw and the prisoner at the back of the premises - I went round to the front door, and he was coming out; he said, "William, if it is yours, I will take it back" - I do not know whether he remained in the officer's custody all night; I had not sold any of the straw, nor had Mr. Cubitt - he never sells any; he wants to buy one hundred loads now - it is a very scarce article; the prisoner told me at first that he did know how it came there - when I said I was led to believe it was my master's property, he took it back, and then he said, "I will tell you how I came by it; I saw a man in the lane with a truss on his shoulder - I called to him, and he laid it down" - I had been searching in other places, but had no suspicion of him; I had not been talking about it; it was six o'clock in the morning - it was in his back premises, which are railed round, and was near the pig-stye; I had tracked it by the ears of the straw being about the hedges, but there was a little opening in the hedge, and I suspected another person, and went there - I then returned, and traced it to the prisoner; I did lose the tracing for about ten yards.</p>


               <p>JAMES COOK. I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner on the 25th of March, for stealing a truss of rye-straw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not set at large? A. Yes, from Thursday till the Monday, through a respectable market-gardener, saying he would be answerable for his appearance; I have known him four or five years - he has an honest character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was set at large till the Monday morning. and then I appeared again at the Bell and Anchor; and if I had stolen it I should not have thought of appearing.</p>

On the 21st of February they both went out with six dozens of quart bottles, to Mr. Stout - they both had access to the stock; McCoy has lived many years with me - it was his duty always to see the van loaded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. McCoy has been with you some years? A. Yes; Wiltshire might take them without his knowledge; I did not see them loaded: I missed from fifty to one hundred dozens, allowing for breakage.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How many years have you been in the trade? A. Fourteen years; I have no doubt about my losing a great quantity of pint bottles.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it McCoy's duty to superintend the loading of the van? A. It was; we have occasionally carried bottles for customers who were moving, but they would be old ones.</p>

            . On the 21st of February I was at my father's house, at Hammersmith; Wiltshire came between ten and eleven o'clock, and McCoy just after him; Wiltshire asked what price we gave for bottles - I said one shilling a dozen - he went out - he and McCoy brought three dozens and four pint bottles: I said we only gave nine-pence a dozen for pints; I believe I paid Wiltshire - they were both together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they new bottles? A. Yes, I believe so; we sold them within an hour; I did not ask where they came from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear they were new? A. No; I sold them for one shilling a dozen, and had to carry them a long way.</p>
               <p>MR. MAN. They are worth three shillings and two-pence a dozen; McCoy knew the value of bottles - he knew the price very well.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife; I saw the ass safe on the 23d of December, and we missed it on the 30th. On the 31st I met the prisoner in Ratcliff-highway and asked if he had it: he said he knew nothing of it; I described it to him, as having a scar on the off-side - he then said he knew it, and had seen it at the back of the Halfway-house; I went there, and it was in the possession of Smith - I saw the prisoner again on the 1st of January, and asked if he knew any thing about it; he said,"D-n your donkey and you to."</p>

            . I live in Montague-place, Poplar. I bought the ass of the prisoner for 20s.; I cannot say on what day; I asked why he sold it; he said it was not strong enough - I think this was the beginning of January; he said he had bought it on the Friday week or fortnight before, at Smithfield, for 20s., and that it was a very good one; it was very ill, and I took it to Smith to sell it for me; it was a light brown colour - the prosecutor claimed the same ass as I bought of the prisoner.</p>

            . - I am night constable of Shadwell. I took the prisoner on the 26th of February; he said, "I suppose you came about the donkey;" he said the prosecutrix had told him she had lost it, and if he saw it to let her know, and she would give him 5s.; that on the Wednesday following he was going to Romford to buy a donkey and met a man with this one; that he bought it of him for 16s., and sold it a few days after; and if he could have deposited 30s. with Kyffen they would not have prosecuted him.</p>

            . When I found the donkey it was not worth so much by 1l. as when I lost it.; the hair had been cut off, but I knew it again - the prisoner at first said he would give me 10s., and then said he did not care what I did.</p>

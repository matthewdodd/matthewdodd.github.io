On the 13th of October, I went to Brighton, leaving the prisoner in care of the house - I had known her some years; I knew she was an unfortunate woman, but thought her honest; I returned on the 25th of November, and found she had locked up the apartments, and left - I missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

Yes, as a dress-maker; this is private property, which she had no business with; she got what victuals she wanted of my tradespeople, on our credit, and received money weekly from the lodgers, who left because she stripped their beds - I never gave her leave to pawn anything.</p>

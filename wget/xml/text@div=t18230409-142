            . I am shopwoman to Mrs. Button, a pastry-cook of Holborn. On the 19th of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for two penny worth of cakes; I gave him four buns - he told me to wrap them up in paper, for they were for his master's children, and gave me a half crown, which I sounded, it was good, and I put it in the till, and gave him change - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, I have got halfpence." I returned him the half-crown - then he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not," and gave me a half crown again, which I thought was the same, and put it into the till without looking at it - there was no other there. He went out; a little boy in the shop named Punch, told me to examine it, which I did, and found it was bad. I gave it to my mistress half an hour afterwards. I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. On Monday the prisoner came and asked for a 1 d. cake - I gave it him wrapped in paper. I had heard how Tipper had been served; he gave me a half crown, which I sounded, it was good - Tipper came out, and put it in the till - he then said he had got change; she gave it him again. He took out a half crown and a penny - we both said that would pay for the buns; he said it would not, and gave her another half crown; she pretended to go for change, but shut the door. My mistress sent for an officer.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090061"></xptr>He forced the door, and ran out - Tipper followed and caught him.</p>

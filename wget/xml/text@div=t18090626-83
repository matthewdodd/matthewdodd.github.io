               <p>Q. Did you lose any sheets, any blankets, a liquor machine, brass cocks, and three handkerchiefs - A. Yes, I missed them in the morning, about a quarter after six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property on this man - A. My son found three handkerchiefs on him.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLEMAN. I am the wife of the last witness. We thought of leaving the Cock and Bell; I moved some of the things into Gloucester-court; that is the house that was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the things that you had moved to the house in Glocester-court, were the things that you charge this man with having stolen in Gloucester-court - A. Yes, I had lodgers there.</p>

               <p>Q. This man was no lodger, was he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these things in the house in Gloucester-court - A. About eleven o'clock; after we had shut up the public house on the 23rd, I went to this other house and looked over the things, I found they were all right then; and coming home I met Townshend, Moggy Williams, and Mrs. Williams; they were lodgers in Gloucester-court, I saw them in the street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260064"></xptr>they were making their way home.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you any information - A. A quarter after six in the morning Mrs. Townsend, and Mrs. Williams came and knocked at my door, and said Coleman, are you moving, no I said, we have nothing to move; she said your house is broken open, but I do not think any thing is gone. I went immediately to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your going there were four sheets gone - A. Yes; three blankets, a liquor machine, more than twenty brass cocks, and more than three handkerchiefs were taken away; and a vast quantity of other things. The liquor machine cost ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this man - A. He used to come in and out with Mrs. Townsend and Mrs. Williams, they were lodgers in the one pair; he used to come every evening and have a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner was taken up, did you see any of these things that you had lost - A. Nothing but the three handkerchiefs; when the officer produced them I knew them to be mine.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Luke's. On the 24th of June, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner, at a public house in Grub-street; I do not know the sign. I told him I took him for robbing Mr. Coleman, at his house in Gloucester-court; he said he had not; I searched him at the public house, and found upon him, three handkerchiefs; one in his pocket, and two in his hat; they were claimed by young Coleman. Mrs. Coleman claimed them afterwards.</p>

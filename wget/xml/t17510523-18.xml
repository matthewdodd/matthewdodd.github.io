            . I live at captain Collet's facing this hosier's shop, the 8th of May I saw the prisoner at the bar an hour and a half at an Apothecary's shop door which joins the hosier's shop. I wondered what made him stand there so long. I went out about business, the prisoner looked every way, he looked full in my face as I went out, and as I came back, my old lady said to me, do you know that man; no, said I, but I shall know him again, for I thought he would have stared his eyes out. I saw the prisoner go by the hosier's shop and look in, the little boy was there; the prisoner went back again and set his foot upon the Apothecary's scraper at the door, put his hand over the grating and took a parcel of stockings of light greys and other colours, a pretty big bundle with a pair of stockings tied round them, he put them under his arm: I said that man has robbed the stocking shop; he ran away.</p>

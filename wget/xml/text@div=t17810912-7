On the third of August the prisoner came to my master's house, and asked the price of a gown; my fellow apprentice told her it was 14 s. she said it was too dear, and immediately went out of the shop. My fellow apprentice went over the counter, and missed a gown which hung on the outside. He went out; I followed him, and saw him lay hold of the prisoner. I came up to her, and took the gown out of her apron. I know it to be my master's, by his mark which is upon it; I hung it up the same morning. She cried, and said a young woman gave it her, that she did not take it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he did not take the gown from another woman, who was discharged before the justice? - When I took the gown out of the prisoner's apron, a woman came behind me and struck me, and asked me what I had to do with her; and by the help of the neighbours we took them both before the justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis. I was present at the examination; she said another woman gave it her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Lant Street, Limehouse—on Sunday morning, 15th October, about 3.45, I heard a noise of breaking through the kitchen window and found the prisoner in the passage of my house—he said "Old man let me go, I have only just come out from seven years, and am on a ticket of leave"—I said "What do you—want here?—he said "I have not come to rob the house, I have come out of the way of the police"—I opened the door and let him go and a constable seized himthe back kitchen window was open and three plates and dishes were put underneath to hold it up—there are about 100 yards between my house and the prosecutor's, they are back to back.</p>

I was on duty at 4 o'clock and heard cries of "Police!"and "Thieves!"—I received information and placed a constable in Lant Street and another in a court—I then went to the prosecutor's house and found that every drawer of a chest in the parlour had been turned over and a quantity of wearing apparel was packed up and lying on the hearth rug—I went into the bed-room and found the drawers all ransacked—the back kitchen window had been forced—I examined the back premises and found footmarks leading from a low wall to the back of Lant Street, and from thence over three wash-houses to Quinton's yard-the prisoner was then brought to the door—on the way to the station he seemed very fidgety and I said "What have you got in your right hand pocket".—he said "Nothing but what is my own property"—I searched him and found this knife and a cigar—I said "Is this knife your property?"—he said "Yes"—Cowper said "I had a knife on my parlour mantle piece"—the prisoner said that a scarf which was there belonged to his sweetheart-this hat was full of candle grease and had been used as a dark lantern.</p>

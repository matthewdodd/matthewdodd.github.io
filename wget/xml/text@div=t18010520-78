             sworn. - About a quarter of an hour before the alarm was given of the robbery, the prisoner, Hughes, asked me the way to Hampstead, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, they were all three together; I directed them, and Hughes said to the others, come along; they walked on before me; I went the back way of Mrs. Brasier's house; I heard a noise in the street, I ran round again, and I said to Hughes, you are the very man that asked me the way to Hampstead; Evans said, he had never seen the others before; I said, you were all in discourse together when you asked me the way to Hampstead, and he said, they were; he said he was going to see a shipmate that lived at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Evans's defence. I met Williams in Oxford-road, and he asked me to go a bird's-nesting with him; I told him I would, and as we were going along, we saw this sailor man; he asked us the way to Hampstead, and we directed him as well as we could, and a little while after we met him going the wrong road; he was going towards Kentish-town; we told him he might walk with us, and we would shew him the way, and as we were going along, this man, Williams, said, he was very hungry, and he went into Mrs. Brasier's shop for a pennyworth of bread, and then we directed the sailor man to Hampstead; as soon as he was gone, Williams told me to go in and steal the sheets; I came out, and met Williams; I said to him, here are the sheets you told me to steal, and he took them of me, and hid them in the grass.</p>

               <p>Williams's defence. I was very tired, and I got over the hedge to rest myself.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion public-house, in Ebury-street. I let this cottage to the prosecutor - it is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square - there are four rooms to it, but their two rooms do not communicate with the rest: I do not occupy any part of it myself, but let the shop and parlour on the ground-floor to another tenant; there is a private passage goes from the street into my yard, and then up-stairs into their rooms; I can see into the passage from my house - I have every reason to believe the prisoner is the man whom I saw coming up the yard, about a quarter before ten o'clock, on Tuesday morning the 31st of October; I looked at him, and went out at the front door, thinking to meet him, but he did not make his appearance; I thought I heard him go up-stairs, and thinking he might be one of the lodgers, I took no further notice; I will not swear to him, as I could only see him half-way, and he held his head down when he saw me looking.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pearson, and know Nolan's premises. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, I was in Nolan's yard, and saw the prisoner in the passage leading from the street to the yard; I stood in the yard, and he was standing in the passage, and was particular to shut the door after him; he went up Nolan's stairs very slow; I also went up, and he asked me if Mrs. Nolan was at home - he was then standing on the landing; I said I did not think she was at home; I left him standing on the landing; I went away: I am sure he is the man - he was dressed as he is now.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOLAN. I rent these two rooms. I came home at twelve o'clock - my wife told me what had happened; I went over at night to where the prisoner lodges, and found him at last at the Cock public-house, in Hopkins'-street, sitting there with his brother, having a pot of beer - his brother, the man who lodged with him, and his wife, were with him - his brother desired me to sit down, and drink; I said I wanted to speak to them at the door - they came to the door; I collared the prisoner, and said,"Was not you at my house to-day;" he said, "I was not;" I said, "I am told you were, and have broken my door and box open, and taken three sovereigns and a half out of it;" he said, "I was not there;" I said, "The man will know you - come up with me to him, and he can see you, or else I shall send you to the watch-house, and bring Pearson forward in the morning;" I took him to Pearson, who said he was the man who was in the yard, and went up the stairs - he denied it.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George, Hanover-square. I was called in about eight o'clock at night on the 31st of October. I went to the Red Lion public-house in Ebury-street, and found Nolan - he said the prisoner had broken into his house, and robbed him of three sovereigns and a half; the prisoner denied it; I asked where he had been all that day - he said at work in Newport-market. I searched him, and found one shilling, one sixpence, one penny-piece, and a duplicate, on him. On the following morning, previous to taking him to Queen-square, I said I should go to Newport-market, and inquire if he had been there all day - he then said he had been there but half a day, and he could not tell me the number of the house, or the person's name, or where they lived, but that he had been moving goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was working half a day - this man is my first cousin; I was moving a man's goods, and he gave me 2s. and a pot of beer. I never asked him where the goods came from; I helped to put them into the waggon - my partner is gone into the country, and cannot come here.</p>

On the 13th of June, we were at needle work together in the back parlour; she said she would work by time. I saw her go and take the watch off the nail, in the front parlour, but cannot tell what she did with it. I remained therein quarter of an hour, and about half past eight o'clock, we went into the front parlour to breakfast; she came in to me in two minutes, and after breakfast went into the back room, to put her things on to go out to work - she went out in about five minutes, and my nephew went into the back room to see the time, and the watch was gone - she told us she worked in Addle-street. I went there after her, but could not find her. I met her in Goswell-street, and said "What have you done with my mother's watch?" she said she had not seen it, since she took it off the nail in the front room, and hung it on the nail in the back room. I said I was sure she had it, and she should go home with us, which she did, and we sent for an officer, but nothing was found on her. We have not found it. Nobody went into the back room before my nephew - we have lodgers up stairs, but the door between the two rooms was open all the time. I never saw it hung in the back parlour myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. She told you she was going to fetch it - A. Yes. The nail in the back parlour is near the window; it could be reached from the yard had the window been open, but it was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where does the window look to - A. The yard. We have two lodgers, who have children.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's nephew. I was in the yard on this morning, and looked through the window, and saw the watch hanging on the nail, and saw that it was half-past eight o'clock. I went to see what time it was after breakfast, and it was gone - the prisoner had gone out about five minutes. Nobody had been in the room but my aunt and her. I am sure none of the lodgers had been down.</p>

            . This watch was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about hanging it so near the window - A. No. I said nothing to her about the window being open, for it was fastened with two gimblets. I spoke to her once before about hanging it there when the window was open. I sat opposite the window and saw her with her bonnet in her hand, leaning over the table towards the window - the looking glass stands in the window. I did not see her put her hand up. She said she should not be home to dinner.</p>

               <p>On May 13, about ten o'clock at night, I, in company with five more officers, went into an alley that leads one end of it into Petticoat-lane; I really forget the name of the alley, it is in the parish of <placeName id="t17940604-7-crimeloc28">St. Mary, Whitechapel</placeName>

We then goes to work to get the dies out of the press. I and Blackiter, and I saw Blackiter take a halfpenny with a saint stamp out of the dies, and I saw him take the dies out of the press, and the instant that was done, the prisoners were brought into the cellar, three of them, one made his escape afterwards that night; the other two were the two prisoners at the bar; we were in a sort of confusion then, we could not cleverly go to work to take the tools down; I said we had better take the prisoners to the office, and come back to take the tools down; I and Ray and Armstrong took the prisoners to the office, and I searched Levi and the other; in the pocket of Levi, his breeches pocket, I found it quite full with the halfpence that, I believe, correspond with the halfpence that were found near the press. Besides that, I forgot to tell you, in the cellar there was a watch hung up as if to work by.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the process of coining? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many can work the press? - I am sure three can, and there were three found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say the other prisoner escaped? - Yes, after being brought to the office; I and Armstrong took them two prisoners to our watch-house, and Blackiter took the other to Moorfields watch-house, and Blackiter let one slip out of the watch-house, by what means God knows.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that escaped claimed the watch? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down into the cellar were the prisoners in the cellar? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody was in the cellar? - No, but there had been, I heard somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a halfpenny, was the head on the halfpenny compleat? - There was a sort of a saint head.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the halfpenny appear to be finished? - I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean now that this was a finished halfpenny? On your oath will you swear that it was a finished halfpenny? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this halfpenny so set off from the blank that it might pass in the world? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040014"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Will you swear after all this examination, by my lord, that this was a finished halfpenny? - As well as a great many others are finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Finished with a woman and a head? - I don't know what you mean by a finished halfpenny, I am telling the truth, it is finished as well a great many that are among the parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Where there any finished among the parcel? - Yes, there were a great many as well as ever they were designed to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Do you know whether it is customary when they quit the press, to put in a piece of copper to keep the two dies from coming together? - I don't know, I cannot give you an answer to that.</p>

               <p>I went with Harper and Armstrong to this house; I assisted Mr. Harper to break the door open, and as we went down into the cellar, there we found all the implements for coining; the first thing I found was a pair of dies in the press, in looking about I saw another pair of dies to put into the press, and I took out a halfpenny from between the dies, these are the dies; I have got that halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know so much of the prosess of coining, as to know, that when they leave off work, they put a blank between the dies? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any halfpence laying by the press? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Harper. Here is a basket full of them.</p>
               <p>Blackiter. These halfpence were under the chair, it appeared from where they were, as if they had been sitting putting them in, they correspond with the dies; at the right hand of the press there were blanks, none at all at the front of the press.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was another man taken up, how came he to escape? - Yes, he went out of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you him in custody? - I was sitting by the fire, and I told him he might sit down by the fire and warm himself, and he jumped out over the half door, and I ran out after him, and knocked my head backward.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you receive a bank note on this occasion from that prisoner? - Not a farthing.</p>

               <p>Q. Where they offensive at all? - I did not smell them, I have seen people that have been in this work, and they were in that same condition; I then see all these things that the officer found in the cellar; there were two coats in the cellar and three hats; Levy was dressed in a jacket with sleeves to it, no coat nor hat, nor had the other that escaped.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me on a Thursday, the latter end of May - he brought these two tumblers, and asked me to buy them - he said he was a married man in great distress, and had been out of work for eight weeks - I bought them for 1s. - he then said he had a looking-glass which he must dispose of, and he would let me have it a bargain - he brought it the middle of the next day, and I bought it for 16s. - I said, if it was worth more I would give him more, but that would buy him shoes and something to eat - we keep a green grocer's and coal shed.</p>

             (police-constable S 81). I found the prisoner in the tea garden of the Prince George of Cumberland - he said he was innocent as a child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The looking-glass is my own - I worked it out of a man, and took it to my mother - she kept it till I went into the country, when she lent me 16s. on it- I paid her again when I came back.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH KING. No; I bought the glass myself - he never worked any thing on it, that I know of - he has had a few shillings from time to time of me, but never borrowed 16s. - he has never said that it was his; but I have said that what little property I had, I wished after my death to be divided amongst my children - the prisoner has said he should look upon the glass to be his, and the rest of the property to be divided.</p>

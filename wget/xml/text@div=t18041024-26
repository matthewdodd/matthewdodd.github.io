               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. The 12th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the Bull? - A. From about four and five o'clock in the afternoon till between nine and ten at night; then this woman and I went out together; we walked up <placeName id="t18041024-26-crimeloc134">Kingsland-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. She was tired too, and laid down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again? - A. No; she went by the watchman as he was crying the hour of one, the watchman told me, and I went by as he was crying the hour of three; I slept all that time; she wandered away home, and I never saw her before last Saturday, she was in at the Bull; I asked her then about this watch; she denied it to me, and said she knew nothing at all about it; with that, the landlady went out, and fetched in two officers, and they took her into custody, and put her in the watch-house; I appeared before the Justice, in Worship-street, on Monday, about eleven o'clock; there she owned she had taken the watch from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her? - A. I asked her if she knew any thing about it, and she kept denying it, but when she came before the Magistrate, she owned she had taken it, and she asked the liberty of my going with her, and Ray, the officer, and we went to the house that she carried it to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the watch there? - A. No, the watch was not in the house; she told me she went there in the morning, after she had been with me, and rapped at the door, and the mistress of the house said, who is there; she said, Molly, and she opened the door; she said to the prisoner, where have you been all night; the prisoner said to her, I have been with a countryman, and I have drawed him of his watch; this woman said, Mary, let me look at it; she took it in her hands, and she said she did not know whether she put it under the bed, or under the cloaths.</p>

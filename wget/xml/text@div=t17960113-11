               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing upon the 21st of December? - A. I lost it by finding it upon the prisoner when he was apprehended; he came to me about seven weeks before that time; that night I took an opportunity of removing the counter, wherein is a counter-bedstead that he slept in, in order to see that he slept decent; it was at the back part of the shop; I desired him to sweep out a parcel of papers, and some dirt that I saw, telling him it was very indecent, which he did; I told him to pull all the clothes down, and make it all neater and more comfortable, with which he gathered up something in his arms in this manner, (describing it), part of his clothes, as I thought; I asked him what he had got in his arms, say he, they belong to me; says I, let me see what they are; he said they belonged to him; I said I insisted upon seeing what it was; he ran to the door with them in his arms; I ran after him to the door, and caught him before he could get to the door; I laid hold of his collar, and he dropped this piece of Irish linen, (producing it); it contains twenty-five yards; I told him I was very sorry to see that, and told him to come back, for I would now go through with it; and I asked him for the key of his box, which was in the same place; he opened it very readily, and took out eight pair of cotton stockings, six pair of mens leather gloves, two muslin cravats, and two remnants of muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these articles? - A. Five or six pounds at least, they are full worth that; I sent for a constable, and he took him to the watch-house, and the next morning to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all when these effects were taken? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell if they were taken at any one time, or at several times? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the utmost value of any of these articles? - A. The piece of Irish cost me 2s. 2d. a yard, twenty-five yards of it 2l. 14s. 2d.</p>
               <p>Q. No other article is of so much value as that? A. No; not separate.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss any of these articles till you found the whole together? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell when you had seen them? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This unfortunate lad is no more than sixteen years old, I believe? - A. I think, he says about seventeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130026"></xptr>Q. Have you any parter in your business? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have known that you had missed any property at all, but for the circumstances you have stated? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated very fairly that the value you have set upon the Irish was the utmost you could state? - A. Yes; the utmost.</p>
               <p>Q. The difference of money is great, since the days of Queen Ann? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened his box very readily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he came to you from the country? - A. No; from Bruton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak of that piece of Irish as to the prime cost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are speaking of the value of money at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable at St. Martin's watch-house; on the 21st of December, Mr. Wiltshire came to the watch-house for a constable, and desired I would go with him to his house: that his boy had robbed him. I saw the young man in custody of some people that were there; I brought him to the watch-house. I desired that he might go up stairs to bed, and not be put down in the black hole; and next morning, he was taken to the Magistrate. Mr. Wiltshire produced the goods before the Magistrate; he has had them ever since, except these two pair of cotton stockings, which I had out of the prisoner's pocket, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wiltshire.) Q. Look at that Irish. Are you able to say that that piece of cloth is your property? - A. Yes; I know it by my own mark. These two pair of stockings, which the constable has, have no mark upon them; the other eight pair, some of them have the marks taken off; there are three pair that have my own mark upon them. The gloves are not marked.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is there any thing by which you can undertake to say they are your's? - A. I believe it; but I cannot, upon my oath, say that they are my property. One of the muslin cravats is marked, the other is not; the two yards of muslin I believe to be mine from the look of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Wiltshire.) Q. Many of the articles that have been produced you have not been able to swear to, because they have no marks; you say, from your belief, you believe them to be your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles having your mark, have your general shop-mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you sell goods out of your shop, do you sell them with the marks on, or do you take them off? - A. If that piece of Irish had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose I go and ask for exactly this quantity, would you sell it me with the mark on? - A. I should sell it with the mark on.</p>
               <p>Q. So that this Irish might get, in the course of your trade and business, into other hands? - A. I suppose it might; and I wish you may find it so.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that if it might get into the world in that way, you will not swear it might not have so gone? - A. Yes, it might; and have come in again, and got into that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. The stockings might have got out into the world in the same way as the Irish? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to William Cook and others, of St. Paul's Churchyard. On 21st Dec, between 8 and 9 in the morning, I saw the prisoner go into my employers' new warehouse with an empty wrapper—he had no business there, he is not in our employ—he came out again with a large parcel in the wrapper under his arm—it appeared to be the same wrapper he had taken in with him—I went after him, caught him and said, "You are a thief!" and threw him down—to the best of my belief he said nothing to that—thinking he might have some accomplices, I sent for a young man named Stevens to take charge of the goods while I took the prisoner; I took him into Knowles-court, and directed one of the porters to secure him, by tying him to a lamp post till my employers came; which I saw done—one end of the wrapper was undone, and I saw a piece of twill or Coburg cloth, of a red colour, in the wrapper—I gave the wrapper to the policeman in the same state I had taken it from the prisoner, and gave the</p>

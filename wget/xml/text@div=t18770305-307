                  </hi>. I was warehouseman to the prisoner in October last at 23, James Street, St. Luke's—I had been there about eighteen months, bat the prisoner had not been there more than six months; he came on 1st May—a few days before 27th October, I should say between the 25th and 127th, he called me downstairs and said he wanted me to go to the bank—he gave me a bundle of notes and said "See how much you make of those"—I counted till I came to about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there were several more—he then said "Oh, never mind, I am going to the City and I will pay them in myself"—he took up the notes, and, after transacting some business, he left about 3 o'clock—next morning he said "Well, Jocelyn, I did not pay those notes in yesterday, I will get you to go this morning with them"—he put his hand to his pocket and said "I have not got my pocket-book with me, I have left it at home"—after finishing what he was about, he left—I had occasion to go into the City, and on my return in the course of an hour or so he came back and said he had been to his lodging, but there was no one at home and he could not ascertain whether he left his pocket-book at home or not—he left again about midday and I never saw him again, he never returned to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met him in the City Road some days afterwards and lie then told me that he had lost the notes, and he was a ruined man—he told me he lodged at 9, Elam Street, Camberwell—I was never there—he never slept at 23, James Street, it was only a warehouse—the only cus<lb></lb>tomer I knew the whole time was a Mr. Priddle, of Jewin Crescent—received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Ming that he could not find his pocket book, but he believed he knew where he had left it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Fansett, of 9, Elam Street, Camberwell—the prisoner came to lodge there in February, 1876, and left in November or December last, I don't remember exactly—I have taken care of notes for him several times—they were always rolled up—I gave them to him when he wanted them—I had a bundle of notes from him in October, and I gave them to him again, and next day he came home and could not find his pocket book containing them—he looked about—he said he had been in Hyde Park the evening before—he did not say where he had lost the notes—he left about a fortnight afterwards—he did not say where he was going—he took all his things with him—he came occasion<lb></lb>ally after that—he said he was then going to lodge in Vauxhall Bridge Road—he left us because he said he could not afford to pay—I was examined at the Bankruptcy Court—after that I met the prisoner in Acre Lane, Brixton, in consequence of a note I had received from him—it was on 29th January—he said to me "What did they say at the Bankruptcy Court?"—I told him as near as I could remember—I did not see him arrested—the reason he gave for asking me to take care of the notes was in case of fire—I knew he had a banking account—I kept the notes in a drawer in my bedroom.</p>

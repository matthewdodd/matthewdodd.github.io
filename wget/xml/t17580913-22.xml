               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Holmes. The very last day of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she your servant?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Her husband had turn'd her out of doors, and my wife took her in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you deliver the cloth to her?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I delivered it the 31st of July; there was 7 yards of it, and she left me but two; she was gone also; and when I came home from my work, she had taken away the key, I was forced to break the door open; I have but one room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife?</p>
               <p>Holmes. My wife had been abroad, three weeks before; she was at her sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your wife to go out, and leave this woman with you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. By her transgression, in pawning my tools.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds have you got?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We have no more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner lie?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She did not lie with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How then?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She sat up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sit up in your room the whole three weeks?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes. I was two days after her before I could find her; she had pawn'd the cloth to two different pawn-brokers, one lives in Silver-street, the other near Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send her to pawn the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never pawn things for you by your direction?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you send the cloth to your wife, for her to make your shirts?</p>
               <p>Holmes. She would not make them. When the prisoner was before the Justice, she said, she intended to have brought the cloth again; but she pawned one part one day, and the other another day, which was no good sign of returning them.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker, I live in Silver-street Golden-square; the prisoner pawned a piece of cloth with me, on the 1st of August, for 2 s. I believe there is about 2 ells of it; she said it was her own, to make a shift body for herself. The prosecutor has been, and had it out of my custody about a month ago. (The prosecutor produced the two pieces, and deposed to them both as his property.)</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this cloth to be yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two pawn-brokers told me it was the same that the prisoner pawned to them; and if so, it is the same that I delivered to her.</p>

               <p>I lodged at this man's house, he beat his wife so that she would not come nigh him; I would not let him know where his wife was gone, so he has done this out of spite; he gave me the cloth to pawn for him.</p>

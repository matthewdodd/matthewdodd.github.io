               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you are not acquainted with Dancer? A. I am certain of it; I never lent him any money - I had not been wrestling with two men at the George the Fourth; a man asked me if I could wrestle at the time I was laid hold of- I ordered a quartern of gin there; I did not give any body my keys or money to take care of for me - I have sometimes left my watch and money at a public-house, not when I was drunk, but before I got drunk; I did not give Dancer my money to take care of - I have not been to the George the Fourth since, and given people a sovereign to drink the prisoners' health.</p>

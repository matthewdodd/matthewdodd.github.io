                  </hi>. I am under butler, at 25, Hyde Park-gardens. On the 9th of Nov. I had been to Drury-lane, and on my way home met the prisoner in John-street, Edgware-road—we walked up several streets till we got to Burn-street, Edgware-road—we went up an entry there, and were there to<lb></lb>gether some time—the prisoner said, "If you will wait a minute I will be back again"—I remained there about two minutes—she did not return—I missed my watch, chain, seal, and key—I was sober—I heard a door next to where I was standing, shut too—I called a policeman—he opened the door, went up stairs, and the prisoner came to the room-door when he knocked—I said, "I will swear that is the woman that stole my watch"—she said, "I have done no such thing, I have not seen it"—I went down to the door and waited, and the policeman called out, "It is all right, I have found the watch"—I did not see it found—she was taken to the station.</p>

I went to this house in Bum-street, next the passage, at about half-past two o'clock in the morning—I found the prisoner in the first floor back—I knocked at the door, and she came out—the prosecutor said she had stolen his watch—she said she had not, she had never seen it, I was welcome to search the room—I searched, and under<lb></lb>neath the table saw a piece of tin lay—I kicked it on one side, and there was a hole in the boards—I knelt down, with my lamp, and there found this watch—she then said she did not know how she came to take it—she had been drinking, but knew very well what she was about—the prosecutor was sober.</p>

She applied at the time of Lord Lovat's being beheaded for the key of my room, for a relation of hers to lie there. It was in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she deliver to you the key again?</p>
               <p>Clapp. I ask'd her for it, but could not get it 'till four or five weeks after, when I came to examine the room, for I never laid in it in my life. I live in Virginia-street. When I went into my own room, there I miss'd a napkin and a pillow-case; there was a blanket, a pair of tongs, one pillow-bear, and a napkin upon the table; all these things I miss'd. The Prisoner was not gone away, I thought I should see her the same day, but I could not, so I put a padlock upon the door, in order to prevent her taking more things. The day that I miss'd the goods, and that I searched, was the 5th of June; on the 6th of June I told her she had robb'd me. I had information some few days after, that there were some of the goods at one Elizabeth Sibly's in East Smith-field. I saw her several times after: she said that the glass was broke in sweeping the room. I went to enquire of several people I knew to be her correspondents, to endeavour to find the things. I had information first by my son of some of the things at

               <p>Q. Was there not something of an action against you for taking of her goods?</p>
               <p>Clapp. There was an action of Trover brought against me for locking the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the action brought against you.</p>
               <p>Clapp. The fifteenth of June.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor appear'd but in a bad light to the Court; his keeping a gaming-table; his conduct in seizing the Prisoner's goods to occasion an arrest on himself, and his doing this so long after the time that the fact is charged. The Prisoner reported to the Court the behaviour of the prosecutor to her, that when he met her in the street how he would call her a thieving B - h, and such language as this. The Court reply'd to her that she might prosecute him if he offered to insult her again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and have a house at Plumstead, in Kent. On the 23rd of September my house was burnt down—John Edwards was in my service—I saw numerous articles taken out of the house while it was on fire—I saw the prisoners carrying some of the things—I saw them both at the time of the fire—I had the things stated—I told Ann Edwards, the next day I had seen things go into her house—I had seen them pass from my garden to their house—Ann said every thing she had had, had been returned, and she had not the value of a pin's head left—a day or two after, I procured a search warrant, but previous to that I questioned her again, and told her I had suspicion, and had been informed she had things left, and if she had the wearing apparel I particularly wanted it, because my wife had nothing to put on—she said she had no<lb></lb>thing, I was quite welcome to search her house—in a quarter of an hour she came with a child's shoe, and said, "There, sir, is all I have left, I have nothing else of your property," and threw the child's shoe at me—I went to her house, and found these articles in different parts of the house, some in a drawer, some in a chest of drawers, some on a shelf—I saw John —I spoke to him—he said he knew nothing of the property—when they took these articles they were saving them from the fire.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to exe<lb></lb>cute the search-warrant—I saw Ann, and told her what I came for—she said the whole of the property she had of Mr. Carrington's was returned—John was not present—there was a back-door—about a quarter of an hour after we had been there Ann went to the door, and wished to go out—I put a constable there, and when she wanted to go out I called a female to</p>

On the 24th of June I was at home. looking out of the first floor window - I had left the ground floor ten minutes before, and left five tables spoons in the sink, to clean them - there is a back door to the house. I was looking out of window, and saw the prisoner Naylor come out of the front garden gate; Davis stood four cottages off: I watched Naylor till he got nearly up to Davis - then he beckoned to him, and both turned the corner, and walked away together. I ran down, missed the spoons, ran out at the back gate, and stopped both the prisoners, and said,</p>
               <p>"Give me those spoons;" Naylor said he had got none - I said to Davis,</p>
               <p>"Then you have." I called a man, who came, and took the spoons out of Davis's pocket, and delivered them to me. They walked together till I stopped them. I missed four, and found four on them; they are worth 3 l.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was at work near this spot, and on looking out of window saw something pass from Naylor to Davis, who put it into his right hand pocket; Duggan came up in a moment, and asked for the spoons; they said they had got nothing. I took them out of Davis's pocket. Naylor ran away, but was taken in five minutes; I am certain of them both.</p>

I had worked at Claxton's cotton manufactory for six years, and lost my arm by an accident with a steam engine, and after I recovered they could not employ me; I could get no work, and in a state of starvation was driven to the commission of this offence.</p>
               <p>NAYLOR'S Defence. I had my basket, and was selling willow shavings, and went to this gate, thinking to see the lady and ask her to buy some; the servant ran after me, and charged me with this, which I know nothing of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to David Moses, wholesale clothiers, of No. 14, Aldgate. The prisoner has been in their employment—on 30th Jan. he came, and brought three coats with him, made up in the regular way—the work was examined, and was not approved of, and he was discharged—I gave him the money for the work, and a voucher for it, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, which was in the name of another party who had had the work out, and a voucher for that—he brought a book, which I gave him back again—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the voucher I gave the prisoner—that would enable him to get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the cashier—in the evening, after the cashbook was made up, the voucher is destroyed—this number, "112," is the page in the ledger.</p>

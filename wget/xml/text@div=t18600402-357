                  </hi>. I am a single-woman and am now servant to Dr. Willis of Barnes—last January twelvemonth I was servant to Mr. Charier Frederick Phillips, of 48, Inverness-terrace, Bayswaier—I was out ol&amp; morning in that month, and came home about 12 o'clock—I came backtb the house down the area and saw a man in the pantry—I see that man now;—the prisoner is the person—the pantry is through the scullery, through the kitchen, and at the end of a passage—I saw him in the pantry—he wy taking the plate out of the basket—I went into the kitchen—he could see me then—he came to me into the kitchen and said he was very sorry for what he had done and he hoped I Would forgive him—he had his hands full of plate; silver-forks and spoons—he said he would pot it all down if I would let him go—he put down what he had in his hands—I said I would call assistance—he said I should not; he would leave the plate—after be hod put it down he attempted to go, and I took hold of him—he tbm took some more plate out of his pocket, some forks and spoons and a soup-ladle—the plate was all put on the kitchen dresser—I caught hold of him by his coat when he attempted to go, and he poshed me back-rafter he had put down the second quantity of plate, he again tried to get away, and succeeded, after I had called for help—he got away through the scullery, and up the area-steps—I went after him and called out—a butterman caught him, of the name of Bird—he was brought back to the kitohen—my mistress was there then—the plate was then counted and it was found to be right—my mistress then let the prisoner go—I don't exactly remember ho* many forks and spoons there were—there were upwards of forty on the dresser—they were made up of what he had in hi hands when I saw him first, and what he afterwards took out of his pockey—I am quite sure tht prisoner is the man.</p>

I am single and live at 51, Inverness-terrace—I was a fellow-servant of last witness, in January last year, in Mr. Phillip service—I heard last witness scream in the kitchen—I was on the staircase at work at that time—I went down to the kitchen, and saw some plate lying on the dresser—the prisoner was not there then—I asked her what had happened, aud ran down the terrace after her; and I saw the prisoner before he was caught, and I saw Bird catch him, and he was brought back to the kitchen—the last witness said she saw him with the plate—he said he was very sorry—I am certain the prisoner is the man—I couuted the silver; it was all right—my mistress came down.</p>

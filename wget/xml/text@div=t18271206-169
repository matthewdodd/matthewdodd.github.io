I took two sovereigns and a half-sovereign from my fob, and 3s. or 4s. I handed her 3s.; I stooped to do something to my shoe, and then missed the money off the counter; I turned round, opened my pantaloons, and gave myself a shake, thinking I had not put it down, and it might be about me. I said to Hart,"It is very odd, my money is gone;" she said, "That is the man who took it;" she went to the door, and called a man, who called a constable, and he took the prisoner in charge; I laid my hand on his shoulder, and said "Kelly, give me my money, and go about your business;" he put his hand down to his shoe, took up a sovereign, and gave it to me; I said, "This won't do, I must have my money, or give you in charge;" he would not return it, and I gave him in charge; the constable found a sovereign, 2s. 6d. and 1s. in his pocket - he was intoxicated; and next morning, at the watch-house, when he came to himself, he confessed that the money was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known him? A. I believe nearly two years; he is my countryman, and often went about with me - he could often have robbed me if he had chosen; he has sometimes taken care of my money for me; if he had not drank too much, he would not have deined taking it - I really think he would have returned it, when he came to himself - I do not think he intended to steal it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate so? A. I cannot say, but I told the whole truth; he said, that as he was putting it into his fob, it fell into his shoe, which was very likely the case.</p>

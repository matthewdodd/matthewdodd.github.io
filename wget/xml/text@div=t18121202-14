            . I am an assistant to Mr. Stiles. On November the 9th, between the hours of one and two, the prisoners came into the shop, and requested me to show them a small piece of muslin; accordingly I did, and being particular in the choice, I shewed them several pieces. I went to the other side of the counter to put the small pieces of muslin up, on which I saw the pieces of muslin lay on the ground. I observed their intention, I let them go on, as though I had no knowledge of it. I asked them whether they wished for any thing else; they told me yes, they would wish to see a small piece of jaconett muslin for borders of caps; and during the time I was getting the jaconett muslin down, it being in a seperate wrapper, I saw

            , asked her whether she took the three-shilling piece off the other counter in the last shop that she was at; Foster put her hand into her pocket hole to see if the three-shilling piece was in her pocket, which gave me reason to suppose she was concealing the goods; I let her go to the other end of the shop, and they were going away, I rang the bell, Mr. Stiles being up stairs. He came down, and I acquainted him of the circumstance. He sent for an officer. I detained them, and before the officer came Mr. Stiles asked me which was the offender. I pointed out Foster. She went from one side of the shop to the other and released the goods from her. I got of one side of her, and found three quantities of cambric, and one on Lock.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The witness told me that the women had stolen something. I asked him which it was that took the property. As soon as he said Foster, I observed the motions of Lock. I saw a piece of muslin drop from her clothes. This is the one that dropped from Lock, and these are the three pieces that dropped from Foster; they have my mark on all four of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, of No. 9, Brook-street, Ratcliffe. On Saturday, 10th May, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was on the watch on Ratcliffe Cross-stairs, and saw a boat come up with four people in it, each of whom had something bulky under their arms, wrapped up in something like a handkerchief—the prisoners are two of them—they came out of the boat, and up the causeway, past me—there was nobody there but myself—two people were standing on the top of the stairs with a truck; the four men put what they had into the truck, and went away up Butcher-row, towards Broad-street—I did not notice whether the whole six went away, because I had a fare, a gentleman to take over the water—in about an hour the two prisoners came back again—I plied them, and they said that they did not want a boat; they had got one there.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember being with the last witness on the night of 10th May—I was there when the four men came in the boat, but I was asleep—when the two prisoners came later in the evening I was awake; I saw them coming from the land—Long had pointed a boat out to me before they came up, and I took the sculls and the hook off the shore, and put them behind the watch boat for safety—they came down to the boat's head, and Long sent me down to ask if they wanted a boat—they told me no, and that that was their boat—one said, with an oath, "The sculls are gone"—the other said, "So help me C—, the hook is gone!"—I told them that I had put them behind the watch boat for safety—Long then called the police galley, and gave information—when the prisoners saw the police coming they said that it was not their boat, and that they wanted a boat to go over the water—the police stepped out of their boat, and said, "Going over the water! what are you going over the water for?"—they said, "Why, we live over there"—Long said, "I thought you said that you did not want a boat just now"—they said, "We said we wanted a boat all along"—I saw a piece of brass bearing of an engine found in the boat which the prisoners had claimed, under the step board—Long was there at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On Saturday night, 10th May, about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock, I took the two prisoners at Ratcliffe-stairs—I found this piece of brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a boat, which was pointed out to me, with the name of "Nash" on it—going to the station, Williams said to Ward, "We had better stopped with that <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>;" and he also said that they had come out of the Old Rose public house—I said, "Where is that?"—he said, "Oh, you know where it is; it is up by the</p>

Price's premises, and found the window of the store room broken open, and footmarks in the gutter leading to the window of the store room—the gutter is on the roof of a lower building—I saw the inspector compare one of Ward's boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the mark in the gutter; it corresponded exactly with the nails, and with the part where there are no nails—there was also some chalk on the bottom of one of the boots, and I saw some chalk on the head board of the boat in which we found the brass—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the head board; it is in the same state in which we found it—there is chalk on the wharf close to the water side—there is pitch on Messrs. Price's pre<lb></lb>mises, on the ground leading to the staircase, here and there: a quantity of pitch had been landed there, and I found pitch on the head board of the boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you compare the footmarks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—these art not ordinary waterman's boots, they are Bluchers—they are worn by all labouring men, but not by boatmen—the nails seem to me regular, but I think one is wanting—the tip of the heel is a little worn—the impression was in mud in the gutter, but it had dried, it was good—I compared it on Sunday morning—when I first saw it I threw a bag over it, so that the wet should not get at it if it rained—I did not put the boot down into the print, nor did inspector Brydges; he made two other impressions, and com<lb></lb>pared them with the other—I did not count the nails—that was between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—there had been no rain up to that time—I have on Wellington boots, without nails—the Old Rose public house is on this aide of the river.</p>

                  </hi>. I am store keeper in the service of Messrs. Price and Co. There is a store warehouse where the brass and old materials are kept—we had some brass safe there on Saturday morning, 10th May, at 8 o'clock; everything was secure at that time, and I locked the door after me—I went to open the premises about half past 6 o'clock on Sunday morning; and near 10 o'clock I found a great quantity of brass on the wharf—in consequence of what Ariel told me I went into store room, and missed about a cwt and a half—this brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has never been used on the premises, it has been knocked out of fittings which have been bought as on brass—I should have noticed if it had been taken away on Saturday—I left the pre<lb></lb>mises about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock at night—if I do not see the watch<lb></lb>man when I leave, I secure the strong lock which is on the gate, and go away—he came that night before I went away, and I paid him his money—I have known Ward since he was a child; he has occasionally been employed on the premises carrying out wood and coals—a dog is kept on the premises chained up.</p>

Price's, and made with the left shoe another impression by the one in the gutter, and there could be no mistake about their corresponding—I counted the nails, but could not count the impressions of them, as there was an accumulation of soot nearly an inch deep, which made a sort of furrow—the nails in the middle of the soles are in an oblique direction, and they corresponded—persons may get from the river side over the wharf, and through some gates over a low roof, and by climbing, which I did, up the side of a wall by the engine house—there is a slanting roof from there to the metal house, where an accumulation of soot would run down with the rain—I endeavoured to bring the impression away out of the gutter, but it would not hold together—that gutter leads to the window which was found open.</p>

               <p>fellow, not Williams, talking—I heard Ward say that Price's dog was no use, and I said I should be very loath to go on the premises in the day time if the dog was loose, for he flew at me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons might there be talking together at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be five or six—I had only had two pints of beer that day—this conversation was in the tap room, I did not hear it all, I am rather hard of hearing—I heard about the dog, and gave him that answer—I was close to him—I am sure he mentioned Price's dog.</p>

On Saturday night, 10th May, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I saw Ward and another person, not Williams—they were going towards Messrs.

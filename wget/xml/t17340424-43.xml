The Boy shew'd me his Hand. I saw the Print of Teeth in it, and it was a little bloody, but not so much as for the Blood to run down. There was some Money found just where the Prisoner stood. One Man found about 7 s. 6 d. and another about 2 s. 6 d. - It was my Guinea that the Boy had to change.</p>

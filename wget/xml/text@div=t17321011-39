Yes, says I, What will you have? A Penny Trumpet, says he. They were mighty difficult in chusing, but at last they fixt upon one, and then she bid me give her change for half a Crown. I ask'd for the half Crown; N o, says she, I never part with my Money in a Fair, till I have my Change. My Husband was just gone for a Penny-worth of Cheese, and I not having Silver enough about me, I gave her a Shilling in part, and told her my Husband would be back in 2 or 3 Minutes, and give her the rest. Come, says the Prisoner to his Wife, we can't stay, give the Woman her Shilling again, I believe I have got Halfpence; says she, I gave the Shilling to you; No, says he, you did not; but I did, says she, look in your Pocket, and you'll find it. So he took out some Silver in his Hand, and about 3 Pennyworth of Half pence, and gave this Shilling and a Penny to her, and she gave the same to me, and they went away; I put the Penny in my Pocket, and keeping the Shilling in my Hand, I felt it crack as I held it. I subscrib'd the Prisoner and his Wife to some People, who follow'd and took them presently. The Prisoner offer'd me a Guinea and a Crown bowl of Punch to smother it up, and not appear against them. And his Wife confess'd before the Justice, that she knew it was a bad Shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Wife took the Shilling for a good one.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not excuse your putting it off if you knew it was bad. Whether you took it for a good one or not, the Law is the same. If you found it bad, you ought to have destroy'd it immediately.</p>

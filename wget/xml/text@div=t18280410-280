               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you in any business now? A. No; I have retired for awhile; I left the Hole-in-the-wall last February; a short time before this happened I was indicted with the prisoner through a troublesome neighbour; I did not tell the prisoner that he was to bear the charge of the indictment; I paid 12s. for Mr. Thompson, who had bailed him; while I was gone to the Nore the prisoner absconded from his bail; I did not stop one farthing of his money for that indictment; I have not treated this as a matter of account; I did receive different sums of money to the amount of 1l. 9s., but I did it with a view to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you receive these sums as part of payment? A. Yes; in part of the 4l. of silver.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Spratt. I gave the prisoner this money on the 12th of August, 1826, to the best of my recollection; he returned in about an hour, and looked round in the tap-room; at nine o'clock I asked for him to take out his beer, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there not been an indictment against him? A. Yes; he did not abscond on account of that; we went down to the Nore - we heard he had been taken up, and that Mr. Thompson had bailed him.</p>

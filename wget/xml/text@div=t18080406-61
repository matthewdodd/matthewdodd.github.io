On the 16th of March I lost six shillings, four sixpences, and five shillings in copper, a till, and a wooden bowl that I keep the farthings in; the bowl and the money were in the till; the prisoner had lived in the upper part of the house for about three months;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060041"></xptr>On the day I lost my property the prisoner removed her goods away by one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her afterwards. - A. Yes, between the hours of one and two o'clock she returned again; she went up stairs to the person in the first floor; the woman in the first floor goes out to work, which gave me suspicion that she was after no good; she remained on the person's premises the best part of the afternoon, on the one pair of stairs; then I saw the prisoner go out of the house with a bundle in her apron; she returned about dusk, she came into my shop and asked for a half pennyworth of small beer; after she had the beer she went up stairs; in about an hour afterwards she went down and enquired if her little girl bad been. About ten minutes the child came in with two white cloths in her hand; the child went up stairs. There is a passage between the shop and the back room. When I set in the back room I cannot see any body that goes into the shop. Some little time after I heard a noise on the stairs, I came into the shop, I saw nothing of Mary Ayres and the child but on the stairs; when she saw me she removed up another pair of stairs higher. In a little time after I heard the same noise again. When I came out again and saw her, she then removed higher up the stairs. In about a quarter of an hour after a person came in the shop for a quarter loaf, she gave me a shilling for the loaf; I went to the till to give her a penny, I missed the till; I gave an alarm and sent for a neighbour; when I gave the alarm I heard something fall out of the window into the yard, which I thought was the till; this was about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the till. - A. Yes, it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides the prisoner. - A. One woman lodger on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was the till thrown out of. - A. The two pair of stairs, the room that the prisoner had occupied.</p>

            . About eight o'clock on the 16th of March I was called out of my house; I went to Mrs. Hetherington upon being informed a person had taken her till. While Mrs. Hetherington was relating her story to me, there was a noise of something dropping in the yard, I went up stairs, I saw the prisoner and her child picking up five or six pennyworth of halfpence on the landing place of the two pair of stairs; I took her down stairs. Mr. Hetherington came home and sent for an officer; an officer was gone for. I took a candle and looked over the yard, and over a shed that leaned to the back part of the house I discovered the till laying about the middle of it on the tiles; it must have come from the prisoner's window, the other window of the one pair was below it. The officer searched the prisoner, he found on her four shillings and nine pence three farthings, one shilling, and two sixpences. A small bowl was found on the stairs. We got the key of the shed, as the tiles were broke, to see whether she had throwed out any of the money in a hurry with the till; we only found two farthings in the shed.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was brought to the prisoner, whom I found in the apartment which she had lately occupied; on her denying having had the till I proceeded to search her - on her I found in copper four shillings and nine pence three farthings - silver, one shilling and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Could the till have been thrown out of the other lodger's room. - A. No, it was of the other side of the house; the till is mine and the bowl; I can speak to two of the halfpence that was found on the prisoner, I had taken them the same day, there is a mark across the middle of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master that I work for is in the habit of lending us money twice a week, which is Tuesday and Thursday; he lent me two shillings on Tuesday and five shillings on the Thursday; this good lady said she lost her till and money; she swore at the justices of losing eight shillings in silver, which was six shillings and four sixpences, and the rest of the money she said was in halfpence; when I was searched all that was found on me was one shilling and two sixpences in silver; I never was out of the place; there were other lodgers in the house besides me.</p>

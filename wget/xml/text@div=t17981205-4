               <p>Kennedy. I searched the box a second time, and found this pen-case in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp.(To Mrs. Fancourt.) Q. These things that are produced, you say are like several that you have? - A. Yes.</p>

            Therefore you do not mean absolutely to swear to their being your property, but that they are like your's? - A. I mean to swear that they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many others of the same quality come from India? - A. Yes; they were made under my inspection.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a black servant, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She was employed by the prisoner to wash? - A. Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner? - A. As my cook, and to wash my morning gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that black girl might give her these things to wash without your knowledge, you cannot say? - A. I cannot swear that, but I should think it impossible.</p>
               <p>- HAYMAN sworn. - I live in Golden-square, Mrs. Fancourt lodges at my house, I was present at the opening of the prisoner's box, when these things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box under lock and key of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I saw her open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been, previous to that, charged with taking any property of Mrs. Fancourt's? - A. No. On the 9th of November my servant complained that she had lost several articles of her own wearing-apparel, and upon hearing that, with Mrs. Fancourt's leave, I called all the servants together, and the prisoner's box was the first thing that was opened, and upon its being opened, Mrs. Fancourt found these things belonging to her; the watchman was called in, and we gave charge of her, with the property, to the watchman; some of my servant's things were found in the room, but not in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There were other persons in the house who had access to that room besides her? - A. I understood it always to be kept locked.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after you had challenged all the servants in the house, that you went up and found these things in the box? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was acquainted that her box was to be searched? - A. Yes, with the other servants.</p>
               <p>Q. And she then gave you the key, and opened the box? - A. She hesitated very much before she did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not at that time say, that she had received them from the black girl? - A. She did not acknowledge to have received all of them from the black girl; the petticoat was the first thing taken out; she said she had that from the black girl to wash; with respect to the handkerchiefs, she said they were things not fit to be looked at, implying that they were foul linen, but they were not.</p>

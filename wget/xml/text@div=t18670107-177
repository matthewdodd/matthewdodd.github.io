I am a widow, and superintendent of the Infant Nur<lb></lb>sery, Parson's Green—I knew William Lutman the last eleven years as a neighbour—on the 2nd or 3rd November I heard a disturbance in the street, and went to the door—I saw the prisoner and the deceased together—I heard the son demand some money, two shillings I think, which the father had borrowed—he said, "If you don't give it to me, you old—, I'll murder you this night"—the father said, "I have not got it"—the prisoner then said, "You old d—, if you don't give it to me I'll knock you down"—with that he fetched him a blow, and repeated the blow again—the deceased fell against the kerbstone sideways, and, from what I could</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 27, Park Road, Fulham—I was called to attend William Lutman on Sunday morning, the 4th November—he was weak and faint, and had lost a great deal of blood—there was a large deep scalp wound on the back of his head, which laid bare the bone—I dressed the wound—he came to my surgery afterwards—the wound was such as might have been caused by what has been described by the first witness—he must have fallen with considerable violence: the cut was through the scalp.</p>

On the 12th November I was a surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I saw William Lutman when he was brought in, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock in the morning—there was a wound on the back of his head, with suppuration beneath the scalp—he went on very well till the 25th November—symptoms of blood-poison set in on that day—he died on the 1st December—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was blood-poison, occasioned by the absorption of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> into the system—the original cause was not a doubt the scalp wound.</p>

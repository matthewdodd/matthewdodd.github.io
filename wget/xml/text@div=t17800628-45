His comrade, who was with him, said, he would not take less than a shilling. I said then I would give him nothing; and if he did not go away I would charge a constable with him. The prisoner said, he would not go, and if I did not give him something he would break my windows. I said I would give him nothing; he lifted up the bar and said, if I did not he would cleave me down. The postman was in the shop at the time delivering me a letter; he advised me to give him three-pence, which I did. The prisoner was secured immediately. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Cook's, No. 61, the next door to Mr. Rowton. I was standing at the door; the prisoner passed by crying No Popery. I saw him go to Mr. Rowton; I heard him say if Mr. Rowton did not give him more money he would cleave him down with the iron bar which he had in his hand. This is the bar (producing it). I laid hold of the bar and took it out of his hand; it fell on the stones and I secured him. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor. I know nothing about it; I did not know where I was when I was taken. I came from Ruport-street, in the morning, to the Bell Savage-inn for some linen, my wife washes for the inn. I staid drinking till about twelve o'clock, and got in liquor. Then I went to the Magpye and had some more liquor; as I was going up Holbourn I saw this bar by Middle-row; I took it up, and seeing these people in the shop I asked them to give me some money to buy me some beer, for I had spent all I had.</p>

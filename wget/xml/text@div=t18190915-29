I went there about a quarter after seven o'clock, and opened the door without making a noise, and saw Morton bringing part of a sack of buck wheat along the floor towards the door. I asked him what he was doing? he said he did not know. I then saw Townsend and Dick on the same floor, filling sacks from the bulk; before they saw me they were bringing sacks towards the door, where four other full sacks had been placed. I asked them if they had any orders to fill the sacks? Townsend said he knew nothing about it. I asked if Dick had any orders? Dick immediately made his escape down, through the cellar. I got Morton and Townsend together, and asked them why they were putting it up without any order, or a meter to attend them? Morton said,</p>
               <p>"We have done wrong, let us shoot it back to the bulk." I said they should not move it unless they called Dick back; I got assistance, and had the prisoners secured. The sacks were not our's, they contained eight quarters and three bushels of buck wheat, which corresponded with the bulk. They said it was of no use having a piece of work about it, and wanted to shoot it back. As soon as they saw me they dropped the sacks and concealed themselves. Corn cannot be delivered without an order.</p>

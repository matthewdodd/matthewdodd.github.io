On the 10th of April, about five minutes before eight o'clock, I came home to breakfast and opened the door with a key which I keep in my pocket, and found the prisoner at the foot of the stairs, the door was always kept shut; he was a perfect stranger. I asked what he did there, he said he had two boys sweeping the chimnies - he was dressed as a sweep. I called the servant up and asked if any sweeps were below; she said No, nor had she sent for any. I asked what business he had there; he said he came in after the boys. I desired him to turn out his pockets; he said, he had but one, he turned that out, and out fell a key, which I tried to my door, and it opened it; he said, he hoped I would forgive him. I gave him in charge. I went out at six o'clock in the morning and closed the outer door.</p>

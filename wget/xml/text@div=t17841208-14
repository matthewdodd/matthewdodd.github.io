               <p>I am servant to Mr. Smith, I was informed that Mr. Bailey had been robbed, Mr. Monk's coachman was at Mr. Monk's gate, I was standing with him, I joined in the pursuit of this man, I first saw him at Mr. Smith's gate, when he got to the edge, he leaped over the ha ha, into Mr. Smith's garden, I took him there, I found nothing on him, I searched him for arms, he produced the money at Mr. Byng's, I have not got the money, he demanded his money and had it, there was one halfpenny, which is a part of the money, and he produced seventeen shillings, two-pence and two farthings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long after the robbery was it that he was taken? - I believe not five minutes, he turned to the right, to get into the ha ha, in the garden.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw him, was he running in a path? - Yes, in a foot path that deople commonly go on from Hadley to Barnet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe the course he took, in his way towards where you took him from the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you next day, or at time any search in that course? - Yes, there was a pistol found.</p>
               <p>(The Pistol produced.)</p>
               <p>It was found near the place where he went over, on the field side.</p>
               <p>Was this pistol loaded? - It was not (The Prosecutor looks at it.) That was much such a one as this is, he put it in three different directions, he said afterwards it was a stick, not a pistol; when he was taken into Mr. Smith's house, he said that life was a precious thing, and that he hoped we would not be too severe with him, for as God was his judge it was his first attempt; when we came out I said to him cannot you trace your own footsteps here, he said what signifies troubling me I acknowledge I am the man that robbed you, I will give you your money again, and make you any acknowledgement, only be favourable to me.</p>

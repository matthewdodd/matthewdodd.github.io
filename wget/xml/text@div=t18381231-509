                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Soden, a baker in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. About ten o'clock, in the evening of the 1st of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked roe for two 4-lbs. new loaves—I weighed them, and placed them on the counter—he then asked for a 2-lb. stale one—while I was stooping down, to reach that, he took the other two off the counter, and ran out of the shop—I am sure he is the man—I called my husband out of the next room—he ran after him, and the prisoner was caught—the loaves were thrown down.</p>

I was at home—I heard the noise, ran out, and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor alter him—I at last caught him, and took him to the station-house—I said I did not know what was the charge, but the other man was coming—the prisoner said it was about a loaf—I said, "What made you run?"—he said he ran as others did—the prosecutor cattle to the station-house, and the loaf was brought there.</p>

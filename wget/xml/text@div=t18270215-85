            . I live at Chelsea, in the same house with the prisoner's mother. On the evening of the 17th of January, the prisoner came there, and showed me a brooch - she said it was worth 8s. 6d., and she was going to take it to Cadogan-place; I told her, if her employer had sent her to carry it there, she should wrap it up - the next morning she had it open again, and I said she would break it, and then have to pay for it - the same evening I saw her at a pawnbroker's, in Sloane-street, and heard her say she had brought a ring, and she wanted a brooch- a girl, of the prisoner's acquaintance, brought these articles to where I live, and gave some account to the prisoner's mother, and said, "A pretty piece of work your daughter has brought us into - there is fourteen years transportation for us, and seven for your daughter."</p>

I am an engine-driver, of 9, Edward Street, York Road, Lambeth—on 21st July about 9.20 p.m. I was at Hounslow coming along the main road to London, and saw the prisoner and a woman sitting by the roadside eating bread and butter, and wrangling—the prisoner said "You have cost me lots of money"or "cost me pounds, and I will do for you to<lb></lb>night"—he said that he came out of prison that morning—I walked on about 100 yards, and then heard the woman's voice call "Murder!"—I looked down the road, and saw the woman in a half-kneeling position—I returned, and saw the prisoner kick her on her side once just as I got there—I was then five or six yards off—it was then about 9.30—she was on the grass on the side of the road—she fell on one side, and did not speak, and never moved any more—I said "Don't you kick the woman again"—he said "What is that to do with you"—I said "It is to do with me"—a sergeant of the 18th Lancers came up, who sent a militiaman for a constable, and the prisoner sat down by the woman, and put her head on his knee—she never moved at all—two constables brought a stretcher in about an hour and a half, and took the body away after a doctor had seen it—there were two doctors—they said that she was dead—the prisoner had been drinking—it was not exactly a violent kick, but it was rather hard; I should not have liked it; you could kick anybody harder.</p>

On the night of 21st July about 8.45 I was called to the Light Horse, Staines Road, Hounslow, and found a woman there drunk and disorderly, whom I know now as the deceased—I at last turned her out of the house, and asked the prisoner to take her away as I understood he was her husband—he was not the worse for drink—I asked him if it was his wife—he said "Yes, and my name is Henry Lock; we live at Halliford"—they left together in the direction of Bedfont—on the same night, about 10.10, I received information, went to Dockwell Lane, half a mile from the public-house, and saw the woman lying down with her head resting on the prisoner's legs—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Oh, she is drunk again"—I asked him if he could get her away—he said that he would try—I did not see her move—I found she was perfectly helpless—I did not know that she was dead—she smelt very strongly of drink, and I sent for a stretcher, which came about 11.20, and she was carried on it to the Huzzar beershop—while the people had gone for the stretcher Taylor told me in the prisoner's hearing that at 9.30 he had seen him kick her. in the side or the stomach—the prisoner said nothing then—I struck a lucifer, examined the woman, and found she did not move—the prisoner said "If she dies, and I think she is <hi rend="italic">a going</hi>, I shall say she died from heart disease, for she told mo a fortnight ago when she went she should go all in a moment; but she is drunk, she has been drinking run all day; she will be all right when she has had her sleep out, she often lays like that for four or five hours"—before the stretcher came, Dr. Evans came and reported that she was dead—the prisoner is a dealer, gathering rags and bones—I saw this knife on the ground.

I am a surgeon of Hounslow—I was called about 12.30 on this night and found the deceased by the side of the road—she had been dead about an hour—she was carried to a public-house, where I examined her, but found no marks of violence—I have since made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found a tumour on the liver—it was not a drunkard's liver—there was also disease of the lungs, heart, and blood-vessels—from the state in which I found the heart a kick would have a tendency to produce death—I think the immediate cause of death was syncope, a fatal fainting—any shock to the system would produce syncope, either physical violence or mental excitement, in the state in which she was, but she might have died suddenly at any time independent of any external cause—if she had been kicked and died immediately I should not expect to find a mark.</p>

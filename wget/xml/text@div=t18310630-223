On the 26th of May, between ten and eleven in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop; I saw my wife serving him; he had dealt at the shop - when he went to pay for what he bought, she said he had some that did not belong to him; I was going up to him, and he took nine pieces of leather out of his pocket- he threw them down in the window; I collared him immediately - he tried to get away, and I had some difficulty to detain him till the Police-officer came - this is the leather - it is my property; my wife had not served him with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. He had dealt with you before? A. Yes, for small quantities - he put a shilling on the counter for what he had bought that day.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner to the office - in going along he offered me a sovereign; at least he pretended to do it; he held his hand down, and said, "There is not one coming, take it, and I will soon he out of the way;" when I got him to Marlborough-street he ran away, put I pursued, and took him - he acknowledged at the office that he had done it.</p>

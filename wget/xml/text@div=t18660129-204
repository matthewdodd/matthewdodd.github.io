                  </hi>. I live at 1, John-street, Homerton—the pri<lb></lb>soner was a fellow-workman with me at Mr. Waite's, Camomile-street—on 5th January, shortly after two o'clock, we had a small quarrel—it was the first we ever had in our lives—there was some dispute about some work that had been done—I told him I thought he had wound some shutters up the wrong way—he said that I was a liar—I told him that if he repeated that I would give him a pat on the head—he did repeat it and I struck him—he then took up a hammer and threw it at me—it struck me and I fell—directly afterwards he appeared very sorry and tried to pick me up, but I would not let him—the hammer was on my anvil—it weighs about 4<hi rend="italic">lbs</hi>.—I was taken to the hospital—I freely forgive him—it was done in the height of passion—we never quarrelled before—I do not believe he intended to hurt me.<hi rend="smallCaps">

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and medical assistant at West<lb></lb>minster Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there about a fortnight ago, in the evening, between 8 o'clock and 12 or 1, I cannot recollect exactly, as there are sometimes a dozen of these cases in the course of the evening—he had an incised wound across the nose, from one cheek to the other—it was rather deep on the left cheek, but was not bleeding very copiously—I put in three sutures, and strapped it up—it was exactly the sort of cut that might have been caused by a razor—I did not probe it, and do not know whether the cartilage was injured—I have not seen him since—the wound was continuous, and was exactly as if a razor had been stroked across the face—it would require considerable force to do it, because it went right into the muscles—it will disfigure him to a certain extent, there is a little scar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's husband, unfortunately—we live at No. 30, Gardner's-lane, York-street, Westminster—I was in work at this time, I had been at work at two different shops that week—on Satur<lb></lb>day evening I got home about 10 minutes after 6 o'clock—I then had tea, and went out to market with my wife—coming home, about a quarter to 9 o'clock, there was a public house, and my wife said, "Go in here;" we did so—I drank a drop, she began to get quarrelsome, and in about five or ten minutes I left the beer on the table, and went home, and she followed me—I got home close upon 10 o'clock—I was sober, I had had a share of two pints with a shopmate of mine, at the King's Arms, at Pimlico—I went out after tea, and met a woman, who paid for some gin, and I had some of it, and then I had the beer at the Adam and Eve—I was in liquor, but was not tipsy; it did not deprive me of my senses—the prisoner told me that she had had a drop of gin extra; she was excited—when she got home she began to quarrel with me because she did not have sufficient money—I said that I had not any more to give her, and said, "I will not stand here and wrangle with you, I will go out and leave you"—she laid hold of my coat, and tore it off my back; I pushed her, and she laid hold of my trowsers, and tore them; I went to the street door—I was having my trowsers pinned up, the land<lb></lb>lady opened the door, and I opened my door in the passage; that was about ten minutes after my wife tore my clothes—while talking to the landlady, my wife came out of my room, put her hand over the landlady's right shoulder, with a razor in it, drew it over my face, and said, "There, you b—, take that"—I had not struck her, I only pushed her when she tore my coat off—I was taken to a druggist's shop, and I must have bled a quart of blood there, and a great deal going along—I afterwards saw a razor in the possession of the constable; it was kept in a shaving box on top of a shelf in the room where my wife lodged with me, and was there that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, living at No. 17, Blue Anchor-yard, Westminster. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner go into their house on this Saturday night, at a few minutes after 10 o'clock—I heard him ask her for the keys—she said, "Wait a minute"—they got into the passage, and then he got hallooing out, and said, "I will not stop here to be annoyed by a mad person like you"—she said, "Go on, go on," and he shut the door, and there was quarrelling—the prisoner did not appear to be in liquor, or excited by liquor; she might have been drinking by the way she went on—the lodger up stairs then came, and said, "Mrs. Dougherty, why do not you let the man alone?" and he came out, with bis coat and trowsers torn—the landlady came in about ten minutes, from her own house, next door but one; I saw him talking to her, and in from five to eight minutes the prisoner came out into the passage—the landlady said, "Come in doors; do not let anybody in the street hear what we are talking about"—the prisoner put her hand over the landlady's shoulder, with something bright in it; she drew it across his face, and he came out running, saying, "Here, look what my wife has done"—he walked to the doctor's, and she came out, wiped her hands on her apron, and said, "There must have been a man in the passage"—I said, "No; you did it yourself"—she said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Piff</hi>; I will serve you the same"—at that time she did not appear excited by liquor.</p>

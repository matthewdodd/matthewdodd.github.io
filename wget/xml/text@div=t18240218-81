The prisoner Milford was in my service for three years; she gave me notice to quit on the 4th of November, to spend Christmas with her friends, and was to return to me again. I paid her her wages on the 4th of December; she took her boxes and left on that evening, and was to return into my service; she called next evening and had tea, and went off in the evening. A trunk, containing this property, was always kept in her room, locked. On the 16th of January it was unlocked in my presence, and four sheets, two pairs of pillowcases, three tablecloths, a white cotton night-gown, and a silk handkerchief, were missing. I apprehended her in the street, and found a silk handkerchief on her person which was taken from the trunk; nobody could get to it but her. A pair of shoes were found in her box, and one silk handkerchief was taken from another part of the house. I told her I wanted her on some business which I dare say she guessed; she said she knew nothing about it. The officer came up, and asked where she lodged? She said in Dock-street, and took us there. I found the shoes in her box; I asked if she knew anything of the property - she said she did not, but that

               <p>"I never should have thought of doing this, if it had not been for you, and to you alone I attribute all this misfortune." They found fault with each other. Young said the property was pawned, but she had lost her pocket the day before with the duplicates in it, but she would go and make an affidavit, and get the property back. They were taken to Lambeth-street Office. Young took me round to seven or eight different pawnbrokers, where she said she had pawned the property, and I found my goods pawned there.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lambeth-street. I went with Farley - his account is correct. I took a silk handkerchief off Milford's neck, and found a pair of shoes in her box; I got a pair of pillowcases from Reynolds, a pawnbroker, at Ratcliff-highway - Young took me there, and round to all the pawnbrokers; I get a tablecloth from Harris, Commercial-road; a sheet from Kennedy - she took me to all these places. I found two duplicates in Milford's box for goods pawned at Reynolds's, and one in Young's drawer, for property pawned at Hull's.</p>

            . This handkerchief is mine, and was in the trunk, and the other in the house. All the property produced is mine. The value of all that I lost is 3 l. and more. I am certain they were all in my house on the 24th of December, and on that night I left her alone in care of the premises, while I and my wife went out. Young came to my house twice, to inquire for Milford. I asked what she wanted; she made no reply.</p>

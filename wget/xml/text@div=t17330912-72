            . Between 7 and 8 on Saturday Morning, the 1st of September, the Prisoner came to Mr. Nowell's Stables in George-Yard, Westminster, with a bay Gelding with a bald Face and white Leg. The Horse was very dirty quite up his Sides, with clay Dirt, and his Hocks were so cover'd with Grass-purging, occasion'd by hard Riding, that I could scarce get it off. The Prisoner came several times afterwards, and ordered Corn for the Horse; but on Monday last, this honest Man - Court. What honest Man?</p>
               <p>Greenaway.

            . On the 6th of September, the Prisoner proffer'd to sell me this Horse, and next Day rode him out, to see how I lik'd him, and riding thro' Smithfield, I was follow'd home. I was to have given 5 Guineas for him, and had appointed the Prisoner to come to me at 3 a Clock, and when he came I took him up. He told me he had had the Horse 6 Months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I said I had not had him above 5 or 6 Months. - I bought him about 7 a Clock in the Morning, on Saturday was se'nnight. For, going along Holbourn, near the End of Red-Lion-Street, there was a Countryman about selling this Horse to an other Man, but they not agreeing about the Price, I bought him myself for 4l. 10s. for which I paid the Countryman at the Alehouse the Corner of Red-Lion-Street; but the Horse proving too heavy for my Use, I thought to sell him again. There were several by when I bought the Horse and paid for him, and they promis'd to appear for me, but none of them are come yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Loraine-place, Holloway. On Thursday the 27th of August I drove home in a phaeton—on arriving at Is—lington turnpike I found the back of the phaeton open, and a box containing these dresses, gone—they were mine—I had seen them safe about twenty minutes before—it was impossible they could have fallen out—on the following Monday I saw one of the dresses on Mrs. Castiglione, at a Dahlia show, at Rotherhithe—I spoke to her, and gave her in charge—here is the dress—it is mine.</p>

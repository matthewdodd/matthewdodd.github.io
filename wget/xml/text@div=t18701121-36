                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Malley, and live at 24, Hill Street—a week before Whitsuntide, the prisoners came and lodged at my house—they occupied a room on the second-floor—they had two children, one about eight, and the other between three and four—shortly after they came, the female prisoner was delivered of a child—she was not delivered at my house—she came back about a week afterwards, very much intoxicated, with a female child; she was too tipsy to carry it, she fell on the stairs with it—when she was out, I used to go up and tell the little boy to give it food—she was in the habit of going out and leaving the child for hours—one day she left it a whole day with the little boy—I used to go up and see the child—it was in a very horrible state, cold and wretched—no fire or food for it—I said to the female prisoner, "If you look after that child now, you will get out of trouble; but if not, you will get into a great deal of trouble"—she was tipsy then—I Used to tell her the poor little thing was delicate, and wanted looking after—that was all I told her—the said she never suckled any of her children, but brought them up by bottle—I gave information to a policeman, and on the 5th October, I went with him into the room where the child was—only the little boy was there, the other little child and the baby—it was in a very bad condition, very wet, miserable, and cold—I showed him the poor little thing's under-clothes, they were dreadfully wet, and in a frightful state, and the little thing was a mere skeleton—the little boy went out, and the female prisoner came in almost directly—a doctor called the next day and saw the child, and it was afterwards taken to the workhouse—when the prisoner came home, and the policeman remonstrated with her, she took the baby out—I. don't know where—it was sent for by the workhouse authorities shortly after that.</p>

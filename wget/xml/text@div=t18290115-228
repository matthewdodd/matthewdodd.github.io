               <p>SAMUEL BUBB. I am errand-boy to Mr. Barnett. I was standing facing his window, to mind some baskets; I saw three lads round the window - the prisoner pulled out his hand, and had something in it; I ran after him, and a gentleman caught him just past the window - nothing was found on him; he threw it down, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What were you doing? A.Minding some baskets - I had never seen him before, he had a hat on; I did not notice whether it was a hat or a cap; I looked at the other boys as well - the whole business took a minute or two; I did not loose sight of him - no one told me to say that it was not day-light; it was not a black cap he had on - it was a hat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Do you believe now, that he is the man? A. Yes, I know he is the man.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ALLEN. I was going up the road and saw the ribbon lay; a woman took it up and was putting it under her cloak; I said to Mr. Barnett "Does this belong to you?" and the woman passed the ribbon from her hand to mine to give to the prosecutor; I turned round, and she was gone; I did not see the prisoner - they were running after him.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer. I heard Stop thief! called, and was sent for to take the prisoner, who was then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What they have said is false, you may depend upon it; I was walking down Baker's-row, and was taken by two men who are not here.</p>

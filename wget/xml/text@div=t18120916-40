               <p>Q. How long did she live with you - A. She came in the month of February or March, I cannot say which. During the time she so lived with me, I have at various times missed quantities of linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man - A. No, I am not. Of course nobody in the house but her and her husband could take it. He resided in the house with her.</p>
               <p>Q.What is her husband - A. I believe he was formerly a soldier. I discharged her on the 22d of last month for some irregularities. On the Thursday following, the 27th of the same month, the prisoner came to my house to fetch the remainder of the things that she had left behind her. After some conversation that relates to other matters I charged her with having robbed me. She confessed that she had robbed me. Afterwards I found some of the goods. I sent for a constable, and she was taken to the compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You indicted the husband - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, whether the husband or the woman took the things, certainly you cannot tell - A. Certainly, I cannot</p>

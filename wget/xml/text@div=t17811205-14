On the 27th of November, upon opening a box where I kept ruffles and other things, I found they were not there, this was sometime the latter end of last month. I desired to know where they were, what she had done with them. She told me they were in another box in another closet. I desired her to bring them to me, she did not.</p>
               <p>What reason did she assign? - That she did not know where they were, and she appeared confused. I asked if she had pawned them, she said she had.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to suspect her before? - At the time I had no suspicion. I asked her if she had pawned the ruffles. I told her if she had, she must have pawned other things, and I begged to know what they were, and where they were.</p>
               <p>What did she say to that? - She said she could give me no account, but if I would give her three weeks, she would find a friend to get out all the things. I understood it in that light; I cannot remember the words; I asked her who this friend was, what was her expression? - If I would give her three weeks she would find a friend to get out all the things; I then told her she had trifled with me, and I could not be trifled with any longer; I would send for Mr. Bingham, at whose house she lived, who recommended her.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Bingham? - He is a hosier in the Strand; when Mr. Bingham came I told him what had passed in the morning; he asked if I had any objection to his speaking to her alone; I said no; they went and spoke together, and after some little altercation, she delivered up the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Do you know the things? - If they are produced I shall know them.</p>

               <p>What reason had you to suppose she, Brown, had the duplicates? - From what her mistress told me.</p>

               <p>(The duplicates were produced, and shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Court. Are those the duplicates of the things? - I believe so; I did not tell them, I gave them to Miss Thistlethwayte, I did not go to the pawn-broker's, all I did was to receive them from the hands of Brown, and give them to Miss Thistlethwyte.</p>
               <p>You asked her how she came to pawn them? - I did; she said it was through necessity.</p>
               <p>Do you remember going with Mrs. Brown to the House of Taconet? - Yes, the same evening; it was about three or four in the same afternoon I was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bayswater, and am a fish-factor, carry<lb></lb>ing on business in Thames Street as Overall, Son &amp; Co.—I have no partner—I had three policies of insurance on the Agatha for 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one with Lloyds Underwriters for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the second with the Archangel Marine Insur<lb></lb>ance for 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the third with the Imperial Marine for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 17th November I received information of the loss of the vessel, and on 27th I addressed this letter to the defendant to recover the monies on the policies. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:"27th November, 1875. To Messrs. Tatlock Brothers, St. Michael's, Corahill. Gentlemen,—Herewith we hand you the necessary documents for recovering the amount insured upon Agatha (Lericls:), with list of same, which please sign and return per bearer. S. Overall, Son &amp; Co.") I received back the list signed—this is the receipt—on 10th January I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:" To Overall, Son &amp; Co. 10th January.

Tatlock Brothers.") Two or three days after that I applied personally to the defendant for the money, and again in a few days, and on the third occasion he came and saw me; I think that was between the 17th and 21st January—he said he would try and let me have 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday following—I think the 17th was Monday, and on the following day I called on him, and asked him for the money—he said he could not let me have it, but he would let me know on Thursday how much he could let me have by Saturday—I then got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> 20th January, 1876. Dear Sirs,—We fear we shall be unable to exceed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the loss by the above-named vessel on Saturday next. Tatlock Brothers.") On the receipt of that I went and saw him again, I think on that same day—I said I was surprised that he had not handed me over the money—he said "We could not carry on our business if we had to pay immediately"—I said "Let me have the policies then"—he went to a safe and rummaged the safe and said "Oh, the offices have kept the two policies"—I said "The offices would not have kept them if they had not paid them, I presume"—he said "They have not paid them; they have settled with me in account"—I said "You should not have settled my loss in your account; you should have taken the money, and handed it over to me"—he then went to another safe, and found the third policy, which was the policy underwritten at Lloyds, and that he handed over to me—I said "Can't you give me some of this money"—he said "No, I really can<lb></lb>not "—1 then went to the two offices, the Marine and the Archangel—I received some information from them, upon which I immediately put the matter in the hands of Mr. Beard, my solicitor—I appeared at the Mansion House and gave evidence on this prosecution—I did not receive notice of the prisoner's liquidation until after he had been at the Mansion House—I have never proved on that estate, and have not received a shilling of the 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

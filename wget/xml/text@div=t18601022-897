                  </hi>. I live at Deptford, and am a smith—the prisoner lodged in my house about six weeks—her bed room was the front room up stairs—my bed room was the back room on the same floor—there is a cup<lb></lb>board in my bed room—On 6th September, my wife cleared that cupboard out, and this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought down to me—there were five sovereigns in it—I saw it after it was put into the cupboard—the sovereigns were in it, in a large piece of paper—the box fastens with a spring, which fastens the lid down—I saw it safe that night—I came home about 8 o'clock at night, on Monday, 8th October—I saw the prisoner and my wife; they called out, "There has been thieves in the house"—I went up stairs to my room and looked in the cupboard, and missed the box—the prisoner asked me to go in her room—I went in and found the contents of two or three boxes strewed about the room, and she told me she had lost two shirts and a white shirt—I went to the police-station and brought a constable; we went up stairs and searched the cupboard together—I did not see anything wrapped in a piece of paper—I must have seen it if it had been there—the prisoner asked the constable to go into her room; she told him she bad lost two shirts, and a blue shirt not made up—On the Tuesday morning, the box was brought to me by a fellow-workman, whom I saw pick it up about forty yards from my house—it appeared to have been there all night, because it</p>

               <p>had some dewdrops on the top of the lid—the lid was on one side—On Wednesday night, I came home at half-past 5 o'clock—the prisoner beckoned me, and asked if I was going to work again; I said "Yes"—she said "I want you to go for a walk with me, but don't say a word about it to any one"—I went with her, and we went to the William the Fourth public-house, in Flagon-row—we went in and sat down together, and she began talking about the clothes she had lost—she said "The clothes were not stolen; I gave them to my brother last Sunday week, because he was very badly off"—she then told me she had strewed the things about her room and mine to make it appear that a robbery had taken place, that her husband, or the man she lives with, might think they were stolen—I asked her how she did it—she said she came to my room and asked my wife to go for a walk with her, and she had consented, that she then went up stairs to take her bonnet and shawl, and went into my bed-room and took the box containing the money, and also my coat, and that she had dropped it on the stairs, and had dropped the box while I was talking with my wife—she told me I should find the money safe wrapped in a paper in one corner of the cupboard—from what I heard of the superstition of the prisoner, I told her it was very fortunate for her that she had told me about it, for my wife had been persuaded to go to London to see the astrologer, she would give him half-a-crown and he would tell her where the money was—she said "Do you really think the astrologer could tell her where the money was?"—I said "Yes, of course he could"—she said "Then the devil must be in him"—I left the public-house with the prisoner, and I came home and went up stairs and looked in the cupboard, and saw this piece of paper which contained four sovereigns—if this paper had been there when I searched the cupboard I must have seen it—it is the same paper that I had put the money in—the money was wrapped and folded in the paper when I put it in, and it was screwed up afterwards—I brought it down to the prisoner, and said, "There are only four sovereigns"—she made use of very abusive language, and said, "The other sovereign must be in the box"—I told her it was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—On Saturday, 6th October, I put the box in the cupboard about 5 o'clock—there were five sovereigns in it, wrapped in a piece of paper—I took the box from my husband, and put it in the cupboard—I did not take anything out of it—I never opened the box—I know it was there on Monday, I saw it safe about 5 o'clock in the evening—on the evening of 8th October the prisoner asked me if I would go for a walk—I said I had no objection to do so when I had put my children to bed—she asked me if I had my bonnet and shawl down stairs—I said, "Yes"—she said she would go up and put her bonnet and shawl on—she went up—I put my bonnet and shawl on and went out with her, and returned a little before 8—when I got back I found my husband's coat on the stairs—she said, "What is there?"—I put my hand and felt, and thought it was like a coat—I said it was my husband's coat—I went upstairs, and went in the first place to the cup<lb></lb>board, and the box was missing—the prisoner went into her room and said her things had been taken—immediately my husband came in I called him up stairs, and said everything was gone—he came and looked in the cupboard for some time, and I asked him to go for the police—on the Wednesday, about 1 or 2 o'clock, after dinner, the prisoner came to my room, and saw my husband's things on the table—I said to her, "My husband is gone to the magistrate again, he won't let this matter rest;" and I said I should go to an astrologer—she said, "I would not do so on any account, I should be frightened at an astrologer."</p>

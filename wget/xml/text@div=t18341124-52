On the 25th of October, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, a person gave me information—I went out, and saw a man running along the New-road with these blinds—I pursued—he turned down Gloucester-place, and I lost sight of him—he threw down these window blinds, and I took them up—they are my master's—the prisoner was taken in a few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Host, a butcher, of High Street, Wandsworth—on 31st January, before dinner time, I served the prisoner with 1lb. 20z. of pork, which came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she gave me a half<lb></lb>crown, I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the half-crown in my pocket, where there was only small coin—afterwards, about two o'clock the same day, she came in for half a pound of steak, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a half-crown—I gave her a florin and a penny, and then told her it was a bad half-crown, she said, "Do not deface it, I know where I took it from"—I gave it back to her, and she gave me a good one—after she left I examined the first half-crown, showed it to a constable, and gave him instructions—he came back with the prisoner, and I told her that she bought 11b. of pork before dinner, and gave me a bad half-crown—she said, "Before dinner?"—I gave the first half-crown to the constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 129 <hi rend="italic">V</hi>). On 31st January, a little after two o'clock, I received information, and found the prisoner at the King's Head, Wandsworth, sitting in a corner of the parlour with an open purse and a half-crown in her hand—I took hold of the half-crown, and said, "Have you got any more of this kind about you?"—she said, "Do you know, I was just looking at it"—I told her she was charged with passing a bad half-crown before dinner, at the butcher's—she said that she had not been to any butcher's shop before dinner—I look her to the shop, and Mrs. Rost said, "You gave me a bad half-crown before dmaer, for that bit of pork you bought of me"—she said that she did not—I showed the half-crown I took to Mr. Rost; she said, "Here is'the mark of my teeth on it," and gave me another—I asked the prisoner where she lived, she said that she should not tell me—I took her to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the female searcher showed you what she found on her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a good florin and one penny—the prisoner did not say that she did not know the half-crown was bad; she said, "I was just looking at it"—I believe I have said before to-day that she said she had not been to the shop. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition, being ready stated</hi>: "She said, 'I did not know it was bad.'") She did not say that to my knowledge—it was in reference to the half-crown in her hand that she said, "I was just looking at it."</p>

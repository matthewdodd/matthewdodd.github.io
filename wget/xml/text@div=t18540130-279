                  </hi>. I am barman at the Long-acre coffee house, Long<lb></lb>acre. On 16th Jan., about a quarter to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb></lb>soner came for a pint of porter; it came to two pence, and he gave me a six-pence—I gave him change, and put it into the till; there was no other six-pence there—I went to the till about five minutes afterwards, nobody had been to it in the meantime, and there was no other sixpence there; I found that it was bad, put it on the hob by the fire, and watched till it melted—he came again, about a quarter to 6 o'clock in the evening, asked for three-halfpennyworth of gin, and gave me a shilling; it was bad—I went round the counter, shut the door, and sent for a policeman—I asked the prisoner if he was not ashamed of himself to come twice in one day—he said he had not been near the house before—I am certain he is the man who had come in the morning—I gave him in charge with the shilling.</p>

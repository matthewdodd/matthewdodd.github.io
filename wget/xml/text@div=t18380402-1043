                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Armour, a cabinet-maker, of Old Cavendish-street. The prisoner was my servant six weeks—we lost several articles—I acquainted her with it, not suspecting her—she said, she knew nothing about them—I gave her permission to go out to tea on the 18th of March—she returned about twelve o'clock the following day—in consequence of her not returning that night, I unlocked her box with a key of my own—I was not aware of its fitting it—my laundress was present—I found in the prisoner's box a table-cloth, two chamber articles, some towels, and various other goods and broken glass—I have no doubt it was broken by accident, and then concealed there—the articles could not have been there for the use of the house—I found some remnants of silk, part of a gown—the prisoner was coming in just as I was searching the box—I took her to the box—when I told her what I had found, she said she knew nothing of it—they are not things which intercepted between their use and going to the wash—she had not given them out to the wash—she gave me no explanation.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Pancras, and was returning with my wife from the Lyceum Theatre, and saw the prisoner try the prosecutor's pocket, feeling it with his hand; he then stept aside, and I saw the corner of the prosecutor's handkerchief hanging out of his pocket. In crossing the gateway, I saw the prisoner take it quite out. I secured him, and my wife informed the prosecutor - we took him to a public-house, and found it in his bosom.</p>

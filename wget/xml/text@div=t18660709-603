                  </hi>. I live at 3, Munster Street, Regent's Park, and am an oilman—on Saturday morning, 9th June, I heard my fowls making a great noise in the back yard, at about half-past three o'clock—I went to sleep again—I got up about half-past seven or twenty minutes to eight, and found the front kitchen, door broken open—that is an outer door—it leads from the yard into the kitchen—the padlock of the fowl house was broken, and I missed 14 fowls, which I had seen safe at half-past one in the night—I saw them at the police-station dead, and knew them directly—the kitchen door leads into the dwelling-house;—a person would be obliged to go that way to steal the fowls—I had barricaded one way—I did not know the prisoner before—two inner doors were broken besides the outer one, which would enable him to get at the fowls.</p>

On 9th June I was on duty in Fitzroy Square about four in the morning, and saw the prisoner carrying a bag—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Look for yourself," and threw it off his shoulder—I found 14 fowls in it, which had been recently killed—they were hot—I took him to the station, and said, "Where did you get them?"—he made no answer.</p>

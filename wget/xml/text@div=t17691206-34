               <p>Poor. On the beginning of August I went to bed about ten o'clock. I cannot take upon me to give a particular account of the day; it was on a Tuesday, at night. My wife and I had been about an hour and an half in bed: I could not, nor did not sleep; but we lay and slumbered. We heard a great noise of people coming up stairs; they came thundering and rapping at the outward door of the house. At the passage coming in, they cried out,

            , you old whore, open the door! Poor, you son of a whore, open the door! or we will break it in. My wife said, My dear, stay in bed, and don't get up, for they will have more tenderness and mercy on a woman than on a man. I thought to get up, but she would not let me. They kept still crying, Blast you! you whore! you roghe! let us in! or we will tear down the door. Gentlemen, said she, have patience, give me leave to put on my petticoats; for you don't know whether I have a smock on. Blast your eyes! said they again, you never was without one. They kept rapping at the door before she would give them entrance. Gentlemen, at last, said she, be easy, and I will open the door. Then she came out and opened the door. We lay up one-pair-of stairs. She did not go down stairs after we came out of our chamber. Our street door is on our right hand, within about two feet of the chamber door. We heard them come up stairs; there is no outward door; they kept thundering at my room door. There is no fastening but only my room door. You come up one-pair-of stairs, the door is right before you. When the door is open, there is a little passage on the right hand to go into the shop by my room. I can't tell how many came in; but I can tell how many went out. I saw them all go out. They went into the shop where all the looms and work were. I did not go up till I heard the weight stones fall. Then I went and held my room door in my hand. My wife was then in the shop with them. I believe the stones fell in about two minutes after they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the jury the use of the weight-stones.</p>
               <p>Poor. They are to keep the work stiff to work. The weight is hung to the cane roll. I believe there may be about three quarters of a hundred weight, or near a hundred weight upon the roll.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they continue in the work shop?</p>
               <p>Poor. I believe they were there about eight or ten minutes. They past near me when they came out. I saw seven come out in the whole. The prisoner was one of them; he, and two more of them, came in about two steps into my chamber, and shook hands with my wife, and said, Good night, mother Poor. I am sure he was one of them, as sure as I am here. I had hold of the door at the time. My wife was standing just on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side does your door open, within or without?</p>
               <p>Poor. My door opens within side. I was just by the door, with my head looking out at the door, which was about half open; she came back out of the workshop when the first of them came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Poor. I have known him, I believe, about four years and a quarter. I have eat and drank in his company sundry and sundry times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in the house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060033"></xptr>Poor. No, I had not. I had only a large window. After this they all came down, and went out, and cryed out, Blast your eyes! are you all out? and fixed a shot. They spoke hoarse, like a boatswain of a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapons in the hands of them?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say there was light enough to distinguish their faces?</p>
               <p>Poor. There was: I saw them, in a manner the same, almost, as I see you now. I could not otherwise chose but see them. After they were gone, I struck a light, and went into the workshop. There were some pieces all lying about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner speak with a feigned voice, when he spoke to your wife?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, he did not, he spoke in a common way. I knew it to be his voice at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was every thing right when you went to bed the night before?</p>
               <p>Poor. They were all right and fit for working. The reed and things were all in their proper places, and when I went into the room, after they were gone, I found the work cut, hanging, some by one cord, and some by another. It was cut cross. It was bombazeen. The cane was all silk. Those things in my hand are what they call harness, that we work with, and this is the deed produced in court, the harness broke, the reed beat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there worsted in bombazeen?</p>
               <p>Poor. It is shot down with worsted. There was about half a yard or three quarters of a yard of it made. It was silk and worsted when made; that was rolled upon the roll; that that was cut was the warping, joining to that that was completely made; about a yard distance from that that was cut, consisted of all silk; that that was made and rolled on the roll, was then not worth a pin to make any use of it. It was not worth a penny to any one, without to any poor body to make a pinch of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call the harness a tool or a tackle?</p>
               <p>Poor. This is that that makes the work that goes up and down. We tread it up and down with out feet, and we strike the reed in at every shoot. They belong to Mr. Horton, and the silk belongs to him. The reed is not worth a pin now. They gave it a cut with a hanger, besides the beading of it. I found it worse than it is now. It was like the screw of a bottle. (probably he meant a cork-screw) I saw the prisoner after he was taken before Sir

               <p>Q. Did they see him?</p>
               <p>M.Poor. I do'nt know that: they knew he was there to be sure; they had cut the bombazeen, and hurt the harness and the reed; Duff bent that against his knee; then with his sword he took and gave it a scratch; it fell on the ground along with the harness, I think.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>M. Poor. The Lord stop me for it, if I did not. I met him after that in a place called Quaker's-street; I asked him if he would drink share of a pint of beer; he said, yes. We went into the Castle. I said, I wish I could see young Mahoney; he said, he wanted to see him too. I got up and left the pint of beer upon the table. I saw young Mahoney and his wife; he lived just facing the place. I went over and called him into the yard. I fetched him and his wife; we had another pint. I said to the prisoner, if you had gone through all London, I thought you would not have come to destroy me. He said he would not, or he could not save me (I think it was could not) if I was his sister. We had three pints of beer, which I paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make application to him after?</p>
               <p>M. Poor. Yes, several times; one day in particular he met me; it was about four or five days after, in Webb-square. He said, Do I meet you? my blood boils! I said, why? He said, I was at

             I applied so often to him it is almost hard for me to tell. About seven or eight days after the last day of August, my husband went to some of these men; he said, he was not at the cutting of them. I said to the prisoner it is so long ago my husband dare not work, and my curtains, and my bed, and things were all destroyed; What must I do? He said, I will speak to them, and do what is in my power.</p>

I mean the committee of weavers and cutters; and I related my distress; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060036"></xptr> gone to the committee several times; one time in particular I saw Horsford there, at the Duke of Northumberland's head, at the end of Gun-street; I went in with a journeyman of ours. I said, How do you do, Mr. Horsford? He said the same; he said, I want to speak to you, mother; I said, what do you want to say? said he, if you will be upstairs I'll tell you. I said, I have been called whore and b - h, I did not care to go up for such usage.</p>

Being asked how she came to be so flurried at the latter end and so cool at the beginning, she said knowing them all perfectly well she was not much frighted; that she was flurried upon seeing her bread going; she could not say she saw their weapons when they shook hands with her; that the last man that shook hands with her was Valline to the best of her knowledge; that Mahoney was the first, because he kept her with his hands till she came out of the shop with him; that the ninth of August, the next night, she did not go to bed at all, she was afraid of her life; that she could not directly tell the day of the month, she first gave information of the affair; she believed it might be a fortnight after. Being asked, when it was she was sent to Bridewell, she said she was sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell long and long and long after her goods were cut; that she was sent to Bridewell for assaulting Doyle and another; that before that she had not gone to a justice of the peace and given information; that she made the information the same night that she was sent to Bridewell; that she had spoke to other people about it, and she was both hungry and dry, and she begged of people to put her in the way of it; that at their cutting the work out, they said they would begin with Champion's the next night. Being asked what reason she had to think they would cut Mr. Horton's rather than Mr.Champion's work, she said there were two that worked for Mr. Champion, and they would save their own master's work; none of them worked for Mr. Horton; that she did not give notice to Mr. Champion, that his work was to be cut the next night, being afraid of her life; that she laid at Limehouse seventeen nights; that the shop was so light she could see to know a man's face; that she could not have seen a mouse or rat.

               <p>Barton. I declare to God he never was out of the house in that time, without he went out to make water; he was not missing five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did Horsford go?</p>
               <p>Barton. I can give no manner of account which way he went when he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose custody has this warrant been in since?</p>
               <p>Barton. It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person's name that was with you and Horsford?</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. WHAT is your reason for remembering the time?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. My particular reason for remembering the time, is, because Mr. Horton's foreman asked me if all was well; and afterwards said he had been at two or three places, and his master's work was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention where the work was cut?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. No, he did not; he said that night and that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation while together at the Well-and-bucket?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We talked of bailing the woman, he asked if we were house-keepers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know either of you before?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. He knew Horsford very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What other conversation had you?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. There were several things talked about. We talked sometimes about one thing, and sometimes about another.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We talked about Wilkes and trade. There was a gentleman, on the right side of the fire-place, talked about geograffee, or geograffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Were no relations talked about?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. Mr. Barton asked Mr. Horsford about his grandmother, or his wife's grandmother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I believe I paid part of it. I always do, if I have money. I am sure I paid some of it, but cannot recollect how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pots of beer had you?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you half a dozen?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We had, I believe, more than half a dozen. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Horsford pay part of the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I am certain he did, but do not remember what; I know the reckoning was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable pay any thing towards it?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I am not sure whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain as to knowing the time of the night?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I have a very good reason for knowing that, there being a moment hand, or second hand, upon the clock. I went and took observation of it while the hand was going round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060043"></xptr> one minute, then it was past one o'clock. I am certain it was ten minutes past and above.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? Was it dark or light?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was a very dark night. I don't think any one could distinguish any one's face that night. I could not know my father's face from my mother's at that time.

             called me up and waked me out of my sleep, and told me the work was cut in the shop. I did not believe it. I set up in my bed, then I went to the loom and felt. I could not see the loom, it was so dark. I felt the work was cut. I could not distinguish a man from a woman then. My shop-mate that lay with me, told me they had been gone half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see your Mistress that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I did not see her till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not speak to you soon after the cutters were gone?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, I am sure she did not. Clark came to me without a candle, in his shirt, and told me it was my shop mate's work, that lay in the bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that loom to your bed?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was within about two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I went to bed between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Stevens. Quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a pistol fired?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No. I heard nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the loom next morning?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did, the harness was cut a-cross, and the reed bent quite double, and the silk cut beyond the harness.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you here on the other trial?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you first tell it to, that it was so dark?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when Doyle was tried?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I don't doubt but I might be at work at that time, at Ben. William's, in Spital-fields. I worked there about six weeks, and it may be more.</p>

            . I lay in that room at the time the work was cut, by the chimney-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the noise of the cutters coming in?</p>
               <p>T. Clark. Yes, sir, I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your mistress's coming in?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, I was up before her. The cutters were in the room before my mistress came in. I could not distinguish any one, the night was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether they had any weapons in their hands?</p>
               <p>Clark. I could not distinguish any thing in their hands, the night was so execussive dark. I was in the shop all the time. I could not see any thing that they did, or any one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see as well as your mistress could see?</p>
               <p>Clark. I could see as well as she.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near your mistress?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was, and it might be a quarter of an hour, more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the room till she went back again?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did. When the cutters were gone, I went up to the loom on the right hand towards the window. I could not perceive any damage done to the loom; it was so dark I could see nothing. I called another of my shop-mates, who was asleep all the time the cutters were there. We could not see, but we felt and groped about. We could not see to distinguish any person. Was my own father there I could not have seen him from another man. Neither the colour of their clothes, nor their hair.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you do to distinguish your mistress from the cutters?</p>
               <p>Clark. I could distinguish her by being in her hift.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the cutters came in before your mistress.</p>
               <p>Clark. I could not see her come in, but I heard her voice. I got out of my bed before they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060044"></xptr>Q. How come you to get out of your bed then?</p>
               <p>Clark. To get out of their way. I knew they were coming.</p>
               <p>Q. By what?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard my mistress say the day before, she expected them, that they would come at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what they said when in the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot recollect what they said. Neither can I tell who let them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you afraid of them?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was not. I knew they would not hurt me, nor no-body that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Clark. I have no reason, but I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, Why did you get out of bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard they would cut the work at the upper end, and I was afraid they would come to that place. I got out of bed to save that work from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose work was it they were for cutting?</p>
               <p>Clark: It was Mr. Horton's work. Mrs. Poor told me they were to cut that particular work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it more likely they would cut the work near the door, or farther from the door?</p>
               <p>Clark. That was Walker's work that I went to save.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they came to cut Walker's work.</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whose work did you get out of bed to save?</p>
               <p>Clark. I got out of bed to save Mr. Thompson's work. I heard they were come to cut Mr. Walker's work and Mr. Thompson's. Mrs. Poor said so that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire you to save Mr. Walker's work?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you prefer Mr. Walker's work to Mr. Horton's? Did you desire them not to cut that work you went to save?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means was you to save it?</p>

             they should ask me whose work it was, I would have told them; but they never asked me, or I would have spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to them when they were cutting Mr. Horton's work?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not. I heard them say, Mr. Horton did not give a price for his work.</p>
               <p>Q. What has Mr. Horton to do with Mr. Poor's Journeymen?</p>
               <p>Clark. He has nothing to do with them. It was, that he did not pay Mr. Poor price enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Did Mr. Walker pay a better price than Mr. Horton?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you place yourself when you ran to save this work?</p>
               <p>Clark. I placed myself down towards the bottom of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew they could not see you, How could they find you out, to ask you whose work it was?</p>
               <p>Clark. No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bed that a man might escape under?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you under that?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I was not. I stood up in the shop. I got out of bed before the cutters came in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not joked afterwards with running away from a woman in her shift?</p>
               <p>Clark. That was some time after the cutters came in that I saw her in her shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cutters ask whose work was in the loom?</p>
               <p>Clark. They asked whose work is this, and whose work is this?</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they ask?</p>
               <p>Clark. The man in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the man in bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could see the man in bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they ask? they could not see you?</p>
               <p>Clark. I said that was Mr. Horton's, and that was Mr. Thompson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me you never spoke to them? You said they never asked you, or else you would have spoke. Did not you say you never spoke to them?</p>
               <p>Clark. No answer.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Whether your mistress was the person that was spoke to by them, and whether she spoke to them?</p>
               <p>Clark. They wished her a good night when they went out, and that is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060045"></xptr>Q. Did not they ask her whose work this was, and whose work that was?</p>
               <p>Clark. I don't recollect that they asked her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then who did they ask?</p>
               <p>Clark. They asked me when I was towards the farther end of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them come there?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, Sir, they went all over the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, or did they not come to the farther end of the shop, where you was?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, sir, and all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near you, when they asked you about the looms?</p>
               <p>Clark. They were pretty near me. They said, they would not cut that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cutters were in the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. I believe there were more than two or three, but how many I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many voices did you hear?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard the voice of but one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they stop at all before they went down stairs?</p>
               <p>Clark. I do not think they did; I can't be sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say any thing after they went out of the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not hear them; the whole of what they said was, Whose loom is this, and whose loom is this? and they bad them a good night when they went away; and God bless you!</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body meddled with in the place, or molested?</p>
               <p>Clark. No one was molested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody lay hold round Mrs. Poor's neck?</p>
               <p>Clark. I could not perceive any thing of that.</p>

            . I remember the night the loom was cut; I said in the very next room to Mrs. Poor, in a room that I rent. I heard the cutters come up, and I arose immediately out of my bed, and looked through a hole in my own door, and there I stood. Their door and mine are within two feet and a half of one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see when you looked?</p>
               <p>Downs. I could see nothing it was so dark. I could not distinguish one man from another. I could not know a person's face, or any thing. I staid all the time in my shirt looking to them:</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you looking to them all the time til they went down from the time they came up?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was. I stood there to hearken to them. I heard them knock at the door, and desire them to open the door. She arose and opened the door. She said, coming Gentlemen, and unlocked, and unbolted it, and they came through, and went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them speak?</p>
               <p>Clark. I never heard them say a word; they only knocked at the door. I did not hear them say one single word till they went away; her room was between me and the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hole was it that you looked through?</p>
               <p>Clark. It was a large hole, above an inch long; an old large key-hole around one. I declare to God I don't know how many there were; I know there were more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a woman in her shift?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not: whatever they said in the shop I could not hear.</p>

            . I think it was on the twenty-seventh of September, about nine in the morning. Mr. Dean's son came to my house to acquaint me, that Mr. Poor had moved his bed away, and his wife was in Bridewell, and Mr. Dean was gone to Sturbridge-fair. I collect rents for Mr. Dean at my leisure time; I went directly and went into Poor's shop; there I made a distress for the deficiency of rent, two pounds thirteen shillings and four-pence, to September the 15th; when I had just began the inventory. Mrs. Poor came in. She asked me what business I had there. I told her I wanted the rent, and if she would pay me, I had no business there. She told me she had no money, how should she pay, we have no work? and made such excuses and was very hard, &amp;c. at last she came to words, and said she would blow my brains out; whereupon I was obliged to send for an officer; then she became more peaceable. When I had almost finished, she said she knew seventeen of the cutters, and she would hang them, except they would give her thirty pounds. She said she had got Doyle fast. I said, suppose they will not give you thirty pounds. She said then they might do as they pleased, for she would never appear against them.</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the value of all their goods together?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060046"></xptr>Sykes. What I sold I sold for three guineas. I never saw many more goods in the house, tho' I have been in the house an hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, were all their goods worth?</p>
               <p>Sykes. I do not suppose all were worth above ten shillings more than what I sold them for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they worth six pounds?</p>
               <p>Sykes. No, nor four: no broker would ever give four pounds for all the goods they had in the house, looms and all; they were valued at three pounds three shillings, and I sold them for that.</p>
               <p>The jury withdrew with the warrant that was produced by Barton. When they returned the foreman told the court, that by observing it by the light the date so med to be the 5th, which had afterwards been made into a figure of 8, upon which they had sent a private messenger to Bridewell for the commitment of

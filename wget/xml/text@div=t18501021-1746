                  </hi>. I am daughter of George Riches, silk-mercer, of Enfield. On 4th Oct. the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a bonnet<lb></lb>shape—Mary Ann Howe, who serves in the shop, went to get it, and while she was gone I saw the prisoner take a coat, which was for sale, from a pile of coats, and put it under her shawl—I called to Charles Smith, and he called to my mother, who came, and after the prisoner had paid for what she bought, my mother told her before she left the shop she would have her searched—the prisoner asked what for, and my mother said for stealing a coat—she said she did not do it—I saw my mother pick up the same coat I saw the prisoner take—it is my father's property.</p>

The last witness called me, and in consequence I went to my mistress, who came—the prisoner paid for what she had bought, and my mistress told her she would have her searched before she left the shop—she asked what for—my mistress told her for stealing a coat—she denied it—I afterwards saw my mistress pick a coat up—I went for a policeman, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

Hodges, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of Adnum"—the effect of this would be, in the course of busi<lb></lb>ness, to make out a cheque for Hodges to sign—on the 14th of December cheque now produced was prepared at our house, and a female came and applied for the money, saying her name was Hodges—she signed this cheque, on which, I sent her to the counter with it, to receive the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear the prisoner is the person—I do not know her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the governor of the County Gaol for Surrey, at Horse<lb></lb>monger Lane, in the parish of Newington. I had a person named John Hodges in the gaol—I think he had been in the gaol about a fortnight or three weeks from the time he was first remanded—he was in custody on a charge of felony—Preston had been in the gaol since the early part of June last—he was there for debt—he was in the infirmary for some time—he was placed there because he was supposed to be insane—the symptoms were a great depression of spirits—he was placed there so that he might be watched, by order of the surgeon—there is an order from the surgeon to that effect entered in the books—I saw the prisoner on Saturday, 5th Sept.; he appeared to be in his usual state—he had never exhibited violence of any bid—I considered him perfectly harmless, although insane he had been in that same ward for about a fortnight, I think—I was told that he had represented to the surgeon that he was subject to fits—he appeared in good health—a person named Todman was also there—Samuel Sowerby, another prisoner, was appointed to wait on these three—there were these four in that infirmary all day Sunday—about 4 o'clock on Monday morning I was aroused by the night watchman—in consequence of that I went to the room where these persons were confined—I found Sowerby, and a prisoner, who was brought up by one of the warders from a room below, holding Preston, who was Sitting on his own bed—he appeared to be in a very excited state indeed—I perceived Hodges lying on his bed, with a large wound on his head, and one of the men, I cannot say which it was, said, "Preston, sir, has struck him with a pail"—Preston's reply was, "He has seduced my wife"—his wife used to visit him—there could not have been any conversation at all between the deceased and her—Hodges was sixty-seven years of age—I saw the pail, and gave it in charge to Gibbs, the officer—I saw marks of blood on it—when I went up and saw Hodges, I believed him to be dead—I sent for Mr. Ebsworth, the surgeon, who attended in five minutes, and pronounced him dead—on Tuesday, 8th Sept., I had some conversation with the prisoner—I was pre<lb></lb>sent with one or two of the Magistrates—he first asked the question, "Is the man dead?"—he was told, "Yes," and he said, "I can't tell why I did it the devil must have possessed" or "tempted me, for he was always very kind to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at No. 11, Trinity Street On Monday, Sept. 7th, I was called to Horsemonger Lane, about 4 o'clock in the morning—I saw Hodges, the deceased—he was quite dead—I exa<lb></lb>mined his head, and found a severe contusion over the eye, on the left side; and that side of the head, over the left temple, appeared to be beaten in—there was also a laceration on that side in the same place—there was some arterial blood dripping from the ear—in my judgment those wounds were caused by some heavy instrument being used on the head of the deceased—this pail is such a thing as would be very likely indeed to do it—it would be several blows—I should say that the death of Hodges was caused by those wounds—I saw Preston there—I had not seen him before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I had been attending at the gaol, as surgeon, for sixteen days before Sept. 7th, in consequence of the absence of Mr. Harris, on leave—I had seen Preston every day during that time—I con<lb></lb>sidered him of unsound mind from the first—I had had communications with Mr. Harris about him previously, about orders in the Surgeon's Journal—he was in the infirmary in accordance with those orders—I thought him of unsound mind—he was continually muttering to him<lb></lb>self, and had an idea that an operation was to be performed on him against his will—that was the chief thing—he was exceedingly low and depressed, and hardly ever looked up—I considered him entirely harmless.</p>

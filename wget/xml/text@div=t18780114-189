I am the prisoner's wife, and live with him at 3, John Street, Whitechapel—on 8th December I was up late at dressmaking—I asked my husband if he was going to get up in the morning when he was called, as he was such a trouble to get up in the morning, he was a very lazy man—he said he would get up as he liked—he went to bed with his trousers on—I told him to take them off; he would not—I went to bed, and fell asleep with my baby on my arms, being tired, and I was awoke up in the morn<lb></lb>ing by the prisoner cutting my throat—I saw him rush to the door, and I heard my sister say "He has murdered the baby"—my sister came into the room, and I said "He has cut my throat"—I know no more—four or five months before this he made an attack upon me in my sleep, one Saturday night, and wrenched my left breast very nearly off, and it was so sore for a fortnight after that I had to wean the baby—he has used threatening language to me—when I have bought anything for my home, which I liked to look nicely, he has said "You won't enjoy it long"—he has told me that three or four times—he had not been out on this evening—he was quite sober; he had two glasses of ale, his usual supper beer—he was at home all the evening—we have been married a year and eight months—I have one child—the prisoner is 27 years of age, and is a painter and house decorator.</p>

I am the sister of the prosecutrix, and lived with her and her husband, and my mother also—at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 8th December I went into the prisoner's room to wake him—I said "Jem, get up"—he was lying at the back of the bed with his trousers on—he got up—I said "Shall I leave you the lamp to see to dress by?"—he said "No, never mind," and I took it downstairs—he afterwards dressed and came down—he asked me for his pipe—I said "Perhaps you left it upstairs"—he said "Perhaps I did," and he went up—he was gone about five minutes—I went up and said "Jem, you will be late"—the door was open—I went in, and saw him on his knees at the back of the bed—I said "Jem, is that you?"—he did not answer—I said it again—he said "Yes, it is me," and he came downstairs—he then went up again—I followed him—I wondered if they were quarrelling, and I went to the foot of the bedroom stairs and listened—I heard him walking about and mumbling to himself—he came down and said "You have been listening"—I said "No, I have not"—he said "Yes, you have"—I was frightened, and I said "I can stand in the passage if I like"—he then said "Well, here's off," and he went upstairs again—I was so frightened I went behind him, and fell over my dress on the kitchen stairs—he went right up into the bedroom, and I did not think he had time to get into the bedroom before I heard my sister scream—I ran up and went into the room, and just as I got in he took his hand up off the baby's face, and</p>

               <p>there were the marks of four bloody fingers on the baby's face—the baby was lying on the front of the bed by the side of the mother—I called out "Oh, mother, he has murdered the baby!"—my sister said "Oh, he has cut my throat!"—my mother could not at first get her door open—there was a piece of wood somewhere in the lock—she ran up to my sister—the prisoner ran from the bed to get out at the door—I caught hold of him—he got on to the staircase—I held on to him down the stairs, and my mother also tried to hold him, but she had to run back to my sister—I still held him till we got to the street door—he opened the door, and I got pushed into the street, and he ran out—I caught him again and called "Murder! Police!" and he caught me by the throat and threw me against the shutters next door—I then went for a doctor—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody.</p>

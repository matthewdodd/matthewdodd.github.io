                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Younghusband, a carrier, of the Old Bailey. These studs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine; I had them in my coat pocket, about 9th or 10th Jan., which I left in the office—I missed them three or four days afterwards—I saw them next at the Fortune of War public house, at the corner of Giltspur Street—Mr. Younghusband gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hough, who keeps the Fortune of War, Smithfield. I know the prisoner, by his coming in sometimes—he came there on the Thursday before he appeared at the Police Court, about 11 o'clock in the morning; he took these studs out of his pocket, and asked if he could have a raffle; I said that I would inquire, and he left them—I said that it was a pity for him to raffle them; he said that he did not want them, for he picked them up at the cab stand in the Old Bailey—he brought this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him, and it was exhibited in the bar—(<hi rend="italic">This was a raffle paper, representing the studs as the property of Mr. Bolton</hi>.)</p>

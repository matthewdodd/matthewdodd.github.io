            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner at the Gloucester Arms, Rochester-row, on the 7th of November, selling these biscuits; I called him out, and asked where he got them - he at first would not give me an answer - he then said he bought them in the City, and then that he brought them from Portsmouth, but I found they were quite warm; this is the sieve.(Sieve produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived at Portsmouth thirty-three years. I bought these biscuits of a man who was selling them in the street - I bought 1d. worth of him, and ate them; he said he would sell me the rest a bargain - I thought as it was Saturday night I might get a shilling by taking them to public-houses; I sell a few little things, which I buy of Mr. Brooks, in Tothill-street, where I took the officer, and he gave me a good character.</p>
               <p>JOHN EBLING. I went to Mr. Brooks - he said he was in the habit of buying hardware of him.</p>

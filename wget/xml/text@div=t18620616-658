                  </hi>. I am a carver, of 28, Montpellier-row, Brompton—on 8th May, about 12 at night, I was in Piccadilly, between Park-lane and Hamilton-place, and saw a Hansom's-cab and a four-wheeled cab near together—the prisoner got off his cab, got on to the forewheel of the four-wheeled cab, took the driver by the collar, and pulled him on to the kerb, and I thought the man's head was smashed to pieces—his face came on the kerb—he hallooed "Murder!" twice, and a policeman came up—I said, in the prisoner's presence, "I think I never saw a more cruel thing in my life"—I should not like to say that the prisoner was drunk, but he seemed very excited.</p>

On 24th May, in consequence of information, I took the prisoner in Great Marlborough-street—I said that he was charged with assaulting a cabman named Charles Field—he said, "It is a bad job; we had a quarrel; he called me a liar, and struck me with his whip; I got off my cab, took hold of his badge-strap, and, in the struggle which ensued, he fell through my arms on to the foot pavement; I think he must have been drunk, for he fell like a lump of lead; I accompanied him to the hospital; I have been several times to see him since, and have taken him port wine and other things"—he was taken before the Magistrate, and I afterwards, on the same day, took him to the hospital into the de<lb></lb>ceased's presence—several other witnesses were present—I said to the deceased, "Who caused the injuries to your head which you are now suffering from?"—he pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That man there"—I said, "Tell me how it happened, will you?"—he said, "I was driving along Piccadilly, and thought I heard some one call 'Cab'; I thought I should like to take another job—"he was going to state something else, but he wandered from the subject—I gave him sufficient time to recover, and said, "Are you sure that man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Walker</hi>) is the man?"—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner merely asked him how he was.</p>

I live at 6, Buckingham-street, Strand—Charles Field was my son—I was with him when he died, and two days and two nights previously, at St. Georges Hospital—the prisoner came to see him in the night, and said, "How do you do?"—he said, "I do not know you"—the prisoner said, "I am the man that did that," pointing to my son's head—I said to the prisoner, "How came you to do so? it was very cruel of you"—he said to my son, "Do you know how it happened?"—my son said, "About 1 o'clock in the morning I was near Hyde-park Corner, and heard 'Cab' called; you were behind with your cab, and the wheel came against mine; you said, 'You did it on purpose;' I said, 'I did not,' and then you called me a liar; you got off your cab, took me by the collar, and threw me on the kerb"—the prisoner said, "You fell as heavy as though</p>

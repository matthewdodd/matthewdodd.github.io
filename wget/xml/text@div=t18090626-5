             is the owner of the house; neither he nor none of his family lives there, he lives at No. 6. I kept a mangle. On Friday the 12th of May, between the hour of three and four in the afternoon, I missed the property; I went out with a woman that came for me to go and fetch a basket of linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person - A. I do not know her person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any body in your room when you went out to go with her - A. Only a child about two years and a half old. I was absent about half an hour, I returned, I missed a bundle that I had to mangle; I knew the contents of the bundle, I had mangled them, and pinned them up ready to go home. I had left the articles on the table behind the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you taken to afterwards - A. The woman that took my things, took me out to go to a house, No. 30, in King-street, Soho, after a basket of linen; and in part of the way to the house she left me, she said she was going to get an errand, she would be there as soon as me. I never saw any more of her that day; we took her on the 21st of the same month. I saw her immediately after she was taken, but I did not know her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were mentioning of her taking you to some house, No. 30, King-street, Soho - A. Yes, that was the day she robbed me; I went to No. 30, I found there was none; I came home and found the things missing. I have seen some of the things that were found in her room on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. But the person of the prisoner you do not recollect - A. She was an entire stranger to me before.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took charge of the property you found there - A. Mr. Skinner; I know nothing of the articles; I was not at home at the time; the prisoner was taken to Tothill-fields prison.</p>

            . Q. Were you one of those that were at the apprehending of the prisoner - A. Yes, I keep a broker's shop in the same house where the prosecutrix lived; the prisoner on the day mentioned came into the yard to me and asked me if I was the person belonging to the mangle; I told her no, the person belonging to the mangle was in the kitchen; she went down into the kitchen; I know that person was the prisoner perfectly well, I never saw her before. They came up together; Mrs. Lovegrove asked me if I would give an eye to the kitchen; while they went for a basket of linen; the prisoner came back again in about five minutes, after leaving Mrs. Lovegrove; she told me that they had forgot half their errand, they had not took with them the mangling things; she said Mrs. Lovegrove told her she was to go down stairs and I was to give her the things, but I did not give them her; she went down stairs and took them before I could get into the kitchen; she told me that she must make haste and overtake her or else she should not be able to give her the rest of the mangling things.</p>
               <p>Q. What other mangling things - A. There were none, that was only her false pretence. Mrs. Lovegrove came back and told me there were no mangling things at No. 30; I saw no more of the prisoner; I told Mrs. Lovegrove that I had given her the things.

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of May, I apprehended the prisoner very near Tothill-fields-bridewell; I was informed her apartment was in Orange-court, Drury-lane; I went and searched it, and found some articles that Mrs. Lovegrove identified. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found her in the room on the 13th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, she was dressing herself; I had a suspicion of the woman that lodged with her, and they put her down in the dust hole.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day that person lost the things her husband came down to where I lodge in Orange-court, Drury-lane; I was sitting at the window at work, he then enquired for a woman with a cast in her eye, of the name of Goodwin; in the evening I was in a public house in Drury-lane, he saw me there and took no notice of me. On the Sunday morning the woman that I lodged with said there is somebody lifting the latch of the door; I said it is the same man that came before. On the Monday I went to Constitution-hill, I saw him, he took no notice of me. On the Sunday week following I went with the woman I lodged with to see a man in Tothill-fields-prison for quarrelling; these two women stopped me and said I was the woman that took the bundle and ran away.</p>

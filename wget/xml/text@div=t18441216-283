                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 51, Black<lb></lb>friars-road. The prisoner was in my employ about three weeks as shop or errand boy—on the 18th of Nov., about eleven o'clock in the morning, I placed thirteen sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in a bowl in my till—there is a lock and key to it, but I did not lock it—I had occasion to leave my shop for a few moments, and left the prisoner in the shop—he could not have seen me put the money into the till—his back was towards me—he may have heard it—he was standing at the door minding the goods—I returned in about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner was then gone—I looked into the till and missed the bowl and its contents—I saw the prisoner again on Friday, the 13th of Dec., and gave him into custody—I have never recovered any of the money.</p>

I received the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor—I took him to Union-hall police-court—I made him no promise or threat—he told me voluntarily that he went down to White<lb></lb>chapel to be out of the way, that no one might know him; that four boys surrounded him, and would have some of the money, and he gave them a half-sovereign each—that he went further on and saw two boys playing at marbles; that he bought a halfpenny worth, and while playing at mar<lb></lb>bles some of the money fell out of his pocket; that they would have some money from him, and he gave them 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to buy some clothes with; that they recommended him to a lodging in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; and they kept him there for a fortnight—I went there to make in<lb></lb>quiries, and found that he had been there, but had passed off as an orphan boy with the other two that were with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newington-crescent. On the 5th of Dec, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking on London-bridge with a friend—a gentleman came and asked if I had lost anything—I said I was not aware that I had—I put my hand into my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had used it in coming along—this is the handker-chief—I know it because there is a tear in it—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I was in plain clothes—I fol<lb></lb>lowed the prisoners from the Borough to London-bridge—I had seen them together for about an hour—I knew them as associates—I saw Buckley take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket—I saw him attempt it several times before he got it—he gave it to Cushion—I sprang from the road where I was walking by the side of a wagon, and seized them both—Cushion threw the handkerchief down—a gentleman took it up and gave it to the prose<lb></lb>cutor.</p>
               <p>Buckley. We came up from Dock-head at six o'clock, and came up Ber<lb></lb>mondsey, and up Thames-street, as far as the bridge, and the policeman laid hold of us; we had two lamb's feet, and were eating them. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> They had nothing of the kind; I saw them lift a lady's dress by St. George's church.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour of nine o'clock on the 26th of January; at the bottom of Dyot street I saw the prisoner and another man, the other man was trundling a wheel in the foot way; I asked the man where he had the wheel from; he said it was his own, and if you have any suspicion you may come and see; with that he trundled the wheel along the channel. I told the other watchman to go along with him and see whether all was right; the prisoner's mother has been to me at the watch-house, and asked me if I would take a bribe, and make a flaw in the indictment. I am sure the prisoner is one of them.</p>

            . I am the other watchman. This watchman bid me go along with him; I went along with him to Bowl yard, St. Giles's. The prisoner took the wheel; then the other man ran away; the prisoner came to Nottingham court, he put the wheel against the side of a house; he said the other man bid him bring the wheel there, that was his house; I said you must come along to the watchhouse; he said he would not; he threw the wheel away, and then he ran away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. The other man ran away, the prisoner called after him - A. Yes; the prisoner was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not attempt to run away till the mob told him - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going home I met Cheeseman; he asked me to trundle the wheel; I called after him when he ran away. When I put the wheel down the watchman said he would put me in the watchhouse; I said I would not go. I staid there some time, and then I ran away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

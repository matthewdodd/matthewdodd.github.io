               <p>Henry Green. On the 11th of July last my wife and I lay out of the house; the house was broke open, and I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment; and the buckles were found at one Mrs. Franks's on Labour-in-vain hill, where he had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Green. No .</p>
               <p>Mary Green. July 11, between 7 and 8 in the morning , I found the window-shutters broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the inside or the outside window-shutters ?</p>
               <p>Green. The outside shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were they broke so that any body could get in?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes; and I found this gimblet lying upon the table. My husband and I did not lie at home that night, for I went to secure my sister's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your things again?</p>
               <p>Green. No; the constable has them. I saw them at the pawn-broker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you shut the shutters?</p>
               <p>Green. Between 8 and 9 at night; I fastened them all myself.</p>

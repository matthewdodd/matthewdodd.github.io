            . I am the wife of John Green. On the 5th of November, I had been to Somer's-town, to see a sister who was dangerously ill; I was at the door of No. 11. <placeName id="t18211205-102-crimeloc638">Bow's-yard, Bolton-street, Long-acre</placeName>

I knocked at the door several times, but could not get in; being very tired I sat down on the step, and fell asleep, and was awoke by a man untying the handkerchief off my neck. I found my bonnet taken off. It was the prisoner, the watchman took him immediately.</p>

            . Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 5th of November, I walked round Middle-row, and saw the prosecutrix sitting on a step, and the prisoner standing half bent over her, undoing the handkerchief on her neck - I seized him and asked what he was doing; he said the woman was tipsy, and he was trying to get her home. She jumped up and screamed out that her bonnet was gone. He said he knew nothing of it. I said I shall take you to the watch-house, if you do not tell me; he then said it is at No. 43, George-street. I took him there, and found two women sitting at the fire. He asked them where the bonnet was which he threw into the house; the women said, "On the table," and gave it me. I took him to the watch-house, and found the comb out of her hair in his waistcoat pocket. She was perfectly sober.</p>

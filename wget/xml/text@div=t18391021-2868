                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Eldon, a shoemaker, in Cross-street, Poplar. About three o'clock on the 11th of October, I went round the corner of the house to turn some clothes which I had on the line—during that time the prisoner passed me, and went into my room—I saw him come out of the house—I went in in two minutes, and the jacket in gone—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

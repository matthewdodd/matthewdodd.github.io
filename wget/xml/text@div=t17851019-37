               <p>How came you to think of your watch? - Why I suspected from this, from her hands being at my neck, to my knowledge the man never put a hand to me.</p>
               <p>Did you feel her hand at your watch, or any thing of that sort? - No, I cannot say I did, when she was dragging me down I certainly felt something move.</p>
               <p>You say the man did nothing? - Not to my knowledge, but I was so busy with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190071"></xptr> woman that I do not know, but however the woman had hold of me while I was robbed of my watch.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell whether she took it or who took it? - No, I cannot, but I am sure it was taken while she held me, and was dragging me down to the ground.</p>
               <p>What became of your friend the Jew that you had released from her? - He was standing by.</p>
               <p>Did not he help you as well as you helped him? - He was minding his goods I believe, the woman endeavoured to make her escape, and by the assistance of the man prisoner and some others, was out of the hands of the watchman, I believe twice, if not more, I caught hold of her twice, she wanted to get away, she got my thumb in her mouth, (Ah you need not laugh, the marks are here yet,) I secured her till two or three watchmen came up, I never got my watch again, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in watches? - No.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I am a taylor in business; I do not know the maker's name of my watch, nor the number, it was to be brought to me by a person that knew it, but they have not, then the woman was searched for the watch at the watch-house, nothing was found, I am sure this

             held me while I was robbed of the watch.</p>
               <p>What was she doing to your friend when you came up? - He was shoving her off desiring her to go from his goods; they have a stall against the side of the house, with buckles, watch-chains, and keys, and different things.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you get out of her way? - I did not suspect I should be catched hold of and robbed, I was not afraid of my watch at first, till she almost dragged me down on the ground, she pulled me down with such despair, that caused me to suspect a robbery.</p>
               <p>Was you there by yourself without any assistance? - Not one that I knew was there; the prisoner England obstructed the watchman taking her to the watch-house, he told the people not to meddle with the woman, but to let her take her own-part, while she had hold of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. They did not know you was a taylor? - No.</p>
               <p>The people had a mind to see a battle between you? - I do not know, but it was no battle, at least it was a disadvantageous one to me when I lost my watch; I am flee before God and my own conscience to declare that I was held by her when I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>The fact is, that you like a fool entered into a squabble with this woman, in defence of poor Mordecai, and got a good beating, and your thumb bit, and lost your watch? - His name was not Mordecai, you are mistaken there, his name is Solomon.</p>
               <p>So you came up in the Godspeed, let the Jew loose, and engaged with this Christian female; did not the people think it was good fun to see the taylor and the woman engaged together? - I am not to be brow beat, though you may suppose yourself a very wise man.</p>

               <p>Saturday sevennight I was coming down the Haymarket, I was standing with Mr. Solomons the Jew, asking the price of a pair of buckles, nobody was nigh us, she came up to me and behaved very indecent, and went to the Jew and behaved so to him, and the Jew puined her away, and told her to go away about her business; then she came the second time to him, and she ran to break his glass, and he caught her hand before it came down on the glass, it was a shew glass which stands with things in at the side of the public-house; then she broke his lamp, then he asked her what she meant, and she said what are you going to kill me, rob me or murder me, she made very bad oaths, and raised a mob, and called me very bad names, then Solomon sent for the watch and charged her, then the prisoner England came up and said, gentlemen consider it is a woman, do not ill use her, that was all the words I heard him say, and the prosecutor came across over the way, then she caught hold of him, and said, you bl - y thief, you have knocked me down twice, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190072"></xptr> caught hold of him by the frill of the shirt, and shook him till the watchman was ringing his rattle, and I went down to seek for assistance, and I heard the prosecutor call out, I have lost my watch, I never saw the prosecutor before, when I heard the prosecutor call out I have lost my watch, I directly turned round and saw the man-prisoner stand pretty close to the woman, but I did not see him do any thing to the prosecutor, nor did I hear the prosecutor charge him with doing any thing to him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, belonging to St. Paul's, Shadwell; I was officer of the night, I remember meeting the prisoner and Taylor between three and four; between the watch-house and King David's-lane, on Sunday the 20th of this month; Taylor gave charge on suspicion that he had stole the coat and waistcoat, and Birch gave me charge afterwards; I have known the prisoner for four years, he was a watchman of the same parish, of St. Paul's, Shadwell, he was on the very night.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is his beat? - His beat is by Shadwell Dock, by Mr. Mellish's; I took charge of him and the property, and took and locked them up and produced them on the morning of the 21st, at the office; this is the property, I have had it in my custody ever since, it was sealed up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing about it? - I examined the prisoner how he came by it, he made a slight answer, he said he found it, I asked him whether he knew what were in the pockets? he told me no, he had not felt, I asked Mr. Birch what he had lost? he told me a coat, waistcoat, &amp;c. the prisoner was in the watch-house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Birch, in the presence of the prisoner, claim the property to be his? - He told me that it was his property, and that he had pulled it off his back, and laid it in the cupboard before he went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Mellish's premises? - I was in them to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gateway, is there one connected square of building and wall to make the square? is there a general building that makes the square, or is any part of it open? - To the best of my knowledge there is a little wall, but it is very high, that goes round and connects all the buildings.</p>
               <p>Birch. This is my coat and waistcoat, I can hardly swear to the handkerchief, but it was the same sort of handkerchief that I lost; nor the money I cannot swear to, nor the knife so much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found them in Labour-in-vain-street, as I was going down at two o'clock in Mrs. Partridge's necessary, they were tied up in this white handkerchief, I see something white, and so put my hand on them, and I untied them and I had them on my arm, and this man met me and hallooed out watch, I told him he need not call out watch, for I was going to take them to the watch-house.</p>

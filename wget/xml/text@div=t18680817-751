                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house at Sydenham—on 16th July the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of pudding—he paid with a bad shilling—I asked him if he had any more of that sort; he said, "No, I was not aware it was bad"—he then paid with a good shilling, and I gave him the change—he left, and I followed him—he joined another man—I spoke to a policeman, and he followed—he was afterwards taken into custody, and I identified him.</p>

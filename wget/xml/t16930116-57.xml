To prove which, the Witnesses for the King were called and Sworn: The first of which deposed, That having Information that the Prisoner was an Ill Woman, a Warrant was obtained to search her House, under a pretence of her being a Clipper; and when the Constable came there with his Assistants, they found the Prisoner up two pair of stairs; and as they were searching in the Garret, in an old Trunk was found a great Number of the Declarations, about a Thousand or more besides other Pamphlets, entituled, The Dear Bargain; Just Weights and Measures; and another, called Hodge-Podge as before-mentioned: The Prisoner seemed very much surprized at their taking of the Papers; and told the Searchers, That they came to look for Clipp'd Money, and therefore what had they to do with Papers, &amp;c.? They seized the Pamphlets and the Declarations, as also the Prisoner, and carried her before a Magistrate, who committed her to Newgate for the Offence. There were several concurring Evidence to the Matter of Fact; especially two, one of which declared, That she owned that she had the Papers from Westminster, brought to her by a Boy who she called Black or Jack; but would not acknowledge who was the Author or Printer of the same; and that she sate up all night to dry the Declarations, being newly brought from the Press; and that she bundled them up, and carried them out in the Night in Coaches. Another Evidence swore, That the Prisoner had Confess'd to her, That she had disposed of several of them amongst her Friends, (but she lookt upon them to be no more than Waste Paper), and that the Papers were to be brought to her, and when she received them she promised the Witness that she should have one of them. The Prisoner called some Evidence, who said, That she was an ingenuous Woman, and behaved her self well in times past, in her general Conversation.

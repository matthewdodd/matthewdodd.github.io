I am the bearer of bad news, but want to see you privately;" he asked me into his front parlour, and I communicated my suspicions to him - the father looked up at the top of a high cupboard, and said, "They have been bringing hairs here, which they are allowed 2s. in the 1l. for selling," and he reached down from the top of his cupboard the 1 lb. I charge the prisoner with stealing - the prisoner was not present when he first produced it to me; his mother was brought in, and placed two chairs for the two sons to be brought in before me, and I charged the prisoner with stealing it - he said, "It is a pretty thing indeed, that I should be charged with stealing bristles;" I said, "I am certain you have done it;" he looked at the top of the cupboard, and said, "Then I dare say you have seen them;" I said, "I have, and now, Mr. Sheppard, will you bring them down?" he then said he had taken that pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not ask him if he had sold the bristles? A. No - he might say he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070031"></xptr>never stole nor sold any thing; he came frequently to our warehouse, bought bristles to some amount, and usually brought a bag for them, which I generally put them into- he might sometimes put them in himself when he bought a single pound; he bought three or four bundles that day- this bundle was about five yards from him, and behind a counter; I was with him the whole time, but the counter goes up the side of the room - the bristles came from St. Petersburg; I had received 28lbs. of them - they were marked H. by the person we bought them of, but I understand we had every pound that was imported.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner for stealing the bristles, at his father's house - I heard the charge made against him; he said nothing to it, and would answer no questions I put to him - I asked his father, in his hearing, how it was that he had not questioned him as to how he had become possessed of them; the father said he had been a most undutiful son, and that he had told him he had them from a friend, and was to receive 2s. in 1l. for selling them - the prisoner made no reply to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to the prosecutors' for a quantity of bristles - a quantity laid on the counter, and in putting what I had bought into the bag, I put in these; I assure you it was quite a mistake - I did not discover it till I got home, and fearing to tell my father I had made a mistake, I put them away, and thinking there would be an inquiry I kept it secret, but when the foreman came I immediately confessed the whole matter.</p>

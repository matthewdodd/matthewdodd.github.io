               <p>Prisoner. Q.Will you say I took that bed without your knowledge? - A. He took the bed while I was out; I did not know any thing at all about it. (They were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I carried the bed to the Jew, that woman desired me to do the bed, and I told her to do it herself, and I went home with her, and she asked me to take hold of one end, and I the other, and we brought it to Mr. Smith's; I did not know it was a ready furnished lodging, I thought the things were all her own.</p>

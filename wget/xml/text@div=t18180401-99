            . On the 28th of November, I was near Twyford, in Berkshire. I inclosed four 1l. notes in a post letter, and directed them to my wife, Mrs. Ann Ford, No. 31, Shuldham-street, Bryanstone-square, Marylebone, London. I took the numbers of them, they were as follows: No. 71,936, 27th May, 1814; 37,663, 27th July, 1817; 19,658, 27th Aug. 1817; and 36,173, 24th July, 1816. I delivered the letter to Mrs. Holt, the post-mistress of Twyford, and paid the postage to London, which was 1s.1d. On the 6th of December I received a letter from my wife (looking at a 1l. note, No. 36,173, 24th July, 1816)-this is one of the notes I sent her, it has my own hand-writing on it. The letter came from my wife almost open-it had been opened; it was wafered.</p>

            , he paid 1s. 1d., the postage to town. A letter put into my office is sent to Maidenhead. I safely sealed the bag on that evening. The letter is directed to Mrs. Ann Ford, No. 31, Shuldham-street, Bryanstone-square.</p>

               <p>HENRY HARRIS. I am post-master at Maidenhead. A letter, put in at Twyford for London, would come to my office. On the 28th of November, the Twyford bag came, sealed in a regular letter-bag - I put them into the London bag, and sealed it. I do all the business myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What seal was put on the Twyford bag - A. It is not an official seal, it is a seal that Mrs. Holt puts on; I do not exactly know it-it sometimes has an impression, and sometimes not. Twyford is seven miles from Maidenhead. The man who brought the bag on that day is still living, but is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of the seal on that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010031"></xptr>day - A. No. I cannot say whether it was opened or not-the man who brought it could tell; he is not here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say whether the letter contained any notes in it - A. I cannot say whether it arrived at all. A treble letter is one which contains two notes. If it had been discovered to be treble it would not have been sent to Bond, but to another department. The person is not here who would have had it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. If it had not been discovered to be treble it would have gone to Bond - A. Yes; it appears to have been charged only double. If I had thought it treble I should have stamped it as having more to pay.</p>

            . I am an oil and colourman, of Broad-street, Golden-square. Last Tuesday night, at a quarter to ten o'clock, Sullivan came to my shop, and asked if I would purchase some chrome yellow; I asked what quantity; he said he had 2lbs. handy, and could have more; I asked what he wanted; he said 1s. I asked to see it; he ran across the street to the other person, I think, who gave him something in a handkerchief - and when he returned, as he only asked a quarter of the usual price, I detained him, and sent for a watchman; he ran out- I followed him, brought him back, and gave him in charge; he said he was the manufacturer, and lived near Vauxhall-bridge - he afterwards said in Milbank-street, and next day said he took it from the prosecutor.</p>

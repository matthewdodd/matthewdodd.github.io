I said, no; she asked me if I knew where they were? I said, my husband talked of a fight in the morning and I take it they are gone there; so with that she asked me to come over to her place; I went over and had been some time in the room where she lodged, I went to order a pot of beer for she and I, so I had ordered the beer, and when I ordered the beer I see the prisoner was wheeling my husband in a wheelbarrow to the Brazen Head, a public house, they went in there; I take it they stopped about a quarter of an hour before they came; they had a pot of beer in their hand when I saw them, but whether they drank I cannot tell, I did not stop to see; so with that I came home and I was standing in the room of the deceased and the prisoner came home; I saw him come into the room; when I saw him coming along, I said to the deceased, here is your husband coming Mrs. Ruddle, you had better hide the beer; I sat at the window and she answered and said, no, he might think more of it if she was to hide it; so with that he came up into the room, and when he came I handed him the pot to drink, it was in the room up one pair of stairs, and he drank good health to me and good health to his wife, and he handed the pot to his wife and she took the pot; so with that she began talking to him, and asked him if he was not ashamed of himself to stay out so drinking and his poor brother so ill? he said, it did not signify talking to him he wanted some victuals; he asked her what there was for dinner? she said, salt beef and carrots, and if he could not make a meal of that he must go without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said rather roughly? - I think it was; she checked him when he came in about being out drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. This was said crossly to him at the time? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q.

            , says, Mrs. Baker you cannot think what an outcry there is with Mrs. Ruddle, I take it he is beating of her; I ran up stairs into the room directly and when I came up stairs he stood at the bed room door with the child in his arms; so I said to him, I am surprized at you Ruddle to get ill using of your wife, as I hear you are; so he said, he had not been touching of her; and I said, he must by what I had been told; he said, she began with him; I had a child in my arms and I laid down the child in the cradle, and I lifted her up in my arms, she laid on the floor with her face towards the ground; so when I lifted her up I said, Lord have mercy on me Ruddle you have killed your wife; I think he said, I hope not, she was only in a fit, and he said, I knew she was subject to fits.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that so? - I have seen her in fits before, but not this time; so I took her in my arms and set her in a chair, and got hartshorn and water, and I thought if she was in a fit I would see and bring her too, and when I got her into the chair she made a very heavy sigh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200066"></xptr>and looked up to me, and she never spoke nothing after that nor ever offered to move after, she never spoke at all; there was hartshorn in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar assist at all? - He did; he endeavoured to bring her too and took her in his arms, he got the hartshorn and rubbed her temples, and he seemed to take very great account and cried sadly over her, and tried a good deal to bring her to, and had her in his arms a long time, for half an hour, he took all the pains he could for bringing her to life again, and was very much distressed, and cried bitterly a good deal; so while he had her in his arms the harts-horn was all used, and I said, I would go and fetch the doctor, and I went for some hartshorn; I don't think I was gone above a quarter of an hour, and when I came back he had her in his arms the same as I left her, he was endeavouring to bring her to, and I asked him how she did? he hoped, he said, she was better; with that he desired me to take her into my arms, he asked me if the doctor was coming that I went for? I said, I don't know for I saw nobody but a little boy, and he said, he would tell his master to come directly; so with that I had been a little time in the room with him and his brother, and he took on very sadly and cried, and he asked me if I had any money? so I made answer and said, Ruddle I have got 6 d. if that would be of any service, and he made reply, then he would have the 6 d. and would go and fetch the harts-horn, and bring the doctor directly; and he went and I never saw any thing of him till I saw him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any blood on the floor? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have used any instrument? - No, I saw nothing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see any marks of violence? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people attended her afterwards? - I cannot tell, there was so many; there was but one doctor, but the doctor's man came first, and the doctor came after, and the doctor's man blooded her before the doctor came</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she never recovered? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Baker, you probably have known the deceased and the prisoner some time, how did they live together? - I never see them live any way disagreeable that ever I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your account he seemed to be in perfect good humour when he came into the room? - Yes, in perfect good humour as ever I saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he fond of his wife? - Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many children had he? - Two, one is two years old and the other is about a twelve month.</p>

As soon as she was gone, there was a strange noise upon the floor were the prisoner and the deceased were; it founded to me like a fall and a blow, when I heard Mrs. Ruddle give an uncommon cry, I got up and took my infant in my lap, and went to open my door for to hear what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200067"></xptr>was the matter, and just as I opened the door I heard Mrs. Ruddle cry out murder very fierce; when I went to the door, Mrs. Ruddle came down stairs and she went and stood at the door with the little boy in her arms; I looked at her and she looked at me, and she shaked her head three times, but never spoke, and when she came by to go up stairs again, I asked her to walk into my room to stop a bit; she made me no answer, but shaked her head and went up stairs, there was a child in the room, and she says to the child, I do not know who you belong to, and she took the child to put it down stairs, for it to go down stairs; he told her she was a damned lyer, she did know who it belonged to, and as soon as she got into the room there was the same noise as I heard before; there was a rumbling on the floor like fails, and a noise like blows; then I heard Mrs Ruddle give an uncommon cry, I got up and opened my door, before I could get to the stairs I heard her cry murder; when I went up stairs I met Mr. Ruddle on the landing place; I asked him what he made such a noise and such a piece of work in my house for; I asked him whether or no he was not ashamed to use a poor woman of ill? he asked me, what business I had with it, what affair it was of mine? I told him if he made such a noise and riot in my house I would fetch a constable and have him taken up; he told me I might fetch a constable and have him taken up and be damned; he told me I should go down stairs, if I did not he would kick my backside down stairs; Mrs. Ruddle said, I should not go down, very fierce; at that time she was standing at a chair before the window, with one hand to her head and the little boy at her left knee, and he said, if I would not go into my own apartment he would kick me down, and he looked so spiteful and malicious, but having a young infant in my arms to save the child I went down into my own room and shut my door, and sat myself down, I got a clout and put on the young child, in that instant, I was struck all with a cold shiver, directly on that I heard the same rumbling as I heard before; I heard a noise in the prisoner's room like falls and heavy blows, like that of people fighting; it was the same sort only louder than I heard before, and I heard Mrs. Ruddle call out Mrs. Bishop, she gave two cries more and I heard no more of her; and then I stopped a while and I heard Mrs. Baker come in, and I heard her say, damn it Ruddle what have you been doing; and I sat and lissened a great while, and I could hear nothing of Mrs. Ruddle, and heard a great crying and walking about the room, but did not know what was the matter, and I went up and knocked at the door, Mr. Baker was there, Mr. Ruddle opened the door and came to me himself; I asked him how Mrs. Ruddle was; Oh! he said she was very well, she would do very well, she would come to presently; I stopped and talked to him a good while on the stairs, and asked him how he could use her so? says he, does not your husband and you have words sometimes? I said, yes, but not blows; he told me he should give her a beating no more; I asked him what he abused me so for? I had done him no harm; he asked my pardon and wanted me to shake hands with him; he asked me what I would have to drink? I told him nothing at all; I went down stairs and stopped a while again, but I could hear nothing of Mrs. Ruddle, Mrs. Baker was in the room all the time; I went down and stopped a while and I went up to the door again, and he came to the door himself again, by some means or other the door slipped out of his singers as he went to pull it after him; I asked him to let me go into the room? and he said, no, she would do very well; I says,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200068"></xptr>she looks to me to be dead, why will not you let me go into the room? he said, no, no, never mind she will do very well; I says to him, she looks to me to be dead, you have killed her, you have killed her, you have given her the death wound; he said, no, no, she will do very well; I went down stairs and alarmed the neighbourhood as fast as ever I could, in the mean time he changed his coat and hat and he came down, as I stopped at the door, and went down the street as unconcerned as if nothing had been the matter, and he walked down the garden and along the street, just as he used to do when he went to his daily work, Mrs. Baker came down the stairs and called me up, as soon as I entered the room I saw she was dead; I says, to Mrs. Baker, she is dead; Oh yes, she says; says I, have you sent for a doctor? says she, no; then says I, send for a doctor directly; I went down stairs and sent some little boy to the doctor; the doctor's man came, but I did not go up stairs to see any thing further.</p>

             a curtain before it, then the room was still for a few minutes, I kept my standing, then I heard Mrs. Ruddle cry out again very terrible, then I still kept standing there and I saw Mrs. Baker go up, and I heard the room very still, then I never heard any thing more of it, then I saw the prisoner come down and I said to him, you have killed your wife Ruddle; he made me no answer but looked very wishful at me, and he got lower in the garden and I still kept saying, I know he has killed her; with that he said, hush, three times; as soon as he was gone I went up into the room and I found Mrs. Ruddle laying dead on the floor before the window towards the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me draw the curtain? - I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; on Wednesday the 9th of January last, as near five o'clock as I can guess, two boys came desiring I would go immediately to see a poor woman who had been having words with her husband and was either dead or in a sit; at that time I was in a conversation with a gentleman in the shop on some business, I desired my assistant to go with the boys and I would follow directly; after the assistant went I went after him, I found the deceased laying on the floor senseless and motionless without any symptoms of life whatever; the assistant had attempted to bleed her without any effect; on that I examined the body particularly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200069"></xptr>at that time to see if there were any marks of violence about the body, on examining particularly all over the body particularly the external part, I saw no appearance of violence there whatever, the only appearance I saw was under the chin where there was a little bit of skin grazed off; on enquiry I found that had been there for several days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine sufficiently to see whether she might possibly die of a fit? - I saw no symptoms of her dying in a fit at that time, at that time I could not tell what had been the occasion of her death; there was no mark any where and no appearance of blood no more than on the apron from attempting to bleed her; at the time there was a conversation that she was pregnant, and I particularly examined the stomach to see if there was any mark in her stomach where there might have been a blow that would have occasioned an immediate suspension of life, but I saw none on the stomach, and the stomach was perfectly flat, no appearance of her being far advanced as I was told; I was ordered before the coroner on Saturday, and was ordered to examine the body, and I opened it, on examining the body at that time there was no appearance of violence any where on the body, except about the neck from ear to ear, and under the left ear a great fullness of swelling, a very great extravasation of blood. On opening of the body I found the whole of the viscera was in a perfect healthy natural state, both the thorax and abdomen, and she was not pregnant; on referring to the head and examining the scalp no injury at all, nor to the bones of the head, on opening the head and turning on one side the covering of the brain, the dura mater, there was a general extravasation of blood, there was a great extravasation of blood on the cerebrum and cerebellum.</p>
               <p>Q. Now could you on the dissection of this head discover what was the occasion of this poor woman's death? - No doubt it was that extravasation.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that that had been caused? - As if violent pressure about the neck had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it be done by a violent blow? - It was in consequence of violence but what sort of violence I cannot say, it appeared by violent pressure of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any measure to find out whether it might be by a fit? - I did, there might be the same symptoms take place of a fit or a violent blow, or fall, but there would not be that great extravasation of blood about the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I take you right any violent means, or any accidental means that might be the occasion of this rupture of the vessels might have had that effect? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if the woman had died in a fit such would have been the appearance as they were now? - Possibly, though in a slighter degree.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know the prisoner at the bar and the deceased? - I might know them personally, but never to my knowledge; I have only to observe, when I saw her on Wednesday there was no appearance of the blackness about the neck and of the extravasation; the pressure would not shew immediately, but it would some time after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That day that this accident happened I had been out along with my fellow workmen having a little beer, and my wife had been drinking too, not with me; when I came home it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Baker was in the room and they were drinking some beer and they asked me to drink, and I drank, I drank both their good healths, and soon after Mrs. Baker went out of the room; in Mrs. Baker's absence I asked my wife whether we should have our dinners; she replied, no, where I had been to get my beer there I should go and have my dinner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200070"></xptr>and I replied, and said to her, why should you be angry you have been drinking a little as well as I have; she said that did not signify for I should have no dinner there; I was sitting down in the chair and words arose, she being angry with me she took the poker out of the fire and struck at me twice, and I asked her why she did that? for I said, I was not angry with her if she was not angry with me; she still kept the poker in her hand and I took hold of her by the arms, and set her down in the chair and begged of her to be quiet, and she got up again and I set her down in the chair again close by the window, and being rather intoxicated with liquor she alarmed the neighbourhood, which I had not meddled with her at all; she got up again and said, I should go out of the room I should not stop there; I replied and said, I should not go till I had something to eat; she came to me in the mean time and attempted to put me out of the room; I took hold of her again for to set her down in the chair again, and with attempting to set her on the chair against the window I shoved her beside the chair and the chair and she, and I fell all down together, the cradle stood close by, the rockers of the cradle caused the blow at the side of her temple; that is all.</p>

On the 14th of September, in the evening, the prisoners came to my house together, and had gin and cloves to the amount of 8d. They gave my wife 1s. She gave them 4d. In about a minute afterwards a woman came in with shrimps. They paid her 1s. she brought it to me. I said it was bad, and took both the shillings to the prisoners, threw them on the table, and said, "How can you offer me such rubbish as this?" Thompson took them up, began jinking them, and said she did not think them bad, and asked Williams if he had any money? He laid half-a-crown on the table. I took it up, and, I believe, Thompson took up the bad shillings. One of them did. I sent for an officer. They left the house immediately, and I followed them. They all stopped and talked together opposite a chemist's shop. Thompson then crossed over and bought some apples of a woman, the others walked on, and stopped at the corner of Duke-street; she then joined them, and all walked on towards Houndsditch. Davis came up and took them.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DAVIS. I am a beadle. I took the prisoners to the watch-house, and found three bad shillings, five good ones, and two half-crowns, on Williams; two half-crowns, eleven good shillings, and one bad one mixed with them, on Myers, and a bad one in a coal-box just behind her; she was within reach of it. Bacon called out, that she was secreting something in her mouth. I found a bad shilling and a good sixpence in her hand, which was up at her mouth. At this moment an apple-woman came in and said, it was the sixpence she had given her in change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280055"></xptr>for a bad shilling, which she produced. She said she received it from Myers.</p>

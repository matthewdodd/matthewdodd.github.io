            . I am clerk to Mr. Laxton. This entry is my writing - I took it from the verbal account of the prisoner; here is no entry of 5s. from Mr. Wood - the prisoner never afterwards came to me, and said he had omitted it; he paid 6l. 6s. on the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. LAXTON. Q. When did you part with the prisoner? A. On the 16th of December, I think it was; and he had never accounted to me for the 5s. received from Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No. The prisoner has been in my service about three years; there are not a great variety of accounts between us; his receipts were not in general more than 4l. or 5l. in a day - I understand he has three children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he receive a-week? A. I think under 30s., but his place, altogether, was worth not less than 2l. a-week.</p>

            . I keep an eating-house in Blandford-street. I paid 5s. to the prisoner, on the 20th of November, for his master; I have the receipt, which he sent in by my servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it you, or your servant, who paid him? A. I sent the money out by my servant, who is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the servant give him the money? A. Yes: he brought the receipt in, and I gave him the money - I saw him pay it - I had a good view of it from my parlour, which has a glass door - this is the receipt - it is the prisoner's writing - I have often seen him write - (read).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have often taken from 10l. to 12l. a-day, and I have no book; I give it in by word-of-mouth, and might book it to somebody else; this is the only way I can account for it; I have bad boys to book it several times, and they have often left off to go and draw beer while they were about it.</p>

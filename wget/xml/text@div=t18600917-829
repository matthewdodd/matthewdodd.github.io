                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, residing at Camberwell—I have also a shop ou Brixton hill—I was sleeping at that shop on the night of 20th August last—I went to bed about 11 o'clock—before doing so I secured the shop myself—the shutters were all right, and the jewellery in the window all correct—in the course of the night I was awoke by a sudden crash and noise in the shop—it was between ten minutes and a quarter past 1 o'clock—I observed the time by my clock—I got up instantly and went into the shop—I found the crashing was at the window—I could not see anything outside—from the noise and confusion I hardly knew what to do, but I went to the front door, and before I could open it the parties were gone—they had left this small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> behind, stuck in between the bar and the shutters—I found a number of my watches, I think eleven, lying on the pavement, and this brick, or piece of stone, lying in front of the shop—there were no such stones lying about there, it must have been brought for the purpose—the shutter had marks of the crowbar on it—it was not broken, but driven on one side—half the window was broken in, more than sufficient to enable a person's hand to take the watches—it is a plate-glass window—I shouted out "Police!" as loud as I could—in consequence of something I heard an hour or two afterwards I went to a place opposite to the Somers-road; to a place shown me by the witness, Brazier—Halsey, the policeman, was with me—I there found these two gold watches, a silver watch, and a variety of gold chains—they were just within a fencing close by the foot<lb></lb>path—Halsey was with me when I found them—these other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found by the policeman—they are my property, and formed part of the stock that was in my window on the night in question—these tickets were shown to me by Brazier—I can swear to them, they came off the watches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman at some water-works on the Brixton-road—I was on duty, on the morning of 21st August, leading up the rise of Brixton-hill, close to the Somers-road—about a quarter to 1 o'clock I heard a rattle spring—I went to see what it was—when I got to the top of the hill I saw Mr. Monks standing outside his door, with his shop window broken, and part of his property lying on the steps; he was picking it up—it was Mr. Monks' rattle that I had heard spring—I went back again to my watch box, and stopped about a quarter of an hour—I then heard footsteps coming down Somers-road, and presently saw two men come down—they were peeping round the corner of the pier, as if looking to see whether anybody was coming—they directly took arm-in-arm and away they shot—I went after them directly—when I had followed them about twenty yards, I saw some<lb></lb>body coming up the road, who I thought was a policeman, and I stepped out into the road and collared one of the prisoners, and said, "I shall have you two locked up on suspicion of the robbery"—the policeman came up, and I said to him, "Take these two men in charge on suspicion of the robbery"—Felton said, "You are drunk"—I said, "If I am drunk, I shall not lose you," and we took them to the station—I afterwards showed Mr. Monks the place where I first detained them, and then some property was found—nothing had passed along from the time the rattle sprang until I apprehended the prisoners—I found some property myself, and was with Halsey when he found some—it was found at the spot where I first detained the prisoners, on the rise of Brixton-hill, opposite No. 5—I found these</p>

               <p>tickets in the Tulse-hill road, and I was with Mr. Monks when he found these chains and watches—I had not seen the prisoners in the Tulse-hill road, but you can come from the Tulse-hill road down Somers-road into the Brixton-road—you might go from Mr. Monks' house to the place where I saw the prisoners in about three or four minutes, and in four or five minutes-to the place where I apprehended them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

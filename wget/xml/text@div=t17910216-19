I will make room for you, and I held the curtain with my hand, to keep the curtain from hurting Mr. Peatt; and in a moment I felt a pressure on my groin, and then put my left hand under my right waistcoat pocket, and missed my seals; I thought my watch was gone; then I put down my right hand: I had three seals and a key hanging to my ribbon, which were gone; but I afterwards found I had not lost my watch; but thinking I had, the first word I said was, my God! I have lost my watch; and I said, Mr. Peatt, will not you assist me. and then I found an arm under my right hand waistcoat pocket, which I seized; I kept hold of the hand, and never let it go for some time; I observed it belonged to Mackenzie, as I found his name was afterwards; I said, you have got my watch; he said, I have not; at that moment of time I observed a <rs id="t17910216-19-deflabel115" type="occupation">boy</rs>

I said, I will thank you for your protection, Sir: I could get no farther; and immediately I heard something drop; I did not observe who it dropped from; I rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160027"></xptr>think from Gilberthorpe; and I saw my seals on the ground; I picked them up, and took care of the lads; they were mine; three cornelian stone seals, set in gold, and a gold watch key; I have had one of the seals this four or five and twenty years; and the other two, two and twenty years; I went into court and Lord Kenyon committed the two prisoners: nobody was by at the time the seals were picked up but the two prisoners and Mr. Martyr; the seals and key were cut away from the watch: I received a letter that night from Mr. Dalton, of the Crown Office, to send them to him; I sent them by my servant, and he brought them back: I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. You pushed very much to get in? - Yes; to hear Judge Buller; he was speaking: I suppose I was three or four minutes, when I felt a tickling on the lower part of my belly: nobody was near me but Mr. Peatt; nobody was near me by a couple of yards.</p>
               <p>Who passed you or came near you during the time you observed what passed? - I did not observe any body, nor any body to come to look into the court: I had the curtain in my hand.</p>
               <p>Who was standing by the curtain? - Mr. Peatt, and I the outside of him.</p>
               <p>Were there not persons looking on the outside of the curtain as well as himself? - No; there could not; I did not see any body; they could not peep in: they could not look without my feeling it.</p>


               <p>Any body trying to come in would of course have pushed you? - Then of course I should have looked.</p>
               <p>That is not the way to answer? - I felt no push.</p>
               <p>Was not Mackenzie at the time you felt the push coming in? - I felt some sort of tickling at the bottom of my belly.</p>
               <p>Would not his trying to come into court have given you that same sort of sensation? - No; it would not: my arm was up: the waistband of my breeches was extended: Mackenzie was on my side; I was nearest to the hall: nobody could come behind me and the curtain all before me: my back was out of the door: I stood fronting the door.</p>
               <p>With the curtain in your left hand, and he came to your right hand? - I cannot answer you any other, was I to stand here eight and forty hours.</p>
               <p>You are not new to this court; you have attended here very often: give me a plain answer; first of all, was his hand under your pocket? was it as my hand is now? - I caught his arm close to my side; his left hand next to my side.</p>
               <p>Was the hand under your waistcoat? - Yes; it was; the hand was not clear off my hip bone.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie made no answer about having your watch, as Gilberthorpe did? - He did not. I will not swear from whom the seals fell; but if I was inclined to swear, I should swear that they came from Gilberthorpe, because he kept fumbling: Mackenzie had only one hand at liberty; if he had any thing he could not have got rid of it only with one hand: I heard the seals fall.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that string? - About five months; I cannot see that it was cut at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could not you find that it was cut? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time you say this ribbon was cut you say that the seals dropped off; there must have been knots to tie the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no part of the ribbon that can shew us by the sight of it, whether they fell from wear, or whether they fell from cutting? - No; there is not. I saw no piece of ribbon upon the ground: they did cut both ribbons: I told Lord Kenyon I did not see the piece of ribbon: I saw no ribbon with the seals: I am sure it was cut double, because I carried the watch, and held it up in the court; it was cut strait off; even; both parts alike.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say, that there was this remarkable difference in the answers of the two persons; when you charged Mackenzie he said, I have not your watch; when you charged Gilberthorpe he said, Sir, I have not your watch, you have your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160028"></xptr>watch: did he assign any reason to you, or say how he came under your legs? - No, Sir; he said, let me go; I am a very good lad; I am son to an apothecary in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of February, the day mentioned in the indictment, I was in the Court of King's Bench, just within the court; there was a considerable scuffle; a noise without the curtain; which I suppose continued two or three minutes; I went out of the court and saw Mr. Thornton, the prosecutor, very much agitated; I said, what is the occasion of this noise? Mr. Thornton said, I have been robbed, and that the two people that were near him, who were the prisoners, were the people that had taken his watch; I particularly observed the string of his watch hanging out of his pocket; and I particularly observed that the string appeared to have been cut, and that there was no knot, and that I am positive of: he immediately took his hand out of his waistcoat pocket, and said, God bless me! here is my seals, my watch is safe; to the best of my recollection; I will not be positive: he hardly knew what he did: I think, to the best of my recollection, I saw him stooping when I came out of the court, but I will not be positive; and when he said, I had been robbed! I have lost my watch, I observed the string of his watch hanging out of his pocket; and I am perfectly satisfied there was no knot to it: I said, secure the people, and bring them into court; and they were taken into court immediately after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you saw him, you say, you think he was so confused he did not know what he was about? - He did not.</p>

               <p>I am tipstaff to Lord Kenyon. I searched Gilberthorpe by the desire of the court; I found a large clasp knife upon him: I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Nothing was found on Mackenzie? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find this knife open or shut in his pocket? - Shut.</p>

               <p>That knife opens with two blades, one of which seems to open with great difficulty, and the other is so blunt it is a doubt whether it would cut a ribbon, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton. A man with a silver-laced hat said, there are your seals. There were five or six persons; a great many offered me assistance.</p>
               <p>Who said, there are the seals? - A person a yard from me.</p>
               <p>Was that the servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, I thought there had been nobody with Mr. Martyr? - No more there was at first. At the moment the seals dropped, they heard them, and said, Sir, there is your seals; it was a stout man, in a silver-laced hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mackenzie. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

I said, no; he said, you have my seals, and they were on the floor, and he picked them up; I was searched, and stopped, and sent to Newgate; we went to the publick house, where we had something to eat; I gave the gentleman the knife; presently came in Mr. Thornton and a lawyer; he said, he had done what he had; he said, he should be very glad if he could have my boots pulled off, for there might be some other property in the boots; but the constable said, there was no room convenient; and they were pulled off there, and nothing was found in them.</p>
               <p>Court to Thornton. Did you hear any conversation between the two prisoners while you was at the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Gilberthorpe say any thing to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the seals nearer to the prisoner than to you? - We all stood of a row: the men were near me.</p>

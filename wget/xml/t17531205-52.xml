            . The prisoner has applied to me since on several occasions to prove the marriage, and I gave evidence of it at the court of King's Bench, on the prisoner's request; they were always concluded to be man and wife. I was not intimate enough in the family to know whether they cohabited together, but am very positive they were married.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any certain judgment of their cohabiting together as man and wife?</p>
               <p>Greason. I cannot say whether they did or no.</p>
               <p>James Drummond. I was clerk to this chapel at that time. I gave away Mary Reith so the prisoner at the bar, and remember him very well, having heard Mrs. Keith ask Mrs. Reith the morning they came to be married, if she was going to be married to that man; they were married at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What ceremony was said?</p>
               <p>Drummond. The ceremony of the church of England; the prisoner made a very handsome appearance, and was exceedingly well dress'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of their living together?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, I do not, but have heard they lived together down in Essex.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon the prisoner, and see whether he is the man that was married or no.</p>
               <p>Drummond. I am positive he is the man, having seen him several times since.</p>

            . I married the prisoner at the bar on the 5th of February, 1749. I was a widow at that time, and had some children; he came dress'd as a merchant. We were married according to the ceremony of the church of England, and Mr. Humphry gave me away. Some time after this he plundered me of every thing, plate, money, and jewels, caused me to mortgage my estate, and took the money from me; he carried me from place to place, then over to Holland, then to other places; he plundered me of every thing, to the destruction of me and my family.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he carry you over to Holland?</p>
               <p>Hudson. With pretence to settle there, and then he went away and left me. When he came first to me he came as a widower and merchant, and a man in good circumstances.</p>

            . I am a wholesale linen-draper, and live in Watling-street, nearly opposite Mr. Barnard, who is a <rs id="t18280410-69-viclabel390" type="occupation">wholesale Manchester draper</rs>

On the 27th of March, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I had some business with Mr. Barnard; I went over and as I was going to enter the passage of his house, I observed a light cart, and a man step from the shaft of it on to the curb - it stood just by Mr. Barnard's door, and on my entering the passage I found the prisoner in the passage, which is fourteen feet long - he was at the further end of it, and had got a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100059"></xptr>sheet full of goods on his right shoulder; he turned round to come out, and hit his left foot against a package of goods, which caused him to stagger forward, and the sheet of goods rolled off his shoulder - they fell down at my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had the prisoner got the wrapper of goods on his shoulder, coming out with it? A. No doubt of it; when they fell at my feet, the man, who stepped off the shaft of the cart, appeared at the door; the prisoner then looked at that man - he took no notice of me, but said to the man at the door, "D-n your soul what did you do that for?" he repeated those words again; I then said, "I am afraid all is not right here;" I then opened the warehouse door, and calling out, asked if Mr. Barnard was within; I was answered by a little boy that he was not within; I turned round as quick as I could, and found the men both gone, and Mr. Barnard standing at my right shoulder, in the passage - all this happened in a very short time indeed; I told him what had happened, and said, "There the men go in that cart; pursue them, and take them if you can, and I will watch your goods;" Mr. Barnard went in pursuit, and took the prisoner, who I am certain is the man who was in the passage as I have described - the other man escaped; I have no doubt of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The goods stood in the passage as if to be removed? A. They were in sheets, to be sent to the west end of the town, I believe - they were tied up in a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man swore at the prisoner? A. Yes; the prisoner was moving the goods towards the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which of them said "D-n your soul,&amp;c.?" A. The prisoner, and that raised my suspicion.</p>

            . This is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street - I reside there. As I was entering the passage, I saw my friend Nelson and some goods, which I had before superintended being tied up in the sheets, and put at the extremity of the passage, I found laying on the threshold of the door - I had seen them within twenty minutes at the end of the passage; the prisoner was pointed out to me, with another man, in a chaise-cart; I pursued down Watling-street - they turned the corner into Sise-lane, galloping as hard as they could; I pursued them to Bucklersbury, and there the cart ran into the wheel of another cart, which stopped them; the other man jumped out, and ran away - the prisoner made a leap out, with the whip in his hand, and brandished it about; I caught hold of him - I imagine that the prisoner drove, as he had the whip; I have the package here - it contains fifteen pieces of calico, and is worth about 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; there is "P. Barnard and Co." over my door, but I have no partner, either acting or sleeping.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Bucklersbury, and heard Mr. Barnard crying, "Stop that cart!" the prisoner and another were driving very furiously down - I pursued them, and saw the other jump out and escape; the prisoner jumped out, and another person caught hold of him - he was thrown down, and secured; they galloped as hard as they could, but another cart stopped them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Cheap Ward. I was standing by the Green Man, public-house, Bucklersbury, and saw the prisoner in the cart with another, turn very furiously from Sise-lane, down the Bury; Mr. Barnard called out - the other man leaped from the cart, and then the prisoner jumped out; I held him till Mr. Barnard came up - the property is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I own I was coming by at the time the cart was there; the man asked me to lend him a hand up with the goods, which I did - he let it out of his arms, and went away directly from the door; I heard a call of"Stop the cart;" I ran forward after the cart, and because I laid hold of the horse's head, they took hold of me, and called me the thief.</p>
               <p>MR. NELSON. The other man had not helped him up with the goods.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th October, I kept the Crown and Sceptre, Ware Street, City, I have left since—I saw my house properly closed and secured that night—about 5.30 a.m. I was awakened by the police, went downstairs and missed the iron safe, which was all right the night before—there was between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in it, and one Spanish Bond, No. 29,690; three bills of exchange, which had not reached maturity, and eighty-seven returned checks—a button was knocked off the fanlight over the front door, and the glass was broken—the opening was quite large enough for a person to enter; I got information from a Mrs. Sixpence, where my money was gone—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash-box that was in the safe, but there is none of the money there—the safe is at the police-station—I identified it as mine.</p>

I lived at 10, Ware Street, with my husband, at the time of the robbery—that house faces the public-house—on the morning of 12th October, after 3 o'clock, I was awakened by knockings at the street door—the prisoner with his wife occupied the back parlour—I saw him help to carry a safe in with another man, "whom I could not swear to; the front door was shut after they carried it in—about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards, as near as I can say I heard a noise in the room; the door was closed—I still kept on the stairs thinking whatever they were doing at that time in the morning—in about half an hour I saw them come out of the room and go down the kitchen stairs—there is a back-door to the house, and a way out into a place called Dirty Lane—I then went to bed and know nothing more, but I heard footsteps on the stairs—the safe looked quite black; it was dark—I did not speak to the prisoner's wife—I hallooed as I went upstairs "You are a lot of thieves in this house."</p>

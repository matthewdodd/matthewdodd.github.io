            . I am a Policeman. On the 27th of February, I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's shop; the prosecutor gave him in charge for stealing a paper of gold - the knees of his trowsers were dirty as if he had fallen down; I went to Compton-passage with the prosecutor about ten minutes after two o'clock - I found a small portion of gold which I have here; as I took the prisoner to the watch-house, he said he was not the man who was in the shop.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. On the 27th of February, about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock, I was going up Compton-passage; I heard a cry of Stop thief! I instantly saw the prisoner turn the corner, and come towards me running very fast; I said, Halloo! and instantly stopped him, and as I stopped him he fell down; the street was dirty, I let him get up, he then said "It was not me" - I took him to the top of the passage, and met the prosecutor at the end of the passage in about half a minute; he said to the prisoner,"Where is my gold you have robbed me of?" the prisoner said, he had not got any gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the passage in which you took the prisoner short or long? A. I suppose about two hundred yards long; I was ten or twelve yards from the end of the passage; I did not go back to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Nine witnesses gave the prisoner an unusually good character for honesty and steady conduct.</p>

               <p>Very strongly recommended to Mercy by the Prosecutor and Jury, on account of his excellent character.</p>

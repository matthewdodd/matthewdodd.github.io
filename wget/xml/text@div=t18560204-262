                  </hi>. I am examiner of accounts in the East India Docks. On Christmas ere, at a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was at an oyster stall in High-street, Shadwell—while there, the prisoner came up, put her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I saw it in her hand—she ran away, and I followed her—I did not overtake her, but was not far off her—some men, her confederates I presume, came up—I think there were four men; one of them put his arm behind me, and threw me down on my back—the prisoner said, "All right, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, I have got it, all right;" or words to that effect—I then missed my gold watch and chain—the prisoner came to me when I was down—this was at Palmers-folly, which is a court or alley, right opposite the Bull's Head—my watch was safe in my waistcoat pocket when I was at the oyster stall, and was fastened by a gold chain—the prisoner ran into the first house past Palmer's-folly, and I gave information to the police—I had had a glass or two with some friends, but was perfectly sober—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant in an outfitting shop, No. 99 and 100, St. George's-street. On Christmas eve, I saw the prosecutor outside the Bull's Head, eating oysters, and saw the prisoner put her hand under his waistcoat, turn round, and run across the Highway—the prosecutor fol<lb></lb>lowed her, and struck at her with an umbrella, but missed her—three or four young men <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Up the Folly, up the Folly!"—she ran up the Folly, and I followed her a little way; she went in at the first door—Mr. Henry tried the door, but it was fast, and four young men came and tripped him up, and one of them took his watch, pulled the guard from over his neck, and then ran away—I had seen the prisoner before, and know the house that she went into.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were you first spoken to about this to become a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Last week; it will be about a week to-morrow since I was asked I to come here—Mr. Henry asked me to come; he met me in the street, and I said, "Good evening, Mr. Henry"—he said, "Good evening, you are the young man that saw my accident that evening?"—I said, "Yes," and on</p>

               <p>that he asked me to come here, and said if I did not he should subpoena me—I believe the persons next door had told him where to find me—Pal<lb></lb>mer's-folly is by the end of our shop, and I was talking to a woman who lives next door—I was on one side of the road, and they were on the other—I was right opposite the public house.</p>

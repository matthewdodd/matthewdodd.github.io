               <p>See if you see him? - There he is.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - No, I saw him at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with him? - Yes, three more men.</p>
               <p>What did he threaten to blow out your brains for? - Because I seared out.</p>
               <p>What did you scream out for? - One of them snatched my bundle, and another of them went to pick my mother's pocket, upon which I screamed out twice, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250074"></xptr> it was that the prisoner threatened to blow my brains out.</p>

               <p>Did any body take your bundle from you? - Yes, a tall man, not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the prisoner threatened you? - Before.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the man snatch your bundle from you? - He went a little way before, and then turned back and snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he snatch it away in a violent manner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When this man threatened to blow your brains out, what happened after that? - I clapped my hands together, and said, pray, Sir, I will be a good girl, and not scream any more.</p>
               <p>What became of him and the rest after that? - They then left me and my mother, and all four of them then went away to some other man, and took my bundle away with them.</p>
               <p>Now are you quite sure that the prisoner was one of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw him at the justice's? - I believe a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Now when you saw him at the justice's, who pointed him out to you, who shewed him to you? - I pointed at him myself.</p>
               <p>What as soon as you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there more people with him at the justices? - A great many more, but I believe nobody belonging to him.</p>
               <p>And you picked him out from amongst them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think you should have known any of the other three men if you had seen them? - No, I cannot justly say that I should.</p>
               <p>How came you to observe him particularly beyond the rest? - I looked at him more than I did at the rest, for the rest did not look at me.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened at the time of the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then could you in that state of affright observe the face of the man, so as to be sure that you could know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You think you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether that is this man? - No. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not you persuaded by the runners to pick out a man in a brown jacket? - No, Sir, the man had a brown jacket, with double breasted buttons on, when he stopped me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any body persuade you to pitch upon the prisoner as the man? - The justice desired me to look round and see if I could find the man that stopped me, and I looked round and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell you to point at a man in a brown jacket? - No.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on that he had when he robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it by his face or his clothes that you knew him? - By his face and his clothes too, but particularly by the brown jacket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not dispute but she will say what she has, because it is an old grudge.</p>

               <p>What happened after that? - The tall man said something to the other, and immediately the prisoner at the bar came to my left arm, and another short man came to my right arm; I turned and said, what do you want with me; the prisoner said, your money to be sure.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing more to the little girl? - My little girl screamed out, and the prisoner said, you little bitch, if you scream I will settle you, I will blow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250075"></xptr> your little bitch's brains out; I says to the prisoner I have but little money.</p>

               <p>I had Mr. Fogg here yesterday, the churchwarden, that I was to have gone to work for when the frost was over, but he is gone out of town. On the 22d of January I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250079"></xptr> had a few words, and I drank with one Mr. Whiteway; and one Mr. Marnes who is here asked me to drink; I said, you do not owe me so much good will, ever since you belonged to the rendezvous and I was pressed; I said I cannot stop, for ever since my last misfortune I never go to any house but my own, and I am obliged to be very particular; he knows he always takes me up on suspicion of any thing that is done on the water, and when I was going away Mr. Marnes said, I have a suspicion of you Charles; says I, why should you be always troubling of me; I said you will take away my life one of these days; this was on the Thursday, I was brought before a magistrate on the Friday, and committed till Monday; on the Monday morning, this gentlewoman that was here just now came to me, in a very ragged dress, and looked very hard at me, I took her to be something of a ballad singer; says I, good woman, is it you that is to swear against me; I do not know, says she, but what it is; I was ordered to pull my coat off, and go over to the justices, which I did; the woman said she believed it was me by my jacket. I hope you will not be affronted with me for detaining you so long; in the evening the woman was brought and a girl, the girl swore punctual to me.</p>

               <p>Court to Whiteway. When was the prisoner taken up? - He came to me on the Thursday night, as he mentions, about ten o'clock, to give me information of a robbery that he was going to do that evening; that he was going to rob that house where his sister-in-law lives; his sister-in-law was to let him in, and he desired I would be somewhere near the house, that I might detect him in the matter, in order to bring him in as an evidence; upon this I took him to the public house, where our follow officers were, and I consulted on the matter, and I then thought it was better to lodge him in the house that night; I did so there was nothing done that night, but he was detained on suspicion of other robberies, and he was detained from that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I can bring proof where I lodge, that since last September I never was out after eight o'clock at night, and I was on the parish, I had two shillings every other day from Mr. Fogg; once on a time I was tried here for piracy, but not for any thing on land, and was I given to any thing that way, I could get more gains on the water than I could on land.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>He was humbly recommended to mercy by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg, for Christ's sake, to speak one word; that is, we were all set down to dinner, and that young man, Fox, was not there every day, he only came in that day, I do not suppose he may remember; I am sure I am a dead man, for Mr. Marnes, who is one of the runners, had a warrant against me, and he said he never would serve that till he had the forty pounds; he sells many a poor fellow; and God bless you all.</p>

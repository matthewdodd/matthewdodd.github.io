            . As I was coming through Caple-street, I saw the prisoner come by the prosecutor's door and catch down the handkerchiefs which were hanging at the door, pinned to a gown sleeve; he put them under his arm; I laid hold of him when he had got about five yards from the door; I found the handkerchiefs and two hats under his arm at the same time. (The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>I went to buy one of these handkerchiefs, as I had hold of them the wind blew pretty hard and they came down into my hand; I did not snatch them down.</p>
               <p>Ragg. When I took him he offered me handkerchiefs and hats to let him go.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe he was so drunk he did not know what he said.</p>

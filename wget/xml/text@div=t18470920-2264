                  </hi> I am shopwoman to Mr. James Dawson—he keeps a shoe-warehouse in Newington-causeway. The prisoner brought a pair of shoes to be repaired, and she came on the following Wednesday to fetch them—she bought a pair of boots, and paid for them—this pair of shoes, produced, came out of our shop—we have sold a great many pairs, but not of this make—the prisoner sat with her back to the place where these shoes were—she was sober—the boots were 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair, and the shoes 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure these shoes were there in the morning.</p>

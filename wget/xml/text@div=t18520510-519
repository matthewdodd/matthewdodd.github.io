                  </hi>. I am ten years old in Sept.; I live with my father and mother at 29, King-street, Smithfield. On 4th May I met the prisoner at the comer of Farringdon-street—he said, "Have you got any money?"—I said, "Yes"—I had four shillings and two sixpences—he said, "Shall I put it into a piece of brown paper for you?"—I said, "Yes," and gave it to him—he gave me a paper which I thought contained the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and went away—I went to a shop about five minutes after, and discovered it was only a penny in the paper—I described the person to my mother and at the police station—I saw him again the next evening in Fleet-street—I told my father, and he had him locked up—he was not pointed out to me by anybody.</p>

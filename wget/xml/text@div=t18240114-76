            . I am servant to Mr. Gilbertson. The prisoner had nowhere to clean himself but his bed-room. On the 1st of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I met him coming up the kitchen stairs, but do not know what room he went to. On the Sunday after Christmas-day, the prosecutor was gone into the area to brush his clothes - the prisoner said the prosecutor had saved six sovereigns in master's service; and on Saturday, when the prosecutor was enquiring about two sovereigns and a half which he had lost, the prisoner put down a shilling, and said it was all he had.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Gilbertson, but not when this money was lost. I met the prisoner on the 30th of December, and rode round Chelsea with him. I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140035"></xptr>was out of place, and had pawned my clothes for 3 l., and expected to go about the situation I had before, and did not wish to part with my clothes - if he would lend me 10 s. I would give him security; he called in Long-acre, and redeemed a watch, and tendered a sovereign for it, and on my leaving him, he lent me 10 s., and said if I met him on Thursday night, he would lend me 5 s. more; I gave him two duplicates as security, and told him not to redeem the things. On Thursday, I was waiting by the house, and met him with my coat, of which I had given him the duplicate - he said he had taken it out, for it was only running up to interest, and if I would hold it, he would go and redeem the rest of the things, which were pawned opposite the house, for 2 l. I called him back, and told him he was not to take them out, for I would pay him to-morrow. We went and had two or three pots of beer, and I saw him with three sovereigns.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked what he had done with Adams's sovereigns; he said, he had not got them; I found eighteen shillings and one farthing in copper on him, which he said belonged to his master; his master said,</p>
               <p>"Why then did you want to borrow 5 s.;" he said, he had not sufficient change. I asked where he got the money to redeem his watch; he said that was nothing to me. I found a new coat in his box; he said, he bought some duplicates of a young man on Tuesday for 15 s., and redeemed the coat for 1 l. I found a purse at the bottom of his bedstead, containing two sovereigns and sixteen shillings; he had said frequently, that I should find nothing there, and told me not to tumble his shirts; he said, he had saved 2 l. 16 s. a long time ago; his master said.</p>
               <p>"You have always been poor since you have been here, how could you save this?" he said, if he had paid his debts he could not have saved it.</p>

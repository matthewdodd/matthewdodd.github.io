               <p>Court. Q.Then the buildings belong to the Corporation? - A. Yes; about the middle of March, the constable and watchman came and acquainted me that the lead was stolen off a part of those buildings, and desired I would come to the Justice Room; I went there, and was bound over to prosecute; that is all I know about it; I went to the premises, and found the lead was gone; it was all affixed to one building; the plumber can speak more particularly about it, he can ascertain the pieces of lead that were missing on the 12th or 13th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of the building? - A.What we call the front projection.</p>
               <p>Q.How much? - A.About half a hundred weight; there was about sixty pounds weight that was found upon the prisoner, and there was missing about another sixty pounds.</p>

             Sworn. - I am a watchman belonging to St. Andrews; it wanted about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, on Friday night, the 11th of March, when I saw four boys coming down Field-lane; as soon as I went up to them, Thomas Murky throwed the lead down; I catched hold of him directly, and the others ran down Field-lane; he began to cry, and then I delivered him to the other watchman that came over,

               <p>Court. Q.When did you last see this lead before it was taken away? - A.It was put on in the beginning of March; I saw it about three days after it was first put on; I called upon Mr. Skyring the Sunday following, and he said the lead was taken off the front; it was off from the cornice; I saw that there were two pieces taken away, a circular piece and a straight piece; it was the same lead that was on the cornice; I can prove it by the number that was on it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the number? - A. No. 1807; I saw the lead at Guildhall with the number on it; I can venture to swear that it is the piece of lead that was cut off; there were two pieces lost, but only one found.</p>

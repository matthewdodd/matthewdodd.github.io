                  </hi>. I am a single woman. In Oct. last, I was living with the prisoner at 6, Douglas-street, Westminster—we had lived there together three weeks, but I have lived with him three months altogether—I had a female child of my own living with me, named Mary Elizabeth Rey<lb></lb>nolds—it was seventeen months old in Oct.—the prisoner was not the father of the child—on 23rd Oct., I left my child alive in bed asleep at 8 o'clock in the evening—I put the child to bed in a lavender frock and a shirt, and went out, leaving no one in the room with it—I went out to look for the prisoner; I met a friend of his, and we went to a public-house, and had something to drink, and not having had much to eat, the drink overcame me, and I was locked up all night—I was taken before the Magistrate in the morning, and discharged—I got back to my house about half-past 10 or 11 in the morning—I went into the room we occupied, and found my child dead in the bed—its face was covered with bruises, it had none the night before when I went out—some of the people in the house spoke to me, and I went about 12 o'clock to the Equitable Gas Works—I went alone, and found the prisoner there—I said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> you have killed my child, for it is dead!"—he said, "Dead!"—I said, "Yes; and its face is covered with bruises"—he said, "You should have been at home; I have murdered it; what to do I do not know; for I had better b y well go and drown myself at once"—he said nothing else to my recollection—I spoke to a policeman at the gas-works, and he was taken into custody—this shirt (<hi rend="italic">produced by Millerman</hi>)is the one the child had on when I left it that night, and this other one is the prisoner's shirt.</p>

In Oct. last, I had a sister living at 6, Douglas-street, Westminster, and on the even<lb></lb>ing of 23rd I was in her room, on the first floor, adjoining the one where the prisoner and the last witness lived—I went there about 4 o'clock—I did not know that the child's mother was out—I did not notice her going out—my sister's room door was a little way open—I heard the prisoner come home, and heard him come up stairs—I thought by his manner he was in liquor—when he got on the landing, I heard him say "All right" three times, and he went into the back room, and shut the door—the child was then quiet, and I supposed asleep—about five minutes after, I heard it cry, as though it had been slapped; and while it was crying the prisoner said, "You little b—, if you are not quiet, I will kill you"—I then heard the child slapped, and then a thump, as though it was thrown down, and it screamed very violently—he continued swearing at the child, and called it the same name again; and said if any one interfered with him, he would serve them the same—I then heard a noise, as though he was shaking the child; the child cried, as though it was being shaken—the prisoner then said he was miserable, his life was a misery—he knew he should be hung, and he might as well be hung out of the way—I then heard the child, as though it was thrown down again and it screamed very violently again—my sister was down stairs washing; I called to her to come and take care of the children, and look after her baby, and I then went away—as near as I can judge, it was' about 7 when he came, home, and it was about a quarter to 9 when I left—I got so nervous I could not stay any longer—this occupied from the time he came in, till a quarter to 9—I heard the last noise, as though the child was thrown on the floor, just as I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Westminster. On 24th Oct. shortly after 2 o'clock, I was called to this house in Douglas-street, and found the body of a female child there—Millerman and the superintendent of police were there—I examined the body, and found sixteen bruises on the surface and extremities—they were severe bruises, most of them, and appeared to be of several days' standing—the left arm and right leg had been recently frac<lb></lb>tured—there was a contused wound under the left eye, and the head and face were covered with bruises—there was one very extensive one covering the whole right side of the head, and there was blood extravasated under the scalp—the wound and contusions on the head were of recent date—the contusions were such as might have been produced by the child being thrown violently down—on 30th Oct. I made an internal examination, but before doing so, I found an old fracture of the left collar-bone, and some bruises of a circular character on the calf of the left leg, and on the instep, with indentations, apparently occasioned by the marks of teeth—those marks were recent—they were from the teeth of a human being—on making the internal examination, I found a large clot of blood, extravasated, beneath the scalp, covering nearly the whole of the right side of the head, "and on opening the head I found blood, extravasated on the brain, corresponding with the external injury—that was the cause of death—the external injuries would, in my opinion, cause that extravasation of blood, which produced the death.</p>

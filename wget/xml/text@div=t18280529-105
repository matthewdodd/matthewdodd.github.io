On the 18th of April, she came to my shop between eleven and twelve o'clock; she went to a bin of leather, as she generally did, to look out the soles: she stooped down - I had some suspicion; I watched her, and saw her put some soles under her shawl, and then take up some more; at last she brought four soles to the counter, and asked what they came to; I said they were marked, and they came to 8 1/2d. - I said, "What are you going to do with the others?" she said, "I have no more;" I said, "What, have you not some under your shawl?" I put my hand to open her shawl, and she took out these soles, put them down, and began to beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. She had dealt with you some time? A. Yes; it was customary for persons to go the bin to look at the leather - I am sure she did not say she had other soles, and offer to pay for them.</p>

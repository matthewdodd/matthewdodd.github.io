                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Weldon, and live in Bath-place, Dalston. On the 29th of March I went to Hackney church with my two daughters—I saw three men, one of whom was the prisoner, come down from the gallery—they pushed against me in the body of the church and by the vestry—they were not passing out with the congrega<lb></lb>tion—they came down and met me—I felt a touch at my pocket—I looked about, and saw the prisoner and another—I did not say any thing at that time, but looked at him—I felt another pressure—the prisoner and two others were then near me—we went on to the church gate, and there I felt some one touching my pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "I beg your pardon,'—I turned to my husband, and said, "This man has got his hand in my pocket"—he said, "If you say that, I will stop him"—I felt, and my parse was gone—it contained three sovereigns, some half-crowns, some shillings, and some sixpences—my husband went up to the prisoner, and took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—in going along he said, "Pardon me, and I will give you money, any thing I have"—he offered me both gold and silver—he said,</p>

               <p>"I will give you all I have," and his manner was very pressing—this is my purse—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my mother. I was at church on this occasion—I saw some men come from under the gallery, but I did not notice the prisoner as one of them—I heard my mother say to the prisoner, "What are you doing?"—he begged her pardon—her pocket was open, as if a hand bad been in it—she felt, and her purse was gone—the prisoner had a cloak on at first—after he had gone away I saw him take the cloak off—I heard him say, "I am charged with stealing a lady's watch."</p>

                  </hi>.

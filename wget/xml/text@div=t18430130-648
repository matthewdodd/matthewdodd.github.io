                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. On the 1st of Feb., about a quarter after eleven o'clock, I went into my next door neighbour's shop—I returned into my own shop, and saw the prisoner standing at the back of the shop, with the bacon id her hand behind her—she saw me, and put it back to where she took it from—I had placed it on a stand at the back of the shop ten minutes before—I went out<lb></lb>side, and stood opposite the shop, without taking any notice—in a few minutes she came out—I went in, and the piece of bacon I had seen her put back on the stand was gone—I went after her, and found her about two hundred yards off—I tapped her on the shoulder, and told her to come back with me—she said, "What for?"—I said she had some bacon in her lap which did not belong to her—she said she had not, but as I brought her back, she said she had, and was very sorry for what she had done, she did it through distress—I took it out of her apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What was the lady's age? A. As near as I can judge, between seventy and eighty - it might be seventy-five; there was that kind of habit in her which I should expect from a lady who had married early in life, and lived much abroad - she lived in lodgings much below her station; I believe that resulted from penurious habits - she went to lodge there on the 2nd of April, and had lodged there previously, between 1822 and 1824; I called on her there several times - I cannot recollect how often: I do not recollect where she went to lodge after that - I saw her repeatedly; I was scarcely a week without seeing her - I saw her when she lodged in Carey-street, in 1829, repeatedly, and she used to come either to my house or to some of my relations, every week; I sent her to the West Indies twice, at my own expense; before she went to Carter's I understood she lived in Portugal-street, after she left Carter's the first time; I did not visit her there, being much occupied in my profession, and she usually called on me or my family - I saw her last on the 1st of June; I left town the next morning for Brighton, for my own health, and left her better than I had seen her from the commencement of her illness in February - I left her dropsical and ill, but expected she would recover; she kept her bed when I left - she was confined to her bed all the time she was at Carter's; her complaint required it - I did not direct any medical friend to call on her; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100155"></xptr>did not think it necessary, and it was my opinion she would not submit to any advice but my own - I had great difficulty to get her to submit to mine; she was of a determined mind, and would have her own will in every thing - she dressed respectable: not like a pauper - I think I saw her repeatedly at Carter's, but not so much as at Carey-street; I considered her convalescent on the 26th of March - I may have seen her once or twice a week at Carter's, but not for the last fortnight, till the night before I went to Brighton, having been ill myself; she was the only person I visited - she was confined there with the consequence of her former disease, and did not require my attendance there oftener than I have stated; she was in bed - I had not an opportunity of seeing her dressed; I saw her dressed at Carey-street, before she took to her bed - she certainly dressed in a way I thought unworthy of her; very much in the style of a pauper - but when she visited she dressed respectable; I had enabled her to become wholly independent, having sent her twice to the West Indies, at my own expense, to obtain an independent income, which she had been deprived of for twenty-five years - she had 200l. a year transferred to her by the Court of Chancery, and claimed a great deal more; she lodged on the ground floor in Carey-street - if it had been kept as I could have wished, I considered it a decent lodging, but it was dirty; she was attended by a servant whom she employed, and I got a nurse for her at my own expense.</p>

               <p>Q. When you told Mrs. Carter to send all the things to Charterhouse-square, did not she tell your Mrs. Keefe had left her every thing in the house? A. No, nothing like it - Mr. Franks, of Mill-hill was present, and Miss Springweiler; Mr. Franks is a Magistrate - she did not state this to me, nor in my hearing, but denied positively all knowledge of the notes; she did not say any thing had been left her by Mrs. Keefe - I claim on the property as sole administrator, to answer all claims as the whole of the estate; I have a sister who claims as well - we are her next relatives; I am a creditor of 150l.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Were you and the deceased on good terms? A. Perfectly so - we never had any difference; I thought she would recover on the 1st of June, and only required good nursing and nourishment - I had a better opinion of her then, than at any time from the commencement of her illness, and did not provide a nurse on that occasion, because I was satisfied with Mrs. Carter's attention up to that time; she had enjoyed the 200l. a year from 1821.</p>

            . I am single, and was intimately acquainted with Mrs. Keefe - I am no relation, but have been acquainted with her many years. I remember her going to live at Carter's on the 2nd of April; she was then in a bad state of health - I had visited her during her illness about twice a week till her death; I saw her last on Monday, the 1st of June - she died on the 8th; I know she was in possession of about 225l. in Bank notes - I had counted them for her on the 10th of April, and had them in my hand on the 15th; I did not see them on the 1st of June - they were deposited in her desk, of which she kept the key herself: it was put into a purse in a little drawer by her bed side - there was also a 200l. bill of exchange, four sovereigns and a half, and some ear-drops: I had seen those in April and May - I saw the bundle of notes about three weeks previous to my last visit; they appeared just the same in bulk as when I had opened them - the drops of her ear-rings were in the desk, and were gold; I saw them there in May - she was very particular about opening her desk; I frequently brought it to her, wishing her to open it herself if she wanted to go to it, but I used to open it when I was there: she used to direct me to take the key from the purse in this drawer, if she did not take it herself - when she wanted a note changed she employed me to do it, and was very particular about it; I changed a note for her last on the 10th of April, when I saw them altogether - about three weeks previous to my last visit or after that, she used to point to her desk and say to me, "There they are for you to pat your hand on in case any thing happens to me;" but generally added, "I am not going to die yet." On the 8th of June Mrs. Carter's son came to me at No. 1l, Charterhouse-square, and informed me of her death; I went almost immediately - Mrs. Carter told me she died about nine o'clock that morning very suddenly, and had been very angry in the night at her employing a nurse to attend her instead of herself - I asked why she employed a nurse without sending for me; she said she had been too ill to attend to her herself - I asked her for the key of the desk, saying I knew there were papers of consequence there; she said she had the key in her possession, went down, and brought it up - I opened the desk in her presence; I found it on the steps by the bed-side - I found all the papers in confusion; the bill of exchange was there, but neither the ear-drops nor any one of the Bank notes - I then said there was a parcel missing, which was of consequence to Dr. Farre; she replied if they were merely papers they could not be of much consequence, and stated that Mrs. Keefe had told her she had no money, but there was a bill of exchange coming due in October when she should be paid for her lodging - the bill in the desk is due in October; Mrs. Carter had told me, previous to this, that Mrs. Keefe was to pay her 13s. a week for lodging, and desired me, on one occasion, to apply to Mrs. Keefe to allow her 1s. a day more for her attendance - this was about the 10th of April; I made the application to Mrs. Keefe, who was very angry - she said 13s. was quite sufficient, and she would allow nothing more - on the 8th of June Mrs. Carter told me Mrs. Keefe had desired her to shut the doors against every body, and take charge of every thing; she did not say for what purpose - I left the desk there, taking home the 200l. bill and the West India letters; I went there, I believe, every day but two, till the funeral; notice was sent to Dr. Farre, who came to town that day week - I think I had no more conversation with her myself about the desk, but I went back on the day she died, with Mr.

            - he stated to her, in my presence, that the property was missing; she said she knew nothing about it - he asked who had been in the room; she said she knew nothing at all about it - on the 18th I went in company with Mr. Franks, and opened the desk; I was showing him, in Mrs. Carter's presence, the manner in which the notes used to lay there, and where the drops were in a small box in the desk - Mrs. Carter said she had picked the drops up in the fire-place, and sent her child down for them; the child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100156"></xptr>returned, and she gave them to me - we never examined any thing out of Mrs. Carter's presence; she heard what I said about where the notes used to lay; but gave no account of them, or what had become of them - I myself only asked her if she had met with any papers or parcels; but the notes were mentioned in her presence more than once - she said she knew nothing of them; Mr. Franks asked me for the key of the desk on the 26th of June, and took out both these papers (looking at them) in Mrs. Carter's presence - the desk was then locked, and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Mrs. Keefe a woman rather grateful, as to acts of kindness done to her? A. I never thought her so - she made no will; I have no recollection of her saying any thing to me, but"There the notes are for you to put your hand on;" she did not tell me to give them to Dr. Farre, but I concluded that was her meaning - I saw her last on the day Dr. Farre did; she certainly appeared to require nursing very much, but appeared better, and I was prevented from going to see her - I am not aware that Mrs. Carter sat up one night with her - Mrs. Keefe had a stick to knock with to call her in the day time; I am not aware of her doing that in the night; Mrs. Carter did not appear to me to be particularly fatigued on the day of her death - she did not appear pregnant; I visited Mrs. Keefe almost daily in Carey-street - she was a very odd woman; her apartment at one time was in a filthy state: her dress was more like a pauper than a lady; she was a self-willed obstinate woman -I do not know why she returned to lodge at Carter's; I was surprised to hear of her going back, because I understood she had left there in anger - she had lived there before for two years; if she had wanted the desk in my absence, she could not lift it herself, but must have some one to bring it to her; Mrs. Carter's words were that Mrs. Keefe had told her to shut the door against every body, and take charge of every thing; she did not say she had given her every thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she on any occasion insist that the notes, or any other property, had been given to her? A. No; she only said she was to take charge of every thing.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you never hear Mrs. Keefe say she intended to make Carter a compliment? A. Once, when I applied about the shilling a day, she said, in an angry manner, "I will make her a compliment;" I did not take out all the papers when I first examined the desk - I turned them over in the desk, and opened every West Indis letter; there were a great many papers; it was not full- I did not put any papers on the steps, or on the bed, nor put them on one side; there was no room to do so - there were a great many loose papers - I examined them, and am certain there were no Bank notes among them; I might be ten minutes rummaging the desk.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you live in the house of Dr. Farre's father, as one of the family? A. Yes - I frequently went to see Mrs. Keefe, when Dr. Farre did not; Mrs. Carter knew I was a member of the family, no doubt - if the desk was brought to Mrs. Keefe, she could open it with the key, and put the key away in its proper place; Mrs. Carter said she was assisting her out of bed, that her head dropped on her shoulder, and she died immediately - when Mrs. Keefe said she would make her a compliment she did not fix any time for it, in words or otherwise.</p>

On the 8th of June I went with Miss Springweiler to Mrs. Carter's house - I said I had no hesitation in telling her that notes to a considerable amount were missing from the desk, and I was sure, for her own sake, she would be anxious to afford some explanation of it, as it appeared to me very mysterious; she said she knew nothing about them, and could not be answerable for them - I saw her again on the 10th and 26th - I believe she was asked by Miss Springweiler whether she could afford any further information about the paper - she could not; the desk was opened on both occasions before me - Mrs. Carter was the only person in the room; I saw

            , ESQ. I live at Mill-hill, and am a Magistrate of Middlesex. I went to Carter's with Mr. Farre and Miss Springweiler, on the 18th of June, and saw Mrs. Carter - Miss Springweiler desired her to come up stairs; she came up - I asked her where she took the key of the desk from: she said, "Out of the drawer, by the bed-side, and it was in a purse;" I asked what made her take the key; she said she thought she had a right to take it; I told her she did very wrong; she had made herself liable by so doing - I did not say to what she was liable; she was agitated, and shook very much - I said all she ought to have done was to close the eyes of the deceased, tied a handkerchief round her mouth, locked the door, and sent for her relations - she made no answer: I asked to see her daughter Catherine, who is about twelve years old, and asked her, in her mother's presence, whether Mrs. Keefe had laid quiet in the night she died, and if she was out of the room the whole night - she said she laid very quiet, as usual - I asked if she had asked for the desk; the daughter said she had asked for it on the Friday before the Sunday, and she had handed it to her on the bed - I asked what Mrs. Keefe took out of it; she said a sovereign, and gave it her to get change; I asked if she had left any papers or things on the bed, after she had locked the desk - she said she had not left any thing, and Mrs. Keefe told her to put the desk where it was, and the key and purse in the drawer where she usually kept it - I then requested Miss Springweiler to open the desk, and look into every part of it very particularly - it was searched, but no notes found; the notes were not mentioned - Miss Springweiler asked Mrs. Carter if the ear-drops had been in the desk; she said she would go and fetch them - I said, "Don't move out of the room, you may send for them;" and she sent the child, who brought them up -Mrs. Carter said she found them under the grate: I wished to see the nurse, who had attended Mrs. Keefe that night - they sent for

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The last was the only time the notes were specifically mentioned? A. That was the only time - I did not announce myself as a Magistrate; I acted as a friend of Dr. Farre, he being a professional man, and not able to attend - I was not acting as a Magistrate; I told her she had made herself liable - she was frightened before that; she could hardly hold herself still; she did not appear ill - I did not desire that she should be taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go there as a Magistrate, or merely as a friend of Dr. Farre? A. As a friend; the little girl said she had slept with Mrs. Keefe that night.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I took Mrs. Carter into custody in August; on our way to the office she said that the notes were given her by Mrs. Keefe - that Mrs. Keefe had called her little girl and given her a 200l. bill, but the child could not read, and she took it away from her again; I then asked, if any of the notes should be traced with the name of Carter on them, what she would say? - she said, "It will be all very well; they were given to me - indeed she gave me all;" I understood her to mean all that was in the desk, and I think she said, "I am sorry I let the desk go." I afterwards apprehended Carter, Sen.; he said his wife had given him the notes; that he had passed them, and he was not ashamed of it - that his name was on them; that he had passed them at a public-house in his neighbourhood, and one at an ironmonger's - that his wife had not acted right, for she should have brought him the key of the room, and then he would have kept the whole property, for he understood her it had been given to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You went to Mrs. Carter's and took her? A.

            . I live at No. 109, Drury-lane. I recollect a 10l. note being changed by one of the Carters, but which I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERS re-examined. The two bills of exchange were paid on the 11th of July, 1825; they were most likely presented to a clerk at the counter - the person who received them would write the receipts.</p>
               <p>MISS SPRINGWEILER. I believe the words, "Received, J. Keefe," on the back of these bills to be Mrs. Keefe's writing.</p>
               <p>The letter of administration granted to Dr. Farre were here read: the list of notes produced by Mr. Waters, corresponded with those given in evidence.</p>

            's Defence. My wife has been in the habit, for twenty years, of keeping the cash; and when I wanted money to pay away, I always sent to her for it.</p>

               <p>Robert Carter, Jun.'s Defence. When I was taken into custody. I was at work in Stacey-street; my father came and said I was wanted, and I went with him to Queen-square - I have been in the habit of receiving notes for my father, and giving them to my mother; and receiving them from her, when I wanted them to pay away.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Carter delivered in a long written defence, stating that she was on the most familiar terms with the deceased, who usually called her "Dear Carter, &amp;c.;" and felt unhappy if any one but herself attended to her; and that, a few days previous to her death, she told her to send her daughter out of the room, and then gave the notes into her hand, telling her to keep them if she died, and telling her to take every thing in the place for herself, and had often promised to make her and family comfortable. That the papers in question, must have got into the desk when Miss Springweiler was rummaging it.</p>

            . I have lodged in Carter's house for sixteen months; I was called down the morning Mrs. Keefe died, to assist Mrs. Carter - it was when she was dying - I had seen her the Friday before her death, and at other times; I have heard her say Mrs. Carter behaved with the greatest kindness to her - on the Friday before she died, my sister and I were in the room helping her into bed; she was much troubled with dropsy - I asked if her doctor was aware of her being in that situation; she said, she believed so - that Mr. Farre was her doctor, and he was her nephew, but he was gone to Brighton, for the benefit of his health - she told me Mrs. Carter was to have all her property when she died, and that she had already made her a very handsome compliment - she was very infirm, and required great attention; Mrs. Carter paid her every attention - she slept in the room over Mrs. Carter, and had a stick to thump the boards to call her - I have heard Mrs. Carter say she went to a physician, in consequence of hurting herself by lifting her out of bed, as she was pregnant - I was taken to the Police-office on the part of the prosecution but not examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often in the course of your being there did you see Mrs. Keefe? A. I should think four or five times - I was not at all intimate with her; every time I went into the room she talked about her property that she had given it to Mrs. Carter; I only saw her four times - the first time might have been five or six weeks before her death; she told me about the handsome compliment on the Friday - she said there was a time-piece on the mantel-shelf which had been given to her by an old sweetheart, and she had given that to Mrs. Carter; I heard nothing of Carter wanting 1s. more to attend her - I was not with her more than ten minutes when she died; she was sitting on the nightchair, but I assisted Mrs. Carter to put her into bed - that was at near ten o'clock in the morning; I never told the officer of this - I was at the office on the day Mrs. Carter went to prison.</p>

I want no one here but you, you are the first here" - Catherine Carter, the daughter, slept in the room before Mrs. Keefe died, and had done so for some time; on the Sunday night Mrs. Carter asked if she wanted Miss Springweiler - she said she did not want her there; she owed her nothing - "I want none here but you, Carter;" I remember her once sending for

            , Jun. - she gave him a glass of wine, and said,"My boy, I respect you, you are a nice youth - Will you have a commission in the army or navy? I will buy it you, and make a gentleman of you;" the boy thanked her, and said he did not want either - I remember, when Mrs. Keefe lodged in Carey-street, Mrs. Carter sent me to see her there three times; she desired me to give her kind respects to her, and begged she would move, as she was so poorly - she thought she had better not move back to her house; this was about a fortnight before she did move - Mrs. Keefe's answer was, that so Dr. Farre said, but that did not matter; that her rent where she was, was only 12s. a week, and Mrs. Carter's 13s. - I said I thought she paid 15s. there; she said she did not, but that did not matter - she would go back to Carter's, and if she was to die she would die there; I remember Carter burting herself by lifting her out of bed - she was often in the habit of doing so.</p>

Mrs. Keefe came from Carter's to lodge with me, in October, 1824 - she has spoken to me very handsomely of Mrs. Carter, and often wished to go back there again; I know Mrs. Carter was pregnant in May, or the beginning of June.</p>

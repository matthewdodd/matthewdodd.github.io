               <p>When did you see them before they were missing? - A day or two; all the plate was under lock and key, but five old silver table spoons, and a few tea spoons; two of them were taken.</p>
               <p>To Haliburton. What do you know of this? - A young man whose name is Radford, servant to a silversmith, sent to Bow-street to inform us that a lad had offered a silver spoon to sale. I went down, when I came he shewed me a spoon. I searched the prisoner and found this spoon in his pocket; by its appearance it was the fellow of one he had offered to sell. The silversmith is not the spoon is marked A. M. P. The prisoner told me he had them from Mr. Pearson's in Water-street.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had them from Mr. Pearso n's? - No; he cried and said he should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pearson. The boy (the prisoner) has not been above two months from Bengal; I beg for all the mercy the court can show him.</p>

               <p>January, about 1 p.m., I went with a warrant to 14, Oglander Road, East Dulwich—a female answered the door, and in consequence of what she said I placed Sergeant Moore at the back and another officer in front, and commenced to search the house—the female took me to the back yard, where I found Collier in the closet—I read the warrant to him—he said, "Well, it is very true, Pope owed me some money, and he asked me if I could do a cheque for him; I took the cheque to Mr. Field, and to pay a small bill I got the change—I gave Pope 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money." I produced the cheque, and he said, "That is the one, it is my writing on the back"—he handed me this letter, and asked me to produce it to the Magistrate, as it would be his defence—he said, "I received that—from Pope." (<hi rend="italic">This letter was signed Frederick Pope, dated 7th August 1879, stating that he enclosed the whole amount in Field's matter, although he had only had half of it, as he never went from a promise when once made, and that he hoped to he able to tend more money to<lb></lb>morrow.</hi>) Collior also said that I should find a number of letters from Field to him, and from him to Pope, in Pope's possession. I found this batch of letters in Pope's desk. (<hi rend="italic">The letters were put in at before.</hi>)</p>

I had this memorandum book in my posses<lb></lb>sion at the police-court, but I did not use it, because the evidence was fresh in my memory—I made the first part of the entry on the day I took Pope, and the second part when I searched his desk—I was then sent out of the police-court at your request, but after I gave my evidence I kept in Court—I did not stop in the attorneys' seat the whole investigation—Pugh only was first put in the dock—I took out a summons for Pope to come and give evidence, and then arrested him, and he was put in the dock the same day and charged with fraud and conspiracy, and there was an adjournment for a week—I sat by the side of the Attorney for the Treasury, handing him documents—I did not remain there pumping him after the witnesses were ordered out—I assisted him except when I was ordered out—I received the case from Andrews, who has been sent to South America—I do not know that Pope sent for Andrews, but I heard him say that he called on him—Pope never mentioned the name of Williams—he said that the cheque-book had been stolen from his box, but not that he had discharged Herbert Pugh in consequence—he did not particularly request his solicitor to have Andrews there—I have heard that Mr. Crowther was Pope's solicitor, and that Herbert Pugh was in Pope's service some time—there was no committal for forgery, nor do I believe it was applied for—I heard the argument as to a general charge of conspiracy against the four prisoners, and I believe the Magistrate at first refused to do so—I do not know whether they asked him behind your back to be allowed to indict for conspiracy—I heard it, and I understand it has been returned by the Grand Jury—I believe I mentioned in my cross-examinatien that Pope handed me the key of his desk, but not in my evidence in chief—when I went to his desk I found it broken open, and I took the documents—the cheques with "N.S." on fire of them, and "Refer to drawer" on others, were put in to show his pecuniary difficulties, I believe—I understand that four or five of them were dishonoured—a bundle of the dishonoured cheques was not put in to show nefarious trading—I did not cast up the total of the cheques—I don't know that it was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

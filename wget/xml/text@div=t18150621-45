            . On Friday at about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a man coming from the ruins after the fire in Five-feet-lane, with a brace on his shoulder, I followed him through the church yard. into Watling-street; I marked the brace as he went along. He went into Mr. Woods the scale makers, I don't recollect the prisoner at the bar; I know it was Mr. Stover's brace; after I went for Mr. Stover, and we found a copper brace in the cotton at Mr. Woods.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Wood, in Queen-street, two men came in about four o'clock, in the afternoon of the 9th of June, and wanted to sell a copper brace, I told them I could not give them money for it; but if they would leave it, and call again, I would tell them what my master said; I have every reason to believe the prisoner was one of the men. They left the house, and in the interim while they were away, Mr. Stover and the last witness came. In consequence of something they told me, when the prisoner at the bar came again, I took him down to Hancock's house. The officer, Hancock, was not at home, and the prisoner went back with me to my master's. Shortly after Hancock came, and took him into custody.</p>

I lived, in October, at 1, Glasshouse-street, White-chapel—I now live at 46, Went worth-street—I am a cooper—on 2d Oc<lb></lb>tober, about ten minutes past 3 in the afternoon, the prisoner, who was ft lodger in my house, came to my room—my door was locked, but I was out<lb></lb>side in the passage; it is on the ground-floor—he shoved the door open, and I said, "What did you do that for?"—he replied, "Have you got any money?"—I said, "What is that to do with you whether I have or not?—we both went into the room together; there was a table-knife on the table, and he said, "I will give you something; I will do for you," and took the knife off the table, and stabbed it into my right wrist—it bled—I called for assistance, and he ran out of the house—I followed him, and gave him in charge—I did not find the knife—a doctor examined me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I deny having used the knife at all, and I can prove that if could not have been done with a knife, because he wore a blue guernsey. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did, but I had the sleeve tucked up in this way—I did not tuck it up afterwards—we had no quarrel—I have known you five or six years—you had nowhere to go, and I took pity on you and gave you a lodging—you have knocked me about before.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital-square—on 2d October, I examined the prosecutor at the station, and found him bleeding from an incised wound of the wrist, about three inches long, which had divided the radial artery—it was a serious wound for the time—it might have been inflicted by a table-knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Would not the sharp iron latch of a door have done it? 4. No; it was too sharp-cut for that, and there was no bruise or laceration—I attended him up to this time; he is going on well.</p>

               <p>He made a laugh of it, and said he would not open it for me. I put my foot to the door and knocked it in; he came round and struck me on both eyes and cut my mouth. We were both in liquor, and in tumbling about, he fell, and cut himself. I do not know how to account for that."</p>

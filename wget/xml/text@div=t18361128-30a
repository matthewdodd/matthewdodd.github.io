                  </hi>. I am servant to Joseph Hall, of Pinner. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, the 19th of November, he had forty-seven sheep—I counted them about four o'clock in the afternoon—they were in the paddock be<lb></lb>fore the house, adjoining Lady Pell's wood, which is fenced off from it—there is a footpath in the paddock, and a stile—next morning, a little searched for it, but could not find it, nor trace where one had been killed—I looked in Lady Pell's wood, but could find nothing—I afterwards saw two legs and two shoulders of mutton and a skull—I could not tell whe<lb></lb>ther it was the head of my master's lamb—it was the same description and size—it was Leicester breed—I could not tell whether the mutton belonged to a Leicester sheep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Rickmansworth. I searched a house at Pinner-common, with a search-warrant, on the 23rd of Novem<lb></lb>ber—we found the prisoner's wife in the house—in a cupboard in the bed-room, which was not locked, I found the greater part of a shoulder of lamb, uncooked—I forced open another cupboard, as the wife said she had not got the key, and found another shoulder, two legs, three pieces of loin, and two pieces of neck—the lamb had not been cut up by a butcher, quite the reverse.</p>

I went on Wednesday the 23rd of November to search the prisoner's house—he has lived there for years—I saw Forster bring the mutton down stairs—I went into another room, and found part of the head, cooked, in a dish—I found a bag at the top of the cupboard, with some mutton suet in it—I went into the garden, and found all the entrails buried, and cabbage-plants planted over them—they were the entrails of a sheep which had been recently killed—they were quite fresh—they might have been killed about three days—I was present before the Magistrate when the prisoner's examination was taken—I saw Mr. Hanson sign it—I know his hand-writing—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposition</hi>)—I heard it read over to the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "The prisoner says, I saw a sheep lying in Lady Pell's, as I was going into the foot-path in Mr. Hall's field, on Sunday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I think it must be past 6 o'clock when I got home—it was getting day light—day light was broken—I did wrong in taking the lamb—I knew it did not belong to me—I carried it <hi rend="italic">athwart</hi> my shoulders—I did not meet any body—I carried it just as it was—the skin I never saw—I did not open it till I got home—I then asked myself several</p>

I said they could not do it; they came again next afternoon between three and four o'clock, and swept my back parlour chimney; there was White, the prisoner, and another. I am sure the prisoner was one of them - his face was black; the little boy went up the chimney, and while he was up, White the master came to me and said the soot was falling down another flue - I was in another room and told him it was no such thing, for I had lived in the house many years and it could not be. I went up stairs with him, leaving the prisoner sitting in the back parlour window - the watch laid on the drawers in the front parlour, and the door between the two parlours stood open. I did not miss the watch till half-past nine o'clock, when I went to wind it up. I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I am husband of the last witness. I saw the boy go up the chimney and left the prisoner in the room. I am sure he is the boy. I went out of the room up stairs to work. I missed the watch about nine o'clock. I saw the seal on the following morning in the possession of Irving, and on the evening of the 21st, a woman came to me and asked if I had lost a watch, and if I had it back with the expences I had incurred, she hoped I should not proceed further. I said I could not promise any thing: she then gave the watch into my hand, and under it was 10 s. I have not seen her since.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of September, in company with White and a boy about the prisoner's size - they were sweeping a chimney; they all denied knowing any thing of the watch. I took them to the office, the boy was discharged, but the prisoner and White were committed for further examination. While I was at the house where I took them somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280008"></xptr>called out that there was a seal found. I was down stairs, and it was given to me in Irving's presence.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer. On the 18th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning one Dunn came to my father's house, and asked if I had stitched the straps on his boots; he said if I would do them he would give me a seal; he gave me this seal, I cleaned it and went to see if it was gold, I gave it to Gulliver's daughter - she is not here.</p>

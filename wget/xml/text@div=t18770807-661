                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 99, Powis Street, Woolwich—the prisoner was my shop boy and was promoted to be porter, and afterwards assistant—his duty was to serve customers and when he received cash to place it on the cash desk and ring the bell for me or my wife to take the money—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge I gave a half-crown, two shillings, and a penny, all marked, to Detective Morgan on 20th June, about 8.30—the other assistant was due at 8.30, and the prisoner was alone till then, except that a lad helped him to unshut—I went in and said "Have you served a customer this morning?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Where is the money?"—he said that he had put it on the desk—I said "It is not there," and showed him a bill in his own writing for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said "Have you sold these goods, where is the money?"—he repeated that he had placed it on the desk—I told him I should charge him with stealing it and called Morgan in, who took him into the cutting room, and there he repeated two or three times that he had placed the money on the desk—Morgan told him he would be charged with stealing the money and that it was marked, and ordered him to turn out his pockets—he turned out about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of which Morgan and I picked out the marked money—I said "What have you to say to that?"—he said "Well, I did place it on the desk, but I took it again afterwards and put it in my pocket"—these are the three silver coins I marked, but not the penny.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three examinations at the police-court, on 20th June, 28th June, and 5th July—on 5th July I said "My deposition on the 28th was incorrect in one particular, the prisoner's statement that he had put the money in his pocket was not made till after he was taken into the cutting-room"—the Magistrate did not give me a caution—I have a till in my desk, which was locked at the time—the prisoner swept the shop every morning—the dustpan is kept somewhere at the back, I believe he went into the kitchen for it every morning, but I did not see him—the lad was cleaning the windows outside the shop—this bill for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is in the prisoner's writing—when he was in the cutting-room he said that he put the money in his pocket because of. the boy or the servant girls, but he did not say while he went away for the dustpan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Edward Ives Fuller, a coach-builder, of Margaret-street, Cavendish-square. On the 24th of March, the prisoner came to hire a phaeton for the following day—he fixed on one, and hired it in the name of Mr. Griffiths, No. 46, Pall-mall—I knew there was a family of that name there—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day was to be paid for it—the next morning a lad fetched the phaeton—it was not returned, and we put an advertisement in the newspaper; and, on the 28th, two persons called on me—I went with them to Millbank—I saw the phaeton there, but the cushions were gone—the phaeton Is worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure the prisoner is the man, I cannot be mistaken in him.</p>

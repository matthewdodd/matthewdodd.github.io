Going down into the cellar we met Forrester on the stairs, without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310051"></xptr> out his coat, and his shirt sleeves tucked up within his waistcoat. I rushed by Forrester into the back cellar, and under an arch which goes into the fore cellar, I saw a large press with a large fly, and the fly was going round. There was two large candles, one on each side the press, a light. Giles sat down, and the fly was going round over his head; he was feeding the press. I saw an halfpenny struck, and took out, and a blank put in. Dereham and William's I believe, were assisting him with blanks. I don't know who were working the fly. Giles got up to run away. I laid hold of him and secured him. Dereham and Williams were secured by Mardell; they were all without their coat, and their shirt sleeves tucked up: I think Dereham had slippers on. I found some counterfeit half-pence in Forrester's breeches pocket, which had been struck from that die, (producing them) and some half-pence, struck from the same die, were lying about the press, (producing them.) There is a flaw about the head: Mardell and I examin'd the press and found a half-penny between the dies, just struck; there were eight or nine shillings worth struck from the same dies lying about the press. We found a cutting press in the fore cellar, a quantity of copper, one piece in the cutting press, with some blanks cut out of it, a pair of sheers, and six or seven pair of dies.</p>

               <p>Giles's Defence.</p>
               <p>I used to work by the water-side; being out of work I went to the sign of the White Lion the beginning of May last, to inquire for work; a gentleman who was there, told me if I would go with him, he would help me to a job. I went with him to Haddle-hill; there he called for some punch and a pint of beer for me; and said, if I could leave my family a week together, he would give me a guinea a week, and four or five pints of beer a day. I said, I could upon occasion: then he appointed me to meet him on Monday morning at Tyburn turnpike; accordingly I went there, and he came with a chaise cart and took me to Acton. He said, I was only to cut out some copper, and gave me some, which I cut out with shears: he shewed me how to mark it. I knew nothing what it was, for I never saw such a thing before. There was a man cutting with an engine. I asked him what he was about? he made me no answer. The man that employed me, appointed me to meet at a publick-house in town on Saturday following: he did not tell me his name. When I met him, he gave me half a guinea instead of a guinea: he said, he had no more in his pocket; he would give me the rest on Monday. I went again on Monday, and told him to get another man; that I did not choose to stay with him, and should leave him on Wednesday. On Tuesday the witnesses and some more people came and took us.</p>
               <p>Forrester's Defence.</p>
               <p>Last Tuesday fortnight I was going down to Heeling to receive some money that was owing me at Acton. I stopped to have some refreshment: there I met with a woman I knew: she asked where I was going? I told her to Heeling to receive some money. It was a very hot day, and the dust blew very much. She said my face was very dirty; if I would go into the house, she would give me some water to wash my face. I went in, pulled my coat off, and went into the cellar, where there was a well, and washed me. As I was coming-up again, a gentleman met me and pushed me down, and I was taken.</p>

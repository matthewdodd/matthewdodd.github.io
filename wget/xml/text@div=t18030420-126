             sworn. - I am shopman to Scarle and Cator, linen-drapers, St. Paul's Churchyard: On Monday, the 14th of March, the prisoner and another person came in; the other person purchased a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person? - A. Ann Williams, the person who has just left the bar; the next day the prisoner came again, and purchased a gown, five yards at two shillings; she would not have any other, because it was not exactly ten shillings; she said she could not pay the whole, but would call in the morning and pay the rest; she then paid me three shillings first, and then one shilling; I put the four shillings in the till; then, after hesitating a little, she asked me what remained to be paid; I told her six shillings; she said, dear me, I believe I may have as much, and produced six shillings, which immediately excited in me a suspicion; she put them all down at once upon a piece of print; I then looked at the shillings very minutely, and found them all very bad; I then charged her with knowing perfectly well that they were bad, from the peculiar manner of offering them in part; I told her I had seen her before; she said, she had never been there before in her life; she said, she wondered at my impudence in charging her, and said she would make me pay for it if I sent for a constable; I had threatened to send for a constable; I sent for David Hughes; she still said she was not guilty, but when a coach came to the door to take her off, she begged pardon, offered to leave all the money, or do any thing rather than go to prison; I kept the six shillings in my own possession, and have had them ever since;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200122"></xptr>I kept them separate from any other money. (Produce them.)</p>

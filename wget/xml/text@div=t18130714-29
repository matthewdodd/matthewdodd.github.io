            . I am shopman to Mr. Sonby. On Monday the 5th of July, about two o'clock, the prisoners came into Mr. Sonby's shop; they asked for Japan muslin; I shewed them some sprigged muslin; they said it was too dear. They did not buy any. They went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing - A. I did not. About five o'clock, Read, the officer, came; he produced some muslin. I knew it belonged to my master. I sent for Mr. Sonby from the next door immediately. I had seen the piece of muslin in the shop three hours before the prisoners came in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. The piece of muslin that was brought back by Read, was it yours - A. Yes, it was. I had seen it the evening before. My house is in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. This piece of sprigged muslin I found in the bundle that was delivered up to me by Mr. Bennett, where they had committed another robbery, in the city. Mr. Bennett, when he delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140026"></xptr>it up to me, said they dropped it. This is the muslin that I shewed to Mr. Sonby.</p>
               <p>MR. BENNETT. I am a linen-draper. The prisoners came into my shop, both of them, on the 5th of July, about four o'clock; they asked me for some muslins; I shewed them some; they purchased a quarter of a yard of muslin. Soon after the prisoners were gone I was called down; there was a shawl missing. I overtook the prisoners about three hundred, yards from my shop; I brought them back again.

               <p>Prosecutor. This piece of sprigged muslin I can positively say is my property, by the private mark, and by the peculiar pattern. It is worth about twenty-four shillings.</p>

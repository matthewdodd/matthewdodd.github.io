            . I am the pot-boy; the prosecutor appeared drunk, and came in with the prisoner; he fell asleep, and the prisoner sent me for a glass of gin and water, and then asked me to fetch sixpenny-worth of oysters - when I came back he was gone - the prosecutor's fob was open, as he lay asleep on the seat - I awoke him, and he missed his watch - I had seen his seals hanging out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trimming manufacturer, of Newgate street. On Monday morning, 5th Dec., about 10 o'clock, I came into my warehouse to open it—I occupy the upper part of the house—in consequence of information, I went up into a bed room on the third floor, where I had left everything safe an hour before, and missed two coats, two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, a silk gown of my wife's, a mantle, and a pair of kid boots—these articles produced are all my property, and were in my room—the prisoner had no business in the house, but about ten days or a fortnight before the robbery I met him on the staircase, and asked him his business, seeing he was a stranger—he spoke in broken English, and said he was looking for a German warehouse—my street door is kept open, the lower part of the house being a warehouse—the value of the things I missed is 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of Christ Church.</p>

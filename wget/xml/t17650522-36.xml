            . I am butler to Lady Feversham. About five weeks ago, about nine o'clock, as near as I can guess, in the morning, I was in my pantry, waiting for my Lady's calling for the tea-kettle; when she call'd I went up with it; it is up two pair of stairs; I set it down, and returned directly. I went into the housekeeper's room to carry up some butter'd roll; I came down and catched the boy Kelley in the Pantry; he hearing me coming, was for getting out, and would have made me believe he was just come in at the door: He said, Sir, do you know one

            , an Irish postilion that lives here? (my pantry door is just by the area door) I said, There is no such person here: said he, Then I must be mistaken; is not this a Lord's house? I said, No, but it is a Lady's, and there is a Lord lives on the other side. Before he was got out of the area I stept into the pantry, and miss'd two silver cups, which the young ladies used to drink out of: there was my Lord's crest upon them, a horse's leg and horse-shoe. I ran after the boy, and called him back, and said, Here are other servants, that have been in the house longer than I, perhaps they can direct you: he came back and said he was oblig'd to me. He staid by the area gate: I went and searched for the cups: they were not in the pantry; then I went into the hall and asked the servants if they knew any thing of the young Ladies cups; the boy hearing me, set off directly; I went and opened the door thinking I could easily catch him; but I could see nothing of him: he told me since he was taken he dropt down behind a post, and I ran by him. About an hour and a half after I found him by the side of Newport-market. Mr. Hemmings's son, a silversmith in Bond-street, had him in custody; I took him before Sir

I was going by Grosvenor-square on the Thursday in last Sessions week, about nine or ten in the morning, the three prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220041"></xptr> were with me: they sat on the steps opposite the area: upon seeing the area gate open; I went down and took two silver cups out of a white cupboard: I gave the cups to Farrell's wife: I said there were silver chandlesticks, and silver handled knives and forks, and spoons: I went in again, and this gentleman came: I asked him as he has said: when he called me back again, I heard talk about the silver cups; then I went away, and went to Bond-street, and was taken. I never saw the cups, nor received any money for them. Farrell's wife said before the Justice, that I gave the cups to

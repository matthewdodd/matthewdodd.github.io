A woman seized my right arm, and a third, who I believe to be the prisoner, came in front and took my watch out; they all came from behind; the others pinioned me, so that I could not move; the woman took four half-crowns and some silver from my breeches pocket. I then received a violent blow at the back of my neck by the right fist of the man, it knocked me down, and they all ran away; they then ran down Fox-lane. The blow stunned me; I went about half a mile, and then returned to the Fox, and had a woman and a man taken, who I thought to be the party; but it was done in a moment. and the night being dark I could not recognize them. I cannot be certain of the prisoner, for dress makes a great difference. I can swear to the party if she had the same dress on now. I was not at all inebriated.</p>

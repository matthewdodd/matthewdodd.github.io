                  </hi>. I live at Portpool Lane, Holborn—on Monday night, I think about 8.30., the prisoner came to my mother's room—my father had had his tea and was going down stairs, and left the door open—my mother went to close the door and the prisoner swore at her and pulled out a knife and struck her with it on the forehead and cheek—I halloaed "Murder!"out at the window—my mother was all over blood, and was taken to St Bartholomew's hospital.</p>

Q.</hi> Was anybody else in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know a man named Williams, he is not a relation of mine, unless it is by marriage—he took the knife out of my mother's hand and out her thumb—my mother had pulled the knife out of the prisoner's hand—the knife had not been hanging by the mantelpiece, we do not always keep a carving knife hanging there, we keep the knives on the dresser—my mother closed the door in Williams' face, so as not to lot him in, but he could see what was done before the door was shut—the prisoner lost her grandchild a little while before, it was run over in the street—she has to pass our house to go to her daughter's—she was passing to go to the poor mother of the child which was killed—she and my mother had not a quarrel—mother was having her tea.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's—the prosecutrix was brought there in a state of collapse, with two large incised wounds on her face—she had lost a good deal of blood—they must have been inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument—there was also a bruise on her left wrist.</p>

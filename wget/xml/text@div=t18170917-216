On the 27th of August, I was standing by the counter, looking towards Oxford-street, the shop door enables me to see all along one side of Berners street; I saw the prisoner bringing a basket in one hand and the lamp in the other, he was coming from Oxford-street towards the shop, I crossed over to the shop door; I thought the lamp a very handsome one, and saw the glass in the basket - I thought they were going to some gentleman's house; he passed the door and in a moment came into one of our private boxes, he put the basket on the counter and said he wanted 1l., as I drew it towards me to look at it, he put the lamp on the counter and said, "I suppose you will lend me more if I want it, "I told him "yes," he said he merely wanted to make up a bill, and that made him bring the lamp; I wrote a duplicate for him, and asked him his name and address, he gave me the name of

            . I have only seen the prisoner once that was at a public-house near Burlington-house in Piccadilly, I do not know the sign, I was having a pint of beer, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170063"></xptr>the prisomer come in and a man behind him; the man brought the things, and asked him 30s. for them. He said he had not got so much. The man went out, and the prisoner went out when he had drank his beer. Very shortly after, the man came in, and said he would take the money that he offered, which was 22s.. The prisoner paid the money, and the goods were delivered to him. There were glass dishes such as that, and a large bowl or globe like a lamp. I believe those produced are the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you - A. A waterman. I work at Billingsgate in general. I am apprentice to Mr. Sellers, who is a waterman and lighterman. I do not know what the prisoner is - I am not acquainted with him - I never saw him before to my knowledge. I do not know the man who sold them - They were bought and sold in the public tap-room. I do not know what day it was - I think it is better than a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect the month - A. I believe it was August, or the latter end of July - I think it was the latter end of July. I did not drink with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who served you - A. The landlord. I do not know his name; I was never in the house before - They both drank together. I only staid while I drank my beer - I looked at the newspaper. I was not there above a quarter of an hour; the things were taken out and put on the table-the landlady was there. There were a few more people in the room. She could see them as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner - A. We talked together coming towards Coventry-street; we went as far as there, and then parted.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner find you out - A. His wife came to me. I told the prisoner where I worked.</p>

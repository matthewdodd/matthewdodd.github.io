               <p>Sir, You have been robbed daily by a fellow named Robert Birch; you may find a pair of black trousers at Mr. Hawes', a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road; if you give him in charge I will attend at the office to-night or to-morrow as a witness.</p>

               <p>Bird's Defence. I did not write it; I cannot read writing; a young man wrote it, and told me to take it - I had no intention of taking the things; I had orders to stand about the window, and I said if I saw any one take any thing I would stop him - I was told to get a Policeman, and the Policemen were waiting.</p>

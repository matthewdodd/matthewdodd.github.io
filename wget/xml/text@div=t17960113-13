               <p>Q. Were you the last person up in the house, on the 3d of January? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see every part of your house secure? - A. I always do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe particularly the cellar which comes out into the street, was that secure? - A. Yes; with two bolts, as usual, on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. Between eleven and twelve, my usual time.</p>
               <p>Q. All the other persons in the house were in bed? - A. I am always the last up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed, and what time in the night? - A. At one in the morning, Sunday night, the 3d of January, I was alarmed by the watch man knocking at my shutters; I got up, and came down stairs into the street, and got a light from him.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed between you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130028"></xptr>and the watchman, where did you go? - A. I went into the house, and down the cellar stairs, into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went there did you see any thing respecting the cellar? - A. When I went out to the watchman to get the light, I saw the cellar slap moved out; it was rose from where the bolts go in, and was drawn out; they were fairly started out.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not open by hinges? - A. No, it does not; it slides in a groove.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the bolts being started? - A. They were fairly bent out of the place where they went into the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any appearances, upon the slap of the cellar, how this must have been done? - A. By a crow, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. But, from the appearance of the slap, how do you think it must have been done? - A. By an iron instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. From within side, or the out? - A. It must have been on the outside; it could not have been done inside.</p>
               <p>Q. This violence appeared to be done to the cellar slap; what did you next do? - A. When I got the light of the watchman, I desired him to watch the door, to see that no thieves came out: when I went down into the cellar, I went to the bottom of the stairs where the slap laid over; there I saw the prints of some people's feet; there were no steps for them to go down; there was a run down into the cellar; I looked to see if I could see any body; I smelt a very strong smell of sulphur; I looked about my front cellar, it is very large; I saw nobody; I then went into my long cellar, which is forty yards long, that goes out of this cellar, there is a door opens between the two.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the long cellar your store-cellar? - A. Yes; I then walked on, but could not see any body; I went on till I got near the further end of the cellar; I then could see the further end of the cellar, but saw nobody: I was just upon my heel to turn round, to come back, and all at once, I discovered the crown of a man's hat, behind a butt, adjoining the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the hat appear to be upon the man's head? - A. Yes; as soon as I saw that, I halloa'd out murder and thieves, directly, to get people to come to my assistance; and I immediately darted forward, where I saw this man's hat; I darted forward with this weapon, a tuck belonging to a can, which was broke three pieces off; I immediately made a push at the fellow; and I believe I run him through the neck; another man sprang up from the left side of the cellar; the other was upon the right side; he was behind a butt; he immediately knocked the candle out that I had in my hand: after two or three pushes with my weapon, I found it gave way; when I found my tool would do no more execution, I threw it away, and took to my fists; the other man coming and knocking the candle out; I was then engaged with the two; I was then in the dark, and we were all three presently upon the ground; I was soon up, and had at them again, in the dark, and brought them to the ground again; both of them and I were in that situation, up and down, I suppose, a dozen times, before any assistance came to me; my mistress then screamed out, and waked my son; for I had never thought of calling him, not my servant: my son came running down, and the watchman with him, down the same stairs that I came down through the house.</p>
               <p>Q. They brought a light with them, I suppose? - A. Yes; the watchman's light, we were then upon the ground all three of us; my son coming along between the butts, picked up a large piece of wood as long as my arm; he saw a man upon me, and he struck the top man and fetched him down from off me, and I got the other man secure in a moment; when I was got shot of one, and when my son struck the tallest man, Wilson, he cried out, what do you want to rob and murder me, and rob me of my property? my son replied, it is much more likely that you come here to rob and murder my father, and my son gave him another blow; the watchman and people, and some others then came up; they all came nearly together, but my son was foremost, he had nothing but his shirt on.</p>
               <p>Q. These were the two prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of it? - A. Yes; they were never out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were secured, was any thing found? - A. There was a parcel of picklock keys picked up by the watchman in my presence, just upon the spot where we had been rolling and tumbling together; he found also a dark lanthorn upon the same spot, they were then secured and taken to the watch-house; after we returned from the watch-house, which was about an hour afterwards, I went down into the cellar to see if we could find any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - A. My son and several others.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down into the cellar, did you find any thing more? - A. Yes; we found a pistol nearly upon the same spot where we had been struggling, it was loaded with three balls, and an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the pistol here? - A. Yes; with the name of Twigg, London, upon it,(produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is it loaded now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130029"></xptr>Q. Was there any thing else? - A. Yes; an open ward key, and some picklock keys; I suppose there were eighteen of them altogether: I then went up stairs, when I got the people away, and went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever done any thing with the crow? - A. I tried it with the cellar slap, and it fitted the place exactly where they had rose the slap up; if they had happened to have come behind me, they would have done for me properly with this,(the crow).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. I will only trouble you with one question, and that is your Christian name? - A. John.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down from your house into the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two communications to your cellar? - A. Yes, one from the street, and another from the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.One is for conveying your goods in, and the other to go for any thing you want? - A. Yes.</p>

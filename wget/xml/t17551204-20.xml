My man seemed to flatter him, in hopes of letting him have the money. He told him they would go to Mr. Wright, and see how the account stood, and if there was that money due, he should have it. So they went away together.</p>

I went with him, as my master has given an account; and when we were at Mr. Wright's, I asked him how he spelt his name (to see if his writing and the order were alike.) So he wrote this name at the bottom.

               <p>Q. Did you hear him ask for the payment of that order, of your master?</p>
               <p>Merry. I did. I think I heard the prisoner tell my master he saw Mr. Wilmot write the order; or he wrote it while he was in his house. He said he was coming from Shoreliam, and he called upon Mr. Wilmot; and Mr. Wilmot told him he had occasion for present money, and would be glad if he would take a draught to town; and as a letter would be safer carriage than cash, he took the draught, and paid the money for it: And that he was a shop-keeper at Shoreham; and two or three times he spoke of the hardship of staying for money when they come with a draught for it. I immediately told my master if I went to Mr. Wright's I might know farther of it. When I came out of the compting-house, I told him my master traded with Mr. Wright, who traded with Mr. Wilmot, and I believed there might be a mistake; but if there was any money due to him, he should have it. So then we went there; then I found that the writing was not at all like Mr. Wilmot's hand. Then we contrived to get him into the compting house; and sent for a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Grimwood, and live in White Bear-yard, Drury-lane. The prisoner came to my house on the 4th of July—he said he wanted a pair of boots of one of my lodgers—the young man not being at home, I refused to let him go into the lodging—he then requested to purchase a pair of boots of me—he tried on several, and de<lb></lb>cided on one pair, which came to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took them away, saying his father would pay for them—I expected his father would pay—he told me, if I went with him, his father would pay me—I went, and on arriving at his father's house in Bennett's-court, Drury-lane, he went up stairs into a room on the first-floor, which was not his father's room, and slammed the door—he then came out, passed me, and said, "If you go into my father's room he will pay you"—I went into that room, but his father did not live there—there were two lads and a girl there—he absconded altogether, with the boots on his person.</p>

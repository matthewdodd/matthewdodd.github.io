On Thursday, the 14th of November, these things were in a shew glass outside the window - they were safe about six o'clock in the evening, and at seven I missed them. I found the prisoners at the office on the Monday following I think. A young man afterwards came into the shop, and gave two ear-rings and a clasp into my hand, and went out immediately; I do not know who it was.</p>

On the 14th of November, I went out on business, and on returning home about half-past seven o'clock, I found Sheen in the shop; (my master rents the house) he had a brooch, a pair of slippers, and two pair of ear-rings in his hand, which appeared new - he asked me to buy the brooch; a young man said they were stolen, and took them from him. He said he found them at the corner of Somerset-street. I do not know James.</p>

               <p>"I had nothing but a knife, and that I sold a woman who sells eels in the street." Sheen said, Ned Stockman took them from him, and lost them two or three nights before at a fight. The prosecutor produced the property a few days after.</p>

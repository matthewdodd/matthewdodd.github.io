On the 23d of March I was coming down Pater noster-row, I turned into St. Paul's church-yard; I met two soldiers, they ran against me; instantly I heard the alarm, stop the soldiers; I turned and pursued. I saw one of them drop the bundle; I took it up, and followed them across Newgate-street into Bull head-court; there I took Harding and Rees; I believe it was Harding that dropped the bundle. We took them to the Compter; after that I heard them say Fowkes drew them in, he was the projector of it; and that this was the first offence they had been guilty of.

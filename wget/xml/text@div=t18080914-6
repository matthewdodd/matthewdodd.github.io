               <p>Q. Was there any other person near him in the street - A. He did not see any body about the street at the time. The prisoner took him into a public house and told him he must treat him or else he would not let him go; he found himself in a difficult situation; he asked the publican if he could not sleep there, he would pay him any money; the prisoner was by at the time; the publican said he had not a place for him; the prisoner said, never mind, I will bring you home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call for any liquor or drink any thing - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140005"></xptr>Yes, they had two or three glasses of liquor, and the prosecutor paid for them; the prisoner called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the witness drink any - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next - A. He went out, and the prisoner had hold of his arm; as soon as he got out in the street he met with another man, and he laid hold of his left arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he seen that other man before - A. No; every now and then they both put their hands in his pockets; he tried to keep them off with his elbows: that was till he came to our door, it is only about an hundred yards off; when he came to my door, the prisoner told him it was not his lodgings: the prosecutor replied here is the number, pointing up to the number; then the prisoner said now I shall take you away to a prison; upon that the prisoner and the other man held his hands; he was with his back against the door, he knocked with his elbow against the door; there was a woman stood a little before these men, and a fiddler came and played the fiddle, when they made the noise; upon that he says, I opened the window; the prisoner had then his hand in his pocket, and when I opened the window, the prisoner said to the other man let him alone now, and then they both went away and left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman and the fiddler - A. They all went one way; the witness put his hand in his pocket, as soon as the prisoner left him, and found all his money was gone; I came down and opened the door; he exclaimed to me, all my money is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket was the money in - A. His breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had he last felt that money that he had in his pocket, before that time - A. He had his hand in his pocket, and felt it after he came out of the public house; it was loose in his pocket; he is sure he felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of money was it - A. Five guineas, two seven shilling pieces, one West India joe, and his protection box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he see the other man before he went into the public house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the landlord of the public house of that man who brought him there against his will, and that he wished to get rid of that man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he not to tell the publican that that man brought him in against his will, and that he did not choose to treat him - A. He says he was afraid, because the man told him he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see any thing of the fiddler or the woman before the man first laid hold of him and took him into the public house - A. They came up at the time he was at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was there any body in the public house at the time he was there with the prisoner besides them and the landlord - A. He saw two or three women, but they were all ready for starting out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to them, or did they drink any thing with him - A. They said nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of these women any of the liquor that he paid for - A. No, not as he knows of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into the public house after that he lost his money - A. He did; I went with him.</p>

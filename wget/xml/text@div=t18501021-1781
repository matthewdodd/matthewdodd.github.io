                  </hi>. I am a wholesale brush-manufacturer, at 8 and 9, Osborne-street, Whitechapel—the prisoners were in my employ—Burke left on 22nd June—I give out bristles to the workmen, and when they are dressed they are returned to me—in consequence of missing bristles, I called Debenham on Sept. 4, and asked him about a parcel of bristles he had left at a coffee-shop, and he said, "Well, I did leave a parcel of bristles at the coffee-shop in Union-street, Brick-lane"—I asked where he got them from—he said a man in the street gave them to him—I asked him what man—he said, "That is my business"—I gave him into custody—he has worked for me six years—I know nothing against his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Globe coffee-house, Union-street, Spital-fields, and have known the prisoners more than twelve months, by using my house, and Debenham leaving parcels there and Burke fetching them away—on 30th Aug. Debenham left a parcel wrapped in a handkerchief, which Barke asked for and took away next day between ten and eleven, I did not untie it—on 4th Sept. Debenham came to me at six in the morning (he had been in the habit of coming between seven and eight in the evening), and said, "Oh, Mr. Green, I want to speak to you"—I said, "Indeed"—he said, "I shall be brought here about twelve o'clock respecting a parcel, for you to swear to me, I want you to say you do not know me"—he said he had a wife and large family, and if I said I knew him it would be the ruin of him—I said it was very wrong indeed of him to leave stolen property at my house—he said, "It is done now, and cannot be undone," and that there were two in it—I said, "Suppose I was a master, and employed a great number of hands, how should I like it?"—he said, "If you talk like that I am <hi rend="italic">done</hi>"—he said <hi rend="italic">his</hi> bitch of a wife had been and <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon him—I do not know whose wife he meant—I reasoned with him, and he said his master paid such dreadful low wages, the men were obliged to do it.</p>

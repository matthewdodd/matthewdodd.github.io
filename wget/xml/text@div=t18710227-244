I am servant to Mrs. Annie Gordon Chamier, of 7, Woodland Villas, Blackheath—on Tuesday night, 7th February, I went to bed a little after 10 o'clock, leaving the windows and doors properly fastened—the next morning, a little before 7, I found the kitchen door open, and a basket, which was under the table when we went to bed, was pulled out, and all the things on the floor—the breakfast-room door was open; it was closed the night before—a pane of glass had been taken out of the scullery window—I had fastened it over night; the next morning it was shut down, but unfastened—a person could get in by taking out the pane of glass, and opening the window, and getting through the bars—the bars are about 7 inches apart—I missed two cloaks, two pairs of boots, a jacket, an umbrella, a ring, a locket and chain, some stamps, and a mustard pot—this is the umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the locket and chain belong to my fellow-servant, Ann Parkinson, the basket and other things to my mistress, and one pair of boots, a cloak, and the ring are mine—the value of my mistress's property is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the door of the landing leading up stairs was locked, so that they were only in the lower part of the house—an old table knife was found at the scullery window, which did not belong to the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 8th of this month I was going to Plumstead for a job. I saw a basket lying between some furze on the heath. I picked it up, and carried it home to my mother's place, and put the boots in the cupboard, and the umbrella on the bed. My clothes-box would only hold the two small coats. Do you think if I had stolen the property I should have kept them four hours in my mother's house? and when the policeman came and caught hold of me, I was not more than 200 yards from the station, where I was going to give information. I want to know what proof they have, to charge me with the burglary. I was down the town after 11 o'clock, and I can call my sister, and the young woman that was with her, to say that.</p>

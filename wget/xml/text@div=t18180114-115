On the 25th of December I was at the Mason's Arms, public-house, Charlotte-street, Portland-place, I dined there, the prisoner sat next to me; we were very comfortable together-there were a great many persons in Company. Just as it got dark the prisoner began to get quarrelsome, and wanted to fight; he fought with one man, after which he began upsetting the glasses; we wanted him to leave the room, he refused, and abused the landlady; I told him he should not stay in the room, and collared him to turn him out - We took him into the street, he slipped down-as soon as he got up, he advanced towards me - We closed, he threw me, and cut my head; he was pulled away. I went into the parlour, and in about twenty minutes I missed my watch-it could not have fallen out. I went out, collared him, and charged him with taking it; he said he knew nothing about it. I gave him in charge; my watch was found in the area of the next house, I heard it fall from him into the area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The watch could not fall out in the scuffle-the blow made me insensible.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRICK. I am a watchman. On the 25th of December I was going up Charlotte-street, the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge; he went backwards from the middle of the street till he got to the area - He then took the watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and threw it down - I saw him do it.</p>

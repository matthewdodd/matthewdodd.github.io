             were in it, I was then proceeding on my way to Lyndhurst, in order to secure it there that night, and about half an hour after I got to Minstead, Cull the prisoner ran out and joined the other two men, and had some conversation with them two, I did not know the nature of the road, I enquired, and a woman had directed me; Cull immediately came up and said, you are going wrong, and wished me to go some other way; I told him I did not want his assistance, and should follow the woman's directions; I told him he had no business to follow me, and insisted he should not; he then began to abuse me, and said, he had as much business on the road as I had; I then insisted he should keep at a much greater distance, for I did not like his appearance at all; soon after that he returned to Witcher and Curtis, and they had some conversation together at a distance; and in about ten minutes after that, they came out of a wood opposite to the cart I was driving, and one of them pulled me off my horse, I cannot say which, nor which of them beat me; it was in that violent manner, I cannot say; but they took a pistol out of my pocket, and while I was laying in that manner, Cull says, d - n him, shoot him; he then immediately after that ran to the cart and horse, and turned it about, and began driving it to Stoney Cross, which I had seized; and a woman about a hundred yards off, where they beat me, ran out and cried, and ran for her husband; and when she returned with her husband, they were gone; one of them took away my horse, and bridle, and saddle, and my pistol, but I cannot say which of them it was; the horse was brought to me the next day, but the saddle and bridle I never got again; my arm was dislocated at my elbow, and very much cut, and dreadful bad it was for a month, and I never shall have much strength in it.</p>
               <p>Was Cull there at the time? - Cull was the most active man, they were all three together, I saw them together as I was down, and they were beating me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You had first seized a cart and horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you first seized it the prisoner was not by? - He was not.</p>
               <p>You saw the prisoner come out from a farm yard? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>He did not make his appearance to you, till you was in conversation with a woman? - He did not come near till then.</p>
               <p>You told him, I suppose, rather huffishly, that you did not want his directions? - I told him, friend, you can have no business here, I am convinced, and therefore you had better go about your business.</p>
               <p>Upon which he replied, that he had as much business on the road as you had? - He did.</p>
               <p>He certainly was not the man that pulled you off your horse? - No, he certainly was not.</p>
               <p>You cannot say which of them it was that beat you? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Was you at all stunned with the fall from your horse? - They pulled me from my horse.</p>
               <p>Did you fall to the ground in consequence of that pulling? - Of course.</p>
               <p>I take it you was a little alarmed? - Of course.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - About half after six in the evening of the 1st of June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and am a porter, living in Crofton Terrace, Richmond—the prisoner lived with me—on Wednesday morning, 11th, about half-past one, he was brought home drunk, put in doors, and the door shut; he began knocking the things about down stairs—he then went into his own room, where he and his brother slept—they got fighting with sticks, I got out of bed to separate them—after that his brother threatened to throw him down stairs and break his neck;" I said, "Don't hurt him;" he took him by the legs and threw him down head first—he then came up and put his clothes on—I heard the prisoner say, "If you come down stairs, I will have a knife for you"—I said, "Nonsense, don't talk like that"—it was all in darkness—a light was brought—he stood in a corner—my son Joe shoved me on one side, and said, "Father, let me put him down quiet on the sofa," he went to catch hold of him, and he was struck with the knife—I then caught hold of the prisoner's hand on one side and Joe on the other—a policeman came to the door—we had asked him to come before, and if he had come he would have saved us all—I went for a doctor—the prisoner was going on in a raving way—he did not know what he was doing—when I came back I found my son Joe lying on the floor vomiting—he had been stabbed just below the lower jaw, by the jugular vein.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty in Crofton Terrace, and heard a great noise at Mr. King's house, who opened a bedroom window and said, "Take my son away, he is creating this disturbance"—I said, "I cannot come in, the door is locked"—he unlocked the door, and the prisoner rushed out with a knife in his hand—Joseph King said, "I am stabbed"—he was bleeding from the neck—his father went for a doctor.</p>

               <p>I said first, but the second time I said, "If you are not quiet I will soon make you"—presently I got out of bed and got a stick, and he got a stick—I threw my stick down and we wrestled, he threw me down, and I got him and slid him down the stairs—I put my things on and saw him wrest<lb></lb>ling with my father at the front door, and he plunged a knife into my neck.</p>

I caught hold of a stick. I never attempted to stab him, and never stabbed him intentionally.</p>

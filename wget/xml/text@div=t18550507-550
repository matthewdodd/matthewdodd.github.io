                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the City Militia—the prisoner was one of our men—he gave himself up to me as a deserter the night previous to this occurrence. On 10th April, I was at the Castle public house in the City-road, kept by Mr. Hill—there had previously been a fight between two of our men, but we did not know it—one of them had a cut under his eye as big as a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—it was in the tap room—the deceased, Joseph Towers, came in to serve beer, and when he saw the man that was cut, who was an Irishman, he said, "That is the way of you Irish lads, when you see your own blood you begin to cry; you should not do that; cheer up, it will be all right by-and-by"—it was said in a good-tempered manner; not in an insulting manner—the room was full, and there were plenty of Irishmen there—the prisoner said, "What did the old b——say?" and he followed Towers out—I remained in the room—the prisoner returned in about three minutes—I said to him, "You did not strike the old man, <hi rend="italic">Bill.</hi> I hope;" he made no answer—I said, "Because he is an old man, and old men will have their ways; if he comes in again do not say anything to him, and don't strike him"—the prisoner said, "I won't, sergeant," and I believe he said sideways, as he turned his head, "By Christ, it is done already"—I afterwards went out to dinner—I saw a quantity of blood on the pavement outside the side door in Castle-street, and some in the road—I did not see the deceased—the prisoner was sober—I was present when he was taken into custody by the police on the Saturday following, at our head quarters, in the City road—he wanted to know what he was taken for; I said, "It is for the old man, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

On Tuesday, 10th April, I was in the tap room of the Castle—I saw Towers there, and an he was leaving the room he turned round and said, "I detest the Irish"—he made that remark to the company—I do not suppose he made it to any one individual—the prisoner was there sitting down—upon hearing that said, he got up deliberately and said, "What does the old man say about Irish?" and he followed Towers out of doors—he returned in a minute or two and said, "I gave him one"—about</p>

On Tuesday, 10th April, I was walking up Castle-street, and saw Towers crossing the road—I saw the prisoner follow him, and strike him two blows under the left eye with his right fist—nothing was said before the blows were struck—they were heavy blows—Towers fell on his right side—he bled a great deal from above his right temple—the prisoner walked into the house again when he had done it—Towers got up—he bled from the blow the prisoner gave him, and also from the blow of the stone that he fell upon—he went to a surgeon's—I spoke to a policeman—I saw Towers again in about a half or three quarters of an hour—he was then strapped up, and being led by two militia men.</p>

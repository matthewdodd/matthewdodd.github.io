            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I met the prisoner in Wood's-place, Chequer-alley, on the 28th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening - Swift and Medlicot were with me; the prisoner had a bundle of leaden pipe - I asked where he got it, and he said, at last, that he got it from Mr. Lavers' premises, and was taking it to his own house, to take care of for his master, Mr. Lavers, of Old-street-road, a bricklayer and palsterer; as it was tied up in an apron, and wrapped up in his jacket, we took him to Mr. Lavers, who said he had no knowledge of the lead; I went the next day with Medlicot to fit the lead to an old house in Chequer-square, used by Mr. Lavers for making up his mortar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he going to Mr. Lavers' shed? A. Yes; it was an old house of Mr. Lavers, where, as I have since heard, the prisoner lives.</p>

            . I am a plasterer. The prisoner has been several years in my employ - he had the care of some empty houses in Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row - he lives in one, and lets the others when empty - they are all my houses; I have a shed, opposite his house, for my materials. I believe this to be my property, but I did not see it fitted. I went to the house and found the lead was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your employ? A. About six years. I would readily employ him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the lead cut in the cellar, and was taking it to the shed to take care of - I never said I would give 10s. to make it up.</p>

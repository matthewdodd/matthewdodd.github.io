               <p>What was contained in that box? - There were four guineas in it, a pair of shoe-buckles, ten shirts, eight neckcloths, and thirteen pair of stockings, nine pair of thread and four pair of worsted, five handkerchiefs, and a new thickset waistcoat.</p>

The box was found on Sunday morning, in Hyde Park, split from the top to the bottom, and a box that was in it, with my money, was broke too; we suspected the prisoner Eustace; the prisoners were taken up, I went to see them in prison, and found one of my shirts on Eustace, and one of my neckcloths about his neck, and a pair of my stockings on. There was a letter found in his pocket directed to a woman, to go to New-street, Carnaby-market, to fetch some linen, Dixon and Macdonald went there and found some more of my linen at his washerwoman's.</p>
               <p>Who was this letter directed to? - I forget the name. We found two pair of stockings and a neckcloth there; since that a woman gave Macdonald a handkerchief, which Langham gave her to pin before her child.</p>

               <p>Was it difficult to open the coach-house door on the outside? - No; it might be done with a stick or long knife, but it could not be done with a hand.</p>

               <p>Could there be an admission into the coach-house any other way? - No; there is a way through the stable, but the stable door was locked.</p>
               <p>Had the persons got into this room through the coach-house door, or any other way? - Through the coach-house door.</p>

               <p>I met this man on Sunday morning with the bundles which I had bought in Monmouth-street; he said I had better go and leave them at the washerwoman's for safety; I met him (Langham) in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Dixon. He said before the justice that he bought them of a Jew; the justice asked him what Jew; he said it might be a Turk for what he knew.</p>
               <p>Eustace. I bought them of a Jew woman in Monmouth-street; I gave two guineas and a half for them; Langham is innocent of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>LANGHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not see this young man till I met him on Sunday morning in Compton-street; we went and had a pint of purl, and then went together to the washerwoman's.</p>

               <p>I am the prisoner Langham's brother; I am an upholsterer in James-street, Golden-square. I was very much surprised to hear of his being taken up, or being with a thief; it alarmed me very much; I never heard any thing of the kind of him before; he was bound apprentice to me; we did not agree; he left me about six months ago, and got a service in a family where a brother-in-law of mine lived as a footman; he had been out of that service about a fortnight, and lived at my brother-in-law's; my brother-in-law protected him; he had offended me very much; I did not suffer him to come to my house.</p>
               <p>I suppose when he lived with you he behaved very irregular? - He did; but he never was out of my house after ten o'clock. I could wish to save his life.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have heard the evidence you hear he was become so abandoned as to be found in bed with two girls and another man.</p>
               <p>(Macdonald produced a shirt and a pair of stockings which he took off Eustace, and a handkerchief he received of a woman who told him Langham gave it to her, and they were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

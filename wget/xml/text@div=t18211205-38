            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Little Rusel-street, Covent-garden. The prisoner came to my shop on the 20th of September, and asked me to advance him 9 s. or 10 s., on this spoon; it having a crest on it, I asked whose it was, he said it was his father's, who lived in Princes-street, very near me, and that he lived with him, but he was an out-door apprentice to Mr. Winstaple, a bedstead-maker, in Drury-lane. I said I wished to see his father before I advanced any money; he then left, to send his father, as I supposed, I sent one of my lads to follow him, he returned and said he had gone to Mr. Houlditch's - he immediately came into the shop again with a young man a little older than himself, saying, he was his brother; he said the lad had called on him, and that he worked at the prosecutor's (Houlditch's), and that the prisoner actually was an apprentice of Mr. Winstaple's, and that the spoon was the property of his father, who had been butler in a family. and had received this with many others, as a reward for his past services, which precisely agreed with what the boy had stated. I then lent him 9 s. on the spoon. On the 12th of October, he came again and brought a set of gig harness, and said Mr. Hinton, his brother, in Long-acre, had requested him to come with it - he said Mr. Hinton kept a shop; I advanced him 1 l. on it. On the 17th, he brought a coach harness, on which I advanced 30 s., after making a great deal of enquiry. On the 24th of October, he came again with two more sets of gig harness, I refused to advance any more till I saw Mr. Hinton; he said he would send him, and in the afternoon he came again with the same man whom he brought about the spoon - he said he came to speak to the correctness of the harness; I said I must see Mr. Hinton, they left, and did not come again, nor did I ever see Hinton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Was the harness in parts - A. No; it was buckled together all in one set; my house is not five minutes walk from Houlditch's, he was absent about long enough to go there - the man who he brought was about twenty-four years old; I understand he has absconded. The coach-harness was brought all together - it was heavy.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. HOULDITCH. The prisoner's brother is not sixteen years old, he has been a year and a half with me. My brother and I live together, the boys occasionally go into the kitchen, where the spoons are. The value of the coach-harness is three or four guineas, they are not new; our shop and dwelling-house join, they are all one set of premises, but part of this property might be took from our premises over the way - here is one set of coach-harness, I am sure was taken from the house, it is worth above 40 s. I am not certain that it had not been moved - one Clemence was in our employ, has absconded - he is about twenty-five years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it customary to take harness over to the other premises - A. Yes; I saw this harness in the loft a few days before he was taken, part of the harness which was buckled to it still remains there. I should think the prisoner could not carry it away all together.</p>

            . I received the harness from the witness. When I apprehended the prisoner, he said two more men used to come to the shop a little after eight o'clock in the evening; they used to take the things away for the night, and bring them to him in the morning, and he pledged them. He said he took the spoon from the kitchen and pawned it, and gave the money to the two men. He took me to a public-house to find them, but no such men were to be found - he mentioned no particular harness, but said they used to come and stand opposite the shop, and he used to give them a harness at a time, and that Clemence, who has absconded, was concerned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say from where it was taken - A. From the warehouse.</p>

On Tuesday night I was at my master's house in Hunt-street, Mile-end - I got home about half-past ten o'clock, and found the street door open; I went up to my room, which is the back room on the first floor, and found the door open - I had left it locked a little before ten that night; I had been absent above half an hour - my wife was out; I found the prisoner in my room, and another man with him, who escaped - that man was stooping down apparently putting his shoes on; the prisoner was standing alongside him -I asked how they came there; he said my wife had brought them home, and he had sent her down to get a drop of gin - I did not know them before; I asked them to follow me down stairs, and I would go and look for my wife - they followed me down; I knocked at Mr. Johnson's room on the ground floor, and told him I had caught two men in my place - the one who escaped said, "Why you ayn't going to be the fool, as to say we came to rob, have not you been drinking with us all day long?" I said, "No, I have not seen you all day;" Johnson told me to call a Policeman - I opened the door to call one; the prisoner and the other man shoved Johnson down, and ran out, but I caught the prisoner - Johnson came to my assistance, and took the prisoner into his room; they both tried to escape - the Policeman came in about a quarter of an hour; I found two bobbins of shute silk removed off the shelf, and put on the table - the Policeman took it to the station with the prisoner; the serjeant returned with me, and I found I had lost six hobbins of shute, which had also been on the shelf with the others -I have not found them; a skeleton or picklock-key was found in Johnson's room, but not in my presence - I had given my key to the woman in the front room in the morning, and my wife had it afterwards.</p>

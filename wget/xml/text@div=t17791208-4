I wanted a lodging; they offered to procure me a lodging in <placeName id="t17791208-4-crimeloc18">Gardener's-lane, Westminster</placeName>

After I had been there half an hour, the prisoner went down; I desired him to bring up a candle; he came up again without one; he then laid hold of me in the dark, put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out what money I had, which was two shillings and sixpence. I had my clothes on, I had not undressed myself. After he had taken my money he went and fetched a candle and locked the door, drew his bayonet and swore he would have my life or I should give him my great coat and boots; he struck me, gave me three wounds upon my head, besides several bruises upon my body; the other man stood by, but said nothing.

               <p>I am a soldier. I was in bed at the house. I was getting up to work in the morning, for I work in the coal trade when I am not upon duty; I heard a bustle in the room for a quarter of an hour; then I went into the room to get my accountrements out of it, and I saw the Prosecutor all over blood, and the prisoner with a drawn bayonet in his hand; upon seeing this I immediately wrested the bayonet out of his hand, and got the prosecutor out of the room, so as to part them, that they should not have any more struggling together.</p>

I took the light from him. I heard a noise in the next room; I heard the prisoner d - n the prosecutor, and ask him for his gold and great coat and boots, or else he swore he would have his life.</p>

               <p>This man met me in the street at three o'clock in the morning and asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080005"></xptr>would have part of a pot of beet; I said no, I had plenty of beer; he said you may as well go and have a pot somewhere; I said there was never a house open; he replied there was a house open in the Haymarket; we went there and had three pots of beer; coming along the Haymarket again he asked me if I lodged by myself; I said I did then, because the man I lodged with was gone to the hospital; I told him he was a stranger to me, but if he would accept of a night's lodging, he was very welcome; he went home with me. After I went up into the room I pulled my coat off and went down into the necessary; when I returned again into the room, he said he had lost his money out of his pocket, and he accused me of taking it; I said it was a wrong thing. I did not say any thing that I would have his money and boots and things. I was much in liquor; if I had an unlawful weapon in my hand, it is more than I know of. I never had my hand in his pocket.</p>

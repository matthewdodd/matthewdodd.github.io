            . I am a servant. I was out of employ just after Christmas, and lodged at the King's Head, Albemarle-street - Parsons used the house, and I became acquainted with him; I did not know Dawson. Several days before they were in custody, Parsons came to me at the Blue Posts, Bond-street, and said a person wanted to see me outside. I left him in the house, and went out and saw Dawson, who I never saw before. He asked, if I would pass a forged note; I said, I never did, and should not like to do it - he said, he would pay me if I did; and asked me to meet him next morning in Oxford-street, at nine o'clock. I made no answer and came away - he mentioned no place in Oxford-street. I met him three days after in Oxford-street, and he asked me to do the same. I had seen him before that, and he asked me, why I did not come according to appointment? I said,</p>
               <p>"I made no appointment." He then asked, if I would pass them? I refused. He said, I could get a very good living by it - that he had passed above one hundred in the country. I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here - A. Mr. Christie, the inspector, fetched me here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you in place - A. I lived with with Captain

               <p>JURY. Q. Recollect as well as you can, when you were called out of the public-house - A. It was a week or ten days after Christmas. I met them in the street three or four days after that, accidentally. I never intended to go to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you were called from the public-house, were you questioned about this - A. About a fortnight after. I have lived with Sir

               <p>"Put any address, it does not matter." I have no place of residence of my own, and I had better give an address that was known; I then gave Colonel

               <p>"I will send the cake." I said, I believed it to be good - she said, she did not know. and would send the cake. I came out, and told him the person said the note<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140021"></xptr>was bad. He said,</p>
               <p>"No, it is not, you may depend on it." I said the woman would not refuse it if it was not - he said,</p>
               <p>"I want an almanack and some paper; go and get it, and I will go with you; I am sure it is good." I went in, and gave the note to Mrs. Stevens, who gave it her husband in the parlour; he put it in his pocket, but they never asked me for any address; but he came and took hold of me, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is a bad note - we have been tricked by some of you before.</p>
               <p>"I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who gave it to me - why not take him?" At the office he denied giving it me, but he knows he did; he afterwards wavered, and said, he did give it me. They asked me several questions, at the house of correction. He said, I need not be afraid, for he had taken it of a man he had sold some things to, and that he would go to the house with me. Mr. Stevens asked me for no address. After leaving Colonel

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-surveyor. On Wednesday even<lb></lb>ing, the 30th of Sept., I was on duty at the landing-place at the stain in Hogg-lane, Woolwich. A boat came up with the two defendants in it—they were sitting in the after-part of the boat, on the benches—their feet were placed over a bag of copper, which was lying down in the after-part of the boat—I asked them where they came from?—they both told me from Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi> then lying off the dock-yard—this is the bag of copper which I found in the after-part of the boat—it had been under their feet—at the time I found it they were still in the boat—Berry was in the act of passing out of the boat—I asked her how she came by the copper?—he said a man or a person on board the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi> had given her the copper, telling her there were no marks upon it, and that it was private property—she walked out of the boat, and I lost her—I went aft and asked Motton what account he gave of it?—he said it was given him by a person on board the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi>—that it was no use—it was knocking about the deck, and he thought there was no harm in taking it—(the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi> was about half a mile from where I saw the boat)—I told him he must know there was no power in any one on board, or for sailors, giving copper away—I took him in custody—I have known him three or four years—the prisoners are both engaged as bum-boaters, that is in taking bread and sausages, and other things, on board ships, that sailors might want—the next morning I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi>—Motton was in my boat with my people—when I got near the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi> I saw Berry on board a coal-hulk that lay alongside the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi>—I told her I wanted to speak to her about the copper she had with her last night in the boat—she said a person named Jones gave her the copper on board the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi>—I asked her to point out Jones, and she did so—Jones said, in her presence, "No, I never gave you any copper at all"—I said she must know that he had no power to give copper, or any stores belonging to Her Majesty—she said he told her it had no mark on it, and it was private property—this is the copper—it has the broad-arrow on it, and this is the bag it was in, which is also marked with the arrow—when I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Plover</hi> there was plenty of copper on board, of the same description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the store-department at Woolwich—this copper is marked with the broad-arrow—that is the mark put on Her Majesty's naval stores—here is the mark on five places on this piece of copper—it is copper-sheeting used for sheeting the bottom of ships—I do not see the mark on this other piece at all—it is so much corroded—the whole of the copper is more than one-third worn—it is sent to the dock-yard to be melted again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

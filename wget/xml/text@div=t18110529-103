            . Q. Were you very early in the morning passing Mr. Clack's house - A. At half after five, and I saw the prisoner Wellings coming out of Mr. Clack's house; Guernsey opened the door; Wellings had a bundle of soap under his left arm; I let him go on; I went further on and met him again in Old-street-road with the same bundle; I stopped him at No. 22, James-street, Old-street-road. I never lost sight of him; he had the same bundle with him that he had when he came out of Mr. Clack's house; I informed him that he had stolen property that did not belong to him; he begged for me to let him go, he said he was a soldier, if I took him he would receive five hundred lashes. I took him into custody, Mr. Ashworth assisted me; he said that he had it of his brother; I told him if I let him go I should compound felony. I took him back to Mr. Clack's house, Mr. Clack was not up; I knocked at the door, the prisoner Guernsey let me in; I told Guernsey to call his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290066"></xptr>master, he went and called his master; I stopped in the shop some short time, his master did not come; I went up stairs and called Mr. Clack; I told him he had been robbed; he said he hoped it was not his servant; Mr. Clack followed me, I looked for the soap, and saw the soap removed where I had left it, it was put into the scale; I looked into the scale, and saw it was fourteen pound weight; Mr. Clack sent for a constable; there were some herrings found with the soap. I cannot say the quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clack. Upon being called by the last witness you there saw the prisoners at the bar - A. Yes, and the prisoner Wellings was pointed out to me as the person that carried the soap away; the witness Ashworth told me to consider that he was a soldier, that he would receive five hundred lashes; I charged Guernsey of being guilty of it; he said he had sold it to the soldier, and he meant to pay me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was this - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Guernsey your servant disposed of any soap and made any entery the night before - A. No, I have got my book here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the usual time for Guernsey to be up - A. He had no occasion to be up so early that morning, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to the soap being your property - A. No, because the soap maker sells to other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you red herrings - A. I had. I would not swear positively to the soap, but Guernsey told me he had sold it to Wellings.</p>

               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; Wellings called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

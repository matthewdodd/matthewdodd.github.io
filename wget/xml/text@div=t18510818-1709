                  </hi>. I am a soldier, in the grenadier-guards. On the morning of 17th July I was in bed with a woman in James-court, St. Ann's-lane, Westminster—we went to bed about 2 o'clock in the morning—I had seen Manning near the door with his back against the wall as I went in, and bare no doubt he is the man—he fetched a pot of beer before I went to bed, but I would not drink any of it—I had not been in bed a minute when I heard a noise at the window; it went up, and two men came in—the room is on the ground-floor, the bed is close to the window, the prisoners are the men—Ashby came in first, and Manning afterwards; they went to my clothes on the chair—I got out of bed and said I would not be robbed, a scuffle ensued; the door was unbolted either by them or by the girl, and another man came in—I called "Police!" and they cleared out of the room, the girl went out first, they had got my clothes in their hands—I got my breeches and leggings away from them—I was not in my uniform—I missed my waist<lb></lb>coat, which contained three half-crowns, one shilling, a fourpenny—<hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and a handkerchief; also my braces—I have never seen my waistcoat since—this is my handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it two years—I call it dark brown—I had it in my pocket when I went into the room—I have no doubt the prisoners are the men—I ran after them—I was close behind Ash by when I got out of the door, and never lost sight of him till the policeman was in sight of him, who brought him back—he said it would not be above a <hi rend="italic">sixer.</hi>

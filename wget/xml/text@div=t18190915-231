I was in a field adjoining the road, reading a book; when I got about halfway across the field I heard a footstep, looked back, and perceived a man holding his head down, and his hand in his bosom - I went on reading for about half a minute, then looked round, as I was in the act of turning he called out</p>

               <p>"Stop, Sir!" and immediately presented a pistol towards my breast - he was five or six yards from me - he did not say a word; but expecting every moment to be shot, I screamed, and not hearing any shot I ran away. After running a short distance, I turned, and saw him in the same place, apparently doing something to the lock of the pistol. I got to a stile, and thought myself secure, looked round, and observed nobody was with him. I held my cane up to him, he then put himself in an attitude as if to run after me. I proceeded towards Hornsey-wood House, met an officer, and described the man to him. I cannot speak with certainty to the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at Ball's pond, and found a pistol in his coat-pocket. I asked him what he had got? he said he had nothing. I seized the pistol, and found it was loaded with five bullets. I also found a large knife in his pocket, with twenty-three other bullets, and some gunpowder. He said he had been to Stepney to shoot sparrows. It was about ten o'clock at night.</p>

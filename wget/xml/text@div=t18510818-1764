                  </hi>. I am waiter at the White Hart public-house, Park-street, Southwark, which is kept by Mr. Young, it is in St. Saviour's parish. On Wednesday evening, 13th Aug., between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came and went into the bagatelle-room, which is up-stairs, and adjoins my master's bed-room—a panel of the bed-room door has been broken, and is mended with a piece of sacking, nailed over it inside, and then there is a piece of wood nailed across the sacking to keep it firm—about half-past 9, I missed the prisoner from the bagatelle-room, where I had seen him ten minutes before—I went down-stairs, spoke to Mrs. Young, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what she said I went up-stairs again, and while going up saw the prisoner coming through the panel of the door—he came down-stairs, passed me on the stairs, and I followed him to the door—Mrs. Young had followed me op-stairs, and went into the bed-room—at the front-door the prisoner looked round', saw me, and ran away—I followed, and caught him about twenty yards from the house—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and ran. down Fishmonger-alley—I cried, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped in the alley by Richards—when he was stopped I saw him stoop down by the side of the wall, and heard something jingle—a light was afterwards brought, and the policeman picked up two skeleton keys on the spot in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Baker-street, Stepney—the prisoner and Barton lived at No. 10, Baker-Street, where I used to live. On the 22nd of Mar, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up stairs very tipsy, and used bad expressions, and said she would have some of their lives—ahe kept swearing at Burton, and then Burton asked her for the loan of the irons—the prisoner said she should not have them—Burton said she must, as she wanted to use them, and followed her up stairs for them—I was standing in my mistress's room—the prisoner took the water-jug, threw it at Barton, and hit her in the temple—they were a very little distance from each other—the prisoner kept the jug in her hand, and struck her on the temple, with it—it did not go out of her hand till after she struck, her—the blood came from her temple.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Portugal Hotel, in Flee-street, and was so at the latter end of Feb last. On the night of 27th or morning of 28th Feb. about half past 12 o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise—I went out, and found a crowd collected at the door of No. 158, next door to our premises, and adjoining them—I went to the leads at the back of our house, and got on to the leads of No. 158, so as to be able to look into the house—the leads are nearly on the same level as the floor—there were neither shutters nor blinds to the back window—I looked into the room that was used as a kitchen, and saw a fire burning on the landing—there is only one landing between the room used as a kitchen and the room which looks into Fleet-street—the staircase goes up the centre of the house—it appeared to me to be a well staircase, but I never was higher than the first floor—I saw no fire higher than that—I went into the street again, and saw that firemen were there, and people got into the house—the house had not been open since Saturday night—it was a house for chops, steaks, and refreshments—I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday after the fire, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon; he came into the Portugal Hotel, to receive some money which was due to him for beer—the conversation was not addressed to me, but to the barmaid; it turned upon the fire, and the prisoner said to the barmaid, "It is a bad job for me, but I ought to be thankful that my little children were not there"—I do not know whether they are his children or his sister's, but I have seen children there, and he had his sister living with him as housekeeper—he said that he had locked up the house on Saturday night, and was not there on the Monday, but was staying at his lodging, at Islington, as he was very unwell on Monday, and took some medicine, which kept him at home all day; that the first he heard of the fire was on Tuesday evening, when he was coming down from his lodging at Islington, to keep an appointment with a man at the corner of Chancery-lane, who had taken the business of him, and some one met him and told him that his house was burned down—the barmaid said, "What a strange place to make an appoint<lb></lb>ment</p>

               <p>to meet a man on business of that kind!"—Mr. Hall made no reply to that, but took the money that was owing to him and walked out—the shop was open on Saturday, but not afterwards—I had had conversation with him before that, on the state of his business—I used to go in and out sometimes two or three times a day, and used to say, "How are you getting on?" and one morning I said, "Mr. Hall, I do not think you will make a fortune here;" he nodded his head, and said, "Oh, never mind, I will make some<lb></lb>body pay for it some day"—I should think that was about a month before the fire—he was not there above four or five months, certainly not six months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the fire brigade. On Monday night, 27th Feb., I got to fleet-street at about half past 12 o'clock, and with others broke open the door and got in—there was no fire on the ground floor, the great bulk of the fire was on the first floor landing—I was able to get about three parts of the way up the first flight of stairs—we were about two hours before we succeeded in subduing the fire—the staircase was in the middle of the house—there was a wooden partition on the first floor to divide the front room from the staircase—the back room was enclosed by brickwork, a portion of which was standing after the fire—I saw the fire going up the staircase into the first floor rooms, front and back, but the bulk of the fire was on the landing, burning up the staircase very fiercely—I saw no shavings on the premises at that time, but about a fortnight afterwards I saw some in the first floor front room, and the back room, the same on the second floor, and the same on the upper floor—at the time I saw them there had been some carpenters at work on the first floor; the shavings on the second floor had been on the beds—in the front room second floor, and in the back room, I observed shavings which bore traces of fire, and the same on the upper floor, the third floor, in both attics—they were lying about the beds partially burned, and the floors were very much burned; we were not able to stand without planks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he tell you he could smell the tobacco? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could say anything—he asked me if I did smoke, and I said, "No"—he told me that if I did I should not do it—I do not know how many times he did that—he complained of my drinking as well—the drink was not for chilblains, but he gave no one a chance to drink but himself; his cellar was always locked—I did not try it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Tappenden, who lives in Fleet-street—I had some intention of taking the house, No. 158, Fleet-street, from the prisoner, soon after Christmas—I saw the prisoner upon it—in the first instance he asked me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the concern, furniture, fixtures, and all; that was some time in Jan.—he afterwards offered it to me as low as 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, I should not mind giving 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my agent proposed that we should divide the difference, but that I declined—I had made no agreement with the prisoner at the time the fire happened—on the Friday or Saturday immediately before the fire, I went to the place—there were two gentlemen in the first room as I entered, and the prisoner said, those two gentlemen were about taking the house, and I had better fix upon it at once—I said, "I should consider more about it, but I had not made up my mind at present"—he did not say any more; his sister asked me up stairs to rest, as I was ill at the time.</p>

Q.</hi> Before you made the offer of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., did you go over the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; several times—he showed me an inventory, and said what he wished me to take was what he himself had taken when he came in; he told me that he had laid out money upon the place; in the first instance he said about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in fittings and alterations—he pointed them</p>

               <p>out to me—I had not much knowledge of the business; it was my husband who wished to enter into it—he pointed out a new water closet that he had built—he mentioned two or three different sums as what he had paid when he went in—at first he said 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had laid out—I should have given 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not in any way diminish the value of the business in speaking to me—I have never sold a business.</p>

I am an auctioneer and agent in Cranbourne-street—about the beginning of Feb., I was consulted by Mrs. Tappenden about the house in Fleet-street—I had sold the house to the former occu<lb></lb>pant, Mr. Pilkington, in Feb., 1853—there was then a valuation made; it was 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for fixtures—that was what Mr. Pilkington paid when he went in—there was an inventory on that occasion; that same inventory, with certain additions, was brought to me by Mrs. Tappenden—I went to the house in Feb. last; I found same things in it that were not included in the former valuation—I should suppose the value of those additional things was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they were to be included in the purchase—there were other things besides, which the prisoner described as his private furniture; I did not of course look at them with a view of purchasing; but I should suppose they were worth about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In going over the premises, did you see anything answering to the description of "a handsome Spanish mahogany desk washstand, with nest of drawers, supply cistern inside, and fittings all complete, 20 guineas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw nothing which would amount to anything like that value—I saw a mahogany wash hand stand—I saw nothing which I should reckon above the value of from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw a sort of mahogany square enclosed wash hand stand; I did not look into the interior of it—I know what they are generally; if there had been an article answering that description, I could not have failed to notice it—I did not tell the prisoner that I came there on the part of Mrs. Tappenden—he told me that he had been offered 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mrs. Tappenden, which I knew to be false—he did not know that I was acting for Mrs. Tappenden—I went down into the cellar; there was a very small stock indeed; what I saw there I should think would not amount to above 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a traveller in drapery—I travel for houses in the drapery line—during the time the prisoner kept the house in Fleet-street, I used to dine there occasionally—in that way I became acquainted with him—I have been out with him several times into the City, to several places—I have been with him to the Bay Tree, in St. Swithin's-lane: that was about the latter end of Jan.—I went there with him and two other persons; we were there about an hour and a half, or two hours—we drank together there; we had nothing to eat—we left between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening—the other persons came away with us, but we parted outside—the prisoner and I walked home towards Fleet-street together—on our return home, we went into the Daniel Lambert public house, on Ludgate-hill—we only stood in front of the bar, and had a glass of ale; we then proceeded towards his house—as we went, he said, "Well, I am going to be a partner of your <hi rend="italic">governor;</hi> "that was Halsey—I had been in Halsey's employment previously, and I was then in his employment—he lives at No. 67, Chancery-lane—I had been about six weeks in his employment—he said, "If I can place con<lb></lb>fidence in you, I can put money in your pocket"—I said, "How?"—this was near his own house, and he said, "I will tell you another time"—we then parted; he went in doors, and I went on to the west end of the town—I saw him again the next day—I dined with him; at least, I dined at his house, and in the evening we went out again together; I and the prisoner, Halsey, and a man of the name of Gleed—they were the two that had been with us at the Bay Tree—Gleed lodged at the prisoner's house—we all four went to the Bay Tree again, because it was near the omnibus where Halsey got in; he generally took the omnibus near King William-street—we drank together there, and stayed I think till near 10 o'clock—the prisoner and I parted with the others outside the door, and we walked home as before—in the course of our walk, I said to him, "Well, Hall, how are you going to put money in my pocket?"—he said, "To tell you the truth, I am going to have a blaze"—"Indeed," I said—he said, "Yes, I intend to fire the premises, for I am insured pretty stiff;" or, "rather stiff;" "pretty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140076"></xptr>
               <p>stiff," I think it was—I said, "Then I shall not have anything at all to do with you;" that was all that passed—we parted, and he went inside his house—the following day I was at Halsey's, when he came there—they had a little private conversation, which I did not hear, and a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards some furniture was brought in in a truck—it was put in the back room—there are only two rooms, the office and the room; the furniture was put in the room—it is not a large auction room, merely offices—it was put in the back office—some more was brought afterwards—altogether, there were eight mahogany chairs, an easy chair, a large looking glass, window curtains, brass rods, a sofa, and a quantity of other things—the prisoner said that they were brought there as he was going to be a partner of Halsey's—he is an auctioneer—I was in Halsey's employment from the latter end of Dec. to the 14th Feb.—the furniture was brought the last week in Jan.—I do not know at what time the prisoner went into the house in Fleet-street—during the time I was with Mr. Halsey I did not know or hear of any furniture being lent by him to the prisoner, or deposited in his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you give me the date of this conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the last week in Jan.—it passed in Fleet-street, between Farring<lb></lb>don-street and his house; I should think between 10 and 11 o'clock; I was then living with Mr. Halsey, at No. 67, Chancery-lane, not sleeping there; I slept at No. 32, Great Portland-street at that time, and for some time previously, and do now—I have lived there for twelve months up to this time, I am known there by the name of Errick—if anybody inquired for me there, they would find that I lived there—I was not aware that an inquest was held about this fire, until I returned to London from Man<lb></lb>chester—that was I think in the middle of March—I think about the 8th or 10th—I then heard that an inquest had been held, I did not hear that it was over—I read of the fire in the newspaper, when I was at Manchester—I heard of the inquest when I returned to town, that was after the inquest had been held—I do not know about the date, I suppose it was about the 8th or 10th March—I heard then that the inquest had been held—I know the time that I came up from Manchester perfectly well, I should not think there could be any mistake about it—it was either the 8th or 10th March that I returned from Manchester, I am positive—I do not know positively, but I believe it was about that time; I heard from a man in Holborn that the inquest had been held—he did not tell me that the inquest was over—he told me the inquest had been held respecting the fire in Fleet-street, and the officer was inquiring for me—that was when I returned from Manchester, I think about 8th or 10th March, I did not go to the Westminster Fire Office in consequence—the officer came to a house that I went to in Holborn—I did not go there purposely to meet him, I had been in the habit of using that house sometimes—he was not aware that I was going there—he did not meet me by accident, nor by appointment—the man told me the officer wanted to see me, and then I went to see the officer—that was a few days after I came to town—I was not aware that the inquest was being held while I was in town, I am certain of that—I left London for Manchester between 15th and 20th Feb., from Manchester I went to Preston, and then returned to town on 8th or 10th March—when I saw the officer, I did not hear what the verdict at the inquest had been—the officer's name is Gaylor—I was first examined in this case at the police court, I think that was in April—I did not lay the information, I wont to the police court and was examined—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185408140077"></xptr>
               <p>there with the officer—I think it was about a month after I returned to town—I never laid any information—it was on my information that a warrant was issued—I am not the person that originated this prosecution—I do not know whether it was upon my evidence only, that the warrant was issued—I gave my evidence at Guildhall—I do not think anybody else gave evidence that day—I was not in town whilst the inquest was held—I never laid any other information against any one, for anything—I have never informed against any one—I did inform against a person for selling goods without a hawker's licence—that was a short time ago—that was connected with my own business; there was nothing criminal in that I apprehend—I never informed against any one—I told the police of it, I do not call that informing—I told the police that they were trading without a licence—I went before a Magistrate, and was sworn about it—the parties were not fined—I have not done that more than once, that was only a fortnight ago—I was never a witness before a Magistrate before; the infor<lb></lb>mation was against a Mr. Way—I did not go to the parties against whom I complained, before I informed—I will swear that—I had not made any demand of money upon them—I am certain of that, not a farthing—I did not give the information from a sense of public justice—I heard that I should not receive my money, and then I gave information to the police; it was money that was due to me, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of the parties had refused to pay me, and I told the police—it is necessary that these fellows should be brought to justice—I do not know whether I should have informed if the fellows had paid me my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. perhaps I should, I do not know that it would have been ungrateful, that would depend upon circumstances—I have been connected with them for years—I have not been connected with men who sell goods without a licence, I always have a licence—I was connected with those fellows that I informed about, for about ten years—I did not say that they would not pay me my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but they put me off from day to day—I did not think I should get the money by informing against them—I dare say I shall get it, I have not tried to get it—I intend to summons them in the County Court—I state distinctly that I live at No. 32, Great Portland-street—I think it is the second floor that I occupy, I know it is—I have occupied it twelve months—I pay rent for it myself, in my own name—the landlord is Mr. Matthew Slingsby—I have paid him rent for the second floor for twelve months, within a week or two—I have lodged there, and paid rent for that twelve months—I pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for one room, a bed room—I have not been in town during the whole of that twelve months—I have stated that I was travelling about for drapery houses—that is true, this last week I have not travelled for any one—I was engaged in London for this house in Bristol, for the man of the name of Way—that is the man you say I informed against, I was travelling for him—I do not think he has any place of business—I was engaged for three weeks till last week, I did not travel before that—I was in a situation, at Mr. Hurst's, No. 108, Oxford-street, a shawl house—I was with him from May last to the latter end of July, and then for three weeks with Mr. Way—I have stated that I was travelling in the drapery trade—I did not say for any house, because the persons I have been travelling for, travel from town to town—they do not sell by auction—they travel from town to town with goods, and sell them in the various towns—they send hand bills round—I have been with them for ten years—I think the police have interfered with us once—that was in Leadenhall-street, this time twelve months—the police were placed at the door, for the purpose of</p>

               <p>warning persons from going in—that was not on the ground that we were a set of swindlers, because our business was carried on quite as respectably as the drapers' generally are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a set of men called "The Towsery gang?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is in the country called "The Towsery gang;" we had a man with us of the name of Towsery, who was well known in the country; he was not known in London—we aroused the jealousy of the drapers and they denominated us "The Towsery gang"—we are quite as respectable as the gentlemen in Ludgate-hill—we were never charged with selling sham goods—we were charged with charging exorbitant prices, perhaps, but not with selling sham goods—we were never charged with selling articles worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used you to represent that these sales were the wrecks of fires, and so on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When a fire took place we bought goods there; and then, of course, we represented them as goods from the fire—in Leadenhall-street we were known by the name of "Brown Brothers"—that was the place where the police were placed at the door—they were only there for two or three hours, not longer; I do not mean for two or three hours a day, but for two or three hours in one day—we did not leave after that, we stayed two months there, from April to June—I do not know whether "Brown Brothers" were ever summoned before the Magistrate, not criminally they were not—I think one of them was summoned, that was Brown—I think it was to Marlborough-street, I am not certain—we were then trading as "Brown Brothers"—the place of business was then in Pall Mall; he was only sum<lb></lb>moned once to my knowledge—I was at Pall Mall with him—I have not been with Brown Brothers pretty well all over the country—I do not know what names we went by—various names—I was not the proprietor—I have been with them about ten years—I think we went by different names in different towns—we had a licence to travel, and the licence was always in Brown's name—we did not always trade in Brown's name, not when any large firm had failed, or anything of that sort, we very likely then traded in the name of that firm—we never traded in the name of Howard and Co.—I know a Mr. Lloyd—he was not one of them, he was in business for himself in Maddox-street—he had sale rooms—he was there two years—I was with him part of the time—Mr. Brown was not with him—that was not Brown's concern, it was separate—I suppose I was with him for about two months, I changed about from one time to the other—I remember the fire at Messrs. Pawson's, in St. Paul's-churchyard—it was never com<lb></lb>plained that Brown Brothers had fraudulently represented that they had purchased a large quantity of their stock—it was said so by a draper in the neighbourhood—we did buy goods of them—I was never charged with assaulting ladies who came to our establishment and compelling them to buy, nor were any of us to my knowledge—I think I did hear that Lloyd was, but I was not present—I do not know a person of the name of Hor<lb></lb>wood—I know the name of Allgood—I gave him a character as a respect<lb></lb>able man—I was never charged with giving him a false character—not the slightest complaint was ever made of it—I will swear that—he lived with me between three and four months—I never gave him a nine months' cha<lb></lb>racter, nor was it false, nor was the slightest complaint made of it—that I swear—he lived with me at Chertsey or Egham—I was travelling about then—he was one of the men that lived with me while I was travelling about—I gave him a character on that account; not from Mr. Towsery, or Brown Brothers, but from myself—he was my servant, and I paid him</p>

               <p>wages—I have lived at Cheltenham; I was in the drapery business there, alone—I had a shop—I was there about six months the second time, and about twelve months the first time, still in the drapery trade, never any other—I was nothing else there but in the drapery trade—I did not know a man named Hog there—I knew him in London—I was not with him at any time—I met him at a tavern in Regent-street—I never lived in the same house with him—I never acted as servant to him—I knew him for about three or four months I suppose—I never used to be with him as a companion—God knows whether he has been transported—I saw him the other day—I first knew him in '45, I have known him since then, but I was only acquainted with him in '45 for a month or two—I have known him ever since; I should have known if he had been transported; I have not known him, but I should have known that—he was never imprisoned to my knowledge—I had nothing to do with him at a gambling house; nothing of the kind—I was in the habit of taking my meals at the prisoner's coffee shop; I always paid for them—there is no debt owing whatever, not a farthing—I think I became acquainted with Gleed last August, at Green<lb></lb>wich—I was not dismissed from Mr. Halsey's, I left of my own accord—I was there about six weeks—I did not live there at the same time that Gleed did—I left some time before Gleed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable. I went to the pre<lb></lb>mises soon after the fire—I attended at the Guildhall police office, when application was made for a warrant against the prisoner—I think that was on the 19th April, or the 29th—Errick was examined there, and Mr. Storr—I do not think I was—on receiving the warrant of the Magistrate, I endeavoured to execute it in London—I could not find the prisoner in London—I ultimately found him, on 6th June, at a pawnbroker's of the name of Thomas, at 134 or 135, Dale-street, Liverpool, where he was employed—I told him I wanted him on a warrant for arson—he said, "Very well," and I brought him to London.</p>

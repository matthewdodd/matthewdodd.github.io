            . I am a boot-maker, I live at No. 24, Duke-street, West Smithfield. On Friday the 3rd of December, a waggon stopped opposite my shop window, and in the waggon the prisoner was sitting; the man that was driving it went into a public-house facing of our house, and while the waggoner was gone into the public-house the prisoner employed himself in untying a flat of butter, and out of that flat he took a lump of butter and placed the lump of butter in an empty one that was standing endways upwards; he then tied the flat that he had taken the lump of butter out, and threw it in a careless manner to the other side of the waggon, as though he was about his business. By this time the waggoner that went into the public-house came out, and brought half a pint of purl or beer to the prisoner; he drank it, and gave the waggoner the money to pay for it, and while the waggoner was gone to the public-house the second time, the prisoner took his handkerchief out of his pocket, as if to wipe his nose, instead of that he took up the lump of butter he had throwed into the empty flat, tied it up, and put it into his pocket; the waggoner then moved the waggon; they went on towards Smithfield. I saw two officer; I told them to follow me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in Smithfield upon duty; Mr. Jolly came, he said come along with me. He told me the man in the waggon had stolen a lump of butter out of a flat; I jumped in the waggon by Smithfield bars. On searching the prisoner I found two pounds of butter in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wykes. I am book-keeper of the waggon, and I keep the Inn. The prisoner was one of the porters; the waggon had been to Newgate market; the prisoner was appointed to take care that nobody should rob the waggon.</p>

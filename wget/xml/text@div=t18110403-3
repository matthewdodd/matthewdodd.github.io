            . I am a Chelsea pensioner. On Tuesday the 19th of February, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the constable take the prisoner with a basket of linen out of a house in St. Giles's; I followed the constable, he was taking her to Marlborough-street; the prisoner took a belcher handkerchief out of her pocket, and dropped it into a woman's lap that was sitting down as she passed by. I took it out of the woman's lap, and gave it to the constable. This was between twelve and one o'clock; I saw her putting her hand into her pocket again, I said, stop, constable, she has got more handkerchiefs in her pocket. I took her hand out of her pocket, and took out of her pocket five more handkerchiefs; I gave them to the constable; that made six, and the one on her neck was seven. They were all belcher handkerchiefs, but different patterns. The prisoner was very much in liquor.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at No. 18, Backeridge-street; I went there from information, called her out; I told her she must go up into her room, I would tell her what I wanted with her. This was between twelve and two o'clock; we went up into her own room, she asked me what I wanted with her; she said she would not open the door; she had the key in her hand; I took the key out of her hand, and opened the door myself. In the middle of the room stood a basket, I asked her how she came by it; she said a young man gave it her. I asked her who the young man was; she said she did not know, she had never seen him before, he had promised to bring her some more. I packed up the basket of linen and tied them up; I said you must go with me.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not produce the hankerchiefs - A. No. She said, what occasion have I to go with you, you have got your own property. I took the basket of linen and her to Marlborough-street office. She dropped the handkerchiefs, as was related before. I saw the handkerchiefs taken out of her pocket, and one was on her neck; they were all marked the same as the linen in the basket. The prisoner was intoxicated. She told the magistrate that a young man brought them to her to wash, that she had lived with the young man some time. She was committed. I advertized the property. Mrs. Davidson came and claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. You said these goods were left in the parlour - A. Yes; the parlour door was open. The basket was tied down when in my parlour, she must have opened them at her own home to have taken the handkerchiefs out. I was sweeping about the door at the time they were taken away. If she had opened them in my room I should have seen her. The shirts were worth a guinea each, when new; they may all be worth about two pounds now. I am not certain. They are all the gentleman's property that sent them me to wash.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This basket was delivered to me by a man, it had a cloth over it; the handkerchiefs he gave me loose out of his pocket; he told me to go home and he would bring the rest of the things to me. We had something to drink together in the forenoon. I took the handkerchiefs of the man at the end of Oxford-road; I took them home. I asked the man where he came from, he said he had disagreed with his relations. I had been in his company before, we agreed to live together. The constable came and took the things away; he said he would advertise the things, he did not think I came honestly by them.</p>

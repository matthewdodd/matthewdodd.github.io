Last Friday morning between 2 and 3 o'clock I heard my bell ring, a man with a lanthorn called to me to come down, he told me my shop was robbed. I put on my cloaths and went down, I found the iron bar that goes cross the shutters, was drawn out; there was the watchman with a young woman that he was guarding home; the two shutters were taken down, and the glass was broke all to pieces, some lay in the street, and some within; the watchman, coming over the hill, found a bit of brown cloth with 6 of my handkerchiefs in it, and 2 other handkerchiefs that had been in it, lying near the others. In the morning I went to Justice Fielding, thinking he could give me some directions; the clerk told me, I must advertise the things, and a reward. I came home and had some bills printed and dispatched them to the pawnbrokers, and on the Saturday I had an account of a bit of lawn that had been offered to pawn. I sent my apprentice to see if it was mine; he came and told me, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230008"></xptr> had seen my mark on it, and could swear it was my property. The prosecutor sent the young woman that brought it to him to pawn, and one of his neighbours with it, in my house; I found it to be my property. The young woman said, she would carry me to the person that had given it to her. I got an officer, and proceeded six of us to the house, there was the prisoner Lyon. The young woman asked her, how she could serve her so to send her to pawn goods that were stolen? Lyon said, she had sent her with no stolen goods: then I shewed her the cloth, and desired her to tell me, how she came by it? she said, she found it; I asked her, where and when? she said, yesterday morning about 6 o'clock in East-Smithfield, wrapt up in a bit of paper, on the ground: I desired to know, how she could say she found it on the ground when it was quite clean. Several of the company desired her to confess the truth, and give an account of her confederates; she said, she had no accomplice, nor she would discover none. The officer and I went to Justice Berry for a search-warrant. I told the clerk, there was a man in the prisoner's lodgings with her that looked like a sailor, and asked, if I should bring him? he said, bring him and all the people you find in her room. We had a search-warrant, and urged her again to confess before we began to search; she would not confess any thing, but said, if this would hang her, she would be hang'd for it. The officer searched under the bolster of her bed, we found 2 silk and cotton handkerchiefs; between the feather-bed and the matting we found a Southsea handkerchief, and the rest here was tied up in a silk handkerchief and put between the head-board and the wall, when the board was taken away it fell on the ground; then the prisoner began to cry; we took them and her before the Justice, a great many have my pencil mark upon them, (about 50 handkerchiefs produced in court) these were all in my shop the day before. The Justice desired to know, how she came by them? she said, she found them on the Friday morning about 6 o'clock in East-Smithfield, as she was going to Billingsgate to buy fish; the Justice blamed her very much for going so much out of her way. Then the prisoner Martin was examined. The Justice asked him, what business he had there at the prisoner's lodgings? he said, he came to get a little girl that was there to go and take a pair of shoes of his out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a little girl there?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I did, she appeared to be about 10 years of age. The justice asked him how long he had been on shore, and what ship he had been on board, and what money he had when he came on shore; he said 6 guineas; and by his own account he had but 16 s. 6 d. a month. The justice asked, how long ago it was that he had pawn'd his shoes; he was very inconsistent in his answers: the justice asked him where he laid; he said, with his mother in Spittlefields, with a tall sailor that used to come to the prisoner Lyon, one

The justice ordered us a search warrant; we went and searched his lodgings at his mother's; the mother was a basket-woman that attends Leadenhall market, she was not at home; we looked in at a hole big enough to put my hand in, we saw it was an ordinary room, with only one bed in it, we could view the room all over; we were informed by the neighbours that he did not lodge there, and that his mother had not seen him for some time, we could not find where he lodged: we found

            , he was a watchman, but he did not answer the description that Martin gave of him, he was a shortish man, he went voluntary with us, it appeared he was upon his duty that night as a watchman, and he was sent home about hi s business. We took the prisoner Lyon apart, and told her, she certainly would be acquitted if she would tell the truth: at last she said, if you will discharge us all, I will tell you the whole story; this the justice's clerk and several others heard. I told her, I would discharge her, and all that were innocent: when she found I would not discharge the whole, she said, I did it all myself, let me be hanged, and there's an end of it. After that she went in to be farther examined, and he committed them, and bound me over to prosecute. It went very hard with me, to think this woman must suffer, for what I know she could not of herself effect. I went to her yesterday in Newgate, there she would not own so far as she had before; I did all in my power to save her life; she says she is but 18 years old, I do not think she is above 4 or 5 and 20.</p>

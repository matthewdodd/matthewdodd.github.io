                  </hi>. I am a chronometer maker, at No. 30, Cornhill. I have one partner—on 17th May, the prisoner called at my shop; he asked to see some patent winding watches—he was shown some by my partner, and, after looking at one at 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he would make up his mind in a day or two—he gave no name or address—he did not call again—I received a letter in the afternoon of 19th May—I am not certain when I saw that letter last, but it was on the day I was examined at Guildhall, when I handed it to Mr. Martin—I cannot swear what he did with it—Mr. Martin's clerk said, "Of course we will take care of the letter"—in consequence of that letter, I went to No. 20, Charles Street, Westbourne Terrace—I asked if Mr. Mitchel was in, and I was shown into a small room; the prisoner came down, and I said to him, "We received your letter, Sir, this afternoon, and I have brought the watch and some chains for inspection"—we had some general conversation about the watch, and the way of winding it—he asked me if I had a receipt with me; but he had first selected a chain, which I attached to the watch, and put it in a morocco case, and put it before him—I cannot swear whether it was before him when he asked me to make out a bill and receipt—I said I had a bill of the watch, but I would add the chain to it, which came to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I added it, and he then desired me to receipt the bill, at the same time saying, "You give discount for cash"—this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I receipted it—we had some little argument about the discount, and I agreed to take off five per cent—he then said something about not having sufficient money there to pay for it, and he said, "Excuse me for a moment, I will go up stairs and fetch it"—he took up the watch and the account, and slipped out at the front door—I waited about a quarter of an hour after he had left the room—as soon as I had packed up the chains, I opened the door to see that he did not slip out at the front door, but I did not see him again till he was in custody at</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lodging house keeper, at No. 20, Park Street, Westbourne Terrace. The prisoner came to my house about 10 o'clock in the morning, on 19th May; he said he had just come from the country, and wanted a back drawing room, which I said I could not accommodate him with, but I had a small room, and a bedroom at the top—he asked what I wanted for them; I said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; he said it was too much, he should be in town five or six weeks—I said, in that case, I would take something less—he went away, and did not take the rooms—he returned at 5 o'clock, and said he had come to say that he would take the rooms—he said he had written a letter to me, but had forgotten to post it—he said, "I have been to the Crystal Palace, I am very tired, I am going to the hotel to dine, and I will return"—he returned at twenty minutes after 7 o'clock, and asked if his room was ready; I said, "Yes"—he then asked me to send to the Great Western for his luggage—he said his hands were dirty, and he would go up stairs to wash them; that he expected a gentleman to call on him, and asked me to come and tell him—while I was up stairs the last witness called, and my wife showed him into the room—I went up and told the prisoner; he came down, and they remained together about a quarter of an hour—I heard the prisoner come out again, and he went up stairs very quietly to where he had washed his hands—I had occasion to go up, and I met him coming down—I asked him whether he intended to take tea; he said he could not tell, he was just going out for a minute, and when he returned he would tell me—he went out, I shut the door after him; I never saw him again till I saw him at Guildhall, in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eight years old, and live with my father and mother, in Brook-street, Rateliff. On the 9th of January, I was in White Horse-street, Ratcliff, with Sarah Ann Brown—I had a little sister with me, named Sophia Edwards—the prisoner came up to me and told me to go down a street to borrow sixpence of her aunt, and she would stand round the corner, because she did not like her aunt to see her—she took my little sister and set he on the bank, and took off her shoes after taking her away—I cried and told some women, who ran and took my sister away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Hill. About two o'clock that afternoon, I was at my window, and saw the prisoner go by with the two children—she had the little one in her arms—I watched her, and saw her send the witness down the street—she stopped a minute, then ran down a lonely alley with the child, between two banks—I ran out, and saw the witness come out of the street crying—I asked if she knew who had got her sister—I went with a neighbour and found the prisoner sitting on the bank with her hands down at the child's shoes—I asked if she knew the children—she asked what business I had to come after her, for her aunt lived at the child's house, and that she had brought them from Love-lane, and then she said she would <hi rend="italic">muzzle</hi> me.</p>

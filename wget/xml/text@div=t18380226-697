                  </hi>. I keep the Box and Cock public-house, in Gray's Inn-lane. On the 9th of February I lost a coat and pair of gloves—I missed them on the 10th—I had left them in the bar—I went with the policeman and the witness Berry, to take the prisoner into custody, at No. 5, Fox-place, Gray's Inn-lane—I saw the policeman search and find my gloves—the prisoner was afterwards taken to Reeves, the pawnbroker's, and my coat was found there.</p>

I lodged with the prisoner at No. 5, Fox-place, Gray's Inn-lane—he showed me two papers on Sunday evening, the 11th—one was a licence, and the other a letter, the name of Mr. Winder was on them—the prisoner asked me to put them into the fire, but I put them on the bed with a pair of silk gloves—on the following morning, after break<lb></lb>fast, he came up stairs, and asked me where I could raise him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the ticket of the coat—I took the ticket and papers to the prosecutor, knowing they belonged to him—I gave him the ticket of the coat that I had received from the prisoner—I had seen him take the gloves from his own pocket with the papers—it was on my information that he was taken.</p>

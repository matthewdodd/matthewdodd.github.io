                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Wilmington-street. On the 20th of July I met the prisoner at the Ship Tavern, in Talbot's-court, Grace-church-street—we were playing at bagatelle—I had not known him before—we continued playing a couple of hours—I was unsuccessful, and lost some money—I went away about eleven o'clock—the prisoner proposed to go away with me—we had a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> called somewhere about Finsbury—we went to the Angel at Islington—I cannot exactly say what money I had when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was from 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my watch was in my fob—I lost the money—the prisoner paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I had lost my money, but I gave in to that, and we parted at the corner of Amwell-street—I missed my watch two minutes after—I am sure I had it in my fob when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had a silk guard round my neck—I returned to the same house—I saw the landlord, and made some inquiries about it, but could hear no tidings of it—I saw the prisoner the next morning, at Talbot-court—I had accused him before of the money; and when I accused him of stealing the watch, he said he knew nothing about it—after a time I offered him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to return the watch—he said he would try to get it, and see what he could do—he went away—I had the watch from the landlord, at the same house—the prisoner was not in the room at the time—I did not pay any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Ship tavern in Talbot-court. The prosecutor and the prisoner were playing at bagatelle there—they went out of my house together—in about an hour and a half the prosecutor returned, and complained that he had been robbed—I promised to get up in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and see if I could find the prisoner—the prosecutor had a bed in my house that night—I found out where the prisoner lived, and went to his house in the morning—I waited till he got up, and I told him the party he went out with the evening before had lost his watch—I begged of him, if he had got it, to give it up to save any noise or disturbance—I said the prosecutor had been robbed of his watch—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all about it—I still pressed on him, if he did know any thing about it to give it up, as the person would be sure to prosecute if he did not have his watch back—I told him of the money the man had lost, but I said, "He don't care a pin about the money, it is the watch he wants"—he still denied it, and said he knew nothing at all about it—I left the house, and went part of the way home—I then returned again, and the prisoner's wife was in the shop with him—I begged of him again, if he knew any thing about it to give it up—he said he knew nothing about it, but he would be at my house in less than an hour—he came, and the pro<lb></lb>secutor was in the passage—as the prisoner came in they met each other, and went into the parlour—the prosecutor then came out, and wanted to borrow 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me—I asked him what it was for, and whether he was going to give the money before he got the watch back—he said, "Yes"—I would not lend it him—the prisoner then went out, and returned in about an hour, and brought the watch back—the prosecutor then gave the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was agreed that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be spent out of it for a rump-steak and a bottle of wine—they then had a bit of dinner.</p>

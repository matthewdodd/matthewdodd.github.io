            . I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. Between four and five in the afternoon, of the 8th of September, I was standing in company with Limbrick, a brother officer, and I observed the prisoner with something apparently very heavy tied up in this piece of green baize, (produces it,) and hanging by a cord over his shoulder, which it appeared to cut; I remarked this circumstance to Limbrick, and we agreed to follow the prisoner, which we did, across Clerkenwell green, and into Red Lion-street, and there we went up to him, and stopped him; we observed him looking into a good many old iron shops on Mutton hill. I asked him what he had there, and he said, nails: he said, he had them from his brother, who was a manufacturer at Sheffield. I asked him where he was going to sell them, and he said, in Smithfield. I went with him to Mr. Wright's, the great nail warehouse, in Smithfield, and called Mr. Wright out of the counting-house. Mr. Wright asked him where he got them, and he said, from Sheffield; Mr. Wright said, that was a falsity, for they were Birmingham nails. After going to various nail warehouses, we at last, discovered them to be the property of Messrs. Williams and Blunt.</p>

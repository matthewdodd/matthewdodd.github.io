                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 72). On 26th July, from information I received, I found the prisoner at Spitalfields, at 9 o'clock in the morning, selling vegetables that were in a cart—I went up to him and asked him whose goods they were—he said they were his own—I asked him his name—he said, "That is my name and address on the cart"—"William Martin, 80, High-street, Marylebone," was on the cart—I heard him making an agree<lb></lb>ment, with a person named Jones, about buying the vegetables—I told him I thought it was not right, and I should take him to the warehouse—he said that I could do as I liked—he had received 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Jones for one part of the goods, and was to have 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the rest of them; that was for the whole contents of the cart, not for the horse and cart—I took him and the horse and cart to the station with the assistance of another constable, and Jones also went—the prisoner stated there that they were his own things,</p>

               <p>horse and cart, and all, were his own—the sergeant on duty said if it was his own he had a right to sell it if he liked—he said the reason he sold it was that he had had a quarrel with his wife in Covent-garden market, and had come there to sell it—he then received the other 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Jones, who took the whole of the things in the cart, away—the prisoner was drunk—I charged him with being drunk and incapable of taking care of the horse and cart—I then went to 80, High-street, Marylebone, the address on the cart, and found Mr. Martin at No. 75; he had removed from No. 80, and he told me the horse and cart had been stolen from Covent-garden market—I went back to the prisoner with Mr. Martin—the prisoner gave the name of Martin when he was locked up, and the same address—that is not his address—his address is at a common lodging-house in Hanover-court, Long-acre—after the charge was taken the inspector said, "I will send this horse and cart home if you like, to bear the expense of it"—he said, "No, send it to the Green-yard or where you like; I don't want my wife to know where I am," and it was sent to the Green-yard—I have not been able to find but that Richard Dicks in the prisoner's correct name.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 75, High-street, Marylebone, and am a greengrocer—my horse and cart, with my name on it, were in Long-acre on the morning of 26th July—it was quite safe there at half-past 7, near Covent-garden—it contained a quantity of fruit and vegetables which I had purchased—I lost it—I had gone down into the market again—I heard of it about ten minutes after—I sent one of the porters up with some goods, and they returned and said it was not there—the cart had got my name and address on it—I do not know the prisoner—I never authorised him to take my cart and sell my goods out of it—I never saw him before the morning of the 26th, when I saw him at Spitalfields station, about 1 o'clock, in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I saw the prisoner in Spitalfields on 26th July—I did not speak to him; he said he had fallen out with his wife—he was then standing on the ground, not in the cart—he said she had bought some goods which did not suit him, and he should sell them again—he asked me if I would buy them—I said I would if I saw them—he put them out on the ground, and I gave him a guinea there for one lot, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the other—</p>

               <p>I am a greengrocer—the policeman did not think it was right; we went to the station-house, and the sergeant said, "It seems right;" and he asked me what money I was going to give the man, and I gave him the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was tipsy: he knew how to drive the bargain—I paid him the remaining money at the station.</p>

            . I was at Mrs. Forrester's house, on the 10th of March, and saw the cruets safe on the sideboard. About a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I heard an alarm - I went to the door, and found the prisoner there, with a great many people round him. They asked if he had done it. He denied it. I had opened the windows to let in the air. The cruets were in May's possession. I had shut the shutter to, and drawn the blind, as a gentleman lay dead in the house. I found them disturbed. I had not left the parlour more than ten minutes.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. About a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another lad - they were close together. The prisoner had an apron on. One of them got over a piece of timber, which I was getting into my gate. I suspected, and ran after them. He was fifteen yards beyond me. As soon as he saw me running, he ran too, and his companion also. Before I overtook them, he dropped the cruets and stand out of his apron. I brought him back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Shew me where you took them from." I saw Forrester's window was the only window open - so I knocked at the door, and they claimed them.</p>

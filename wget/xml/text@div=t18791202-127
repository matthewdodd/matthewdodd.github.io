                  </hi>. I keep the Stonehouse Tavern, Old Street, St. Luke's—in August, 1877, I was in want of a barman—Johnson called—he said "I have called for the barman's situation" and "I have 11 months' good character"—I said "Where?"—he said "From a gentleman that keeps the New Stag, Cumberland Market"—I cannot say if he mentioned the name of the gentleman, I have not put it down—I put down the address at the time and arranged to meet the prisoner there—I went to the New Stag the same evening—I made the top portion of this note at the time of tie interview—I put in the date when Johnson came into my service, the 23rd August—the interview was a day or two before that—I met Johnson outside the New Stag—I said "dan I see the proprietor?"—I saw Hunt in the her—I said to him, believing him to be the proprietor, "I have come respect<lb></lb>ing a barman's character"—he said "Come into the bar parlour"—Johnson did not go in—I can hardly say which spoke first; but I said "What is Johnson's character?" and he said "Very good "or "Very fair"—I said "By your recommendation I shall take him into my employ"—I said that Johnson had told me that he had 11 months' character—Hunt said "Yes, that is so"—that was all that took place, and believing that he had been 11 months at the New Stag as barman I took him into my service on the 23rd August, 1877, and he remained about three weeks, when my wife discharged him—she assists me in the business—while Johnson was wits me he used to take a little too much at times.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she return that? - A. Yes; but we suspected something of this sort before, as there was a good many things missing.</p>

Knope came to the accompting-house, and told me Mrs. Watch had taken a settee; I told him to go behind the counter to Mr. Laycock; and I went to her, and took the flushing coat, and set it down in the workbook; she was then going home, and went towards the shop-door, which, as she opened, Mr. Laycock stopped her, and asked her what she had there; I don't know the answer she made, but he looked into her apron, which was tucked round her, covered with her red cloak; he opened it, and pulled out the article mentioned in the indictment; after that, I took her to the back part of the shop, and asked her for the duplicates of the three pair of trowsers we lost on the Tuesday; I found the duplicate of a pair of breeches upon her; I went next morning to the pawnbroker's, with the officer; I know them to be my master's property.</p>

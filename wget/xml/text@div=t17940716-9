I see it again the next day, in the gentleman's hands who apprehended them, Mr. Stapleton; I will swear to the coat by the marks about it, it has a great button and hole near the neck; I had it put on by my mother after I bought the coat, and the lining is tore at the back part in the middle of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you saw it at Mr. Stapleton's? - About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter. This day week, between three and four o'clock, I was at the bottom of Fetter-lane, and I observed three men running, and a chariot going on, two men on one side of the way and one on the other, and one behind the chariot with the great coat under his arm; the prisoners were the four men; I had the curiosity to follow them, and at the other side of the Bar James Clement got up behind the chariot, and stood on the foot board behind the chariot, where the man was standing with the coat under his arm; this was as they were running; I went as far as Catharine-street, in the Strand, and there they both got down, and went up Catharine-street, and the others followed after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was on the carriage with the coat? -

            . The man that had the coat went to a coach at the end of Bow-street, and spoke to the coachman or waterman, in a minute a coach came by, and he went after the coachman towards Druly-lane Play house, and the other three went towards Covent Garden, I went to Bow street and got two officers, and they came along with me, and we turned to the left, the way the man went with the coat; and at the corner of a court, almost facing the Play house, we found them all there, and the coat was shifted to another man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this after you left them? - In the course of a minute; they were the same men James Clements had got the coat then; with that I seized him, and asked whose coat that was He said a man gave it him to hold. With<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160022"></xptr>that the officers took the others, and we took them to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the other two prisoners, Gray and Rolfe, did you see them in conversation with the other two? - No, I did not, till I found them altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they converse when they were altogether? - I did not stand to see; I seized the man that had the coat in the very instant. I enquired for the owner the next morning, and found him on the stand; I gave him the great coat; that is the same great coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Tilbury and Clements were the only persons that had any thing to do with the great coat at all? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Clements. I picked the coat up in Fetter-lane.</p>

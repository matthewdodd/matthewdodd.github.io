                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Goodson. I am a laun-dress, and live at North-Brixton. The prisoner was in my employ—I missed a great many things in my illness, and amongst the rest, this hand<lb></lb>kerchief—they were things I had to wash—I went to the prisoner's lodg<lb></lb>ing, and asked her for the handkerchief which I had been informed she had on Monday—she said she had sent it to my house—I said I had not received it, and I did not think she had—she said, so help her God, she had; and at the same time I saw her tucking it under the child's petticoats—I told the policeman, and he took it from her there—I know the hand<lb></lb>kerchief by the fellow one which Mrs. Potter has given me—it is her pro<lb></lb>perty, and I had it to wash.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I took the handkerchief, but not with the intention of keeping it; I was going out one afternoon, and had not one clean of my own; I took the one I am accused of, at the same time telling my landlady of it; we had a few words, and she told my employer of it, who, with the owner, came and took me; I am a widow, and have four fatherless chil<lb></lb>dren—the prosecutrix said, "You shall go to prison, and your children to the workhouse;" she employed me at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, and I had got another place at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she did this out of spite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. I was in plain clothes in St. James's-park on the 10th of July—there were a great many persons assembled, and a person addressing them—the prisoner came up and joined the crowd, then took this handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and put it into his own—he went about a yard off—I touched the gentleman, and told him he had lost his handkerchief—he found he had—I told him to come with me, which he did—I went to the prisoner, and said, "Give this gentleman his handkerchief"—he said he had not got it—I put my hand on his trowsers' pocket, and said, "Take it out here"—he did so—the gentleman said it was his—I said, "Accompany me to the station"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220066"></xptr>
               <p>he said, "No," and refused to give his card—I took the prisoner to the station—I found in his hat two other handkerchiefs, one was marked "E. R."—the mark of the other has been taken out.</p>

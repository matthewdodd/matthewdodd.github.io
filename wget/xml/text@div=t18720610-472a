                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on 10th May I examined the prosecutrix and found an insised wound on her throat, about three inches long, transversely extending to the left side, across the windpipe—it was about a quarter of an inch deep—I could feel the arteries, it was such a wound as could be produced by a razor—it was about one-eighth of an inch from the arteries, and she would have died if it had cut the artery, as it was it was not dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated that he was cutting his corns with the razor, when his wife told him to go out and look after something to do, to which he replied "Go and tell that other young man you have got, to go to work" upon which she jumped up in a passion and struck him on the back of his head with a small broom; that as she did so he raised his hand to protect his head from a second blow, and the razor went against her throat, that she had thrown a chair at his head on the Sunday before, when he jumped out of the window, and she threw the chair after him, being a woman of a very violent temper.</hi>

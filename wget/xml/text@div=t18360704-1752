                  </hi>, I am a grocer, and live at No. 42, Lambeth-walk, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, in Surrey. I have lived and carried on business there for seven years and a half this Midsummer—I am married, and have two children—the eldest will be eighteen years old next February, and the youngest eight years old next November—my wife is living—they were living in the house with me at the time—the prisoner came to live with me in the mouth of November, 1834, as an apprentice—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium was to be paid with him from a charity-school, at Eaton, from which I had him, and there was an agreement for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, to be paid by Mr. Lawson, his guardian—I understand from the prisoner and from other parties, that his mother had been in a Mrs. Piper's service he is no relation of Mrs. Piper that I know of—the indenture were executed, on the part of the school, in February this year, when I received the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no binding took place till February this year—Mr. Lawson declined paying the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was not paid—the prisoner was anxious to be free of the City, and he proposed to pay me—he said he would advance 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if Mr. Lawson would—it was ultimately agreed that he himself should pay the £5, and upon that the indentures were executed with respect to the freedom—that was in February—he continued to reside in my service after that—in May last he went into the country to visit his friends, at Easter—he went to Eaton and Windsor—he went on the Sunday and returned on the following Friday—my wife made some communication to me after his return—about a fortnight after his return he went again into the country, in consequence of his sister's illness—I think before he went I had received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—from him, besides the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received it at one time—it was before he went away at Easter—I instructed Mrs. Crooks to ask him for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I do not recollect that I was present when she asked him any thing—I received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my wife—after he had been in the country, a sister of my</p>

               <p>wife's (Mrs. Goodenough) came to my house to clean it down—that must have been about the beginning of June—in consequence of what my wife communicated to me, I went up into the prisoner's bed-room, and found a quantity of silver in a purse, which was in a little square box—there was between 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and the rest in silver—there were two gold rings in the box, a morocco mare, a silver dessert knife and fork, a small silver dessert knife, a silver booth-pick, and some other things—I replaced them in the box, and left them as they were found—on the following Sunday he came to me after dinner, and wanted to take a walk—my wife said to him, "No, Henry, we want to have some conversation with you"—she said that Mrs. Goodenough, on removing his box by the lid, the pressure of what was in the box made the hasp give way, and she said there was money in there, and we wished to know how it got there—she said there was between 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the prisoner said, "I am very sorry, Ma'am, that I have told you a story—I told you I did not see Mrs. Piper, but Mrs. Piper gave me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I went to bury my sister"—(that was to May)—I think my wife asked him if Mr. Piper gave him that quanity of silver—he said, "Yes," and that she likewise gave him two gold rings and said to him, "Henry, I should not wish you so wear these—yet—it is not proper for you—have you any body at home who will take care of them for you?" and he made answer to Mrs. Piper, "Either any master or mistress will"—I then said, "Henry, I should like to go up-stairs and see what amount of money you have"—he went up, and spened his box—I went with him—the money was removed from the seal box into a larger box—it was not in the box I had seen it in before—I found 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—there was nearly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more silver that there was in the small box, and I found two quart wine bottles empty—he said that his uncle at Eaton had given him two bottles of currant wife—I said to him, "Henry, this is too much money for you to have in your possession, by you leave I will take it into mine," and I did so with his sanction—I took 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two gold rings, and nine four penny piece—he took 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. himself, that he should not be without pocket money—this was on the Sunday—on the Wednesday after, I went to bed about eleven o'clock—he went to bed at the same time—my wife had gone to bed prior—I slept in the first floor back room—he slept in the befound floor back room, over mine—my children slept in the room adjoining his—the first floor front room is a sitting-room—there had been some things washed, and they were drying in the kitchen that evening—they were hanging on a line before the fire—they had been ironed—the under box if usually kept on the stairs, near my bed-room door—it was not in its proper place when I went to bed that night—I desired the prisoner to go down and fetch it—I did not wait till he returned, but went lote my bed-room—I heard him come up-stairs very shortly after—he merely did me good night, and went up-stairs to his bed-room—in consequence of something that was told me the following morning, I went down into the kitchen, and obeserved a quantity of linen which bad been froned the previous evening, burnt entirely to cinders—there was a pair of drawers and other things—I cannot enumerste them—I had before that time been in the habit of insuring my property in the Globe office for nine yers, for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my insurance had expired at Christmas last—it was my stock in trade and furniture—the house is insured by the landlady—I had omitted to renew my policy last Christmas—I insured she same des<lb></lb>cription.</p>

Henry!"—I ran up to the first floor—he had ran up-stairs when he left my room—Mrs. Crooks told me he was gone out of the window—I did not know he had made his escape—I took my trowsers stockings and cash-box down stairs—my cash-box was kept under my pillow—the prisoner's money laid by the side of it, in a paper which I put it into when I had it from him—I took it down stairs with the cash box—there are leads to our house which the front room window opens upon—I went out on the leads and saw a man on the leads—he was a stranger—he was hallooing after me—with dreadful oaths, he said I was his prisoner he was without his coat, and I believe intoxicated—Mr. Lewis, a neigh<lb></lb>bour was by at the time, and he interfered with the stranger—he came down into the garden after me—I have never seen that person since—he did not appear before the Magistrate to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice whether any part of the house had been burned by the fire, whether it had caught fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the entrance of the shop from the street, where the bags hung, was completely burnt—it was a wall, but a quantity of paper bags hung on the wall—the counter and shop shelves were fired—they were black and had been burnt—half of the front part of the counter was consumed—the door leading into the shop was nearly burnt through—I had looked at the safety of the house that Saturday night—I have gas laid on—the prisoner turned it off that night—I was present, and before I left the shop, I took the glass off the pillar and put the candle to it, to see if it was all safe—there was no fire in the house that night.</p>

               <p>on myself to say it was worth more—I have been in the habit of insuring for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for five or six years—I always considered my furniture as included in the amount—(<hi rend="italic">handing in a policy dated</hi> 1829.)—I gave instruc<lb></lb>tions verbally to one of the clerks for what I insured—I certainly under<lb></lb>stood my furniture was insured as well as my stock in trade and stensils—I should not insure my stock and utensils alone for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. In consequence of this statement I went down to Mr. Crooks, and said, "You bad better keep in your house; it is a case which must go before the Magistrate"—he afterwards suggested that he had better ac<lb></lb>company me to Eaton, and we went and made inquiry after Mrs. Piper—I found she had been dead a year and six months—the prisoner stated that he had received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Piper five weeks before, when he went to bury his sister—I asked him where she lived—he said in the Slough-road—I went there and found she had been dead eighteen months—that was not written down in the paper, but he stated it—in the coarse of inquiry I discovered a Mr. Lawson—he came to town next day—I was pre<lb></lb>sent at Queen-square office, when he was in the prisoner's company—I heard him put some questions to the prisoner at a public-house opposite the office, on the Monday after I had returned from Eaton—he said it was a very strange thing, and he would hardly believe a boy like him would be GUILTY of such a thing as he was charged with—(I had before that told Mr. Lawson what the prisoner had said about the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—he would not answer what Mr. Lawson said, and then Mr. Lawson asked him about the money—he said, "I did not set the house on fire, but"—and then he stopped himself—I said he had better go before a Magistrate—I do not remember any thing being said about charging his master with setting the house on fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was at the house of one Davis, nearly opposite the prosecutor's house, about a quarter or half-past three o'clock on the morning of the fire, and saw the prisoner there—he had on a pair of trowsers and stockings, but no shoes—he had a shirt on—I cannot say whether the brooch found in his shirt, was in it at the time he was at Davis's, but after he was removed back to his master's house, when he was on the bed, there was a brooch in his shirt—I have slept in a brooch myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cheesemonger, and live in Lambeth-walk. On Sunday morning the 19th of June, I was alarmed by the cry of fire—I looked out and saw Mr. Crook's shop on fire, and the prisoner out on the parapet—I think it was about a quarter to three o'clock, but cannot be certain—I saw him stand there for some time—I then saw him jump from the parapet on to the leads, which is about nine or ten feet—he came on the leads of Mr. Base's shop, which is the adjoining house—he fell when he jumped from the wall, and I saw him in the arms of Jones, who lives in Regent-street, Lambeth—I believe he is an occasional porter—I saw him in Jones's arms, and know he had never been on the ground till he was in Jones's arms—after the fire was out I had some conversation with Jones, and then spoke to the prisoner about what Jones had said to me—I asked him whether he had said, his master intended setting the house on fire, whether he had told Jones so—he seemed confused, and gave no answer—I could not get an answer from him for some time—at last he said yes—I sent Lewis over for Mr. Crooks—he brought him over, and when he got there the prisoner did not appear to know him—Lewis asked him if he had said his master set the house on fire—he appeared quite confused.</p>

               <p>Q. They did not say any thing to you, did they - A. No, they did not; It was coming away, the prisoner at the bar came forward after I had left them; he came sideways, my watch was in my pocket, he snatched my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. You both saw him and felt him - A. Yes, and as soon as I found my watch was drawed out of my pocket I called out stop thief. The prisoner ran into the middle of the street, I ran after him and kept close to him; he was running up to the end of Broad-street, the watchman was at the corner and caught him; we took him to the watchhouse, he was searched, we could not find the watch on him. As he was running down the street he met some of his companions, he extended his arms to one of them.</p>

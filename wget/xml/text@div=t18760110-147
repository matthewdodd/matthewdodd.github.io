I keep the Rose public-house—on 28th December, I was passing from the bar parlour to the private parlour and saw the prisoner about six steps up the stairs—I said "What are you doing up stairs?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "You have been robbing me, I believe," and I caught hold of him and shook him—I took him into the bar and he dropped some of the stolen goods; I cannot say which—I called a policeman and gave him in custody—he begged me to forgive him on account of his wife and family.</p>

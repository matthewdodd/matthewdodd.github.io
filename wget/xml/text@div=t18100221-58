            . I am an officer of Whitechapel office. On Monday I received information that a man had been robbed on Sunday of thirty-five pound. I went to the prisoners lodgings in company with Freeman and found a padlock on their door; I searched after them three weeks, at last I found Sibley in Red-Lion-court, and Cohen in Checquer-alley, Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Sibley's Defence. The reason that I left my place I was in debt with my landlady, she put a padlock on my door. He has no reason to accuse me; he has known me many times; he wanted me to live with him; he kept a bagnio down Swan-court.</p>

               <p>Cohen's Defence. He drank five or six glasses of liquor. I never saw him before nor since till I saw him with the officers.</p>

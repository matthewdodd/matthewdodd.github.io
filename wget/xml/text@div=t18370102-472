On the 10th or 12th of December the prisoner took a top room of me, and these articles were in it—on Sunday morning, the 18th, I saw him in the passage of my house—he said, "Good morning," and went out—I went to his room for an umbrella, and then missed the articles stated—I have since seen the drapery of my shop window in the policeman's I hands—the prisoner came back the same night—I did not speak to to him about the loss that night, as I was alone—he remained all night, and left on Monday morning, the 19th—I said nothing to him, as he went out I so quickly—he was taken up that evening—the drapery was put into his room to be dashed—it was in a fender, rolled up—to the best of my recollection—the umbrella hung on a nail—the shells were in the kitchen.</p>

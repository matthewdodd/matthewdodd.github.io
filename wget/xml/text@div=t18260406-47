On the 28th of February the prisoner was in the warehouse, on business; I observed a quantity of ribbons on his left hand - I watched him a few minutes, seeing him near the box, and when he removed from the spot I saw him take his hand from under his basket, and take a piece of ribbon; when he came down the warehouse I followed him, and at the door I saw him put it into his pocket - I took hold of him, and asked what he had - he replied nothing. I said, "Take the ribbon from your pocket" - but I took it from his pocket myself; he was given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did any body except you see the transaction? A. Not to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060025"></xptr>ledge. I have been three years and a quarter in the prosecutors' employ. The prisoner has been in the habit of coming there all the while I have been there; I never heard a blemish in his character. I have been assistant to a linen-draper at Southampton, and had a hawker's licence; I took it out at Winchester. I was never taken up on any charge in my life respecting the licence. I was once subpoenaed as a witness for some midshipmen, who were charged with a disturbance at a Methodist chapel, and they indicted me as a principal; I was in custody in Whitecross-street prison for the costs and fine; I have been arrested for debt. I have had a child sworn to me. The prisoner had a wicker basket, with ribbons in it, which he had bought - it is possible that the ribbon might stick to the outside of the basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bissett Morehouse; we keep a dairy in Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I manage the business, as my husband is not in a lit state to attend to it—the prisoner was in my em<lb></lb>ploy for about a year and a half—she was so during the month of Sept.—it was her duty to go to the barn, milk the cows, come home, and go round with it, and also in the afternoon—it was part of her duty to receive money from customers for milk, and account for the money she received and the milk she delivered, always once a day, and more frequently twice a day—she never ac<lb></lb>counted to me for any milk sold to Mrs. Ghagan—her name was never mentioned—I was not aware she was a customer—I never had any money as from her—there was no other person to whom the prisoner ought to account—I always booked the milk.</p>

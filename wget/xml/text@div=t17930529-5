               <p>Q. Was the outer door of the house locked? - I cannot say. I lodge up one pair of stairs, other people lodge above me; the people that keep the house lodge below.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the lock seem to have been opened? - When I put the key in to attempt to lock the door, I found the lock had been strained, I could not get the key in, I found the door open, or at least upon the latch; there were three coats gone, two close bodied coats and a great coat, nine shirts, four neck muslin handkerchiefs, three muslin cravets, a pair of silk and worsted stockings, a pair of worsted stockings, four pocket handkerchiefs; the shirts were entirely new, they cost me a deal of money, I valued them altogether at 9 l. the boy that came for me informed me that the prisoners were in custody, they were down at the public office in Hatton-garden; I went down to Hatton-garden and the things were there produced, and I saw the prisoner Hastings, and when I came to examine him he had got a great coat of my own on his back, and one of the officers took it off his back; I understood that some of these things were taken from him before.</p>

I observed them some time, and had a suspicion that things were not altogether right; I after that went into the yard behind my father's house, when I came back I was told that one of them had gone into a house nearly opposite, Mr. Austin's house; I then went round the corner to see for assistance at Elliot's and Harris's, and there I found them together; I mentioned my suspicion to them, Mr. Elliot and Harris were together, and I desired them to look out, and returning a very short time afterwards I saw the prisoner Hastings come out of Austin's house, I followed him about twenty or thirty yards and then laid hold of him; I then brought him back to my father's door, a number of people were collected about at the time, and his coat and waistcoat was unbuttoned or tore open, I cannot say which, and these things that were taken was under his clothes, and in the course of the time he dropped something out of his apron, but I cannot tell whether he dropped them after I had hold of him or no; I cannot say any thing but to Hastings, I followed him, and never lost sight of him; the others I cannot positively say they are the men.

               <p>On Wednesday evening the 9th of May, between six and seven o'clock, I was standing with Mr. Sherrin, that has been examined, and we see three men standing together, which are the three men at the bar now, the prisoners, they seemed as if consulting about something, and I says to Sherrin, I think these men are after no good, we will stop a moment and see what they will attempt to do; accordingly Hastings, who is one of the prisoners, walked away from them and walked to the house door where the robbery was done at, the door was open, he stopt there with a pretence to make water, which I fancy he did, he then went on a little further to a gateway just behind the house and there he stopped to see if any body was watching of him; I left the door and was going into Mr. Sherrin's shop when he was coming back from the gateway, while I was going through Mr. Sherrin's shop from the parlour he told me there was one of them men gone into the house; I waited a short time and out came one of them, which I did not see before, it was Stevens the evidence, he came out with several things in his apron; I immediately said, that is none of the men that I saw, where is the other two? Hastings came out with him; I immediately followed Hastings with several things in his apron; I told Mr. Sherrin that this was the man that I saw talking with the other two; I am sure the other two are the men that were consulting with Hastings before the robbery; I walked back again to the place where I had been talking with Mr. Sherrin and Hastings came across there, and I laid hold of him by the collar, as soon as I laid hold of him by the collar, he dropped several things out of his apron, I think there was two coats among them, and one was a green one; I then gave him to Mr. Sherrin, and says to him, there he is; it being very ill convenient for me to attend at this place, I went off and knew nothing further till Mr. Blamire sent for me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hastings. The evidence, Stevens, came to me to Mr. Williams, the Duke of Argyle's Head, Leadenhall-street, and asked me to go with him to carry some wearing apparel; I went with him to Leather-lane, we came to the house and he told me to stop at the door, while he went up stairs; he went up and came down again with two bundles under his arm, and he gave me the keys and one of the bundles; as to the two prisoners at the bar they are innocent of the robbery.</p>

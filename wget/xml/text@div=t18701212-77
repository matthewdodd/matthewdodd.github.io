I am a wheelwright, and carry on business at 120, New Street, Deptford—I have a freehold house there, which I bought about two years ago—I borrowed 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Musgrove, a butcher there, to enable me to pay off the purchase-money, and gave him a mort<lb></lb>gage on my property—in November last year Moody came to my house and said that he had seen Mr. Musgrove, my mortgagee, and he said he should come down on me and seize my stock and all, if the money was not paid, and the best thing I could do was to have a bill of sale on my stock and furniture, as well as the house—I told him I owed no money—he said "If I had a bill of sale I could get money on it to pay the mortgage off; and he said he knew a man who would draw it up cheap, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I told him I would consider of it—he came again, and said he had seen Mr. Wilmott; that was the man who drew it up, and he was coming to his house in the evening—it was drawn up on 3rd November, by Wilmott, and on the 4th we met at the prisoner's house again, and Wilmott produced the bill of sale, registered—he had taken it away to get it registered—it was a bill of sale from Griffiths to Moody, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and included my stock and furniture—I never owed Moody a penny at that time, or any other time—no money was ever advanced by Moody to me on that bill of sale—Moody said, after the bill of sale had been made out and taken away to be registered, that we had better write some I O U's, and date them back, to make it appear that he had lent me the money—he wrote them, and I signed them—Eldridge was not there at that time—there was no attesting witness to the I O U s—I paid Wilmott 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for drawing up the bill of sale—on the 4th Novem<lb></lb>ber, after it was brought back by him, registered, he put it on the table—I took it up and took it home—I kept it till the beginning of December, without it ever being out of my possession, and then Moody came and bor<lb></lb>rowed it of my wife; he only kept it a day; he brought it back and delivered it to my wife—I was not present—I found it there when I got home; I kept it in my possession from that time till 1st April—Mr. Moody came and borrowed it again to show to his lawyer; he kept it thirteen days, and me and my wife went and fetched it back on 13th April, two days before Good Friday—I kept it then till 15th-August, when Mr. Moody came to me and said he had seen Mr. Sorrell, his lawyer, who had agreed to lend me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I told him I had sold several things included in the bill of sale, and he had better have the deeds of the house and the abstract title, and hand me the money—I said if he paid the mortgage I would give him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own by me at the time; he said it did</p>

               <p>not matter at all; he had seen Mr. Sorrell, and he was willing to lend it on the bill of sale; Mr. Sorrell did not want the deeds, he wanted the bill of sale—I went to London with him, taking the bill of sale and these other papers; we went to Mr. Sorrell's office—Moody told me I had better wait while he went in; he took the papers in—I waited about eight minutes, and when he came out he said he had left the papers with Mr. Sorrell, and he would give me the money in four days; we then went home; I waited a week, and then Mr. Moody sent over to say that Mr. Sorrell was out of town, and I spoke to a policeman about it—Mr. Moody sent the abstract of title and the other papers over to me, but not the bill of sale—I could not see Mr. Moody—on 25th August, a man named Ford came to me and wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had the bill of sale in his hand, and asked me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I told him I did not owe Mr. Moody 100 farthings—I took the bill of sale out of his hand, tore it up, and put it in the fire, and said it was my property; I was summoned at the Police Court for doing that, in September, and I was com<lb></lb>mitted for trial—I was released on bail, and when I got home I found my place broken open, and my stock, vans and cabs, and all, gone, and my work<lb></lb>shop pulled down—I was acquitted of the charge—I had to pay Mr. Mus<lb></lb>grove by instalments, on 1st February, the 1st May, and 1st August; he never asked me for a penny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house agent, at Commercial Road, Peckham—in October, 1869, I prepared a bill of sale, at the request of Moody and Griffiths conjointly—it was to secure the payment of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stated to be due from Griffiths to Moody—Mr. Ives was present—I asked what was the consideration for preparing the bill of sale, and the reply was that there were two I O U's, one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that they bad had many transactions together, and there was a further sum of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be advanced, to make up the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bill of sale was dated 8th November, and registered on the 4th—I saw the two I O U's at the time my instructions were given, and I made a memorandum of them at the time, one for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have the memorandum here I made at the time, with the dates of the I O U's—the considerations were recited in the bill of sale—I drew a bill of sale dated November 3rd—it was previous to that I saw the I O U's—I received the instructions, I think, two days before—I think I drew the bill of sale on the day it was dated—I went to Moody's house to receive the instructions two days before I made it—the bill of sale was signed at Moody's house, in the presence of Mr. Ives, myself, and I think Mrs. Moody and Mr. Griffiths—I took it to be registered, and got it Regis<lb></lb>tered on 4th November—I handed it to Mr. Moody—it is untrue, if Mr. Griffiths has sworn that he took it off the table—I handed it to Moody; he looked at it, and read it over—Griffiths looked over it at the same time—Griffiths came out afterwards into the shop, and paid me the balance due to me for executing it—I am perfectly sure I handed it to Moody—I was wrong in saying at the Police Court I delivered it to Griffiths.</p>

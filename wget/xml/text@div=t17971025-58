             AUSTIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am in the employ of the Post-office, the prisoner was in the situation that has just been described; in consequence of his absenting himself from the office, we sent a messenger after him on the Friday, he was not to be found, but on Saturday morning the 9th, his mother came with him, and she said she supposed as her son had not been at the office, he had been doing what he ought not to have been doing, and she searched his box.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Be so good as tell me what passed in his hearing? - A. I told him we had heard various reports, we had heard that he had kept a horse, he said that he saw the horse in Newgate-street, it was a very unruly one, and the man offered him the horse, if he would undertake to break it, and the man said he should have the horse for a trifle; I asked his mother if she knew any thing of his conduct out of the office, as we had reason to suspect he was not doing as he ought to do, and, she unrequested, took out these 5l. notes, which she said she had taken out of his box, (produces them); he began to cry, and wished her not to produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were produced, did he acknowledge that his mother had taken them from his box? - A.Not in words; I asked him how he came by those notes; he said, that on Tuesday he met Davis in Oxford-road, that Davis owed him twelve shillings, which he desired he would pay; Davis said, he had not twelve shillings, but put his hand into his pocket, and said, take these, and that then Davis left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was the Tuesday, that he said he had met Davis? - A. The 5th; there were two other notes produced by his mother for single pounds; the boy said, he had received those two pound notes from a man to whom he had sold some rabbits.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was kept in custody; was any enquiry made? - A. Yes; a clerk of Messrs. Williams brought the particulars of the notes that were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that unhappy lad's father is living? - A. No, he is dead.</p>

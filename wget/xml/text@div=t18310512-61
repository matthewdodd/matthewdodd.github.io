               <p>JOHN HICKEY. I am a Police-constable. I met the prisoner in the Uxbridge-road on the 23rd of April, at half-past five o'clock in the morning - he had some squares of glass; I asked what he had got - he said some glass, and that he was a plumber and glazier; I knew him - we had had him in custody before, and he then stated that he was a bricklayer; he said he found the glass on the road - I took him to the watch-house; he had seven squares of glass and two knives - here is one of them; it had marks of putty on it.</p>

On the morning of the 23rd of April, I missed seven squares of glass from a summer-house -I have seen one which the officer brought; it was tried, and fitted the place exactly - it had been fastened in with putty, which had been cut away; the summer-house is about four hundred yards from the road - there were eight squares missing; the colour and state of the putty appeared the same on the glass as on the frame - it had been painted green on the frame, and on the glass.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 19th of May I went out with a sofa on speculation. It was towards the evening of the day; I called at Mr. Lawrence's, No. 258, Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner carried the sofa and I walked by his side; he said he would carry it no further; I begged permission of Mrs. Lawrence to let it remain in her warehouse till the following week, which she granted. When I called for it they told me it was gone. The prisoner had no permission to call for it.</p>

            . My daughter lives at No. 258, Tottenham Court-road. I remember Mrs. Farrell leaving a sofa at the house on Saturday evening. It was fetched away on the next Monday by the prisoner, who brought it there. I was present when he took it away. He said Mrs. Farrell would not take the money, (35 s.) my daughter had bid for it - she wanted 40 s. I asked if he would know the frame as it stood among a number; he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, it has a honeysuckle back;" I pointed it out. My daughter keeps an upholsterer's shop. I sent the boy up stairs to see if my daughter would give any more; she said she would not, and he took it away. I saw Mrs. Farrell on the following Wednesday.</p>

            . I am a constable. I met the prisoner on the 22d of September, in the Lower Road, Islington; I told him his company was required in Worship-street, to answer for the sofa. He said he had sold it for 25 s. at some place at the West end of the Town - at a shop, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220058"></xptr>he could not say where; that he should know the shop if he saw it, but could not point out whereabouts it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were there not a great many people about close to you? A. There was a great many walking along - I got knocked against by almost every body walking in the street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say you felt somebody drawing at your pocket? Yes, I felt something like it; and I saw three or four persons immediately behind me directly I looked round - that was before I saw the prisoner - the only thing that induced me to follow the prisoner was seeing him going across, and his looking rather shabbily dressed - I do not recollect taking my handkerchief out during the time I was out, which was about half an hour - I was returning from chapel - I did not distinctly feel it taken; but sufficiently to cause me to feel something, which appeared as if my handkerchief was drawn out - I had nothing else in my pocket - I felt a sort of pressure, and afterwards a kind of drawing - it was the feeling of a moment; just as I should have felt if a person might have touched that part of my pocket - I had not used it for half an hour; but I had felt it in my pocket while I was out - the pocket was behind my coat in the plait - it had no flap to it - it was an outside pocket, not very shallow - it would carry more than a handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a patrole of Farringdon Within - I was in Wood-street on the 26th of January, and heard a cry of "Stop thief" - I saw the prisoner running down Wood-street, from Cheapside - I was going to stop him, when I saw him take his hat off, and throw the handkerchief away - I am sure of that - I took it up, and he was stopped by an officer in my sight - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. I was going down Wood-street, from Cheapside, the same way as the prisoner was running - he was five or six yards behind me when I heard the cry - I was not dressed as an officer - I saw nobody else running - there might be a great many people in the stret - I dare say there might be ten persons near - I did not take notice - I saw none of them in the carriage-road - it was rather dark, but a very fine night - the lamps were lighted - I swear I saw him take the handkerchief out of his hat and throw it away - he was stopped in less than two minutes afterwards - I think it was with his left hand that he took his hat off, as he threw the handkerchief as if from the right hand - I do not know whether he saw me, as I was on the opposite side of the way - he did not notice me particularly - I took the handkerchief up in the road, just at the side of the curb - I followed him, and he was taken by another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the same person you saw in custody was the person that threw away the handkerchief? A. He had exactly the same dress on, and I saw his face sideways as he ran - he had a particular dress on, a blue frockcoat, the same as butchers wear.</p>

             re-examined.

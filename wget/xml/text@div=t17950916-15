               <p>Q. Was he drinking there? - Yes, he was, with some acquaintance of his. Going backwards he came back again to his company, and he stopped and drank the value of half a pot of beer, he left some remaining in the pot; he said to a fellow acquaintance of his, I wish you good night. So he went a little way from my house, the value of a hundred yards, then he got over some pales.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - No. He must get over two parcels of rails before he could get at the back place to take it out, my boiler was in a back place belonging to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fixed? - No. It was in a shed that leads to the building, a yard by itself, it opens by a small gate, and it leads to the house; there is a door out of the house into the shed. I see it that day about nine o'clock in the morning, it had been there perhaps for two months. The 2d of July I see it, the same day, I see him with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160051"></xptr>Q. Had you missed it before you see him with it? - I did not; I see him about three hundred yards from the house; I was near the house corner then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he was gone out? - Hardly five minutes. I was at the corner of the house, outside, and I see him throw the boiler over Squire Baranoe's pales; I did not know what it was, but I see him throw something over; I supposed he see me; I cannot say he did or did not; but he left it there in a corner; he got over the pales again and went forwards on the road; he threw it from the field into a yard where they sold sheep or beasts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see him in a field about three hundred yards off? - Yes, of Mr. Baronoe's. I thought it was my boiler, or something of that sort. I followed him, and I went towards the place where the boiler lay.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you see laying there? - A boiler.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then? - Going along the road. I said to him, you have been doing wrong; I cannot justly say what he said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boiler? - I took it myself to my house, and I took him away to the justice; but in the first place he was taken to the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you got the boiler? - I had the boiler that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how do you know that to be your boiler? - I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he get the boiler to take it from the place in which you see it lay that morning? - The back door in the yard was open; he got over the paling close to the building. I know it by the iron work, the handle of it; I had it about a year and a quarter; I know the person that made it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out after him, thinking he had taken it? - No, I went out after other business, but I see him throw something over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went out of his house I stopped to make water, and I see something laying, and I got over to see what it was, and when I see what it was I got over the pales again, and the prosecutor came after me, and said it was his.</p>

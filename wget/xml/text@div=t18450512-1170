                  </hi>. I am an oilman and grocer, and live in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square—the prisoner was my carman for about six months—it was his duty to receive money from my customers, on the delivery of goods, and to pay it over to me on his return—I have a book, in which I make entries of these matters—I find here, that on the 31st of March, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due from Mr. Hewlett—I asked the prisoner if that was paid, and he said, "No"—on the 8th of April, I have a memorandum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., due from Mr. Maitland, of Upper George-street, Bryanston-square—I asked whe<lb></lb>ther that was paid, he said it was not—on the 21st of April, I have an entry of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Henshaw—I asked him about that—he said they did not pay it—I dismissed the prisoner on a Sunday night—I think it was on the 26th or 27th of April, and on the following Monday I found that these monies had been paid, and gave information to the police—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop—I sent for the constable, and gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody.</p>

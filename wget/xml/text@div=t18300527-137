The prisoner was in my employ on the 11th of May - he took these tools after he had done work at seven o'clock at night; I had seen the plane just before he left - I missed them from the bench in my front shop about half-past eight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you lend me these tools more than once, and tell me on the Saturday night that I might have them to repair a couch on Sunday morning, and my wife went for them? A. I deny it; I swear to these tools.</p>

            . I took these four knobs from the prisoner at the watch-house - the other things were found at No. 6, Porter-street; the prosecutor said they were his lodgings, and they were found at a bench the prisoner worked at; the prisoner said he had purchased these four knobs - the prosecutor brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CLARK re-examined. I understood from the landlord that he sleptthere, and he has told me so himself; it was a work-table, not a bench - he had a little job there once which I lent him tools for; these knobs belong to a cheffioneer - there is nothing particular about them; I am sure this plane is mine and this chisel - he denied having this, and we searched among the shavings for it, as he said it must have got among them; we had missed it six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After I leave work I go home, and do work to get a little more money; the prosecutor came to my place and found me at work - he turned jealous at it, and he sent for an officer; I have had the tools repeatedly, and taken them back.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. The prisoner asked my father to lend him a plane to repair a couch, which he did, and he returned it; we then kept missing one thing after another, and my father said,"Mind, I will lend my tools to nobody any more;" we then missed several things; on the 11th of May we went to the prisoner's lodgings - my father said, "Where is my smoothing - plane?" the prisoner said, "Here it is;" we looked, and found the other things - he said he declared he had nothing more, but we found the knobs on him.</p>

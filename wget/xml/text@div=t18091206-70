               <p>JAMES WHISCOMB. I am a watchman. I had just gone ten o'clock. I went into the Rodney's Head, to get a pint of beer, the prisoner was sitting in the taproom, and the prosecutrix was standing up, drinking a pint of beer, she said, these are my feathers, she pulled his hat off; his hat was full of feathers and some were in his right hand jacket pocket. I took him in charge, and likewise the feathers; in going to the watch-house the prisoner got away from me: I pursued him, and caught him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 15, Ecclestone-place, Pimlico. On Sunday, 2nd May, I was returning home about half-past 12 o'clock at night—I passed Ecclestone-mews, and John Campbell came across to me, and said, "You b—r, I have been waiting for you"—I had never spoken to him before, and said, "My good fellow, what are you waiting for me for?"—he made a strike at me, and hit me, and I made a strike at him, and hit him again—no more blows passed between us; he ran to his brother's door, almost opposite, I do not know the number—he did not go into the house; he called his brother Bernard, and the other prisoner came out of the house, and called out to his brother, "Your knife!" and I saw John pull a knife out of his right hand trowsers pocket, and open it—I was then about twelve yards from them, and Thomas Wadlow was with me; he is a fellow lodger of mine, who came running down stairs—I made to the door of my own house, but it was fastened; I opened it with the string, and as I was going in received a stab in my arm—it was John Campbell who gave it to me—I did not see him do it, but he was close to me—I did not see the other prisoner at that time—John followed me into the passage, <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> the knife into my left cheek, and left it there—Wadlow had run into the house before me, and got on to the stairs—I ran up the stairs, and saw Ann Highams in the passage—I bled very much, fainted, and was taken into my own room; a surgeon was sent for—I did not see Bernard Campbell while I was in the passage; I did not see him after I heard him use the words, but I am certain that he is the man that came out of the house with the other prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 50, Ecclestone-place, in the next room to Croxford. I never saw the prisoners until this night, when I was in my room, and about twenty minutes past 12 o'clock heard a scuffle, went to the window, and saw John Campbell in the attitude of fighting Croxford in the road right opposite—I saw John Campbell strike Croxford one blow, and Croxford returned him a heavier one, which caused him to reel two yards or two yards and a half—while he was reeling I heard a voice at the lamp-post say, "Your knife!"—I do not know who it was said that, but I believe it was not Bernard Campbell; it was a bigger and stouter man—John then put his hand into his right band trowsers pocket, drew his knife, and opened it—I then called out, "Croxford, run! he has got a knife;" and he ran to the door of our house—John ran after him, and the person at the lamp post, who had called out, "Your knife!" also ran towards the door, after Croxford—I could not see whether John got into the house—I called loudly, and a person came across the road—I went to my room door, opened it, and saw Croxford on the first floor landing, with a knife in his face; the handle was bent apparently by the stab—he did not bleed till be drew the knife out, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the floor, and said, "I am stabbed;" he then bled a great deal—I got him to bed, and afterwards saw a wound in his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 50, Ecclestone-place. It was No. 15, but the numbers have been altered—on this Sunday night, about half-past 12 o'clock, I was in my bedroom, which is in front of the house; I looked out of the window, and saw Croxford coming along Ecclestone-place, and John Campbell coming from Ecclestone-street; he was about a dozen yards from Croxford when I first saw him; I saw them conversing together, but could not hear what they said—I went down stairs, went into the street, and saw them about four yards from No. 50—John Campbell struck Croxford, who returned the blow—there was nobody else in the street then—after the second blow, John Campbell said, "Stop a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>;" and Croxford said, "I shan't run away, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> will be as good as his master"—John Campbell then went over to his own house, and called out, "<hi rend="italic">Barney!</hi>"—(I had known him by sight for about a week, and knew where he lived, and the other prisoner also; they live about twenty yards from where Croxford and I live)—I saw a man come to the door, who I believe to be Bernard; he came out of the house, and called out, "Your knife! use your knife!"—he ran across the road, and followed John, who then had a knife in his hand, which I had not seen before I heard these words—I saw him take it from his right hand pocket, and open it—they went up to the door of the house where I live, and I and Croxford rushed into the passage together—I got into the passage first; John was outside; I did not see him or Bernard come into the passage; I ran up stairs—before I got up, Croxford overtook me; and when he got to the top of the stairs, he was bleeding very much from a wound in the cheek—I did not see the knife in his cheek—I went for a surgeon.</p>

I was on duty in Chester-square, and heard a disturbance towards Ecclestone-place—I went there, to No. 36, which is sixty or seventy yards from the door of No. 50—another constable was with me—I found the outer door fastened; after knocking twice, and getting no answer, we broke the door open, got into the passage, and saw a light in the back parlour, the door of which was then open, but it was shut immediately—I knocked, and the first thing I heard was some one saying, "Poker and tongs!"—I had not said who I was then—I knocked again, and some one said, "Who is there?" I said it was the police; we eventually broke in, and found the two prisoners, John with his trowsers on and the tongs in his hand, and Bernard in his drawers and stockings, with a poker in his hand—Bernard struck me on my hat—I was in my uniform; I got the poker from him, and told them that there had been a man stabbed outside, in Ecclestone-place, and that the two men were seen to go into that house—they both said they knew nothing about it, and that it must be a man named Lucas, who had made his escape at the staircase window at the rear of the house—I found several spots of blood on the right hand side of John's trowsers, the marks were wet, I have no doubt that it was blood—I said he must be the man; he said he knew nothing about it, and I took him into custody.</p>

Last Saturday one Dunkan, one of my men, brought me some pieces of silver in a leather purse, among which were two pieces of soldor with my mark upon them, which he said were found at the prisoner's. I took him before Justice Welch when he confessed to the several pieces, one by one, that they were my property.</p>
               <p>- Fryer. Last Friday night: I was employed to take down some bed furniture belonging to the prisoner at his lodgings. I found under the bed-head a purse with some pieces of silver in it; I carried it next day to Mr. Dunkan: I heard him confess it was Mr. Plumber's property.</p>
               <p>- Dunkan deposed, that these pieces which were produced, were what he received from Fryer.</p>

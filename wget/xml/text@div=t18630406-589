                  </hi>. On 26th March, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I was coming through Thorney-street, which leads from Bloomsbury-street into New Oxford-street—I had in my trouser's pocket, a half-sovereign and five shillings in copper—the prisoner and two or three other parties followed me through Lumber-court into Thorney-street—I can swear there were two more, and one was a little bigger—I had received the money in Old Compton-street, not far from there—I first saw the prisoner in Little Earl-street, where they all came round me because I dropped a packet of halfpence on the pavement, which I picked up and put loose in my pocket—it was after that that the boys came round me—the gas was alight in the public-houses, and there was light enough to see their features—they got round me, and I was detained just upon an hour, from Lumber-court to Thomas-street, because I told them all that I was waiting for a friend—they still remained and went on to Thomas-street, where they came round me, and tapped my pocket to feel my money, and then thrust their arms round my neck and on my mouth to prevent my hallooing, and blind-folded me—I cannot tell who did that—after tearing my trousers, and biting my hand, they put their hands in, and succeeded in getting 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my pocket, which they tore out, and some of the money rolled out and was picked up ten minutes afterwards and given to me by the people who stood round, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was all that I lost—I am sure the prisoner was not one of those—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was lying on the pavement, and was returned to me by two or three people standing round, and I was then 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deficient—I had had five shillings' worth in my pocket.</p>

I am a bone-keeper of 14, Henrietta-street—I was at the top of Vine-street, close to Thorney-street, heard a cry of "Police!" and went up to five or six lads, about the prisoner's size, who were scrambling on the pavement—I did not take much notice of them at first, thinking they were at play, but directly afterwards I heard money jink on the pave<lb></lb>ment—I went across to them, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutor among them—the prisoner was stooping on the pavement, as if picking up something—he then attempted to ran away, but was detained by a gentleman—the lad halloed out "Police!" two or three times before I went up—the prosecutor said, "That lad has been helping to rob me; he has torn my pocket"—I saw his pocket torn down—the prisoner was detained till a policeman came—he bit the prosecutor's hand—there was half a sovereign in it.</p>

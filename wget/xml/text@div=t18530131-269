                  </hi>. I keep the grocer's shop. On 1st Jan. I was in the shop, and remember the child coming there—I served her with a pound of sugar; she gave me a bad half crown—I did not notice the half crown, knowing the child well—I gave her the sugar and the change—when she was gone I noticed the half crown was bad—I had not lost sight of it—I went to the child's house with it—I then marked it, and gave it to a policeman—on 3rd Jan. I remember the second witness coming for a packet of cocoa and some sugar—she gave me a half crown—I discovered it was bad—I asked her where she got it—in consequence of what she said she took the cocoa and sugar, and left the shop by the shop door—I went out at the private door—she walked across the road to the prisoner, who was standing opposite—I went and asked her if that was the man; she said, "Yes"—I accused him of having, sent the child with a bad half crown—he said he was not the man; it was not probable that a man like him, in constant employment, would do such a thing—I gave him into custody—I marked the second half crown, and gave it to a policeman.</p>

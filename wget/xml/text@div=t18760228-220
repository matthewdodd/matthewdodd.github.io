                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 278, High Street, Poplar-on the 26th February, after 10 o'clock at night, I was at the Iron Bridge public-house, Barking Road, with a friend—I saw the prisoner there doing sleight-of-hand work and different kinds of tricks—I have known him by sight many years; he is what they call a <hi rend="italic">sharper</hi>—he is not a particular friend of mine, but he made himself an acquaintance—I serve thirty or forty public-houses—I had had more drink than was quite right—I went out of the public-house, leaving him there, but he was very quick after me—he ran after me as hard as he could with a little man about 5 feet high—I ran into Mr. Forsyth's shop, and remained there till I got him to go home with me and bring a little bit of a truncheon—the prisoner had not spoken to me nor I to him—we had to go 600 or 700 yards to my house—we were talking, and I did not see the prisoner—Mr. Forsyth left me at the bottom of Robin Hood Lane, and I went on alone—I opened my side door with my latch-key, and as soon as I had done so the prisoner said "Ain't you going to bid us good-night, old chap?" and he threw me down with one hand and to ok my watch and pocket-book—my wife and my boy spoke to me at my door, but I did not go in; I ran to the police-station with as much strength as I had left—I could not speak, but I was told something—my pocket-book was returned to me next morning, but I have not seen my watch again.</p>

I am a labourer, of 12, Leicester Street, Poplar—on the night of the 6th January, between 12 and 1 p.m., I was standing with Lovesey outside Mr. Townsend's, High Street, Poplar; that is about a mile and a quarter from the Irion Bridge tavern—I saw Riley pass me, and saw the prisoner and a man with a black eye—I said something to Lovesey and took notice of them—I saw them cross the road—I followed them; they went to Riley's door, and both got close to the door—Riley went in soon afterwards, and then the two men ran away, and Riley came out and hol<lb></lb>loaed "Stop thief!" and they both ran towards Bow Lane—they might go that way to the Iron Bridge, but it is a long way—when Riley called out a policeman ran up, and I said "You are just too late"—when they ran away I was so surprised that I had not time to do anything.</p>

I live at 6, Surrey Place, Poplar—I was with Dixon standing outside a beer-shop, and saw Riley coming along and the prisoner and another man following him behind—they crossed the road after Riley, who unlocked his door and went inside, and the moment he got inside he made some answer—the prisoner then said "Come on," and they ran up Poplar—I was only following them two or three seconds.</p>

On 27th February, about 12.20 ton., Riley gave me a description of the men who had robbed him—I looked for the men and went to Kelly Street, with two policemen at 12.30, leaving two others in the street—I found the prisoner in the back room, just sitting down to supper and told him the charge—he said "What date was it?"—I said I do not remember—he said that he would go to the station with me—he put his shoes and stockings, and as soon as he got to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> door he pushed the policemen down and ran down the street as fast as he could—I called out and one of the policeman stopped him—he was taken to the station, and after the charge was read over he said "If I had known it was this I should not have bolted"—I said "What did you think?"—he said "I had a man for a sovereign this morning"—I searched him, but found nothing—he had this sleight of hand trick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his pocket.</p>

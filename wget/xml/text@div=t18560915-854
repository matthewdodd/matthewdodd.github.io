                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 75). I am stationed at Hillingdon. On Monday last, 8th Sept, I was on duty, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, opposite Messrs. Rigby's premises, and saw the prisoner come out of their yard with a horse and cart—I asked him what he had got, and where he was going—he said he was going to London, and he had bait for his horse—I said, "Have you got nothing else?"—he said, "Nothing"—I examined the cart, and found this sack concealed under the prisoner—he had taken the tail ladder from the back of the cart, and placed it in the centre of the cart, and the horse cloth was on the tail ladder, which covered the sack—I examined the sack, and found it contained clean oat—I weighed them, and there were 64lbs.—I asked the prisoner what he was doing with this—he said he thought he was doing no harm, as they stood in the sack; he asked me to let him take them back, he said there was no one about, no one would see him take them back—I told him I could not allow that, he must go to Hillingdon station—I took him there, and in going he asked me again to let him take them back, and he would give me anything if I would allow him to do so—I took him to the station—I have the oats here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Dorleyfield, in the parish of Harlington; I am over looker in the employ of the prosecutors, Joseph Brown Rigby and Charles Rigby. The prisoner was in their employ as horsekeeper—I gave him directions on the Saturday evening to leave on Monday morning, at 3 o'clock, to come to London for clover hay—it is about fifteen miles from London—he was to return from London in about fifteen hours and a half—he was to take with him bait for the horses—I did not give any particular order as to what quantity to take, only bait for the horses—I think this sack contains bait sufficient for the journey—what he ought to have taken was clover and oats—this sack contains clover and oats—I allow him half a bushel a day, and this journey was about a day and a half—I should give him a bushel this journey—this sack contains about a bushel and a half—the nosebag has been emptied into this sack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you give them anything but the bait? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but the bait, which is this mixture—the men would have no power to feed the horse on oats—no one would give the prisoner the corn; he was to take it—he had charge of the corn himself—he was not only a carman, but house-keeper—there are other carmen, but no other horsekeeper—I am quite sure the horses are not to be fed on oats—I had had these oats threshed—they were placed on the premises, with five or six other sacks—the mixture was kept in one corner—this mixture is in a state in which it would be proper to give the horse—he was to take bait for the horse—I should allow a bushel of oats for this journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has this man been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years under my direction, and five years before—he takes what corn he thinks proper for his horses—I have not known him to bring back any feed when he has taken too much—the other foreman has known him to bring back some—the part he had to go to was Holywell-street, Westminster Millbank—I have never known him to be guilty of the slightest fault—he has a wife and four children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Rigby. The prisoner has been in their employ for four years, since I have been there—he has been in the habit of taking his hone and cart to London, and other places, when we are short of a man—he has the control of the corn house and the hay house—when he has gone out, there was no one to control him in what he took; he took what he thought proper—I have seen him once or twice, when he has come back, bring his nosebag and empty out what he has brought back—on 5th Sept. I sent a boy for some sacks, and then I went down and shot out a couple of sacks of potatoes on the top of the chaff, and there were several cotchells there, which is about as much as an old man can carry—my opinion is, that there is not sufficient for the prisoner's horse in the bait sack, but there is too much in the two sacks—my opinion is now, that the prisoner did not intend to steal—I never heard anything against him.</p>

Bigby leave all to Mr. Smith—they came and called me out of my bed on the morning the prisoner was taken—I went before the Magistrate, and made my statement—I do not know whether it was taken down—I was present when Beman was examined, I saw his evidence taken, down—I do not believe mine was—I did not sign anything—I have once or twice seen the prisoner replace what he has brought back—he has emptied his nosebag—he might knock out a pottle of the mixture on the oats and chaff that were mixed together—this cart comes to London twice a week—the prisoner takes it sometimes, and sometimes the other man—there is no particular allowance for going to London—they mostly take more for a journey—I consider a horse wants very nearly twice as much victuals as when he is at home—a horse is never allowed unmixed oats, to my knowledge—the food is all mixed up before they take it—the prisoner was the horse keeper, and had the management of the stable—I should think half a bushel of oats to a bushel of chaff would make good bait—this mixture (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is in a state good enough for a horse to eat, but I do not think there is quite enough of this bait for a horse for one day—he would want about half a bushel more—if I had seen him with this 64lbs. of oats, I should have asked him what made him take all the lot.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the rope-yard, Woolwich. On Saturday night, the 18th of April, I met the prisoner in Powis-street—he went home with me, and gave me half-a-crown and a sixpence, which I put into a teapot, where I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides—another man came into my room, and the pri<lb></lb>soner went into an adjoining room—the other person did not stop, and when he was gone the prisoner came into my room again—I then went to bed, but not before I had counted my money—the female who lives in the next house to me saw me count it—I put it into a teapot, and put it into the cupboard—the next morning the prisoner made an excuse to go out—he desired me not to get up, but he dressed himself and went away—I thought it strange, and went to my cupboard—I found the teapot lid was off, and half-a-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence gone—no one could have taken it but the prisoner—I locked my door and bolted it after the other man was gone.</p>

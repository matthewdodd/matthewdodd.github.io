            . I am shopman to Mr. Davies; the prisoner came into the shop about five in the afternoon on the 24th of December; while I was shewing her pieces of printed cottons, I saw her put a piece of printed cotton under her gown, which she had taken from off the counter; when she had paid for the goods she bought, she went out. I directly followed her and brought her back, when I had got her in the shop I charged her with having the piece of print, she denied it; while I was talking to her I saw it drop from her on the ground; I picked it up and gave it to Mr. Davies.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never took the cotton nor did it drop from me. I return the gentleman thanks for relieving my distressed family. When he came up into my room my husband went down to him, he gave them sixpence each, I was in great distress; they had seized upon my goods three or four days before.</p>

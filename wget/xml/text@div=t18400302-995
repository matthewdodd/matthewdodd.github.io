                  </hi>. I am foreman at King and Co.'s India-rubber ma<lb></lb>nufactory, and live at No. 6, Belvedere-road, in the parish of Lambeth—I keep the house. On the night of the 13th of February, I was lying ill in the back parlour in bed about a quarter to eight o'clock, and saw a light under the door in the front parlour—I heard a rustling and whispering in the room—I got out of bed, put my hand on the handle of the door, and heard a voice say, "Make haste"—I opened the door, and saw the prisoner standing by the fire-place—he immediately rushed to the window, which was open—I caught him in the act of getting out—I also saw somebody getting out of the yard gate, and heard glass break, which was the glass of the pictures—the prisoner struggled very hard, and got out of the window, but I went after him, and never let go of him—I afterwards examined the premises, and missed a table-cloth, inkstand, and the other articles stated in the indictment, from different parts of the room—I had seen them safe about two o'clock—I went to bed about three o'clock—my wife and family were in the kitchen, under the parlour—the prisoner had no shoes on—I found them afterwards in his cap by the side of the window—I saw part of the property picked up in the yard near the gate—it is a very small yard—Day brought the decanter to me, and my son the pictures—a lucifer box and matches were found on the prisoner at the station-house—I am certain these articles are mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing by Nickells's house, and picked up this decanter under the window ledge in the yard, and saw Nickells's son pick up the pictures—he is about twelve years old—they were in the yard, about two yards from the window—he took them into the house—I am sure these are the articles.</p>

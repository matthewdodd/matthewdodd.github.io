                  </hi>. I am the wife of Asher Isaacs. I engaged Allah as my servant, about nine weeks ago—the following day I went to Dublin, and returned on Thursday, the 30th of July—I had been away two months—Allah came to me on the Saturday morning, and asked for the key of the hall-door—I asked what it was for—she said it was to take the milk in—about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was apprised that a man in a flannel jacket had knocked at the door, and that she went away with him for an hour and a quarter—I then rang the drawing-room bell, and asked her who it was that had been at my door—she said, "Those who were welcome"—she was very impudent, and said she would go away that moment—she went up-stairs—my daughter called me up, and said that she was very impudent, and said that she would go away—I said that she should not, if she was saucy, I would send for an officer, and did so—I then went to the door, and saw the prisoner, Bagley, at the corner of Cutler-street—the officer took him, and brought him to my door—he took something from his pocket—he threw it into the dark part of the passage, and we found that it was this piece of velvet—the velvet found in the pas<lb></lb>sage was the same as that drawn from his pocket—I was not present when these handkerchiefs were taken from him—these are all mine—I saw the of them on the Thursday before they were taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Callaghan.</hi> You had not been at home—you cannot swear to them—let who will come into your service, you will swear against them—you had Roach every day in you house, bribing her, and giving her drink to come against me—Mrs. Isaacs always bears that character, if they are but one day in her service, she will say they steal something, she transported one</p>

I am the wife of Benjamin Yates—on the 14th Septem<lb></lb>ber, about 5.30, I was standing on London Bridge, talking to a policeman named Dyer—he was in plain clothes—I was close up to the parapet of the bridge, and was resting my baby on my knee, and had a small parcel in the other hand—the prisoner came up and pretended to look into the water—I felt his hand go into my pocket, I made a catch at it, and turned round and said to the constable, "That man has robbed me"—the prisoner run away, and the constable after him—I had only just put my money in my pocket—there was a half-crown, three shillings, and two sixpences—I examined it afterwards, and found that the half-crown was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Catherine Mul<lb></lb>vaney. I had been living at Wapping—I am 18 years of age—the articles stated were given me as a present—I lived with Mr. Kaye formerly—the prisoner lodged there also—I missed a parasol, and one of the necklaces—the other has not been found.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this house of Mr. Kaye's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A public-house, where sailors lodge—I was servant of all work—I had seen this parasol last Sunday five weeks, and afterward found it at my mother's house—there was another necklace of white cornclian—I never wore this—nor the other—nor used the parasol—they were given me more than four weeks before I missed then—they were in a drawer, in the best bed-room where captains slept—drawer was not locked—my gowns were there—I saw them on the Sunday, and missed them on the Monday—there were two beds there—I had a box of my own, but it was not there—my mistress allowed me to keep my things in that drawer—I saw them every time I went to the drawer—the string of these beads broke, and I tied them in the middle—the parasol has a darn in it—there is no other mark by which I know them—the prisoner I believe is a ship-carpen<lb></lb>ter—he had been living in the house for some time—about four or five weeks—when he came on shore he used to board and sleep there—I found these things at my mother's house on the 29th, a fortnight and two days after I missed them.</p>
               <p>Catherine Mulvaney. On the 17th, I think, the prisoner came with a bundle to my house—I had seen him on the Saturday night before—he had asked my husband to go with him and buy a pail—he brought the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What is your daughter's name who lived at Mr. Kaye's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Kitty; she told me she had a parasol—I saw her sue it, nor the beads—she did not bring these things to me—she only told me she had got them, and then she said they were lost—the bundle was tied up with a cord, and sewn with some black thread—it was brought there on Sunday—the prisoner was to come again on Tuesday, but he came on Wednesday night, and was taken.</p>

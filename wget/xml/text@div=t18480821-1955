                  </hi>. I live at Horsham. I know Catherine Mills—she is here—I was present at her marriage with the prisoner, at Petworth, in 1833.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did you know her before she married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was not on the town; she had had two illegitimate children—the mar<lb></lb>riage was effected through the interference of the parish-officers—the prisoner was apprehended as the father of her child, and was sentenced to pay a certain sum, or go to prison until he paid the money or married the woman—he went to prison, and remained there some months—the parish-officers did not lead him from the gaol door to the Church—he was not allowed to be at liberty till he was married—I do not know whether Mills was missing for some time—she was troublesome to the parish after the prisoner left her—he was not taken again; we could not find him—he was taken by the adjoining parish—Mills was perhaps fourteen or fifteen years older than him.</p>

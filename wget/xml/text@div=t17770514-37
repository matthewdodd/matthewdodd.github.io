I said, yes; and he shewed me the muslin and asked, if it was ours? I told him it was, and got a constable and secured the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 5th of May, coming through Newport-alley I saw two girls; I suspected them to be shop-lifters by their having a bundle in their arms and looking at it, and they kept looking behind them to see if any body observed them; I asked them, what they had got there? upon which they dropped it; I secured them and took them to several shops till I found who it belonged to; the prisoner had the cloth when I took her.</p>

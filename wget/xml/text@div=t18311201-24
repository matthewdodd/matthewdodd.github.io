            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner, on the morning of the 3rd of October, at a quarter-past three o'clock, at the corner of Barnsbury-street, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's; he had this bonnet in his hand, and the other articles in his pocket - it was a wet night; I asked how he came by the bonnet, and he said he picked it up in the Liverpool-road, but there was no appearance of dirt on it - there were two or three little slips of paper among the things, which led me to the prosecutrix's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the bonnet, and these other things fell out of it; I went into the old toll-house, and got a light for my pipe - the man asked where I got these things, and I told him; I put them down at his door while I went in - a man came along, and took them up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010037"></xptr>I called him back, and he gave them to me - I then walked on, and the Policeman met me.</p>

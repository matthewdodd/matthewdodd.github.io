                  </hi>. I am servant to Armelino du Coster Ricci, of 2, Inwood-cottages, Hounslow, in the parish of Isleworth—on Monday night, 16th July, I fastened up the house at half-past 10 o'clock—there is a little window in the safe which had a piece of paper in it to keep it partly open, and let the air in—I fastened the back-kitchen shutters with a little button inside—I came down next morning about 6 o'clock, and found the back kitchen shutters open; I found a match box and a pair of shoe brushes on the floor—on the front-kitchen table I found some matches, and some more, which had been lighted, in the fire-place—two bottles of beer had been emptied, and the bottles set beside the cupboard—I missed three silver dessert-spoons, a silver table-spoon, five plated forks, a table cloth of my masters, and two dresses, a shawl, and a piece of calico of mine, which were all safe when I went to bed—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found these gloves on the table, they were not there the night before.</p>

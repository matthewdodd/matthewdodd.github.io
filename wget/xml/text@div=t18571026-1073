                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On 15th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was on board a police galley, and saw a barge laden with butts lying outside the Victoria Dock entrance, made fast with a rope—I saw three men on board of her—I drew my galley closer, and watched for about a quarter of an hour—during that time the barge had been unfastened, and drifted nearer to me—I then saw two of the prisoners on top of a barrel, and the other had a rope in his hand, in the act of checking the barge—I then heard a man in the barge <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "Is there anybody in that barge?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Why to h—do not you come and hawl your own barge down, for I am d—if I am going to do it," letting go the rope—they then came to the eddy, and the barge was drifting without any guide—a butt was on the stretcher of the barge—that was the one I found tapped—I stepped into the barge, and turned my light on—I had seen something spirting from a hole in the butt, and the prisoners were near enough to touch it—it was about the height of their breasts as they stood up—Wall walked round behind me on the barges behind—I ordered a constable to fetch him, and at that moment Taylor dropped this pint pewter pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and beer fell from it—I found two pieces of wood, two inches and a half long, projecting from the cask, very clumsily put in, and beer draining from one of them—they were not proper spiles—I drove them in with my knife, and cut the ends off—on searching, I found this piece of wood, of the same sort, and several chips; also, this gallon stone bottle full of beer, without any cork—it had a rope to it—it was in the head sheets—I examined the other butts, and there was no leakage—I said, "Halloo, what game is this? what business have you here? your lighter is Inside"—they said that they had come to assist Taylor—I said, "Instead of assisting him, you are putting him away"—it was Taylor's master's barge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Larchin and others, of the Queen's Head Brewery. On Monday, 14th, I caused forty-six butts of por<lb></lb>ter to be put on Mr. Hughes' barge; they were going into the Victoria Docks—every one was in a sound and perfect state; there were no spiles in any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I hired the barge, <hi rend="italic">John</hi>—I received forty-six butts of porter from Messrs. Larchin; they were loaded in the night, and lay there till next day—they were to be taken to the <hi rend="italic">Iris</hi>, in the Victoria Docks—Taylor had charge of the vessel; it was his business to go with her into the docks; I left him in her—I saw the butts of porter on board, there were no spiles or pegs to my knowledge, but I did not look round—I do not know this pot or the stone jar—I had not employed Wall and Burns, I know them by sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Taylor your apprentice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was a hardworking honest boy—barges very often get adrift from their moor<lb></lb>ings, and then they generally call some of the lightermen to their help—no complaint has ever been made of the state of the butts before—when they draw the dock gate up, it would flush the craft out, and they would want a little assistance.</p>

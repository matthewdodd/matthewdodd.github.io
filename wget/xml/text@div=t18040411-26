               <p>Q. How did he behave himself? - A. He behaved himself very well; I had suspicions he was not an honest man.</p>
               <p>- SEARLE sworn. - I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He begged that his master would not discharge him, and that he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Fuller.) What is the value of those cuttings? - A. Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These tea-pot spouts I had to strike, he would not suffer them to be cut up stairs for fear of knocking the cieling down, because it was very heavy work: I had to take them down stairs, with four dies, and a crooked pair of shears, in all it was three quarters of an hundred-weight; after I had cut them, I had to enter them in the accompting-house; it was my practise to put the cuttings in my waistcoat-pocket, the dies and shears in my arms, to go up stairs; then my master said I had something about me that was his property; had he given me two minutes longer they would have been out of my pocket; I never took a penny-weight of silver out of his house, nor did I mean it at that time; I have a wife pregnant, and two children.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he took these two tea-pot spouts down to strike; he did not, they were struck by another man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

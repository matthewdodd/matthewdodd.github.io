            . I live on New Hampton-common, about four miles from the prosecutors'; I know nothing of the prisoner, but on the 8th of January he came about seven o'clock in the morning, and knocked at my door - I looked out of window, and he asked me if Cox lived there - I said Yes; he then asked if I was not a buyer of pigs; I said I was - I expected some pigs to come, and thought he had brought them; I told him to put them into the yard, which he did - but when I came down I found they were not those I expected; he had brought four, and asked me 35s. a piece for them - I agreed to give 28s.; but I asked where he lived; he said at Hatton - I went with him there: there was no person who knew him, and I had him apprehended; I showed the same pigs to the prosecutor.</p>

On Thursday morning, 21st March, about 4 o'clock, I went with Parritt to Castle-street, Holborn—I was inside No. 2.7, and between 4 and 5 o'clock I saw the prisoners come down stairs from their bed room—they both went into the back yard—I went out into tin-street—they did not see me—they got on the opposite side of the way, and went in the direction of Holborn-hill—Bartling went.</p>

               <p>On the opposite side of the way, and just before five, Adams came out and went in the direction of Holborn-hill—he returned a minute or two afterwards with a Hansom cab, got out, went into No. 27, and commenced loading the cab, carrying bundles of leather, and Bartling assisted him in carrying some of them—they were such pieces as these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after the cab was loaded, Adams got in, and Bartling stepped up on the step behind as if giving directions to the cabman where to drive—I got into the cab, and directed Parritt to take the other into custody—they were taken in custody with the leather, this label (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was attached to it; it is marked "R W. H., 104 C, paid March 18th, 1861"—between 12 and 1 o'clock the same morning I was at the same place, waiting, and Bartling came in and inquired of Mr. Evans, the lodging-house keeper, if Mr. Smith was there—Evans said, "What Mr. Smith No,—he said, "The person who brought a parcel this afternoon"—Evans said, "No, he has gone to the theatre, and will not be in till late"—I received this label from Evans, it was taken from the bale in my presence—Bartling gave his correct address, Newcastle-court—it is a lodging-house, where he has lodged for some time—the landlord is here.</p>

I live at 27, Castle-street, Holborn, and keep a lodging-house—on Wednesday afternoon, 20th March, about 3 o'clock, I had some conversation with Adams, in consequence of which I received a bale of leather, about half-past 2 or 3 o'clock—I let him a room to put the leather in—I know Bartling—I saw him that evening—he came about half-past 12 and asked for Mr. Smith—I said, "What Mr. Smith do you mean?, I have many Smiths in the house"—he said, "The person who left a bundle of leather here"—the prisoners slept at my house that night—they came in about half-past 1—Adams then asked me, in Bartling's presence, if he could be called at 5 o'clock in the morning—I called the night porter and said, "Yes, you can be called at any time you think proper—he gave directions to the night porter to call him at that hour, as he had to take some goods to Paddington station, to go by the 6 o'clock train—I had let the sleeping room to Adams for himself that afternoon—they both went to bed at my house—the first time I saw this label was, I believe, in Adams' hand, when he asked me if I could make room for a bundle of leather; and the next time I saw it, it was on the bale which was brought to my house—when Adams said the Paddington station, Bartling corrected him, and said, "You mean the Eastern Counties."</p>

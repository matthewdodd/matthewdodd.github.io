                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel, and am a wholesale cheese<lb></lb>monger—I have a partner. The prisoner was in my employ on the 24th of November, and had been so about two years—for some time past we had missed coppers to rather a large extent, and could not find out who ab<lb></lb>stracted them—on the 23rd of November we had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper counted up, and ninety penny-pieces were marked with my initials, which were dis<lb></lb>tributed in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers—they were put into flats, tied down—I locked the counting-house myself, and took the key—on the morning of the 24th the prisoner came rather earlier than usual for the keys of the warehouse, and asked the girl for the key of the counting-house—when I came down my warehouseman spoke to me—I missed the coppers, and called the pri<lb></lb>soner—I said we had missed some money—he said he knew nothing of it—he said he had some coppers—I said, "Let me see"—he pulled out five penny pieces, two of which had been marked, one by my warehouseman, and the other by the clerk—the money was marked between half-past seven and nine o'clock—they were taken from a number of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, and marked, and replaced—the next morning we found the papers had been opened, and two or three pence taken from different ones—the prisoner said he had taken them the day before in exchange for some tobacco—there were no more coppers found on the prisoner—I had not marked any money on previous days.</p>

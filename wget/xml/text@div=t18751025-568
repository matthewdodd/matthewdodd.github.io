I keep the Rose and Crown, Hackney Wick—on Saturday evening, 11th September, I left the house between 7 and 8 o'clock, and met the prisoners going in—I returned again in about five minutes, and met the prisoners going towards the railway-station from the direction of my house—when I got in my wife showed me a bad florin, and I fetched a constable and followed the prisoners—when we got to the. rail<lb></lb>way station Ford was on the platform at the top of the stairs, and Lee was standing partly up the staircase by the window; his hand was on or very near the window sill—seeing us coming up the stairs he went up farther, and said to Ford "Come on, this is our train"—a train was coming into the station at that time—I gave them in custody.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on Saturday evening, 11th September, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoners came in and Ford asked for a glass of the best ale and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of gin, for which he tendered a florin—I gave him the change—a man came at the time, and had a pint of beer and gave me a half-crown—I put the florin I had received from Ford, on the counter; I took it up at once and saw it was bad—I put it back in the bar separate from other money—Lee went out followed by Ford; they were gone a few minutes; Lee came in again, in about three minutes followed by Ford, and called for half a quartern of gin—he tendered a florin—I told him it was bad, and he said twice "Don't deface it"—when I was examining it under the gas he took it out of my hand—I sent for my husband and gave him the first florin which I bad received from Ford—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

It was nearly ten minutes, between the first coin being given and second—Lee asked to be served the second time—I served them without speaking of the first coin, and I did not send for my husband until the second florin had be given, because I wished to be positive as I was alone—I had taken the first florin out of the till and had placed it separate from the other money—we only have one till, but there was no silver taken except the half-crown which I was going to give change for with the florin—I saw it was bad when I put it down, and I put it on one side and gave him another which I took from the back of the bar where we keep change for half-sovereigns and sovereigns—I said to Lee "Are you going to pay for it with, anything else?"—he said "No," and they went out of the house.</p>

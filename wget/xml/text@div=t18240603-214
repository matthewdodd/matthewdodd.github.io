On the 23d of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner dined there and staid about an hour; I did not furnish him with any glasses, but there were some on a shelf in the room - three or four minutes after he was gone we missed six drinking glasses - I pursued him and took him, and found four of them in his hat, and two in his pocket; he said he would bring them back and deliver them up, if I would forgive him; he had paid for his dinner.</p>

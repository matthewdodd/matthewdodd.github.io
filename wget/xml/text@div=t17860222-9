               <p>Are you any relation to the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What relation? - I am his brother, I have ever known him honest and industrious, but very credulous and unthinking; and it seems in my opinion, he has been tricked into this business, by the artifice of a fellow who has escaped with impunity; I therefore trust, that the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider the case of the prisoner at the bar, with that candour and deliberation, which will ever distinguish their sense, feelings, and virtues, and that their opinion will go with mine, that it was not an act of the prisoner's to defraud, but merely an action of stupidity; I have ever known him honest and industrious, he was left very young, he is a year older than me, I am twenty-five last October; but he is very easy of belief, he has not the discerning sense which should protect him from the artifice and deception of others, he has not that sense which would keep him from the artifice of the world; and, my Lord, on the examination in Litchfield-street, Houseman and his hostler were both there, and his hostler who is the man that delivered the horse to the person that hired him, was told he was to appear upon the trial, I have tried to subpoena him, but that man is kept out of the way; it seems to me to be a combination on the part of the prosecutor to a degree of malignance, and to obtain a reward: I hope therefore, Gentlemen, you will pity my feelings, and consider that it is my unfortunate brother's case I plead.</p>
               <p>Houseman. I saddled the horse myself, and my man took him out to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where is that man? - He is with me now, he has never been out of the way.</p>
               <p>Has any body been enquiring after him? - I have never heard any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the Judges have determined upon a similar case to this, the case of Pares, that if the Jury are satisfied upon the circumstances, that at the time the prisoner obtained the horse, he then meant and intended not to go to Barnet, but to go and sell the horse, that that was a felonious taking, that was the determination in the case of Pares, there is a nice distinction, which as it runs so near, like splitting a hair, it is my duty to mention it, that is this; if on the circumstances, you think that the man really did intend at the time he came to hire or borrow the horse, to borrow it or hire it for the purpose of going to Barnet, as he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220038"></xptr> and that he proceeded on the way, and then afterwards returned, in that case it would not be a felonious taking; but it must be his intention at the very moment of obtaining the delivery to behave in that fraudulent manner; if you conceive the intention to have arisen afterwards, that will not amount to a felonious taking: another thing I take to be perfectly clear, that is, that suppose upon this evidence, you should be satisfied that the prisoner did go to Barnet with this horse, and returned with the horse, and after he returned, instead of delivering it to the owner, sold it; there I take it to be clear law, independant of Pares's case, that he was guilty of felony, because you see the end and purpose of hiring a horse would be then over; now with regard to that you recollect, this horse quite fresh bled at his knees, he was cut, and the flesh hanging over his knees, and with all the appearance of being hard rode, now if you should be of opinion that the man rode this horse to Barnet, and came back again, the difference is from eleven to four, or half after four in the afternoon, then most clearly he will be guilty without any doubt; on the other hand, suppose you should not be satisfied that he did take it to Barnet, then you will consider whether on this evidence, you are satisfied that he did obtain the horse at that moment, with the purpose of disposing of it.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you will be so good as to say, whether you go upon the first point, that at the time he took the horse, he had an intention to steal him.</p>

             to Jury. Gentlemen, the Jury declared the very same thing in the case of the King and Pares, in 1779, Mr. Justice Ashurst tried that, and he stated it as my brother Gould has done, and left it; he reserved it for the opinion or all the Judges, and they were of opinion it was felony, and I believe the man was afterwards executed; and the Jury aid they were of opinion that the horse was obtained by Pares with intention originally to steal it, and that the pretence of going to Surry was a mere pretence and colour, and that at the time he had an intention to steal it: this is the case of the prisoner in my opinion, for this man comes in the name of one Edy, and instead of going to Edy's stables, he rides away with it.</p>
               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>

A woman ran up against my arm, and instantly I felt my watch go out of my pocket. I called out, I have lost my watch. I felt it go. Mr. Thompson took the woman, but the two men ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at all out of your sight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch a silver watch - A. No, a metal watch; it was worth 1 l. and the seal was worth five or six shillings. The watch has not been found; the prisoner snatched it away, and the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120048"></xptr>men ran away. The watch was not found about the woman, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOMPSON. I live with my father; he is independent; he lodges at Mr. Stapley's. I was coming home from my brother's; he keeps the Rum Puncheon.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated - A. No, not in the least. In White Cross street two men and a woman met us; the woman ran up against Mr. Stapley; he instantly said he had lost his watch, and instantly the two men ran away. The woman never offered to run. I catched hold of the prisoner, and took her to the watch-house. She was searched, nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor; he was intoxicated. He cried out he had lost his watch. I never offered to run away.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the sack your's? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the oats your's? - I believe it is a hard matter to swear to oats.</p>
               <p>Q.They were on your premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they on your premises, was it a borrowed sack? - No, but it was on my premises, how it came there I cannot possibly tell.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these sacks of oats that you speak of, those that were found on the prisoner? - Yes, those that he took from the cart house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe that they belonged to you? - Because they are very much like the oats that I have; I have a great many sacks about my yard that are stray sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any oats from any place? - No, when I have two or three hundred bushels of oats shot down I cannot possibly miss any.</p>

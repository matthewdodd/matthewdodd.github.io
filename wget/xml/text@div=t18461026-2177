                  </hi>. I live in Carlisle-street, Lambeth. On the morning of the 16th of Oct. sixteen pieces of lead were thrown off the roof of my house into the yard—it was my lead, and I saw it as late as two or three o'clock in the yard, and counted it—I missed one roll between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I then went to the station-house—I saw some lead at Mr. Simpson's shop—I say on my oath it was my lead—the prisoner was a tenant of mine—this lead was in the rear of the premises he occupied.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and occasionally work for the prisoner. On the night of the 19th of Oct., at half-past six o'clock, I was at the Dover Castle public-house, having a pint of beer—the prisoner came to me and said, <hi rend="italic">" Jem</hi>, I have got a job for you"—I said, "When, sir?"—he said, "Now"—I did not know what it was to do till I came to the wicket-gate close against his shop—he there took this piece of lead and put it on my shoulder—he said, "It is all right; take this to Mr. Simpson's"—there was a bag thrown over it—I went, and Mr. Simpson said, "Who does this belong to?"—I said, "To Mr. Pratt," and there I left it.</p>

                  </hi>. This lead was brought to me by Young—he told me it was not his property—I afterwards went to the prisoner at the Dover Castle, and asked him if it was his—he said it was—I said, "Come to my place, and I will weigh it"—he went there, and I put the half hundred weight into the scale—he said, "That is near enough for me"—I went up stairs, came down again and said, "I find by the act of Parliament I cannot purchase lead after sun-set; I will let you have half-a-crown on it"—as soon as he was gone I went to the station, and gave the lead up to the sergeant.</p>

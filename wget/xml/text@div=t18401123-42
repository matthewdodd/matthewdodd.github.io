She gave me a bad sixpence of William the Fourth—I returned it to her to let her see it was bad—she said nothing—I asked her where she got it—she said she had it given to her—she turned out of the shop—I do not know that I should know the sixpence again. About a quarter of an hour after a policeman showed me two sixpences—I thought one was that the prisoner had offered me—I did not see the prisoner again till the Tuesday afterwards.</p>

At seven o'clock in the evening of the 30th of October, I saw the prisoner in Cowles's shop—I heard them talking about bad money as I was standing close to the window—I saw him give the prisoner a sixpence—I stopped her as she came out, and asked for the bad sixpence—she gave it to me from her hand—I had had my eye on her from the time she left Mr. Cowles—she had no opportunity of changing it—I asked if she had any more—she gave me another sixpence wrapped up in paper—she was taken to the station-house and examined at Guildhall on Saturday the 31st, and was discharged about one o'clock. At four o'clock that afternoon I was called by Miss Stevens, and received from her a sixpence—I produce the three sixpences.</p>

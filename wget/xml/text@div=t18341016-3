            ? A. No; I do not know any woman who is now a prisoner in Bridewell, unless she is the person whom I asked to allow me to go into the place - there was a person before the magistrate- I had seen her when I was at the house - I live at No. 2, Tinley-court, Old-street - my husband is in the country, and he was so at the time this happened - the last time I saw him was about nine weeks ago - he is a labouring man - he has lived in Tinley-court - he is a tailor by trade, but is very handy at every thing - he was out of work, and he went into the country to his friends to try to get work - since he has been gone I do work when I can get it - sometimes cleaning and washing - I have worked for Mrs. Welch, who lives in the same court - I washed for her twice a week - I was paid 1s. 6d. - I have not worked for any body but Mrs. Welch, but I had been that morning to a person to know if they wanted me - my husband left me 5s. when he went away - the persons where I lodged have seen part of the 5s. - I have the two rooms on the first floor furnished - I have no family living - I came from the hospital to this Court to-day - the last time I was in Tinley-court was on the Sunday this happened - Mrs. Welch is my landlady - I have not had any visitors since my husband has been in the country, except a person from Berwick-street, who called to say she should want a person to work for her - I have had no male visitors but the landlord of the house - no other man has been to see me, neither young nor old - I am never up later than nine or ten o'clock, or very likely eleven - I have been out as late as twelve or one o'clock with my husband - I swear I have never been out as late as twelve or one o'clock since my husband has left town - I have been out as late as eleven o'clock with my landlady, but not alone, unless I have been at the next door or so - Old-street is not quite a mile from Field-lane - this happened about eight o'clock in the morning, as near as I can say - I went down Field-lane in my way home from the female in Berwick-street, who wished to employ me - her name is Mrs. Goodacre - she lives at No. 3, Downe's-place, Berwick-street - I got to her about a quarter before seven o'clock that morning - I got up a little after six o'clock - it is about two miles and a half or two miles and three quarters from where I lived - I did not stop there many minutes - I did not stop any where else - I had been there once before, but I did not come through Field-lane then - I passed by it once or twice - I have lived a year and nine months in London, but I have been in the country several times during that period- the door of the house I went into was open, and the shutters were up - the woman who was at the door had a handkerchief over her neck - her breasts were partly exposed - she had no bonnet on - I did not know what she was - there was a door in the passage with a little window in it - I cannot say whether there was a curtain to it - I did not know what place it might have been - I did not guess - if I had had the least idea, I would not have gone to such a place - I have heard of a house of ill-fame, but I did not know what they meant by it - I am twenty-one years of age, but I did not know what is the meaning of a house of ill-fame - there were public-houses before I got to this house, but I did not go in there because I did not want any thing to drink myself - I have been married five years - I married at sixteen - I have lived in town almost two years, but I did not know the appearance of a house of ill-fame - I thought I was going into a respectable house - it is the same lane where there are a number of pocket-handkerchiefs exposed on one side, and there are shoemakers on the other - there was no one with me - no one went with me from my lodgings nor returned with me - this occasion occurred to me before I got to Field-lane - I was about half way down Holborn when I first wanted - I went down some places in Holborn, but there were so many persons passing I did not like to go in.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get the 2s. from? A. It was part of the money my husband left me - I had lived upon the other 3s., and what I got from Mrs. Welch, but she used to give me victuals as well - there was another woman came into the room I went into - I do not know who she was - I have not searched for her - I could not - I was in the hospital, and not allowed to go out - I was married in Moorfields, five years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had been in London a year and nine months? A.

             (City police-constable, No. 79). I was fetched to Field-lane about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, on the 14th of September - I knocked at No. 19, the diar was opened by a female, and I went in - I saw the prisoner on a sofa in the back room - the prosecutrix was in the yard - she was covered with blood, and her things all torn off her, except a small portion of her gown at the lower part of her - she was washing herself, with two females, in the yard - she said the man had ill-used her, and nearly murdered her, and I took him into custody, to St. Sepulchre's watch-house, and then locked him up in the Compter - the yard had the floor were covered with blood, and her clothes were from her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the size of the yard? A. About three or four yards square, and the room was about two yards and a half wide, and about three yards being - the place was all smothered with blood - I had known field-lane - there are about four bawdy-houses in it - they have the doors open night and day - the shutters of the one the prisoner has the care of are never down - there is a glass door in the passage, which is the general rule with houses of that description - I should know houses of that description from my own experience - if a half-naked woman was at the door, it would not increase the difficulty of knowing them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix came into the house about eight o'clock in the morning - she was in the house about a quarter of an hour before I saw her come into the back room, and ask permission to wash herself - she was told, certainly she might do it - the servant of the house asked her to stand some gin, and she gave some money to fetch some - I do not know what she gave her - when we had drank that, she asked me personally to go cut, and have some rum with her - I went out after a good deal of persuasion, and we went into Thompson's, on Holborn-hill, where she called for a quartern of rum, which she paid for herself - after we had drank that, I paid for a quartern of rum, and we were in the public-house about an hour, talking over it - then I left her, as I thought, and returned to the house in Field-lane - I did not think she was following me - I returned to the house, and fell fast asleep, in consequence of the liquor I had had - I suppose I was asleep two or three hours, when the servant of the house suddenly awoke me, and told me that woman there had robbed me of half a sovereign - I felt in my pocket for the half-sovereign, and found it was gone - I arose up, and accused her of taking it - she denied having it, and a scuffle ensued between us - by this time, there were three or four women in the room - in the scuffle, the half-sovereign fell from some part of her person - I cannot tell what part it fell from - I picked up the half-sovereign, and then sat down on the sofa, - then the officer came and took me into custody - there was a woman that saw the whole of the transaction, but the officer heard she was coming to speak the truth, and he has brought some trifling charge against her, and confined her in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to FREDERICK PRINCE. Q. Who took up Mrs. McCarty? A. I took her up on Monday afternoon last - Catherine Saunders is her name - I took her for an assault and striking the prosecutrix - I had repeatedly seen her, but I did not know she was the person till she was described by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MARY SCULLY. Q. Do you know Thompson's gin shop on Holborn-hill? A. No; I have heard speak of it many times - I know Holborn-hill - I passed down there that day - I do not know on what side of Holborn-hill Thompson's is - I do not know the house - I had no spirits that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Up to the time that the woman struck you and took the 1s. 4d. out of your hand, did the prisoner do any thing? A. She said to him, "I told you she had been robbing you," and he took the 1s. 4d. and put it into his pocket - when the woman struck me and took the 1s 4d. from me, the prisoner was standing by her side - he had one hand in his pocket, and the other in this manner against me (clinching her fist) - when I was before the magistrate I was hardly able to speak - the prisoner did not meddle with me till after the woman had taken the money.</p>

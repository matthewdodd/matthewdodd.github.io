                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Ramsay, a police<lb></lb>man. We live at 13, Upper Dorchester-place, Bland ford-square—the deceased was my husband's daughter by a former wife—she was seven years old the 3rd of this month—on 18th Feb., about eight o'clock in the morning, my husband and I retired to our room, and in consequence of being disturbed by the children he sent this litte girl up to Mrs. Ewin's room—in about five minutes her brother carried her down-stairs, and brought her in—she was quite insensible, and could move neither hand nor foot—my husband laid her on the bed for half an hour, and seeing her getting worse he went for the doctor—he ordered her to be taken to the Dispensary—she remained there two days, and I stopped with her till she died at three on Friday morning—I had never given her any spirits, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and house-surgeon at the Western General Dispensary. The deceased was brought there on Wednesday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was absent, but saw her a short time afterwards—she was quite insensible, quite collapsed—there was no pulse—the action of the heart could not be felt—there seemed scarcely any sign of animation at all—the pupils of the eyes were quite dilated and insensible to light—she had the stomach-pump applied, and the fluid had a very strong smell of gin—it was opaque, about a pint in quantity—I attended her during the remainder of her life—she remained insensible the whole time—reaction came on so intensely, that I was obliged to open the jugular vein to relieve it—inflammation of the brain came on, and I shaved the bead, and applied a blister, but she died on Friday morning at three o'clock—I have no doubt an overdose of gin was the cause of death—it produced</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say reaction came on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very intensely; it always takes place after narcodism—we did everything necessary to prevent reaction—we administered no stimulants except a strong decoction of coffee to rally the nervous system—that was before the reaction set in—the coffee could not possibly have caused the reaction—what had been taken produced inflammation of the stomach, and that, by sympathy, produced inflammation of the brain—the coffee would rather tend to diminish it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the Western General Dispen<lb></lb>sary. I saw the child immediately it was brought, and perceived it was labouring under the effects of some narcotic poison—I used the stomach-pump, and pumped in about half a pint of warm water—I then drew from the stomach an opaque fluid, which smelt strongly of gin—I then pumped in a strong decoction of coffee, and used friction to the surface—the child was then collapsed and cold—after she was in the bath, she rallied slightly; reaction came on afterwards, and she died from inflammation of the coats of the stomach and membranes of the brain—gin having been administered was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was she brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten o'clock, or a little before—if the stomach-pump had been used an hour before she was brought to us, the child would have been living now—she died not from the gin that was found in the stomach, but from the gin that was absorbed—I cannot speak as to the quantity of gin.</p>

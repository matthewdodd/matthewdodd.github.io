               <p>Dale Ingram. On the first Friday in last month I was coming from the Three-tun-tavern, Grace-church-street; about half an hour after 11 o'clock at night, coming into <placeName id="t17550702-35-crimeloc183">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

I turned about, and saw as it were the shadow of a man standing up near a door. He ran cross the way, and I followed him, having felt, and missed my handkerchief; in the mean time came up a young man; I told him what had happened; he called out watch. I looked and saw my handkerchief lying on the pavement, and took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you that handkerchief before ?</p>
               <p>Ingram. It was given me by a captain that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the handkerchief to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ingram. I believe about a yard, (produced in court and deposed to)</p>

            . I was coming up Fenchurch-street between ten and eleven o'clock at night, or it might be after eleven. I saw Mr. Ingram and another man walking up the street. I heard Mr. Ingram say, sir you have picked my pocket of my handkerchief. Upon which I ran up and seized<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175507020036"></xptr> a man by the collar; (it was the prisoner) he dropt the handkerchief by Mr. Ingram's leg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it?</p>
               <p>Ingram. I did. The watch came and took him away.</p>

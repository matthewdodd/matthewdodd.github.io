            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody at Islington, with a horse in his possession, on Monday, the 19th of August, about six o'clock in the evening; the horse appeared tired. I asked him if it was for sale? he said Yes, and asked forty-eight guineas for it. I left it in the stable, and went with him to the Blue Coat-boy, public-house. I then asked if he would not take something less? he said No. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have come a long way with it?" he said, I came from Stoney Stratford. I asked if it was his? he said, Yes. I said it was stolen, and I should take him into custody and the horse too, which I did; I took him to Hatton-garden, and left him with

             a short time, while I went for the horse, and in a few minutes I heard the cry of Stop thief! and found he had ran off; we followed and took him in Leather-lane. He was examined before Mr. Lamb. and remanded till Monday week. He wanted some refreshment - I took him over to a public-house, and said I did not consider it was his horse now by his running away. He said it was not his horse. I neither threatened nor promised him - he said it was a very bad job; that he was at work down at Southam, and he took it out of Southam fields; that it belonged to

            . I went for Mr. Gibbard, who came up on Monday the 26th, and saw the horse. I had left it in a livery stable in Bleeding Heart-yard. I marked it when I first took it from him, and knew it. When I first saw the prisoner, he was on it; he had a halter, but no bridle or saddle. I heard him enquiring for a stable, and followed him down Mr. Brown's yard.</p>

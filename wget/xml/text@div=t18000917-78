             sworn. - I live at Forty-hill, Enfield: On the 6th of July, I bought a goose, which I marked in the wing with a pair of scissars; I cut the feathers close to his body; I lost it on the 15th of July, I saw it about seven o'clock, and missed it about ten on the common; and about half past three, I saw the prisoner at the bar with a bag under his arm, and his jacket over it, I observed some blood upon the bag; I got Poole, the constable, and went with him to the prisoner's lodging, about four o'clock, and in the corner of the room, we found a goose, and a blanket laid over it; I found another goose in a bag, which was mine, it had been killed; I directly shewed the mark to the constable; the prisoner said he did not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There are five of my comrades that are quartered with me, and this was a bag, belonging to the regiment, that I always fetched our meat in; how the goose came there, I do not know.</p>

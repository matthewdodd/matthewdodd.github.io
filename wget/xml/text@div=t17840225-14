               <p>Did you feel him take your money? - Yes, he put his hand into my pocket and took out the money, and gave it to another person.</p>
               <p>Did all this happen in the publick street, when all the people were coming out of the play-house? - Yes, there was such a noise with coaches and link-boys; this soldier came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did he take the money from you, or did it drop out of your pocket in the scuffle? - No, he took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it did not fall out in the scuffle? - I saw him take the money out and give it to the other person.</p>
               <p>And did they attempt to take your buckles out of your shoes in the street? - One came and unbuckled one buckle, and the prisoner came and laid over me; I held the man that laid over me, while this soldier came and released me.</p>

                  </hi> I am waiter at the Nag's Head, Postern-row, Tower-hill. The prisoner assisted me on Sundays—on Sunday, 12th Feb., about half-past three, I sent him to fetch some coals out of the cellar—there is a cupboard at the foot of the stairs, in which I had seen a scarf tied up is a small handkerchief at half-past one o'clock—it was not locked—I heard the door open and shut again while he was there—there was no one there but him—he came up and said, "I am off"—he ought to have stayed till twelve—I missed my scarf between eight and nine the same evening—I did not see him again till the Tuesday, when I gave him in charge—I asked him where the scarf was, what he had sold it for, and said I would have no more bother about ut—he said he knew nothing about it—I saw the handkerchief taken from him at the station—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

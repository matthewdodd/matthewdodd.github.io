On the 29th of May, the male prisoner called; the person who was there could not understand him - his wife then came and took the lodgings, and they lived there; she said she was his wife - I had a high opinion of the Spanish nation; I missed all the articles stated in the indictment - the woman owned she had pawned the counterpane and sheet, to take out a gown to wear on Whit-Sunday.</p>
               <p>MARY CONNELL. My husband is a bricklayer. I lent the female prisoner a flat iron, and she returned it; I went to their room for another - I knocked twice at the door; there was no one at home - I went in, and missed the counterpane, the blanket, and sheet, and the feathers were lying about the room; I went down and told the witness - I went for the officer, and we went and found the male prisoner with a bundle of feathers under his arm; the officer took him - the bed had been cut open.</p>

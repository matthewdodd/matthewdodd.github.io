                  </hi>. I am a watch and clockmaker, at 254, Tottenham Court Road, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields—about 2.30 on the morning of 14th August, I had a mechanical communication made to me from the workshop, which is attached to the dwelling-house, under the same roof—I afterwards heard a noise of glass smashing—I went down and found a portion of the skylight broken—that hole was not large enough for a man to get through—I had seen the skylight about 12 o'clock the night before—it was not broken then—a constable was outside, opposite the window—we searched, but did not find anybody—I then went to the George Street police-station, and gave information—I got some constables, and we searched the next house, No, 255—the prisoner was found up the chimney, in the kitchen—I found a bag and a, piece of rope in my workshop—this clock-case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the wall outside the premises, about 3 o'clock—I had seen it safe in the said the night before—the rope was attached to the gaspipe under the skylight—a piece of glass had been removed from the skylight, large enough for a man to</p>

On the morning of 14th August, I was on duty at the police-station—the prosecutor came there, and I went to his house and I saw two holes in the roof—we afterwards went into the back kitchen of the next house—I looked up the chimney and saw the prisoner there—I pulled him down—Mr. Hasluck was present—the prisoner said "I hope you will forgive me; I have cut myself with the glass"—I told him I should charge him with a burglary in the next house—I took him to the station—on the way he said, "Are you going to lock me up, I have not taken anything, I only meant to"—I was in the act of wiping the clock-case, which was wet, and the prisoner said, "It was not wet like that when I pulled it out"—he refused his name and address.</p>

I went with Pinniek to 256, Tet<lb></lb>tenham Court Road—after we had been to Mr. Hasluck's, I saw the prisoner found up the chimney—I searched him and found ten keys and an old knife—he said, "Let me go this time, as I have cut my hand"—on the way to the station, he said he had not taken anything, but he meant to.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I got over about twelve houses at the back of Tottenham Court Road, before I got to Mr. Hasluck's premises. I then pulled my companion up with a rope; after a very long while we succeeded in getting the window out of the skylight, and he got into the shop. I heard the noise of a dog, and I went down and got up the chimney, as my only chance of escape. The constables knocked me about very much, and punched me in the side. I was not the real party that broke into the premises, and nothing was taken, and therefore I plead not guilty to the burglary.</p>

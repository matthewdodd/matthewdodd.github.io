Last Friday week, the 28th of December, in the evening, when I came home, Mrs. Woolfe complained of missing two shawls from the parlour cupboard, and next morning I sent for a Police-officer, and searched her box, which was in the garret; three quarters of a yard of linen cloth, two middles of shawls, with the borders cut off, some Prussian binding, three pairs of clasps, and this cantoon, were found - she was present at the search, and said they were her own property, and had been left to her by her father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe her father, who is dead, was a tailor. A. I understand so.</p>

            . I am an officer; I was sent for about eleven o'clock in the morning - the prisoner gave me the key; these articles were found in her box - she had a great number of things belonging to tailors, such as tape, binding, and other things; she said they were part of a lot of property left to her by her father - she had two boxes; one box, contained her wearing-apparel, and this contained tailor's articles, and books - these were not the only articles of the tailors trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose Mr. Woolf pointed out what he considered his own? A. Yes; he did not think any of the others belonged to him; she did not object to give up her keys.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOLF. I know this woollen cloth by matching with a piece I have here, which it was cut off; it tallies with the notches where it has been cut; it was sent to me to make up, and measured about five yards; I had cut off about a yard and three quarters, leaving about three and three quarters - I call this three quarters, and about three yards remained which made up the quantity - these three pairs of clasps I know, by having others similar; here is a pair which exactly match - they are not uncommon; other tailors may have them as well as me - this binding I would not swear to it; I can swear to the two shawls, by having the very same sort of things; they are the centres of shawls, and here is where the border has been cut off; I have a complete shawl here, and this black one I had only got in a few days before; I looked over the cupboard on the night of the 28th, and the shawls were gone - I knew they had been there before; this half a yard of cantoon had been cut off this piece - it had no mark on it, but it is a complement for a pair of trousers; it was the same colour and quality, and I can safely say it is part of the same, on my conscience, from the quality and colour, and quality of the back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many thousand pieces of the same colour and quality have been in the County? A. Certainly, there are hundreds, and so there are of this colour of cloth, but not with this indenture: these are shawls with the borders cut off - it can be used as a shawl; the prisoner's keys were in her box - she afforded every facility to the search.</p>

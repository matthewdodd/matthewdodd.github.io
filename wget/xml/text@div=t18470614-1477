                  </hi>. I keep the Ship and Punch-bowl public-house in High-street, Wapping, in the parish of St. George's-in-the-East. On Monday, the 10th of May, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I returned home, and found the prisoner Langford in my house and another person, who I believe to be the prisoner Fonseco—they were up in a corner outside, the bar having a print of ale together—they could see into the parlour—I went into the parlour and told my wife and child to go up stair—I found two persons in the parlour having a glass of ale—Mr. Schottler was behind the bar—I sent her up stairs, and then attended to the business of the house—some of my usual neighbourly customers were there—the prisoner were on one side of the bar, and the customer on the other—when the cus<lb></lb>tomers left Langford asked me whether he might go into the yard, that would be through the parlour where the two persons were—I suppose he went into the yard—he went into the parlour—that is the way to the yard—I did not go with him—he came back, and took his station opposite to where the cash<lb></lb>box was—the cash-box was inside—he stood outside against the counter—there is a shelf inside the bar underneath—my cash-box was on that shelf—being rather inside, and in the dark, it could not be seen by people passing by, nor by person in the bar, except when it was taken out to give change—Lang<lb></lb>ford placed himself outside the counter—the other placed himself inside, with a coat over his arm, opposite Langford, about two step off—Langford called for half a quartern of gin, paid for it, and shared it with the other—he then called for half a pint of ale, and shared that with the other—during that time the other person opened the street door three or four time, looked out, and said to Langford, "I do not see him coming, Jack," as if he was waiting for some one—the top of the bar is eighteen or twenty inches broad—my son, who had been in the yard, came out of the parlour and went up stairs—then one of the persons in the parlour came out to see what o'clock it was, the dial being in the shop, and when he turned round he asked me to bring him in a glass of spruce and water—I took it into the parlour—I could see back so far that I had only to make four step out of sight of where the cash-box stood—as I placed the spruce and water on the table I turned round and heard the gingle of the bunch of keys in the cash-box—I immediately suspected that they had hold of the cash-box—I went to took, and saw Langford and the other both rush out of door—I thought there was something wrong—I looked and the cash-box was gone—I had seen it just before I went into the parlour—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I do not know exactly in what coin it was—there was one sovereign, a half-crown, sixpences, fourpenny pieces, and, I believe, shilling—I went out at the door, and saw them just turning the corner of a street fifteen yards off—they were on the fast trot—the one I believe to be Fonseco had the coat over his arm then—I pursued and came up with them—they were side by side—I went up to the one with the coat, and said, "what have you got there?"—I lifted up the coat, and saw the cash-box under—he looked in my face and said. "My property"—he threw the cash-box and the coat into the road, and while I was picking them up, I called out, "Stop thief!" several</p>

On Monday morning, the 10th of May, I was standing opposite Mr. Schottler's house, and saw the two prisoners come out of the house—I have no doubt as to either of them—Fonseco came out first with a bundle on his arm—I had not much time to look at it—it was something turned up under his arm—they were running—when they got three or four steps out of the house, I saw Mr. Schottler come out—he ran against me, and as he ran against me, he called out "Hoy, hoy"—I suppose he was calling to the two prisoners—I saw him run after them, and when he was opposite the wharf he cried out "Stop thief"—I ran after them, as Mr. Schottler was running and about twelve steps in the Globe-street he caught the prisoner with the bundle over his arm—the prisoner dropped the bundle, and ran away—when Mr. Schottler came back, he said, "I have got my property"—I saw him bring back a cash-box and a coat, which was the bundle that I had seen the man with, and drop in Globe-street.</p>

Taddy's—I do not know where the prosecutor's house is—Fonesco sat on one side of me, and Neaves on the other side of him—there was no one on the other side of me—the person nearest me, was Badcock, who sat opposite to me—we sit eight at a table, four on each side—we all sat down at half-past eight—I do not know that I can tell you all the eight who sit at the table—sometimes the foreman changes them once a fortnight, sometimes once a month, some<lb></lb>times once in six months—I cannot tell you why he changes them—it is a whim of his own—the men sitting at this table on the 10th of May, were James Ellis, Fonesco, Joseph Neaves, Thoman Neaves, Badcock, and Gibbs, myself, but I cannot remember who the eighth was—that day we were making cigars, some called regalias—I myself was making what we call <hi rend="italic">points</hi>, and Fonseco also—I do not know whether Ellis was making large or small sizes—there is a yard space allowed to each man, and some 3ft. 10in., or 5ft.—the tables vary in size.</p>

               <p>lose a day—the May stock-taking sometimes lasts a fortnight, sometimes three weeks—it does not always begin in the same day in May, as there is no getting finished exactly to a day—there is no account taken in a book of the names of the men who are there—if they are too late, they come in at half-past ten—the foreman thinks the two hours' loss punishment enough—it is piece-work—at half-past ten there is no notice taken of what men are there—they know who are not there by their places being vacant—the fore<lb></lb>man walks up and down—I can almost be positive that there is no account taken, either by the foreman or clerk, of the men who come in the course of the day—a man of the name of Ascalape had left a portion of cigars, part of the last week's work behind him—the foreman did not pay him, because they do not pay for fourteen or fifteen cigars—the foreman asked Fonseco to take the work—the foreman pays in hundreds—there were fifteen or sixteen cigars left—they were not reckoned on this occasion, and the foreman asked Fonseco to include them in his work, and allow Ascalpe for them—I know it was on Monday, the 10th, that Ascalape called—he is not here—I could not have sworn to the day—if it had not been for that circumstance—I think I first heard of this charge against Fonseco on the 18th—it was in con<lb></lb>sequence of that that I searched back, and ascertained the day when this occurred—we were absent about a fortnight after the 15th, or two or three days over the fortnight—I recollect that Fonseco was not absent during any part of Monday the 10th, because we worked together by the hour—I had only known him absent on one occasion three oro four months ago, and that was to go on business—he has always attended to business—we do not work as partners in the same job; but to cause us to work quickly, and not to lose any time, to keep our attention on the work—he has never been from my side the whole time I have worked there—I have returned since the stock<lb></lb>taking, and am now in the same employ, and Fonseco also—he sits behind me now, at another table—we sit back to back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I saw Fonseco at work there on Wednesday last—on Thursday I attended here—he has been regularly at work since, up to last Wednesday—we are paid on Saturday afternoon for the work that we have done during the week—the work clears up on the Friday—the work goes in every day, and we receive an account of it next morning—each man makes about the same number of cigars each day—from 300 to 350 is a fair day's work of that particular work—the amount we each did on the Monday will appear by Messrs. Taddy's account—it might be 250 that I made that day—that would be about the average—we are enabled to earn from 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards—I believe Fonseco is a married man—he has no family that I know of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Taddy, and have been in their employment between three and four years—their place of business is in the Minories—I cannot say how far it is from High-street, Wapping—Fonseco has been in Messrs. Taddy's employ between three and four years—there are between eighty and ninety men employed in the same part of the building with him—I keep a book containing an account of the work which the men do—the account of each day's work is taken on the following morning—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>)—on the 10th of may, Fonseco made 350 cigars—there are 600 down to him on the following day, and 400 the day after that, the next day 400, and the next 400—they are all the same kind of cigars as those made on the Monday—on the Monday before the 10th he made 350.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for the difference in the Monday and Tuesday's work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the 600 cigars down to him on the Tuesday, 200 belonged to another man that had left—he was at work in the Saturday, and our week's work is made up on the Friday night—350 cigars is a good day's work—on Monday, the 3rd, there are 350 down to Fonseco, the same as on the 10th—I heard of Fonseco being in custody on the 17th—that called my attention to the circumstance of the 10th of May—I recollect seeing him that day at Messrs. Taddy's—I first saw him about ten o'clock in the morning, and I saw him from that time up to the time of leaving off for the dinner-hour, which was ten minutes to one, and from two in the afternoon up to seven in the evening—I am able to say that he did not leave the warehouse between ten and one—he could not go out without my leave—he was a very steady, regular, honest man; very unassuming and quiet in his manner—we began to take stock on the follow<lb></lb>ing morning, but we had four or five, or seven men, finishing up a small quantity of leaf we had in hand—I believe we commenced on the 17th—we required only six or seven men, and the rest had a holiday—it is a regular thing for them to have a holiday for two or three weeks while we are taking stock—we commenced work again on the 1st or 2nd of June, when Fonseco come back—he came on Monday, the 1st or 2nd of June, and is still in the</p>

               <p>employment—350 cigars are down to him on the 1st or 2nd June—and he worked for us up to the time of his attendance here—I attended at chambers, before Mr. Justice Erle, made an affidavit as to certain facts, and he was then admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CAARTEEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say on Monday the 10th there are 350 cigars down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and on Thursday 600, but I account for 200 of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the man's name to whom the 200 be<lb></lb>longed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Abraham Ascalape, a man who sat at the same table—the men who sat there were Scott, Joseph Neaves, Ellis, Ascalape, Fonseco, Gibbs, and Lane—I do not remember anybody else just now—we had a name of the name of Badcock—I believe he left previous to the 10th—I do not feel positive about Lane working at that table, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CAARTEEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Badcock left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I not see anything down to Badcock after Thursday, 24th April—the prisoner made 350 cigars on the Monday, 400 on the Thursday, (allowing for the 200), 400 on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 400 on Thursday, 400 on Friday—he is a Jew, and does not work on Saturday—there are 400 cigars down to Scott on Monday—the Saturday and Monday's work go down together—Fonseco does not work on Saturday—Saturday and Monday is connected together—Scott made about 400, but it was a different sort of cigar—I superintend a portion of the manufacturing—I have the general supervision of that one room—none of my business lies out of the room—there are eighty or ninety men in the room—I should say no man could go out and come in again without my knowledge, because he would have to asked leave—there is nothing else to prevent his going out—he might ask leave of the foreman of the premises, but I should know it from him—it is such rare thing for a man to go out come in again, that I should be sure to remember if it was done.</p>

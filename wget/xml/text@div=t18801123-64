I live at 17, Sale Street, Paddington—on 23rd Sep<lb></lb>tember the prisoner engaged a room at my house for the night—her husband and she slept there—the next morning they took it for a week—she brought a child on the Thursday after she had taken the room—I saw the child on the Saturday—it looked very ill—it had a placid look, it could not move—the prisoner was then downstairs—when she came up I <hi rend="italic">said.</hi> It ought to have beef-tea"—she said it would not take it, and that</p>

               <p>she fed it on milk and eggs—I gave it a biscuit—it could not hold it—it dropped and remained on its chest—later the same evening she came and said the child was dying—it was laid out in front of a large fire—I said, "What makes you think it is dying?"—she said, "Because its feet and legs are swollen"—I said, "Its legs are not larger than a child's ought to look; you had better call in the doctor"—it was lying on the carpet on a bundle of straw in front of the fire—she said it was not any use to call in the doctor—I said, "Oh yes, call in the doctor. Then you must have money to pay him"—Oh yes,"she said, "he has plenty of money at the yard"—I said, "If you are not able to pay you had better take the child to Dr. Waller in Sholdham Street"—she took the child, away and came back tipsy, and said, "The doctor says, like all other doctors, that it may live for a year, or may live six months, or a week, or it may die in an hour"—I said, "What medicine has he given you?"—she said, "Oh, he made a bottle of medicine up, but I was not going to pay eightpence for it"—she said she would take it to the doctor on the Sunday morning, but she never went out till the afternoon—I saw her about 11 o'clock on the Saturday evening—she was tipsy—she had some halfpence to get some beer—she said it was for her husband, but she. drank it herself—she was in my room, standing by the door—she took the child out about the middle of the day on Sunday, when she name home tipsy at night—she was tipsy every day from the Saturday till she was taken in charge—I heard the child cry several times—I heard her heating it and calling it, "Dear, darling Meggie," yet still beating it—the cry was a very unnatural sort of shriek—on the Monday morning I saw her with the child laid upon her shoulder, the way she always carried, it—she said she took it to the doctor and brought back some medicine—I never saw her feed the child—I am surd she never gave it any beef-tea—she said it would not take it on the Wednesday afternoon I saw a soldier come into the house with the prisoner—she was drunk—the child was lying on the little sideboard by the side of the fireplace—there is a recess on each side—the next time I saw the child it was dead—the fol<lb></lb>lowing day, Thursday, the prisoner was out in the afternoon—the child was locked up in the room for two hours—when she came back she was drunk and very excitable—about 6.30 I heard the child scream, that unnatural sort of noise, and I heard her talking to it—I never heard it after wards—about 7 o'clock I had to go on to the leads—I looked through the window and saw her dressing her hair—she went out—I saw her husband come in—when the door opened I saw the child—a caudle was spoke to the husband—he sent for a doctor—when the room was searched I found the biscuit, which I had given to the child on the Saturday, with some pieces of bread and bacon, and a lot of dry bread and things of that sort—the man slept there the whole time—he worked up to Sunday even<lb></lb>ing driving a 'bus, and he would go out about 10 o'clock and come back between 12 and 1 o'clock at night—he had no work on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 159, Edgware Road—I was called in by the police to 17, Sale Street, Padding ton, about 9 p.m. on Thursday, 30th September—I found the dead body of a female child about 14 months old—it was warm—it had apparently been dead about an hour—it was on top of a small cupboard or chest of drawers in a recess, and about four feet from the floor—it was laid out and covered with an apron—a bottle of medicine was subsequently handed to me by a police<lb></lb>man—it was a mixture that would be used for diarrhoea—it was about two-thirds full—when given from a dispensary, bottles are not always full—I saw the prisoner—she was intoxicated—by the Coroner's order I made <hi rend="italic">A post-mortem</hi> examination on 3rd October, assisted by Mr. Botley—the child's length was 2 ft. 3 in., its weight 8 lb. 1/2 oz.—a child's weight at its birth is about 7 lb. or 8 lb.—this child ought to have been heavier—its abdomen was green from commencing putrefaction—some lice were on the stomach, and some flea bites about the abdomen—the body generally was extremely emaciated; it seemed simply to be bones—there were do marks of external violence—there was no fat whatever under the skin—that would show that the child had been suffering for some time either from some disease of a wasting character, or from neglect as regards food: that it had been starved gradually—on opening the scalp it was blood-lese—on opening the skull, 2 oz. of serum escaped—the stomach was contracted and empty as regards nutrition, but there was about half a tablespoonful of grumous fluid usually found in all stomachs—the intes<lb></lb>tines were empty from beginning to end, except a small portion of mucous matter in the large bowel as it descends on the left side—I should expect to find traces of solid food if given within two days, and of fluid food within twenty-four hours—I found none whatever—the right lung was contracted and adherent to the chest wall—I should say the cause of death was exhaustion while the child was suffering from inflammation of the lungs and pleurisy, accelerated by neglect and starvation—I mean neglect both as to cleanliness and proper nourishment—there was not the slightest sign of anything in the bowels that would prevent the child taking food.</p>

I am surgeon to the workhouse at Walton, Liverpool—in April this year I attended the prisoner's child—it was suffering at first from a feverish cold, and it had some bronchitis—I saw it occasionally in the workhouse for three or four months; it recovered from the cold, but it was a, very weak child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was never paralysed—I said that I should have to examine it again, because its legs were weak, and I feared there was something the matter with its spine—I examined it and there was nothing the matter—it had the best of food in the workhouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I told the nurse that it was a weak child, and the prisoner may have heard it—a weak child would require more care than a strong one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at Walton Workhouse, Liverpool—the prisoner came there with her child in April, 1880, and about the end of the month she was transferred to the nursery and came under my charge—it was a small, delicate child, and the doctor attended it—the prisoner suckled it—I said that I should mention it to the doctor; she said "It is no use speaking to the doctor, as I have lost other children in the same way; I think it is the teeth."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a very delicate small child, you were never allowed to feed it yourself, one of the aged women fed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder in the goal at Liverpool—I saw the prisoner and her child on 18th June, 1879, it was then a week old and very small—I cannot say that it was a delicate child, it was never under medical treatment, it was six months under my observation.</p>

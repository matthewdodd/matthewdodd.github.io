We went into one of the little houses there, and had some tea, and staid there till between 2 and 3 in the afternoon; then she said, she could eat something, I ordered some mutton chops, they were getting ready, I was very d fy, not being long from sea, I laid my head down, and desired her to awake me when the stakes were ready; I believe I slept about an hour, when I awaked my watch and she were gone. She had told me she lodged in Sheer-lane I went there the next day, and found her in the neighbourhood; she then said, she did not know me; at last she owned she took my watch, and went with me to Mr. Day's, a pawnbroker, at the bottom of Holborn, where I found it; she said, it was the first offence she ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Nash. I looked at it, but whether I laid it down, or put it in my pocket, I am not sure.</p>

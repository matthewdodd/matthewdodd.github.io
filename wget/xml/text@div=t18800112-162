                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). I had seen the prisoner previously at the General Post-office in June—on the first occasion he pleaded very hard that The decision by which he was dismissed might be reconsidered and altered—he began to speak of all he said he had suffered from the Post-office officials at sheerness—I don't remember that he named any particular individual, but he spoke against those who had been in authority there, the late postmaster and the then acting postmaster—Mr. Hartigan was then acting postmaster—I told him that any reconsideration of his case was quite leading into a vestibule, and in this vestibule there is a glass care in which the hall porter sits; on the right is a side door which leads into a small office—it would be very dangerous to fire a bullet in there—Mr. Hartigan was not at the General Post-office at that time, nor yet at sheerness; I don't of my own knowledge know where he was—he had returned from sheerness to the General Post-office before December—he was clerk in charge at the General Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> Any application that you addressed to Superior authority ought to have been forwarded—your papers did come To headquarters, and were seen by the authorities, and by the Postmater-General—the paper in which you state that your liberty was not safe, was received, and said before the postmaster-General, and it is now in my hands—believe it came through the surveyor. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To the clerk in charge. Sir,—I will suspend myself, as I do nor consider my liberty safe at present H.

                  </hi>. I am one of the officers called clerks In charge at the General Post-office—in October, 1878, I went down to Sheerness to fill a vacancy and take charge of the Post-office there—the Prisoner was a letter-carrier in that district—it was in my discretion to arrange the walks of the letter-carriers, and to apportion their duties—in the exercise of that discretion I shifted the walks; I altered all the walks, that they might be more thoroughly conversant with each other's duties—that was the only alteration I made in the prisoner's duties—I think that altera<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>was made on 21st Feb.—I saw him on that evening just as the mail came in, and he threw in my face this paper, which has been read; he was leaving the office, and I called him back to explain—the mail had arrived, and it was his turn to be on duty and to go out with a portion of the mail—I asked him to explain the writing, and not be so stupid; he would not—he refused to come back, and left with his uniform on, and I had to supply a substitute for his duty that evening—U next saw him on the 25th February; he came in at the time the mail arrived, and in the presence of 10 or 12 letter-carriers he demanded a week's wages—I replied "I fear you are not entitled to any wages, you left without giving proper notice"—he then stretched his arm across the counter to me and said "You b——Irish scoundrel, I will take it out of you"—I reported his conduct to Mr. Perrin the surveyor, within an hour or two, in writing—he was the proper officer for me to report it to. (<hi rend="italic">This was a report for insubordinate couduct, &amp;c.</hi>) In consequence of a communication which I afterwards received from Mr. Perrin the prisoner was dismissed—the dismissals in such cases are made on the order of the postmaster-General; his decision is communicated to The surveyor, by the surveyor to me, and by me to the prisoner—I next Saw the prisoner about 5th April—I was assisting in the office at Sheerness, I heard a noise behind me, I turned round in my chair, and the only answer I got was screams of "Branston, Branston," and as I turned round the prisoner met me and struck me in the face and knocked me over; I was covered with blood, and my papers also—I got another blow on the chin, and he seized me round the waist and tried to rush me through a large plate-glass window into the street; I held by the table until help came and he was secured—besides the less for some time, and I felt the effects for months—I afterwards appeared at the police-court against him, and he was sent for a month to Canterbury with hard labour, and bound to keep the peace for three months—it came to my knowledge that in September the prisoner made a charge against me at the Criminal Investigation Department of receiving stolen property; I think he said eight books and a folding slate, which I had paid for; there was not a shadow of foundation for the charge—inquiry was made, and I Still hold my office—I have seen the letter of the 29th December, addressed to Mr. Joyce, and have not the slightest doubt that it refers to me.</p>

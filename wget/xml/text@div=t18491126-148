                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Whitaker, of Park-terrace, Sydenham. The prisoner was in our service as cook for nine months, and left on 8th Oct.—I then missed some pieces of lace from my bed-room—I had five different patterns of lace—I have some lace here which I have compared with that produced by the officer—I also missed a box like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my husband has the <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire Gazette</hi> sent to him, and we bad the one dated 4th Aug., we missed a quantity of it while the prisoner was with us—the value of the lace varied from 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 6). I apprehended the prisoner on the 1st Nov., at Mr. Widdon's, on Sydenham-hill—I told her she was charged with stealing some preserves, and other articles—she said she knew nothing about them—I said she must go to the station—I sealed up her boxes at this House, and afterwards fetched them to the station—I then fetched Mrs. Whitaker, and the boxes were opened in the prisoner's presence, and Mrs. Whitaker identified these articles—there were four or five ounces of loaf-sugar wrapped in the <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire Gazette</hi>—she said the lace was given her by a former mistress, who was dead.</p>

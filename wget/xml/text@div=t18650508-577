                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live at 5, Brittannia-place, Hatcham, New Town—in October last the prisoner lodged with me, the de<lb></lb>ceased Davis, and a man named Bailey also—they were all labourers, work<lb></lb>ing on the rail way—on Saturday night, 29th October, I was in my room I with my wife, Bailey and Davis came in, they had half a gallon of beer—Bailey said to ray wife that wherever he lodged before, his landlady had always paid for a pot of beer—she said, "I do not mind being a pot to your pot, "they sent for the beer—the prisoner and his wife came in—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080099"></xptr>
               <p>offered the prisoner a glass of beer—Bailey jumped up and said, "I helped pay for that and he shall not have any"—I said, "What is the reason?"—he said, "There is a reason, he shall not drink any of it"—the prisoner said, "Perhaps when this is out the landlord and I can have a pot together"—Bailey said, "I do not say muck about that"—when the beer was out, the prisoner and I sent for another pot, and while drinking it they kept falling out about the beer—the prisoner struck at Bailey and Bailey struck at him again, and caught him on the jaw and fell down in front of the bar, saying, "Oh, my jaw is broken, is there no one that will help me"—I said, "I will not have such a disturbance in my house"—Davis sat in a chair against the window and never interfered at all—the prisoner got up and took the poker to strike Bailey across the head—my wife caught hold of it and said, "I will have none of this work"—I took the poker from his hand and put it down—the prisoner and Bailey shook hands after that and drank to<lb></lb>gather, and said that they were very sorry for what had happened—Bailey went and sat against Davis who was asleep, and while there the prisoner stood out in the room and was talking a little to his wife, and went out and came back again and stood behind Davis, and I saw his hands come down two or three times sharp, and I saw the blood pour straight out of Davis's head—the three blows came across Bailey's head—I jumped up and said, "Good God, what is the matter?"—I saw Newman <hi rend="italic">map</hi> the poker out of the prisoner's hand—Bailey got up and was going to strike me, thinking I had done it, as I stood behind him—the prisoner was then just going out at the door—Bailey ran to the door and called him—they had a fight at the door—I shoved them both out of doors, they came in again and were fight<lb></lb>ing in the passage—my wife and I got between them and I got the prisoner into the room—he was drunk and could not walk without staggering—Bailey had had too much beer, but was not so much drunk as the prisoner, Davis was much the same, but he had not been in my house, he interfered with nobody—my wife washed and dressed Davis's head—a doctor was sent for; the prisoner remained in his room all night; he was backwards and forwards for a week afterwards—Davis went to work two days afterwards—he was taken to the hospital on the Sunday week after this happened, and died on the Wednesday following—the prisoner came up and saw him before he left, and said, "Poor fellow, I am sorry to Bee him like this, I am sorry it happened, I will go to my ganger and draw a few shillings and give him to help him, "but he never came back any more—while the quarrelling was going on, the prisoner's wife began at Bailey about hitting her husband on the jaw and not letting him have the beer—Bailey said, "What has that to do with you, you Irish w—?"—that was said loud enough for the pri-soner to hear—it must have been twenty or twenty-four minutes after that that the blow was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of New Cross-road, Hatcham—I was called in on Saturday about twelve o'clock, and saw the deceased bleeding profusely from a wound on the top of his head—he was covered with ban<lb></lb>dages which I removed and found a wound of the temporal artery, which caused the bleeding, it was about two inches long and down to the bone—I saw him next morning, and told him he must go to the hospital, he refused to go—I attended him next day and the following day he came and said that he must go to work—I told him he could not he must go to the hos<lb></lb>pital, he was obstinate and would not go—he got worse each day and on Sun<lb></lb>day became insensible—we then sent him to the hospital and he there died—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have no doubt his death was caused by inflammation arising from the injury—this poker would produce the wound.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JOHNSTON. On the 3d of April, soon after seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18270405-256-crimeloc1406">Fleet-street, nearly opposite Chancery-lane</placeName>

"Yes (said one of the men), and I have got your handkerchief;" I came down with them to the watch-house, but it was not open - I gave my address and left them, as I was on business - this is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know when you had your handkerchief in your pocket? A. Yes, in passing by Messrs. Twinings' there was a crowd, and a quarrel with some coachmen - I stepped into a druggist's shop, and took out my handkerchief there - I then came through Temple-bar, and was nearly opposite Chancery-lane, when my attention was drawn to the circumstance.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Mr. Johnston in Fleet-street - Williams took the handkerchief from his pocket - the street is narrow, and I was just opposite to them - Williams gave it to Peck the moment he took it, and Peck ran up Chancery-lane - I had followed them out of the Strand - I ran over and seized Williams - he was the farthest from me, and I thought he had not had time to give it away, but as I got close to them. I saw Peck receive it out of his hand, and run away - I told a young man to follow Peck, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I understood you that the moment he took the handkerchief, he gave it away? A. Yes; when I crossed over it was handed instantly - my object was to take the man farthest from me - I seized Williams on the spot.</p>

            . I was in a public-house in Chancery-lane, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran out, and saw Peck running - I followed him, and he was taken. I saw him drop this handkerchief - I took him to the watch-house - there was nobody there, and I took him to the Compter - he denied having had any thing to do with it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PECK's Defence. I met my fellow prisoner in Lincoln's-inn-fields, he asked me to go with him to Fleet-market to purchase a hat - I said I would if I could be back by half-past 7 o'clock - I saw when I got to the clock that it was 7 then, and I told him I must leave him - I went up Chancery-lane, and I immediately found myself in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS' Defence. I met my fellow prisoner, and as soon as he got to the clock, he bid me good bye and left me - an officer then took hold of me.</p>

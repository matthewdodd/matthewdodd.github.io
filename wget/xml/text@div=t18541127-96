                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 188). On 4th Nov. I went to the prisoner's shop—he was at that time locked up—I went to the back of the house—I gained access there through the front of the house—I found a shed attached to the kitchen—I had to go out of the kitchen into the yard to go to it—I found in that shed two bags containing copper—in one bag there were 7 lbs. of copper—it was all new, and all marked with the broad arrow; and in the other bag was about 12lbs. of copper, which was not marked—this is the bag with the marked copper—it has the broad arrow on every piece—the copper was folded in the same manner as</p>

               <p>it is now—the broad arrow appears on the outside of all the pieces but this one, which has the mark inside the fold—here are some nails and screws which were in the parcel—they have the broad arrow on them—after having searched, I went back, and found the prisoner in custody—I spoke to him with reference to what I had been at.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was in the cell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I asked him if he knew that the copper which was in the shed at the back of his house, was marked with the broad arrow—he said, "Yes, he knew it was; there were several pieces marked"—I spoke to him through the wicket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the shed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the center of the yard; there was a great deal of property there—I did not take possession of it all—this was on the same day that the prisoner was apprehended—when I had got all this information, I went to the station—I did not open the wicket that led to the cell immediately—some little time after, we put the stores away—I opened the wicket, and looked in—he was against the wicket—I was in uniform—the wicket is about six inches wide—I stood at a little distance—I asked him whether he knew the copper was marked with the broad arrow—he said it was, and he believed he bought it—I asked whether he had made any entry in his book, and he said he had not—I asked him how long he had had it in possession—he said a short time, about a month—he said he had had the lead a short time, about a month—he used the same words about the copper, as about the lead—I do not think there was any difference—I have been a policeman nearly seven years—I have been to the prison door, to speak to the prisoners, some scores of times—I have not come in a Court of Justice scores of times, and told what they have said—I have not had occasion—I was not in the case—I had no busi<lb></lb>ness to ask other prisoners, whom I had nothing to do with.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that scores of times you have come into the Court, and told before; the Judge and Jury that you have gone to cell doors and catechised prisoners in this way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was at times before the Magistrate, not here—in this case I was compelled to do it, as the prisoner was in custody—I did not know but what we had authority to go, and ask prisoners as to matters about which they are charged, when we have found the goods—when I found this copper I saw the marks, and when I went to the cell I knew there were those marks—this is the copper that is marked, and these are tie nails—here is the broad arrow, under the head of the nail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the shipwrights in Woolwich Dock-yard—I have looked at these pieces of copper; they have all the marks of the broad arrow—it is new cop per, and appears to have been part of a funnel for a cabin stove—these screws and nails are such as are used in ships.</p>

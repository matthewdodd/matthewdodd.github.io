               <p>Dr. WILLIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner at the bar twenty-five years: I have prescribed several times for him, and attended him for the purpose of assisting a derangement in his head; his relations and friends said he was very much deranged, and I have often perceived it myself; I exerted myself for him to the utmost of my ability; about two years ago, I believe It was in March, I was given over by my medical friends, I had an asthmatical complaint; Mr. Piers suddenly broke into my chamber, being in the habits of intimacy, he came in in a very wild manner, and clapped me upon my back, and as I lay, very weak and low, with my head upon the pillow upon the table, and said, Doctor, you are a dead man, you are a dead man; your friends do not know your complaint, or do not understand your complaint; nor I do not believe you think yourself so bad as you are; I was exceedingly startled, being low; and my wife was very much frightened, for fear it should take a bad effect upon me; it appeared to be a wild derangement of mind; about a fortnight before this affair happened, he met me in the Borough, just at the turnpike at Newington-causeway, he took and turned me round all on a sudden, being weak, and said, how goes the world with you, doctor; I said, I think it turns round with me at present; it was done with all that flightiness that one would expect from a deranged man; he answered, never mind, Doctor, It will turn round right for an honest man; I attended too at his last examination, at Mrs. Piers's earnest request, and I was then not well at all; I stood under the dial at Bow-street, and after the witnesses were examined, he was very much deranged, and stood like an ideot, picking his nose, and appeared very much deranged; it was impossible to have any other opinion of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Having seen him at the time of his examination, are you of opinion that he is deranged? - A. Undoubtedly, at times; he seems at times a little sensible, but it goes off again very quickly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner seven years; for the last six or eight months I have seen him very frequently; his mind has been certainly much deranged at times; in the course of that time, about five months ago, I came to town from Beckenham, in Kent, and brought my daughter with me; Mr. Piers knew of my marriage, four years ago, with Mr. Coxen; I came to see his eldest daughter, that I had been particularly intimate with, and bringing my daughter with me, he asked me how I came by a child, where I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know that you had a child by your marriage? - A. Most certainly; it will be twelve months old to-morrow; he asked me who I was, where I came from, and what my name was, though he had seen me several times, at his own house, during my pregnancy; he asked me a number of questions, and then entered into a latin discourse, which he knew I was not conversant with, and then told me I was a fool for not understanding it; his daughter has some knowledge of latin, and she told me it was latin; so, from that time, whatever Mr. Piers has said to me, at different times, I have never answered, or took notice of, being quite inconsistent with any thing that is reasonable; I saw him about a month before this business occurred, he came home while I was in the house, his conduct appeared then exactly in the same manner as it had done for four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from your observation of his conduct, that he had possession of his mind? - A. No; he certainly was deranged at times.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect any particular expressions that he has made use of? - A. No; I paid no attention to any thing that he said, he was so inconsistent.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, from your observation, that his mind was deranged? - A. I always thought his mind was deranged.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020071"></xptr>Q. This was known to a great many in the office as well as yourself? - A. Yes; to those that have had the same opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his conduct such as to induce you to believe he was deranged in his intellects? - A. In some small degree I should think so, at times; I recollect his observing to me, one morning, that when he was post-master general he would give me a better situation.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the presidents at the Post-office: I have known the prisoner at the bar a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed him to be a man perfectly possessed of his reason? - A. I have observed him at some times to be completely deranged; I have observed a variety of circumstances; in fact, he has always shewn confusion and irregularity in his ideas and conversation, a flightiness and unsettledness, that has convinced me that his mind has been totally deranged at times; I have observed it down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell us why, under these circumstances, he has been continued in his situation? - A.From motives of humanity, the superior officer forbore to make a report; I believe he has been in the office upwards of thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has a wife and six children? - A. Yes; he has maintained a very good character, so much so, that he has been put in very responsible situations in the office.</p>
               <p>- BALLENTINE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk of the third division of the inland department of the Post-office: About September last, not being in the habits of speaking to the prisoner at the bar, the prisoner saw me at a little distance, where there is a gate to come in; he called to me, and said, here; which I remarked as very extraordinary, not in general speaking to him; there was a small piece of stagnated water before the window where I live, at Walworth; he asked me if I was found of fish; I said, yes; he said, what a fool you must be, here is plenty of fish; he said one of his sons had caught six pounds in a morning; when I returned, I made the observation at the time, that the man must be mad, for there was no fish there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is deranged in his mind? - A. At times, certainly.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I belong to the Treasury: I have known the prisoner between twenty and thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character for honestly during all that time? - A. I never heard that he was dishonest, I always looked upon him as a very eccentric and inconsistent character, a man that seemed to be at war with his own interest in general; I have known him refuse very good situations which have been offered him by his friends, from whim or caprice, though his children at that time might be wanting bread; I found that he was a man that could not be served, which arose from his eccentricity; at the same I believe him a man, when in possession of a found mind, incapable of doing an action morally wrong.</p>

               <p>CHARLES-RUNNINGTON BROUGHTON, Esq. sworn. - I have known the prisoner at the bar upwards of twenty years; I have observed him to be extremely eccentric, and in a disordered state of mind; his character has been always that of a perfectly honest man; I have considered him to be a strictly honourable character; I have had an opportunity frequently of being employed to write in the Secretary of State's office; I employed him to copy a paper to be laid before Parliament, which I could by no means have done if I had had any doubts of his strict honour; that was about three years since; I should not do justice to the man if I did not say he is one of the last men in the world that would, I believe, be guilty of such an action as he now stands at that bar to answer for.</p>

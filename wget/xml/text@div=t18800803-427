                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 26, Medland Street, Ratchiff—on 5th July, about 2.15 a.m., I was in bed and heard someone lighting matches on the stairs—I got up, lit a candle, and found the prisoner on the stairs, dressed as he is now, but without boots—I said "Holloa, foreman, how did you come in here; which way did you come in?"—he said "In through the door"—I said "No, you could not have come in through the door"—he said he had come for a man named Sullivan—no man of that name lodged in the house: my lodger's name is Welch—I went down with the prisoner to the kitchen and found a pair of boots then, which he said were his, and put them on—a pane of glass in the window was cut clean out—if it had been done with a diamond it could not have been done cleaner—he had unbolted the door to let himself out—I had gone to bed at 10.30—the doors and windows were then safe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was searched at the police-station in my presence—he had no diamond or any hammer or jemmy—he told me that he was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Fire Queen</hi>—he offered no resistance—he looked sober—he offered the policeman and me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each to withdraw the charge when he got paid off.</p>

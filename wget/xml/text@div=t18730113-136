               <p>in the "Islington Gazette"—I produce the paper—this is the paragraph—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Sisterly Affection.—On Wednesday last Mary, wife of Mr. James Powell, of Upper Holloway, and Sarah Baylis, of the same place, spinster, were summoned before the magistrates; at Abergavenny, for an assault upon Annie Bebb, a sister of the defendants, and for committing damages on her premises, Quarella Farm, near Abergavenny. It was stated that the complainant is the sole executrix of the will of Thomas Baylis, the deceased father of the parties, and in connection with this fact the offences charged were alleged to have been committed. Mr. Farquhar, of Abergavenny, instructed by Messrs. Buckler, Millard, and Cayley, of London, appeared for the complainant, and the defendants were also represented by a solicitor. The evidence went to show that the defendants broke fifteen panes of glass in the windows of complainant's house, thus effecting an entry, and then committed the assault complained of, which resulted in the complainant having a black eye, scratched face, and broken tooth. Attempts were made on the part of the defendants to settle the matter privately, but these were positively declined by the complainant, and the Magistrates convicted the defendants and levied a fine, which was paid by Mr. Powell, the husband of one of the defendants, who was present in court during the trial.")—I was present at Abergavenny when my wife and Sarah Baylis were charged before the Magistrates—the Magistrates ordered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. damages to be paid for breaking the window, and he fined Sarah Baylis 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; at the same time he said he regretted very much that such a case was brought before them—there is not a word of truth in saying my wife was ever summoned for assault—there was no charge of assault against my wife, and no evidence given—I saw Mr. Burden, a pupil of defendant's, in court—the defendant is the brother-in-law of Mrs. Bebb, who was complainant in the summons at Abergavenny—MR. Burden was busy taking notes in Court—the defen<lb></lb>dant is a shorthand writer—I was present at the Clerkenwell Police Court when the prisoner was committed for trial—the defendant admitted that he was the author of the paragraph, and that he would take the entire responsibility of it upon himself—I withdrew the summons against Burden—MR. Baylis, my father-in-law, died in May—at that time Mrs. Bebb resided with me—my wife was living with me, and so was her sister, sarah Baylis—my attention has since been called to copies of the paper contain<lb></lb>ing the paragraph directed to other persons in my immediate neighbour<lb></lb>hood—I have seen copies with a black mark surrounding the paragraph.</p>

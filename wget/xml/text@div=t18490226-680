I shall be fourteen years old on 29th Mar.—I work for Mrs. Reynolds, a fishing-line maker; the lines are kept on a shelf in the higher shop—I could take them—I was not in the habit of taking them, but Tucker told me to take them—that was about the beginning of last summer—I took these lines that are here—I took some of them up to Tucker's house, No. 16. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2, West-street—I gave them to Tucker—he did not pay me for them—he used to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to work, and he said, if I waited till Friday-night he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a few halfpence—he sometimes gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some<lb></lb>times 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me to get as many as I could, and he would let me be in his raffle for his garden-board for nothing—I was in it; I did not get it—I did not get anything else from him—he said he would make ma a fishing<lb></lb>can, but he did not—I do not think I took him more fishing-lines than there are here, but I cannot say how many—when I was taken I told the whole story—there was no promise made to me before I told it—the policeman told me to tell the truth, and that would be the beat for me, and as I was going along I told him the whole story—Tucker told me to get him a gold lace hatband for his child, but I did not.</p>

               <p>knew it was wrong to take them, but Tucker told me to get them—I told him I would tell my mistress; but he kept asking me, and asking me—I did not tell my mother because he threatened to hit me if I did—I got acquainted with him by seeing him at 16 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2, West-street—my mother's room and his used to look into one another; and when my mother went out, Mrs. Tucker used to come in to look at the fire—the first time he spoke to me, he said; "Let us see, what do you work at?" I said, "Anything; I wind cotton to make fishing-lines sometimes"—I said my mistress tasked me—he said, "What at?"—I said, "At fishing-lines"—he said, "Get us one, will you?"—I said, "I will tell my master."—he said, "If you do, I will hit you; "then he did not speak to me any more for two or three weeks—I used to go to play in his room with his little child; and then I got one line—he said, "Are these the sort?"—I said, "Yes,"—he told me to get as many as I could, and he said he would make me a fishing-can and rod in the summer; and he gave me a few half-pence—I made some of the lines myself; pretty near all of them—my master said if I did sixty yards a day, I might go home if I liked; but if I stopped he would pay me extra for it—these lines were only a small part of my master's business—he made braid and gold lace: I did not do that—I never gave these lines to anybody but to Tucker.</p>

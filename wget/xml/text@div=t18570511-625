                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, T</hi> 27). I know James Wisken. On the morning of 5th April I saw him, and he made a charge against two persons, whom he described—in consequence of that I went in search of the pri<lb></lb>soners, and found them the same evening—Brown was in a beer shop in London Road, Staines, and Thompson was a short distance from the beer shop, going towards it—I took them into custody—I told Brown he was charged with stealing some articles of wearing apparel from James Wisken, who was then present—he said he did not know anything about the robbery—Wisken said in his presence that he was the man who was with Sarah Thompson at Highgate, where his things were stolen by her—Brown said, that if the things were stolen, he knew nothing about it—I took Brown into custody; I afterwards took Thompson, and said that she was charged with stealing some wearing apparel and money, the property of James Wisken, who was present—she said, "I did not"—Wisken said, "From information I have received, you did rob me"—she said, "No, I did not; if you have been robbed, it is by your brother"—he said that he did not know anything about that—I had known Thompson before, I had seen her in the neighbourhood where I took her—I searched a bundle belonging to Brown, and in it found this <hi rend="italic">slop</hi>, which was immediately iden<lb></lb>tified by Wisken, who said, "That is my <hi rend="italic">slop</hi>"—I found this coin in a little bag in Brown's bundle; Wisken saw it, and said, "That is mine also; I can identify it by a hole in it; I bought it at Malta, on my return from the</p>

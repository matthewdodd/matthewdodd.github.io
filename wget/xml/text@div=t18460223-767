                  </hi>. I am now living in Newington-terrace, Dover-road—in Aug. last and previously I was engaged in buying shares in public companies, about Capel-court and the neighbourhood of the Stock Exchange—I know a gentleman named James Gibbons, living at No. 9, Collet-place, Commercial-road—on the 10th of Aug. I received from him this letter of allotment in the British and Irish Union Railway Company, for which I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share—that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it that same month to Smith, Payne, and Smith, the bankers appointed to receive the deposits—I had received money from Mr. Brown, who had money there, and I paid a deposit of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share—this is the bankers' receipt—on the 17th of Sept. I was in the Hall of Commerce, where I am a subscriber—my name was called out in the hall—I went up, and found the prisoner—I had seen him before several times, and knew him about there as a party who was in the habit of selling letters, but in no other way, not to have any conversation with him, no more than he may have come up and asked me the price of any particular railway—I did not know who or what he was—he said, "Have you a banker's receipt for some shares in the British and Irish Union Rail<lb></lb>way? Mr. Gibbons has sent me for it, to get the scrip"—he did not name the number of shares—I replied, "I am glad of it, for I want the scrip to deliver to be sold"—in order to get the scrip, it must be signed by the original allottee—I believed that he came from Gibbons, as it was a very common occurrence at that time, and I went and got the receipt from Mr. Brown, and handed it to the prisoner—when I gave it to him I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "To Westminster"—I said, "How long shall you be?"—he said, "About an hour or an hour and half"—he did not come back—I saw no more of him till he was in custody three or four months after—we had been after him for a long time, and I had him put in the "Hue and Cry" as well—I never got the letter, the scrip, or one penny—I have lost about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it.</p>

               <p>believe you must be a freeman of London to be admitted a broker—I am not acquainted with the City—I did not serve my apprenticeship in London—I never did anything before I became a share-jobber—I had money—I decline to say how I got it, as I do not see that it has anything to do with this matter—I was in no occupation or employment before I took to share-jobbing—I was not in any one's service—I first took to share-jobbing in Capel-court—it was at Bristol that I was a member of the Stock Exchange—I did not start there—I am a native of Croydon—my father resides at Lincoln—I was learning the corn business at Lincoln, not in any shop—I went to a gentleman to teach me the corn business—I left Lincoln about five years since—my name is Hitchins—I always understood so—I never laboured under the notion that it was Gibbons—I have gone by the name of Gibbons for about twelve month—I was not called Gibbons in the Hall of Commerce—I went there by my own name—I was never called out by the name of Gibbons there—I have been so addressed by parties in the habit of congregating in Capel-court—I did not tell them my name was not Gibbons, but Hitchins—if they had called me <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Smith, I should have answered them, and for this reason, I knew pretty Well the characters that associated there, and it made no difference to me what they called me—I never called myself the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—this letter of allotment is to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I am not aware that Mr. Gibbons is the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I never knew him by any other name—I never knew him with a broad-brimmed hat and canonicals—it was no business of mine how Gibbons got the shares allotted to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I made no inquiries as to who he was—it was no business of mine, or as to whether there ever was such a person—I got this letter from Mr. Gibbons for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to do what I thought proper with it, either to sell it or to get the scrip—I got it from Gibbons about a month before it was obtained from me by the prisoner—it was in the possession of Mr. Ebenezer Brown, who acted for me as broker occasionally—he had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of mine—I went to him, and got a check from him to pay the deposit—I had not seen Gibbons, I think, for a fortnight or so—I asked him on that occasion if he knew when the deed would be in town—he said he did not—I said, "Well, I should like this done as soon as the deed comes to town, for I don't wish to hold them"—he said it was coming up from the solicitor at Dumfries—it was to be delivered back to Gibbons for the purpose of getting the scrip—I knew no person in the transaction but Gibbons—the deed must be signed before the scrip is obtained—the name of Joseph Fletcher must be put to the deed if the letter of allotment was in that name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Either the real Joseph Fletcher must come, or there must be a forged Joseph Fletcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I know nothing about—I have heard about those things the same as you may have done—I knew Mr. Yeakell by being about the court—I had no dealings with him—I did not supply the funds to defend him when he was tried here for forgery, nor did I employ a solicitor to defend him, or communicate to any solicitor about it—that I swear—I gave the letter to the prisoner for the purpose of Gibbons getting the scrip—I cannot tell whether Gibbons was to sign the deed or who was to do it—if he had done it I should not have asked him whether he had or had not done it—I never thought about whether he would sign it or not—I did not give the prisoner the letter for the purpose of Gibbons signing the deed, that I am aware of—I did not, on my oath, believe that Gibbons would sign the deed—I solemnly swear that—I never thought at all how he was to get the scrip—I have never inquired whether there was such a person as the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have had nothing more to do with it than bringing the prisoner to justice—I am not aware that I have ever received any letters directed to</p>

               <p>the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I have not-never in my life—I swear I never received letters from Mr. Brown directed to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I recollect having some letters from Mr. Brown, but not for the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I do not know the Rev. Joseph Fletcbor—the letters I have received from Mr. Brown were always directed to Hitchins—I swear that—I have applied in my own name for letters of allotment, and I have purchased a great numher in other people's names—I have handed them over to the persons from whom I purchased them, for the purpose of signing the deed, they not being the persons to whom they were allotted—I have not been aware when doing so that I have been handing them over for the purpose of a forgery being committed—I have not known that in dozens of instances they have been handed over, and forgeries have been committed—I have not be<lb></lb>lieved it—I have never given it a moment's consideration—I know there have been investigations about this matter, and that it hat been a great deal talked about—if I pay these parties for their letters am I to ask them whether they are going to forge the deed?—I have not got an office where letters are sent in different names—Mr. Brown is not the person who receives all my letters in different names—he is a highly respectable man, and known by many gentlemen in the City—I know that the deeds must be signed for the purpose of getting the letters of allotment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know they must be forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has nothing to do with me—I made no inquiries about that, and did not care about it—I should have received the scrip although the deed was forged—I had paid for it—I think the parties holding shares have been the sufferers—if I purchase a let<lb></lb>ter I am not compelled to ask a man if he is going to commit a forgery, or how he is to get the scrip—I have heard that there if no such person at the Rev. Joseph Fletcher—I did not know that at the time I handed the letter of allot<lb></lb>ment to the prisoner—I was not informed to by Gibbons—I have never seen the deed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector G.</hi>) In consequence of information given me by the prosecutor, I made inquiries of Mr. Cable, at Ann's-place, Clerkenwell, in Sept.—I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday, the 4th of Jan., about ten o'clock in the evening, at No. 4, Lower Gloucester-street, Clerkenwell—I told him there was a charge against him for obtaining a banker's receipt for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., under false and fraudulent pretences, the property of a gentleman named Hitchins—he was sitting by the fire, in his shirt sleeves—I told him to put on his coat and come with me—he said, "I will; I am very sorry for it; it is a bad job; and I intend to see Mr. Hitchins, or some of my friends, in the course of a fortnight, and come some arrangement</p>

               <p>if we can"—as we were going to the station-house, he said it was a bad job; he had only been home twice, and he had no business to come homes—I had been on the look-out for him, and been to Liverpool after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but was not examined—the prisoner never told me that he had received the receipt from Hitchins, nor that he had given him one—he said he should be able to satisfy the Magistrate wherever we went.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter of allotment was directed to the Rev. Joseph Fletcher, Priory, Ilford.</hi>)</p>

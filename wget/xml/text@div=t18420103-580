                  </hi>. I live near Farnham, in Surrey. On the 27th of November, I was at Mrs. Griffiths's, in Sharp's-alley—the prisoner, who lodged there, laid me a gallon of beer that he had the most money of any body in the house—I said I could not lay a gallon, I would not mind laying a pot, but I would not till I saw what he had got, and he showed me three sovereigns—I said I had not so much as that—I paid for a pot of beer, and then for a pint—I then had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—I had that safe between five and six o'clock on Saturday evening—the prisoner came home, and Mrs. Griffiths asked me to catch hold of him, and help her to throw him down on the bed—we threw him down, and she threw me across him—he then went away, and in about an hour after he was gone I missed my money—I was not down upon him for a minute—he had an opportunity of taking my money out of my pocket—I did not take notice of his doing it—I should know my sovereign again, because it is marked—here arc four sovereigns produced by the officer—this is mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police. I took the prisoner on the 29th of November—I found on him four sovereigns, a half-crown, and a sixpence—I did not see the prosecutrix till the 1st of De<lb></lb>cember, when she came to me, but not on this business—she came on the 2nd again, and I made inquiries about her loss, and asked if she would know her sovereign if she saw it—she said, "Yes," and I showed her the four sovereigns which have been produced to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 89, Thurlow Road, Waltham—previous to January, 1871 I was a member of the Sir Walter Raleigh Lodge of Odd Fellows, held at the Shakespere Tavern, Woolwich—on 7th January, 1871, I sent 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Danvers, the secretary of that lodge, and received this receipt—my subscription was due at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not called at the police-court—I have been a member of the lodge a good many years, and am still—I subscribed to the testimonial when Mr. Danvers resigned—during all the time I have known him he has borne an irreproachable character, and has had the esteem and respect of everybody—I had notice that he was going to resign, from another member; I did not have any notice from the prisoner that he was going to resign and would like to look over the accounts, and if there was any error it was to be rectified—I don't remember that I received any notice to that effect—I think it was before the second examination that I met the prisoner, at Woolwich Arsenal Station—he said he was sorry to see me there, and hoped if I was examined I would make it as easy for him as I could—I began the conversation by saying "I would rather have met you at Margate than here."</p>

               <p>attended on lodge nights occasionally when I was a member and I have seen the prisoner sitting as secretary there—this book, which is called the contribution ledger, is in his writing—Mr. Dubois, an accountant, was appointed to go into these books—I was not present when the trustees applied to the prisoner for any other books—I heard Mr. Chapman, the prisoner's solicitor, make a statement at the police-station with reference, to books—Mr. Pagden was the treasurer in 1871.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner resigned his position of annual secretary Emby was appointed to succeed him, he is here—I know that the society prosecuted him for embezzlement—I was in various offices before the prisoner resigned—I went through the chair—I was never treasurer, I was elective secretary, the duty of elective secretary is to keep the accounts of the receipts and expenditure and to enter the contributions in the book kept for the purpose and to enter the receipts on the cards—Danvers was then annual secretary, he was secretary ever since I have been a member until he resigned—it was part of his duty to have the charge and conduct of the books and papers, attend the lodge meetings, and register the members' names and residences and so forth—other members have duties to perform at the meetings, the noble grand and the vice-grand; it is the duty of the noble grand to open the letters and to hand the members' subscription cards to be signed by the annual secretary or the elective secretary—sometimes the cards would be signed by one and sometimes by the other—the money received in the course of the evening would be handed to Mr. Pagden who was the treasurer then and now, he is a permanent officer and is not elected annually—the money would first be handed to the secretary and he would sign the card—there is a treasurer's book—on 6th April, 1870, this resolution was passed: "We depute the secretary to have all useless books, papers, &amp;c., destroyed"—if there were any blank pages in the books of course they would not be useless books—I can't say when a new set of books was first made use of—a summons was taken out against the prisoner calling upon him to give up possession—it was not heard before a Magistrate and dismissed, it was unheard—I did not obtain the summons, the trustees did—I was not present when it was obtained and did not see it afterwards—he was called upon to give up the Contribution pence book, the treasurer's book, and the night book—it was the prisoner's duty to keep the ledger, that was not one of the books which we say is destroyed, that is in existence for 1871—the nightly pence book is the one that is missing, that is the book from which the contribution ledger would be made up—I don't remember the defendant sending out a circular when he was about to resign or had resigned inviting each member if there were any errors in his account to come and point them out, I have no knowledge of that, this is the first time I have heard of it—there "is" a member named McConnell and he was a member in 1872 when the prisoner resigned, so was Rumsey and Mortice—I was an auditor in 1870—there was no a special auditing of the accounts that I am aware of in 1872 when the prisoner resigned—I was secretary from January to March, 1872—I was at the meeting in July when the prisoner's resignation was accepted, it was at the Shakspeare—there had not then been a subscription amongst the members to present a testimonial to him—I was not the chairman at that meeting in July and I did not make a speech—there was a vote of thanks to him and a testimonial was subsequently presented to him, I was not a subscriber to it—I did not go to the police-court in the</p>

               <p>first instance for the purpose of laying an information and obtaining a warrant, the trustees went—they were Mr. Walker, Mr. Howe, add Mr. Langhatu—I was appointed annual secretary about six months ago, sometime in February, and I have during that time received monies from subscribers and I paid them over myself—I did not pay it over to the elective secretary, I put it in the box—the two of us sit side by side and we both take the money and put it into one box, it is afterwards counted and handed over to the treasurer by one or the other of us—it is the elective secretary's duty to enter all contributions in the night book, I can't say that the book for 1871 is in existence, it is not here—the defendant was absent at times from the lodge during 1871—there are fifty-two lodge meetings in the year—I will swear he was not absent twenty times that year, I can't say that he was not twelve times; he was away at times—I will swear that I did not hear of the prisoner asking before his resignation was accepted that a special audit should be made of all his accounts, I have never heard of it—the entries in the contribution pence book would be made by the annual secretary from minutes which he got at the nightly week meetings and he would take them home and make the entries before the next weekly meeting—the figures in 1872 are Mr. Emby's, I can't say whose the writing is—I should say the names all down the page were written at the same time, but not the amounts—if the prisoner was absent from a lodge meeting he would call the next morning and take the books away with him—he would have the means of making up the book before the next lodge night from the materials that he would get there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If he was absent on a lodge night the nightly pence-book would be there and the address-book; somebody else would do his duty—the materials to make up the books the next day would be the nightly pence book only—a post-office order received at his private address between two lodge meetings would not be any portion of the materials given to him—if he received a post-office order he ought to take it to the lodge at the next meeting—it was his duty to cash post-office orders; they were made payable to him, and all letters sent to his private address would be opened by him—I have seen the nightly pence-book for 1871, when it was in use, but I have not seen it since the prisoner ceased to be secretary, in July, 1872—on quarter nights the two secretaries generally count the money, paid into the box, and they would both do so on other nights if there was a large sum received—sometimes one secretary would take it down to the treasurer, and sometimes the other—the annual secretary kept the treasurer's book, this "balance to next quarter" and the figures, are in the prisoner's writing—he gets the treasurer's receipt on the left side for the amounts which the treasurer receives and puts down, and on the right hand side the prisoner has carried out the balance in his own figures—the contribution pence-book shows the amount received during the whole of the quarter—page 125, is in the prisoner's writing—that book contains a complete list of every member of the lodge, and a page does for six months—the names are all written before the entries were made—that book would show-any arrears.</p>

               <p>meeting and did not bring the money, there was no one to remind him of it—nobody would know anything about it—if he omitted to enter it, it would show an arrear against the contributor—nobody at the club meeting would have any intimation that money was received except the secretary—the majority of contributions were received on quarterly nights, not on week nights—it is the duty of the elective secretary to receive the money and enter it in the night book, and at the end of the meeting he should hand over the night book to the secretary, and the money to the treasurer—we should agree the amount—all the entries are made in the night book, and the total made up—there were three auditors appointed annually—they would have the contribution book and the night book—there were four different elective secretaries during 1871—from the 4th January to the 29th March, J. Emby was elective secretary, and from the 5th April to 28th July, J. Bishop was elective secretary.</p>

I am a professional accountant—about three or four months ago I was employed by the trustees of this lodge to examine the books—I have gone carefully through certain parts to which my attention has been drawn—at page 47 of this account I find the name of Hob-son, a member, at the top of the page—there is no entry there under the date of 4th January or the next date of any receipt of money from Hobson—all the weeks up to the last week of the quarter are left blank—in the last column I find 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as being a payment by Hobson, and there is an entry of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 29th March to another member, John Baker—in the summary on page 48, I find on March 29th, the whole column added up and the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is carried out in the same column as the 85<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as the column now appears it is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2., and that should have been in the summary, instead of that there is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the summary—the total of the figures in the summary for 29th March, is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a sum of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was received from other lodges on 29th March—I find in the ledger at page 125, a penny for pence card, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. surgeon—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the summary, and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. makes a total of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is the exact sum signed for in the treasurer's book—the balance paid off is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find any entry of a payment by Harrington on 11th January of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find under the column of 15th March, an entry of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against his name as if he had paid it on that day—the column with the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in adds up to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the total summary on 15th March is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the same book there is received on account of other lodges 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and pence card and surgeon 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which makes 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 01/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that is the amount which the prisoner has entered in the treasurer's book and received the receipt for; so, that reckoning the summary to be true, when you add it up it comes to the excessive sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 01/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no entry on the 5th April of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Thomas Wife—there is no entry at all to his credit until 29th June, when it is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the summary with that in adds up to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the total column of the 28th June is added up as 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the column entered against Samuel Warsap, another member—the figures in the column add up to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the summary has got Is. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the total summary is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the ledger for other lodges, and in the treasurer's book as having been paid on 28th June there is entered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., although the summary makes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been treasurer since the lodge was held at my house in January, 1870—during the whole of the period I have known Mr. Danvers he has always borne a character for honour and integrity—these lodges were held at my house—I have never attended one of the meetings—they bring the money downstairs to me; it was not always brought down by the same person sometimes a man named Bishop, sometimes Emby—I believe they were elective secretaries, but I am sure I don't know—I don't suppose I received the money from Danvers half-a-dozen times during the time he was secretary—I believe Danvers was absent for several weeks during 1871 on his employer's business, as far as my memory can go back—he was formerly in her Majesty's service and resigned, and subsequently in the employment of a highly respectable firm of upholsterers in Woolwich.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the trustees of this lodge—Davis is now acting as secretary, and the booksare in his custody—I have had a conversation with the prisoner with reference to the absence of the nightly pence-book which was in use during the time he was secretary—I can't remember the date, but I hare asked him about it on two or three occasions—he told me he had destroyed it, and I told him he should not have done so—this is the minute-book of the lodge meetings of 1871; it is in the prisoner's writing. and it was generally written at the time of the meeting—I find his handwriting there on the 4th January, 1871—the book would not give us an account of when he was absent, because he might do the writing at home—I don't see the writing of anyone else between 4th and 15th January—if anyone acted as secretary for him he should make the entries—Mr. Davis has nothing whatever to do with this prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In the absence of the annual secretary some one could take a minute for him on paper, no doubt, and when the secretary returns he would make the entries in the books from the minutes on paper—all the minute-book is in the prisoner's writing—I am one of the trustees under the constitution of the society—there was a resolution that the secretary should be empowered to destroy all useless books—the nightly pence-book would not be a useless book; that was one of the books in use, but it was not included in the resolution—when the resolution was passed the prisoner had the books in his own keeping—I had no conversation with him previous to the destruction of any books as regards their destruction—I am not aware that I had any conversation with him at any time with reference to going to Bow—I never had any conversation with him as to which books</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> The amount would be ascertained by the two secretaries, and would be signed for by the treasurer the same evening in the book—the annual secretary had the custody of that book.</p>

The resolution as to the destrucion of useless books and papers came to be passed because the box was full of old quarterly reports, old magazines, pence-cards, and many papers, and there was not room to put the necessary things away, and they were understood to be the useless books, not the account books of the society.</p>

I was appointed one of the auditors in 1872, and it was ray business to go through the books with reference to the preceding twelve months, ending December, 1871—my attention has been called to the summary column at page 48 of the Contribution Book—the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 29th March, is brought forward in that summary—the column at page 47 agreed with that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., when I audited the accounts—that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in the column when I audited the account—I compared the summaries with the totals and they tallied.</p>

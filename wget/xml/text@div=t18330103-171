             and his wife occupied the front parlour of that house. On the 31st of October I gave the prisoner authority to call on them for a week's rent, and if they did not pay, to distrain for it; but I never-authorized him to break any lock, or to injure any poor people; I had been there on the morning of Tuesday and Wednesday, and the shutters were not down - I believe Simmonds was out - it was on the Wednesday I told the prisoner to call, and I gave him authority in writing - I never received any money from the prisoner; he never told me he had a table, nor had seen one - he said he knew nothing about it, and said he had not broken the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You signed this paper as an authority for him to distrain? A. Yes, my Lord; he never gave me any intimation that he had distrained - he said he knew nothing at all about the table, and he never offered to pay me the 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I admit I have not paid the money, but will you be kind enough to tell the Court whether there is a running account between us; I have been employed by him before and since, for which there has been no settlement. Witness. I think he has done business for me for six or seven years; I believe I have employed him since that.</p>

            . I am married, but have not lived with my husband for twelve months. I know Simmonds' lodging: I saw the prisoner there on the 31st of October, with another man, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon; they had a mahogany table, with two flaps, and were carrying it by the two ends - they were taking it out of the room door nearest the street door; this is the table - I had seen it there before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the street door open? A. Yes; I cannot tell what dress you had on - you had spectacles on; you sat next to me at Bow street, and said to me,"Let you and I make matters up, and not perjure one another;" I never saw you before, to my knowledge - I did live in King-street, but I do not know that you distrained upon me there; I have not seen you many times before - I do not remember spending the evening at a dance in Wych-street, where you saw me and spoke to me; I have been obliged to walk Leicester-square.</p>

            . I occupied the front parlour in Mr. Avery's house; there was one door fronting the passage, which was our entrance, and another which parted the two rooms, and that door was locked and papered over. I and my wife went out about eleven o'clock on the 31st of October - I had this table on my premises; it is worth 30s.; there were half a dozen chairs, nearly new, and some other tables; he took the best - when I went out I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030099"></xptr>locked the door, and gave the key to my wife; I came home about eight o'clock in the evening - the middle door had been broken open, and splintered, and this table was gone - I went to Mr. Avery's, but did not see him; I went to the prisoner's several times, but never saw him; he was always denied - I at last saw him, on the 8th of November, when he came to me, and asked for two weeks' rent which were due - I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the table; he denied all knowledge of it: I showed him how the place was broken, and told him if he would send Mr. Avery I would pay him - we had at that time a large bill on the shutter, offering a reward for the table; the prisoner asked me if I thought he was such a d-d fool as to enter into such an affair as that; I told him I knew him to be a rogue, and I thought he had got my table; on Saturday, the 10th of November, I got a search warrant, and went with two officers to his premises, in Bear-street: we knocked - a young man made his appearance in the passage, and prevented me from going in for some time; the officers produced the warrant, and forced an entrance; we went up into the warehouse, and found this table concealed under a lot of old bed furniture - the prisoner was in the warehouse, and before we found the table they asked him about it, and he denied knowing any thing about it: he was taken to the office -Mr. Minshull directed him to come to the office again at seven o'clock; he did not come - he was taken in Compton-street, the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any notice left on your premises that the table had been removed? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You state you searched my premises; do you know where I live? A. In Dean-street, I believe; the Magistrate told you to go about your business - he said he should know where to find you; I do not know that any young man came and said you were gone in search of the landlord - you did attend afterwards, and ran away again; I desired that the landlord should be produced - I did not hear you do it; I did not see the landlord the last time when Mr. Halls was sitting - there was a good deal of old rubbish in your warehouse; I did not see any thing like my table: my table was the only one that was covered up.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure that before you found it, he denied that he had it? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not find the outer door open? A. Yes, but you was denied; you were in your working-dress - I believe this case was three times before the Magistrate; I came the last time to give you notice to attend - I did not take you into custody.</p>

            . I called on Mrs. Simmonds on the evening of the 31st of October, and in consequence of what she said I called on the prisoner - I saw him in a little bit of a counting-house, in his house in Dean-street; I asked if he had made any seizure on Mrs. Simmonds; he said he had not received any instructions - I said there was a table lost; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not represent yourself as an attorney. A. Yes, because you have represent yourself as such many times; I told you I should get a warrant, as I had reason to believe you had it - I knew you was difficult to get at; you pointed up to your books, and asked, if I thought you were such a d-d fool as to do that - I wrote down my address and gave it you, and then I tore it up; the Magistrate said to the prosecutor "There is your table, you had better drop it" - I did not hear you offer the table to pay the rent and expenses - you did not tell me that if Mr. Simmonds had any thing to say, he should come and say it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure he denied knowing any thing about the table? Yes.</p>
               <p>The distress-warrant was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I admit being denied, but I had a reason for it - I was looking over some dirty goods, and was not in a dress fit to see gentlemen, but when the officer said he had a warrant, I said, "Let him come up, be he who he may;" and when he came up and asked for a table, I said, "If there is any table you want, take it."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KING. I know the warehouse in Bear-street; it belongs to the prisoner's father - it was the prisoner's before it was his - I have been in the habit of going there; I believe the signature to this inventory is his.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SEAL. I signed this paper - I signed it at the prisoner's request.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What are you? A. A licensed appraiser; I was sworn on this occasion by Wilson, the constable, at the warehouse, in Bear-street, where this table was brought out to me to examine and value - I believe it to be worth about 16s.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE COOK. I am a furniture-broker, and am a juror in waiting - this table is worth 1l. 1s.; to sell again, it would fetch at an auction 24s. or 25s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Brundell, and, live at No. 24, Agnes-street, Waterloo-road, Lambeth. My husband is in the em<lb></lb>ploy of Mr. Patrick, a builder, in Belvedere-road, Lambeth, and has been so about ten or eleven months—on the 27th of Aug. last I was about a fort<lb></lb>night and two or three days after my confinement—Mrs. Cooper, my nurse, had not left me—between two and three o'clock that day a knock came to the street-door—the nurse answered it, and in consequence of a communication from her, I told her to ask the persons down stairs—the prisoner Weston came down into the kitchen, and said, "Are you aware where your husband is?"—I said I hoped he was at his work—he said no, he was not at his work, he was taken from his work into custody, concerning something that had been lost from Mr. Patrick's, his employer—he took a paper out of his pocket, with two large seals on it, and a deal of writing—he handed it to me—I did not take it into my hand—I was in such a fright I could not read it—he folded it up and put it into his pocket again—we went up stairs after that, into the lodger's room—he requested me to go—he looked round, and asked for the keys of the boxes—I said I had not the keys of the boxes—he said he was a police-officer in private clothes, that he had come in private clothes as he did not wish to frighten me, as I was in such ill health—as I was going up stairs I noticed Coopre standing at the door—he had his hand on the latch, and his foot against the door—Weston told me that he was a person from the em<lb></lb>ploy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210154"></xptr>
               <p>of Mr. Patrick, one of the firm—we went into two rooms up stairs—the boxes were locked—he said, "It is very strange, very strange indeed; what part of the house do you hold?"—I said, "Only the lower part, we let all the other part out"—we went down stairs again into the kitchen—as I went down I noticed Cooper still at the door, in the same position as when we had left him—we went down stairs into the bed-room, and he wished to see what papers and property I had—I opened a drawer—it contained only clothes—we opened another—there were only a few odds and ends—he took nothing from there—the next drawer was locked—he requested the key—I asked the nurse to bring them to me, which she did—I unlocked the drawer, and there was a little cash-box in there—he took it out—I told him there were no papers in there concerning Mr. Patrick, the money which was in the box we had put by to pay the rent and taxes—he desired me to unlock the box—I did so, and he took the money out of the box—it was in a green silk purse—there was twelve sovereigns and a half in it—he put it on the end of the drawers—he wished to know if I had any papers or property anywhere—I told him I had some papers in the cupboard—I took them out—he took them off the file, and laid them with the money—he said it was very strange, he did not know what to do; he could not find the property belong<lb></lb>ing to Mr. Patrick; he must write a letter for me to take to the station-house—he had a sheet of paper, which the nurse gave him out of the drawer—he turned on to the dresser in the front kitchen, and scribbled something on the paper, which I thought was a letter—he asked the nurse for a candle, and while she was getting it, he said, "Are you certain that you have no more property anywhere, jewellery, or anything concealed?"—I said, "I have a little box of jewellery, but nothing of consequence"—the nurse went and fetched it out of the bed-room, out of a little drawer—on that being brought, he said, "You ought to have brought this out before; did not I ask you for all your property? "—that box contained two brooches, a pair of coral drops, a little cross, a silver locket, and two wedding-rings—the box was placed in the end of the drawers, with the money—Weston also took half a dozen silver teaspoons out of my workbox in the front kitchen—it was open—I then prepared to go to the station-house—he sealed the letter with his own seal, which he took out of his pocket—when I was ready, I told him I did not think I was able to go to the station-house, the baby was crying—he said, "Don't be in a hurry, you can suckle the baby first"—I was in such a fright I could not, and I went up-stairs—he said, "The young man that is in the employ of Mr. Patrick will allow you to take his arm"—he called Cooper down, and whispered something to him—he was up at the street-door at the time—what Weston said to me was not in his hearing—he called him down directly after—I was then in the front kitchen, putting my boots on—I did not see him come down—as I was going up-stairs I came back again, and said to Weston, "I leave every<lb></lb>thing in your care"—he said, "They shall be all safe; you shall have everything returned to you quite safe"—I then went out with Cooper—we went up Agnes-street, and turned round Vine-street, by the Hero of Waterloo public-house—Vine-street runs along by the side of the Hero of Waterloo—the Waterloo-road faces the street—as we came near the Hero of Waterloo, Cooper said he was going in there for an officer, and we three would go down to the station-house together—I waited for him about three or four minutes, and felt so faint I hardly knew how to stand—I had not been out of the house before—finding he did not return, I went into the Hero of Waterloo and looked round—I could not see anything of him—I came out again, and stood in the Waterloo-road two or three minutes, considering what I should do, go to the station-house or return home—I felt so ill I returned home, and as I was going</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210156"></xptr>
               <p>along I thought to myself they were thieves—I went home as fast as I could, but I was very ill, and could not go very fast—I found the street-door open—I ran down-stairs, and asked my nurse if the man was in the house that I had left there—she said, "I don't know; he was here just this minute, walk<lb></lb>ing in the passage"—I went into the bed-room—Weston was gone, and all the property I have mentioned, purse and everything—the bed-room is the back-kitchen—I gave the letter to Mrs. Courtney, who occupies the parlours, to take to the station-house—I never saw Jackson during any part of this transaction—he had lodged in the same house in which we had apartments, at No. 43, Agnes-street—I know him very well, and his father also—his mother nursed me with my second child—I have had three, but my first died—I saw Jackson the night Cooper was taken to the station, which was on the Monday after the robbery—he was standing in the yard—he was in custody with Cooper—Mrs. Courtney gave him in charge—he had a wedding<lb></lb>ring on his finger—Sergeant Langley tried to get it off, but did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham. I was Mrs. Brundell's nurse during her late confinement—on the 27th of Aug. last, between two and three o'clock in the day, nearly three o'clock, a knock came at the door—I answered it, and Weston and Cooper were there—they wished to speak to Mrs. Brundell—Weston spoke—I said I did not know that he could speak to her, but I would go and ask her—he said he must speak to her, for he had some very particular business—I went to ask her if she could speak to them, and they walked in after me, and shut the door after them—I spoke to Mrs. Brundell, and before I bad time to return Weston followed me down stairs into the front kitchen, to Mrs. Brundell—she was not keeping her bed, but sitting in the front kitchen, which was the sitting-room—I neard him say to Mrs. Brundell that he was come on very particular business—I went into the back kitchen on hearing that—I afterwards came into the front kitchen, and asked Mrs. Brundell what was the matter—she said she could hardly tell me what was the matter—Weston was there then—they went up stairs—I did not go up stairs with them—when they came down again they went into the back kitchen—I did not go in whilst they were there—I heard the money jink, but I did not know what the meaning of it was—when they came out of the bed-room, Weaton asked for a sheet of paper to write a letter—I gave him paper, pen, and ink, sealing-wax, and a candle—he wrote the letter, and sealed it—he got the seal from his waistcoat-pocket—I heard him ask about writings and other property—Mrs. Brundell said she had but very little of jewellery, or anything of that—he said why had she not told him what she had before, for everything must be brought to court—she told me to get the keys, and go and get the jewellery, which I did, and gave it to Weston—he gave it me back again—I went and put it on the corner of the drawers, with the money and other articles—he gave the letter to Mrs. Brundell—he then wanted to know if there were any more writings anywhere, and Mrs. Brundell recollected she had a few old letters in her work-box—she gave me the keys to unlock her work-box to get them out—there was half a dozen silver tea-spoons in the box—he gave them to me to take to the drawers and put with the other things—Mrs. Brundell then put on her things to go to the station—he asked her about going to the station with this letter—I said she was not able to go by herself, without somebody to assist her, and he said his friend, the gentleman who was up stairs, would assist her there—I asked if he would allow her to take hold of the gentleman's arm—he said, O yes, for he had come from the firm where her husband was at work, and he would assist her there—he called to the other party to come down—I did not hear what name he called, or what he said—he whispered something on the stairs—I think when he called him, he said, "Here," but I will not be sure what it was—Mrs. Brundell and Cooper then went off to go to the station—Weston did not remain in the kitchen many minutes after they were gone—he went into the bed-room—I had occasion to go out into the yard, and saw him picking up the money, and putting it into a green purse—he put it into his pocket—the silver spoons he put into his coat pocket, and the box of jewel<lb></lb>lery in his waistcoat—he afterwards came into the room where I was and sat down on the table—the eldest child was crying, and he talked to it, and tried to pacify it—he gave it a halfpenny, and said, "Do not cry, your mother will soon be back again"—he had not been there long when Mrs. Courtney came down into the kitchen, and he went out into the passage, but he walked as many as three times along the little passage, between the kitchen and stair<lb></lb>case, before he went up stairs. I do not know what became of him after<lb></lb>wards—he was gone when Mrs. Brundell returned.</p>

I returned to the carriage; I saw my master's coat was gone; I went to the first turning, which is Redcross-street. I saw a man going along with my coat, I called stop thief; I ran up to him, and told him he had stolen my master's box-coat. He said a man pulled it off the box, and he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him - A. No. He returned to the public-house; a constable was fetched; he has the coat.</p>

About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th of February, I saw the prisoner at my shop—I to quite sure it was him—he bought a penny loaf, and threw a four-penny-piece on the counter—I gave him change, and he went off—before he was out of sight I discovered that it was bail—I bent it, and marked it—it had never been out of my hands—I put it with some other money, after I had bent and cut it—the next day I was called into my shop by Ann Mann, my servant—I saw the prisoner there, and Mann gave me a shilling—I examined it, and pronounced it bad—I said to the prisoner, "I recollect you perfectly, you were here yesterday; I took a four penny piece of you"—he denied that he was at my shop the day before—I sent for the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Willson, a baker, in Judd-street West, New-road. On the 12th of May I left my shop about four o'clock, and went to look after the tea—there was a looking-glass safe on a chest of drawers in the shop when I went down—I was down about three minutes—when I came back it was gone—the prisoner was brought back soon after with it—this is my glass—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the back of the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner going out with this glass under his arm—I know it is the property of Mr. Willson—I live in the same house.</p>

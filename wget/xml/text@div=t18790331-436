               <p>March, at 9.30, from a description given me by the inspector at a lodging house, 16, Mint Street—Walsh said "We want you for passing bad money "—he said "It is not me you want"—we took him to the station—he was placed with four or five others, and just before the prosecutrix was called in he turned his collar up, pressed his hat over his eyes, and put both hands in his pockets—she then walked up and down the row, looked at the last man in the corner, and said "I think it was like this young man"—I called the prisoner up to the window and said "Show the inspector your hands "—he did so, and the prosecutorix said "That is the young man, I will swear to him, I know him by his eyes and his voice, as well as by his hand"—he had spoken then; he had said "It is all over, I have done you, Walsh, I have done you again"—he was then charged, and said "l am not the man."</p>

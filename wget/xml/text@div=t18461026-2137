                  </hi>. I am an attorney's clerk, and live at Walworth. On the 1st of Oct., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was looking into a shop window in Gracechurch-street—the officer spoke to me, and I found I had lost my pocket-handkerchief—I saw him take it from Barry's jacket—this is it.</p>

On that afternoon, about quarter-past three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners feeling and fumbling about the pockets of persons in the crowd—I watched them for about twenty minutes—I saw Barry <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to Mr. Gibson, and take this handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it into his own—Maloney was with him and covering him.</p>

I saw the two prisoners try several people's pockets—at last Barry tried the prosecutor's pocket, and Maloney squeezed up to him—I saw Barry take the handkerchief—I had seen the prisoners together at twelve o'clock—I produce another handkerchief, which I found round Maloney's neck—I had seen him at twelve o'clock with a different handkerchief on.</p>

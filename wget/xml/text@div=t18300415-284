               <p>MESSRS. SCARLETT and ELLIS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STARR. I keep the Cross Keys public-house, Wood-street, Cheapside. On the 6th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and asked for a glass of spruce and the newspaper - I gave him the spruce, and directed him to the coffee-room to read the paper; he gave me a shilling in payment, I gave him a sixpence and 4d. - I afterwards found it was a bad shilling; he was then gone - I thought he was in the coffee-room, but he had not gone there at all; I threw the shilling, into the fire, and it melted down like lead almost immediately - on Saturday, the 13th of March, he came about the same hour, and asked for a glass of spruce and the newspaper; I left my man to serve him - I recognized him and said, "You are the very man who gave me the bad shilling last week;" he then offered me a good one for it - he had not paid me any thing that night; I called in the constable who took him - he paid a good half-crown for what he had, and as the constable took him into the room he dropped a shilling, which I marked and gave to Earl, observing that it was a bad one; I am certain it dropped from him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Cripplegate. I received the prisoner in charge about seven o'clock in the evening - as I took him from the bar to the parlour, to search him more conveniently, a shilling dropped on the ground; I have every reason to believe it fell from him -I found in his waistcoat pocket twelve counterfeit shillings and four good sixpences, wrapped in a piece of rag and then in paper.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Mint. The shilling produced is counterfeit, it is Britannia metal, not worth a farthing; the twelve others are also counterfeit, and cast in the same mould - Britannia metal weighs rather more than one-fourth less than silver.</p>

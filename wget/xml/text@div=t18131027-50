               <p>Q. Have they a stable on their wharf - A. Yes; they keep horses in their business; the gateway to the wharf is always open, and the stable door is generally open; the sack, horse-cloth, and girth, were taken from their stable. Read saw them take them. I laid hold of the prisoner in the street. I saw him come out of the stable, and out of the yard. I laid hold of him in Derby-street; I told him I thought he had robbed the stable; he said, no. This was about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 20th of October. He had a sack on his back; in the sack was a horse-cloth, and a girth. I took him into the accompting-house, and sent for an officer.</p>

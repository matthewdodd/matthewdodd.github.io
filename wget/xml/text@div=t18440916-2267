                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Israel Foster, of Islington. On the 21st of Aug. I saw the prisoner—I am sure it was him—he was run<lb></lb>ning from our shop—when I saw him first he was about thirty yards from the shop, and another person was with him—I saw the prisoner throw these two boots down—I am sure of that—I had before that called "Stop thief," and "Police"—I picked up the boots—they are my master's—I was examined before the Magistrate, and what I said was read over to me.</p>

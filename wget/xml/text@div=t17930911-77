               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. On your oath will you say that you was sober when you went to bed? - I was no ways to be called in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what sort of a house this was before you went in? - When I went in I thought they were very creditable people in the house, because they told me that Mr. and Mrs. Misslebroke were dead.</p>

I am employed by Mr. James Murray, a farmer, at Old Ford, to look after his stock—I turned out a roan mare of his on Epping Forest, last Sunday week, the 10th of Sept.—she had been blistered on the two hind legs lately before—I went to look for her on the Thursday following, but could not find her—I saw her on the Friday following at Mr. Murray's.</p>

I saw the prisoner last Wednesday week, at Romford market—he had a horse exposing in the market for sale—I had never seen him before—I asked what he wanted for the horse—he said he had sold it for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but the party would not have it afterwards—I said I would have it for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as he only came from Hackney, it was not far for him to come to my house for the money—he told me he came from Hackney, and gave me his address, which I have here, which is correct—"Henry Whipps, No. 6, Nichol—street, Margaret—street, Hackney—fields"—I said I would give him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his extra trouble, for I did not much like it, as the horse was fresh blistered—I gave him one of my cards, and one I tore in halves, and told him pro<lb></lb>vided he brought me that half—card, and a letter saying he came honestly by the horse, or brought me the party he had it from, I would pay him—he after wards brought me this letter—"Dear Sir,—Please let the bearer have the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for J. Williams, No. 10, Great Ormond—yard, Queen—square, Blooms<lb></lb>bury"—I did not give him the money—I said I would call, or otherwise write a letter—I wrote a letter to William, and had no answer—my letter was sent back—they called on the Friday evening, to know whether I had had any an<lb></lb>swer—I said, "Yes, I have got an answer for you; you must go down with me to the police"—he said, "Very well," and went with me very wil<lb></lb>lingly—I left it to the discretion of the police whether they would take him in charge or no, and they did not—I kept the mare from Wednesday till Friday evening, when Mrs. Murray came for it, and I gave it to her.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I apprehended the prisoner last Monday morning, in Smithfield—I told him I came to him respecting a mare that he had sold to Mr. Monk—he said "I am looking for him"—I said, "Looking for who?"—he said, "The man I had her from"—I said, "Don't you know the man?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Where did you first meet with him?"—he said, "Over there, opposite the Black Bull"—I said, "What do you mean, in the house?"—he said, "No, outside"—I asked how he became acquainted with him—he said he was passing there, he had come to Smithfield to look for a job—I said, "What, are you in the habit of driving cattle then?"—he said, "No"—I asked if he was in the habit of dealing in horses—he said no he was not—he then said, "I will tell you all about it"—I said, "You had better be cautious, because I don't know but what I shall have to take</p>

               <p>you into custody"—he then said, that while passing by the side of the Black Bull, two men were in conversation together, one man said to the other "I will do it for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and no leas," the man replied he would give him half-a-crown and no more; with that the men separated—he walked up to the one who remained, and told him he would do it for half-a-crown—I asked him if he knew at that time what he was to do for the half-crown—he said no, but the man told him afterwards, it was to take three horses down to Romford, that he did not want them taken down then, but on the following Wednesday, and he would give him the half-crown, and that he must bring a halter with him—that on the following Wednesday he met the man in the same spot—he was then sitting on a rail, and he had only the mare that he sold to Monk with him—he told him he had told the other two, but he was to take that one down to Romford, and sell it for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would give him the same for selling that one that he was to have given him for the three—he said he took it down to Romford, and sold it to Monk, who refused to pay him and told him to go to him next morning, and he would pay him—that he went to Smith field market on the Thursday morning, and found the man in the same place he had seen him in on the previous morning—he told the man he had sold the horse to Monk for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if he went to Monk he could receive the money—the man said he could not go, but told him to go and say he was ill—that he went back to Monk's, and Monk told him he would not pay him unless he gave the person's name and address—he said be then went back to Smithfield, and found the man in the same place where he had left him—that he told him Monk refused to pay without a note from him—that he and the man then walked from Smithfield to the other side of Bethnal-green—they turned down a bye-street, and went to a public-house—he did not know the name of the street or house, that when they got there the man pulled half a sheet of paper out of his pocket, and told him to go into the public-house, and write the same as was written on the note that he sent to Mr. Monk—he said he did so, and came out, and showed it to him—he said it would do very well, ordered him to take it to Monk's, and said, "I will walk back to Smithfield—you get the money, and bring it to me, and you will find me in the same place again"—he said when, he took the letter to Monk's, Monk said he was going to the Edgeware-road, and he would call and pay him—that the following morning he went, and met the man in the same place, and asked him if he had seen Monk—he said no; that he had not been to him, and he was to go again to Monk's for the money, and meet him there—that when he went to Monk's again, Monk told him the horse was owned, and wished him to go to the station—that he went to the station, and told them nearly the same as he had told me—he said after that be went back to Smithfield, but could not find the man—that be then went to Great Ormond-yard, where the man had given the address in the note, and found there was no such person living there, and he could not hear anything of him—he said he never saw the man before the transaction, he never knew anything of him, and had not the slightest clue to him—I then took him into custody.</p>

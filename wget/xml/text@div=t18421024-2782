                  </hi>. I work on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Hydra,</hi> in the West India Docks—the prisoner was employed on board. On the morning of the 8th of October I went on board at half-past six o'clock, and went into the hold to get some gravel to <hi rend="italic">holystone</hi> the quarter-deck—the prisoner came on board about seven, looked down the main hatchway, and said, "Is that lazy fellow there?" meaning me—I made no answer—I filled my bucket half full of gravel—I had a line made fast to it—the prisoner pulled it half way up the hold, and then let it drop again on my toes—he said that the mate had promised me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I got forward, and if I got 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it would be plenty for me—I came up out of the hold on to the quarter-deck, seized hold of him, and said, "If you won't keep your tongue off me, I will give you a slap in the mouth"—I shook him—he said, "You</p>

               <p>forget yourself, you had best mind what you are about," and he picked up the carpenter's hammer to strike me—I took it out of his hand, and he directly picked up a five-inch spike-nail from between the fore and aft hatchway—I had not got the hammer in my hand then—I had dropped it—I cannot say whether he could see that I dropped it—he struck me with the spike-nail down the neck—I twisted it out of his hand—he then took the carpenter's chisel off the bench, and stabbed me in the breast with it—it penetrated through my waistcoat—I was not much hurt—it bled a very little—it was not done with much violence—it would have hurt me much more if it had been done with violence.</p>

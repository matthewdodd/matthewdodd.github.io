On 16th Nov., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Bishopsgate-street; my attention was called by my sergeant to Mr. Hawkins's premises; I went to the front entrance, and rang the bell—it was answered by Page, Mr. Hawkins's warehouseman—I went in and searched the premises—I went through the, shop, and into the warehouse in the rear of the premises, and on the second floor of the warehouse I discovered Williams—he was in the act of opening a window in front of the warehouse, which leads on to some leads which communicate to the dwelling house of Mr. Hawkins—I secured him, and then took a survey of the premises—I found an entrance had been effected through the roof of the warehouse—the tiles had been taken off, so that a man could pass through the rafters into the warehouse—I took Williams to the station—when I took him, he said, It is all up with me; I know you, Fisher.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 82). I received some information from Wheeler, and in consequence I went to Catharine Wheel-alley—I waited there two or three minutes; I heard something in an adjoining yard at the rear of Mr. Orpwood's premises, which is six doors from Mr. Hawkins's—on hearing the noise I got a ladder, and got on the top of a wall—I saw a man on the top of a warehouse adjoining Mr. Orpwood's premises, but on the other side from me—between Mr. Hawkins's and Mr. Orpwood's, I could not tell who that man was.</p>

I was on duty at 2 o'clock in the morning, on 16th Nov.; I heard a noise in Mr. Orpwood's yard—I went to the back door, put it on one side, and I saw Wells standing in the yard—I forced the door open, and laid hold of him—it is a temporary door, it did not properly hang—he said, I am done now—I took him to the station, and found on him a pocket book and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I was called up by the policeman—on the night previous I had seen the warehouse at 8 o'clock, it was all safe then—on being awoke in the morning, I went with the policeman round the premises—the tiles had been taken off, and there was a hole in the roof—I saw William found on the premises—I know Mr. Orpwood's premises, they are six houses off our place—the back premises join all along; a man can creep from one to the other.</p>

On the morning of 16th Nov., I looked out at my window immediately after I was alarmed; I found a window broken, and I saw marks on the wall, as if some one had got over and broken off part of the wood work in getting down to the yard—the end is a wooden building, and part of the wood was broken—a person to get to Mr. Hawkins's must get over this wall, and they would have to get over roofs and warehouses—a person could get to Mr. Hawkins's by keeping the roofs.</p>

I said, "Yes"—I do not recollect exactly what he said to the prisoner—all I can remember is, that he told her to turn her pockets out—she said she had no objection to be searched—she said she had property of her own—Mr. Herring told the porter to go for a policeman—when he was gone, four sovereigns and one farthing were produced on the table—I cannot recollect who produced them—I was flurried, and did not see them put on the table—the prisoner repeated that she had property of her own, and would not be guilty of such a thing—I said, "That is my money"—she said, how could I say so, when she had money of her own—when the money was produced, I said there was one sovereign, one half-crown, one sixpence, and one halfpenny wanting—I asked her where the purse was—she said she had thrown it into the back kitchen—I asked her where about—she said she did not know, somewhere about—I took a light, and she went with me into the back</p>

On the 6th of December, I went down into the kitchen in conse<lb></lb>quence of hearing of the loss of the money—I found the servant, the pri<lb></lb>soner, and the porter there—I asked the prisoner whether she knew any thing about it—she said she had not seen the money, she supposed the servant must have dropped it—the porter wished to search her—I requested him not to do so, as she might not know any thing of it, but said if she wished to clear herself, she would not object to take her pocket off, and show what money she had—she said she had not the least objection, and took her money out of her pocket—she produced four sovereigns, some halfpence, and a farthing (I had sent the porter for a policeman before this) the pri<lb></lb>soner laid the money on the table, and said it was her own, that she had had some money left her by her father some time before—I said it was not impossible, her father might have left her the money, but if she had the purse, she had better produce it—she said she did not know any thing of the purse at all—she walked about the kitchen, and I observed her pot something down on the cupboard, but at that moment I did not see what it was—I went to the place, and found a sovereign, which made up the amount missed—a few minutes after, the policeman came in, and I gave her in charge—before that I asked her if she had taken the money from the drawer—she said, "It was I who took it," and begged I would not take any notice of it, that it was the first time she had committed such an offence, and begged I would not give her in charge—she afterwards took her pocket off at my desire—I cannot remember whether a halfcrown was produced—the money she produced I delivered to the policeman.</p>

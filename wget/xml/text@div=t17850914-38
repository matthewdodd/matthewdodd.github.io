               <p>Are you sure that no other person had not been in the place till you broke it open? - No, nobody ever was in the place.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay in the place? - She had her dinner, and she made her a dish of tea; and between seven and eight she came down, and said, she was going to help her husband with a box.</p>

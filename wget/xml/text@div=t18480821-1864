                  </hi>. I live at 5, London-passage, St. Luke's. On Sunday, 6th Aug., between one and two o'clock, I saw the deceased with the prisoner, in London-passage—she appeared very much in liquor, and was trying to get away from the prisoner, who held her by the left arm, and he struck her on the left side of the head with his closed fist—she immediately fell by the right side of the prisoner—I said to the prisoner that he had killed the woman—he said, what was that to do with me, I seemed to know all about it—he then assisted in getting her up again, by laying hold of her arm, and some other people assisted—when he got her up, he placed her against a wall with rail-ings, and he shook her rather violently, apparently to bring her to—he looked in her face—he did not seem to think she was so far gone as she was—she appeared perfectly insensible—when he shook her, her head came in contact with the railings, but not sufficient to cause death or a bruise—she had no strength in her neck, and her head fell about—she was taken to No. 8—I saw her about ten or twelve minutes after, and she was then dead.</p>

On Sunday, 6th Aug., about half-past one, I came out, in consequence of hearing a noise, and saw the prisoner and his wife—she was lying on the ground, with her back against the wall, which has an iron railing on the top of it—the prisoner picked her up by her two arras, stood her on her feet, with her back against the wall, and said, "Stand up"—I do not know whether he did that care<lb></lb>fully—he then took hold of her shoulders, and shook her rather roughly—the back part of her head stuck in between the railing—her head seemed to hang down a little as he raised her up—it appeared as if her neck was not strong enough to hold her head up—she slid down again, and he pressed his knee against her stomach—she was standing—she fell on the ground, and he walked away—I said, "You brute to illuse the woman like that"—he turned round and said, "Look at the dirty <hi rend="italic">fagot</hi> "—I think he meant the woman—I afterwards went into the house—she was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 6th Aug., about half-past one, I was called to the deceased—she appeared dead, but I was not quite certain—I had her removed into a house, and opened a vein—a very few drops of blood flowed—I could find no external marks of violence—on 19th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Courtnay—there was a great extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood at the base of the brain—the larger quantity was on the left side—it appeared to arise from the rupture of a blood-vessel—a blow with a clenched fist on the left side of the head would be likely to produce it—it night not have left an external mark—the brain was not very healthy—a blow to a subject of that kind, though not very violent, might rupture a blood-vessel—the extravasation of blood was the immediate cause of death—the brain was slightly congested, so that less violence would produce serious consequences.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The brain was very much diseased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was of long standing—I imagine from the effluvia, she had been drinking all the morning—if she had been very drunk, the exertion of walking would not be so likely to produce extravasation as if she had fallen down—if she had resisted a person, it is possible the excitement would have caused it, but not so probable as a blow—if her head fell back against the railings, that would very likely cause it.</p>

            . On the 18th of October, I found a piece of leather in the warehouse, on the top of the privy, that was in the warehouse; I informed my father of it. On the Wednesday following the men in the warehouse were called together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of your men. - A. Yes, he was; he had lived with us near six years. A piece of leather was shewn to the men, they were all asked if they knew any thing about it, and they all said they did not; they were all asked if they were agreeable to let their houses be searched, they all said they were; I then went to the whole of their houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's among the rest. - A. I did; and there I found this piece of leather along with several other pieces; I came back and told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man with you when you found it. - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it. - A. There is the currier's mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular mark upon it. - A. I can swear to that mark having other leather like it.</p>

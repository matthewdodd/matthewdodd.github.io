On 11th May I was on duty in George-street, Richmond, and about half-past six in the morning saw the prisoner, with an iron stock on his shoulder—I followed him to Marsh-gate—he said it was his own, and he had brought it from Hounslow that morning, where he had slept at the side of a hay-rick, and he was carrying it about to show tradesmen that he was capable of making such a thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Deptford—the prisoner was my carman. On the 21st of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I went to my foreman's counting-house, and took the key of the corn-bin, which is kept there—I put about a pint of canary-seed amongst the corn in the bin, I smoothed it over, and locked the bin—I hung the key in the usual place—I then went to my private counting-house, where my foreman was waiting to do our regular evening business—I staid there till half-past seven o'clock—the prisoner then came with the key of the granary in which the corn-bin is placed—as soon as he had hung up the key, I and my foreman went and opened the bin—I found a great hole in the corn, a quantity had been taken out, I thought about a sack—we locked the bin, looked about, and found a sack concealed under some straw and other rubbish, in a stable adjoining the stable where the prisoner keep his horses—I opened the sack, and found the corn, and the canary-seed mixed with it—I got the policeman, to whom I gave charge of the sack—I can swear to the corn from the canary-seed in the corn—I did not watch the key of the bin during that hour.</p>

On the 21st of January, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I went to the stable where Mr. Smith pointed out the sack of corn, covered with straw and litter—there was some canary-seed amongst the corn—I watched the corn at night to see whether the prisoner would take it when he went out, but he did not, and when he came back, I took him to the counting-house—Mr. Smith asked him how that corn came there—he said he had saved it for about three weeks to give to the horses when they did a little harder work than usual—Mr. Smith said, "When did you put any into it last?"—he said, "There has been none put in since last Saturday."</p>

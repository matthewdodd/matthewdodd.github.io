                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hart, who keeps the Hand and Shears public-house, in Clothfair—between 12 and 1 in the morning of 18th June I found the prisoner lying in the corner of an empty room in my house—I desired him to leave, and he would not do so—he had been drinking—he said he had come there to see a Mrs. Giles, whom he had some time since been cohabiting with, and said he should not go away till he found her—he then began to break the things, and smash them about, and we gave him into custody—previous to that he said he had been robbing his employers for five <hi rend="italic">or</hi> six years, and he was going to give himself up on purpose to get this woman into trouble with him—he said some of the property was in her box in my room—he told the constable that those which he had taken out of the box were some of the things stolen—I found the things on the table in the room.</p>

About 5 o'clock in the morning of 18th June I was called into the last witness's house, and took the prisoner into custody—I found a watch, a pair of scissors, three keys, 10 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and three duplicates on him; I saw a piece of velvet, a piece of blonde, a piece of ribbon, two hair-nets, a piece of lace, and a black silk jacket, in the room—he said he had robbed his employers of those—he did not say who his employers were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic dealer, and live in Clement's-lane. I have a partner—the prisoner had been an occasional workman—he came on the morning of the 14th of June, and asked me if I had any work to give him, and whether I had found an apron which he said he had left behind at my place, about which he had called a good many times—he had left me about a month—I told him I had no work, and I had not yet found his apron, if I bad it—he left—when he went out at the street-door I watched him—I saw him stand opposite the entrance to my back premises some time—I looked for a policeman, and during that time he went up the court, and came out in another instant with three stones—he <hi rend="italic">dived</hi> to the right, and went down a court opposite; he then <hi rend="italic">dived</hi> to the left, and passed me—I followed, and gave him into custody in Cannon-street, with these three stones—he was carrying them before his breast.</p>

                  </hi>. I was occasional servant to the prosecutor, and was so at this time. I have occasionally seen the prisoner—he called on the Friday previous to this, and asked me if I would let him leave some stones there—he brought three stones wrapped in a cloth—he said, "I will call on Monday or Tuesday"—he said, "I am not going home"—I said, "Very well, if I am not here any person will give them to you"—he called on Monday morning—he said, "I have called for these stones, let me have them"—he took them away wrapped up in a cloth—he went out of the court, and I went to my breakfast—I came back, and had not been there long before Mr. Dean came in and the policeman—Mr. Dean said, "Has Welch been here?"—I said, "Yes, he called on Friday, and left three stones, and he called this morning, and I gave them to him"—I should consider that the three stones I gave him were those he had left.</p>

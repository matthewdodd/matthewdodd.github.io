                  </hi>. I have lived with the prisoner nine years as his wife. On 3rd Oct., about a quarter to ten o'clock at night, he came home from work—we had some angry words—I went out on an errand, returned in half-an-hour, and let myself in with a key—I was sober—the prisoner was undressed, and getting into bed—he ran at me and struck me a violent blow on the nose with his hand, which made it bleed—I went to get something to stop it, and found he had locked the door—I wanted to escape—he took up a knife, said, "You b——y bitch I will do for you," and stabbed me on the temple—I fell, and cried, "Murder!"—I bled a great deal, and the boards were broken in about half a yard—when he knocked me down, he took up something, wiped my eyes, and said it was all right—I found the key, and opened the door—the prisoner ran up-stairs, and I ran down—a policeman was coming in—we went up, and the prisoner was then in the room in his shirt—lie was quite sober—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

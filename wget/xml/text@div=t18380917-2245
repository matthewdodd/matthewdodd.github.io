                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 21st of August, at one o'clock in the day, I found the prisoner in Broadway, St. Thomas-street, in a marine-store shop—I watched him into the shop, having followed him from St. Thomas-street, with a sack of iron—I went in, a minute or two after him, and he was putting some of this iron into the scale—it was all in the scale, but one piece which he had in his hand—I asked him how he came by it—he said he had been at work at Spitalfields, and found it in clearing the cellar—he afterwards said a man had given it to him in Duke-street, by London-bridge, to take to the marine-store shop to sell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Chadwick, a builder. The prisoner was also in his employ, and had been so eight years—I know this iron belongs to Mr. Chadwick—it was made for Fenning's Wharf, and was taken from No. 1, Adelaide-place, London-bridge, where we had work going on—the prisoner was employed there.</p>

I am a tailor, at 21, Hare Street Hill, Holborn—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning, 12th July, I was on Han Street Hill—I saw the two prisoners with four or six more—Hayes jumped on me behind, and pulled me back, and put his fingers in my face—Higgs jumped on me and rifled my pockets—I called "Police!"—he took 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they ran away, and I did not see them again until they were in charge—I was kicked in the hip while I was down, but I do not know which of the prisoners did it—I was very much frightened, and my clothes were damaged.</p>

I was on duty on Hart Street Hill, on the night of 11th July—I saw the prisoners there with four others and two girls—I watched them—I saw the prosecutor coming down Hare Street Hill—Hays sprung at him and threw him down, and Higgs immediately got on the top of him, put his hand across his chin and commenced to rifle his pockets—I rushed across the street, but an alarm was given by the others standing there, and the prisoners ran away—I followed Higgs and caught him—on the way to the station Hays came up and I apprehended him—he passed what appeared to be a watch to a young man not in custody.</p>

About 12.30, on 12th July, I was at the corner of Baker's Row, and beard a cry of "Stop thief?"—I saw Higgs running, and the constable after him—he ran into Back Alley, and we caught him at the workhouse—just before we caught him he said he would give in, he had done nothing—we met the prosecutor, who said "Thai is the one that attempted to rob me"—on the way to the station Hays came up, and the prosecutor said "There is another one behind," and we took him to the station as well.</p>

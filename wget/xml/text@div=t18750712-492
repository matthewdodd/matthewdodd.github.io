V—the ticket was shown and the date, and he said "I will soon see whether Keen was here then"—a book was produced and the entries of that day referred to—Keen saw something and said "Oh, that will do"—on the way to the station in a cab Keen remained silent at first, and then said "What did you say I was to be charged with?"—I said "You will be charged with uttering and dealing in base coin in connection with two persons, a man and a woman"—he said "Is it that man that was at the office on Sunday morning you are going to put me in for?"—I said "That man was at the office"—he said "That man I bought this coat of which I am now wearing"—Chamberlain said "Why, you were wearing that coat on 28th April"—Keen said nothing to that, but he said "I hope you do not think I had anything to do with keeping you out of the office this morning? there is Mr. Manning; you may find a better, man than him, but you can't find a bigger scoundrel; my heart is too big to-round, and I shan't round"—I produce three shillings, which I received from Johnson, Carr, and Freeman.</p>

                  </hi>. These two shillings uttered to Chamberlain and Johnson are bad and from the same mould—I have examined the whole of the coins in the case and they are bad—some of the 147 in the bag are from the same mould as the two uttered and there are forty-three of 1856 from one mould, the same as those uttered by Keen to Chamberlain and Johnson—these ten found at the foot of the bed are of 1856 and four of them are from the same mould as those uttered to Chamberlain and Johnson—these sixpences are also bad—here are double moulds for shillings and sixpences—the officer showed me a shilling and &amp; sixpence which came from those moulds—this sixpence uttered to Mary Ann Yarrien is bad—these two shillings uttered to Carr and Freeman are bad but not from the same mould—I have seen the clamps, the battery and the acid, here is every thing complete for making counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Neave's statement was read as follows</hi>:—Horsemonger Lane Gaol, 15th May, 1875. I am desirous of giving some information with reference to the disposal of counterfeit coin. I first began to carry for a man named <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi> in January or February last, and was introduced to a barman near Moorgate Street Station who bought of me and supplied the clerks in the booking-office there. One of the clerks was dismissed or absconded in February I think—The barman then said he would not have anything more to do with it, but took me to Baker Street Station one Sunday morning in the beginning of February and introduced me to a clerk named Murrell or Keen. I then began to supply him with things which I had from <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi>, who was agent for 3 makers, one called <hi rend="italic">Little Ben</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">Harry Drake</hi>, and the other <hi rend="italic">Ted Kelly.</hi> I supplied Murrell with about 200 florins and shillings, which he got rid of himself. I used to go into the office to him, and if anyone was there I would sell him some article of clothing which I always carry with me. He was then at Baker Street Station. I went about three times a week, carrying him sixty or seventy pieces each time. He then asked me to get him some smaller pieces, such as sixpences, as he said he had someone <hi rend="italic">else</hi> who would take them at Victoria Station. I told him I would try and do so, but could not then get any. I got him more shillings and took him about 300 a week. He told me he had a lot of florins by him which he could not get rid of. After going to Baker Street for some time he was removed to several stations, and remained at the Swiss Cottage for about a fortnight, and I continued to supply him at each place. He asked me to get him some sixpences, and when I told him I could not, he said "Why don't you try and make them yourself?" I told him that I did not know how unless someone learnt me. I was on the Dials one day and saw an old man whom I knew to be a maker of sixpences. His name is Cummings, a very old man. I asked him if he could let me have some sixpences. He said "No, but i'll learn you how to make them if you'll give me what is right, because I am hard up." I promised to do so, and the next day he showed me the way to make a mould, and the following day how to mix the metal, and the proper way to make them. He brought with him a battery, some solution, and the whole of the necessary things for plating them over. I did not make myself for nearly a fortnight, but continued to have things from <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi> till I moved away from Blackfriars to. Camberwell, and then I told the clerk (Murrell) I would try and make him some sixpences, as I had learnt how to do it. He said "All right, bring as many as you like." I made some sixpences and shilling and met him at King's Cross two or three days running. He then told me the other clerk who was on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120070"></xptr>
               <p>duty with him was all right, and I could come to the office at Edgware Road Station. I think that is about three weeks ago, or may be more. He told me to make as many as I could as there were several of the other clerks doing it at other stations, one at Victoria. I have been taking him about 500 a week for the last three weeks, and he told me he could do with twice as many more. Last Sunday morning I took him eighty sixpences and about forty shillings. I went into the office about a quarter to eleven and remained there till one o'clock. Murrell and another clerk with a thick moustache were there. I handed Murrell the sixpences in presence of the other clerk, who received forty of them, which he put into his pocket, at the same time taking some bad florins and shillings from his pocket, which he handed to Murrell. Whilst I was in the office I rubbed up the edges a some shillings and sixpences for both of them. At about 1/2 past 12 Murrel told me that another clerk was coming to fetch some bad money and said "We shall want a rare lot of things next week for the holidays." He meant bad money. He told me to bring as much as I could by Tuesday, and he would then tell me how much they wanted for the Whitsun holidays. I said "All right" Just before I left another clerk, tall, wearing a light coat, came in. I knew the time that Murrell came on duty. He had told me. On Tuesday, (nth), I went with 146 or 147 shillings for Murrell, but as he was not there when I arrived at 10 minutes to 2, I took a walk, and came back in about twenty minutes, when I went to the window and saw Murrell, who asked me if I had got them. I told him I had. He said "All right, give them to me." I said "Who is that man?" (meaning Campbell), who was then, talking to me of the railway men. He said "I don't know." I then took a ticket to King's Cross as a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>, so that Campbell should not think anything was wrong. I then went and had my boots cleaned again, having had them cleaned once before, and waited for some time about the front of the station. I asked the porter (ticket collector), to let me go down the staircase to meet a young woman, and he allowed me to do so. I met my young woman (Annie Bolwell), who came by the next train. She was going to her sisters at Notting Hill. I told her there was something up which I did not like, and that I should want her to take something off the platform for me. I had hid the bad money in the watercloset when I first went down. I went and got it at 3 times, and put it into a bag which she was carrying, and told her to go and wait for me in the Edgware-road. She went upstairs and was followed by Campbell. I went up the stairs and into the Marylebone Road to Oxford Terrace and Notting Hill, where we remained till 8 o'clock. I returned to Edgware Road Station and saw Murrell, whom I asked if he had seen that man about since, and he said no. He asked me if I had got the things with me, and I said "No, not likely I'm going to bring the things up here, but if you will come out I'll get them." He said "1 am too busy to come out to-night, meet me to-morrow at the Angel, Islington, about 12 o'clock. I wish to state that had it not been for Murrell I should not have' commenced making counterfeit coin. He pressed me very much to do it, because I could not get from Smith sufficient to satisfy him, Smith having a lot of customers in London and the country. I have never supplied any one but Murrell since I have been making myself. Annie Bolwell is not to blame; she is a country girl, and did not know hardly what the meaning of it was. We were going to be married on Whit Monday. The banns are out at Waterloo church, and we have made all the arrangements for it. I</p>

               <p>Can describe the makers, but cannot give any addresses. Most of them have agents, and they don't give their addresses as they always meet by appointment. <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi>, about 28 years old, height 5 feet 8 inches, sallow sunken cheeks, broad shoulders, lost half forefinger, left hand, makes sovereigns. He lives somewhere in Westminster. <hi rend="italic">Little Ben</hi>, about 3-4 years old, short and thin, black billy goat beard, large mouth, black eyes and hair; dress, pea jacket, tight trowsers; he was living somewhere near Clapham Junction, but is now in a coffee shop which he has taken. I don't know where. <hi rend="italic">Ted Kelly</hi>, aged 50, 5ft. 5in., bloated ruddy face, covered with scars from blows from fighting. Carries his right hand in his breast very often, and dresses in pilot coat and cord trousers, which are ragged. His wife makes as well. She is sallow, with very long face, about 50 years old, 5ft.,2in., dresses in black, or red shawl and black frock, walks quickly. <hi rend="italic">Harry Drake</hi>, age 40, 5ft. 6 or 7 in. Has the gout; and sometimes walks with a stick, pale, full face, small moustache. He is the biggest maker there is now. The whole of them can be seen on the Seven Dials nearly every day.

               <p>Keen has been in the service of the company three or four years—I have heard that he was at the Swiss Cottage Station and Moorgate Street, Baker Street, and several stations—I did not make out a list of the times that Keen was employed at the Edgware Road Station for the purposes of the company, but I sent in my sheet weekly—I did not say that the first week in May he was employed from 5 a.m. till 2 o'clock, it was the late date in the early part of May—I find that on May 4th Keen and another man were there from 5.15 ill 2 o'clock—that was quite right; these sheets puzzle me, they are my own—on May 1st Keen was on duty from 2 o'clock to 12.30, I can't say whether he was on duty on 2nd May, but I imagine he was, as I hare his time here—in the return sent to you he is not down at all; in that case it was his Sunday away—on 3rd May he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.20, the 4th May you have; on 5th, 6th, and 7th May he was there from 5.15 to 2 o'clock—he was there on duty on Sunday, 9th May, from 8 a.m. till 11.30 p.m., and on the 10th and 11th he was there from 2 o'clock till 12.30—in the last week in April he began on the 23rd, when he was there from 5.15 to 2 o'clock, and the same on the 24th and 25th—on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th, he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.30—on 16th April he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.30—on 14th April his time is not here, it is a blank, there-fore he would not be there, he was absent from some cause or other—on 12th May he came to the office at 2 o'clock just for half an hour and went away—I told him some one had been to see him—the person asked if I had any<lb></lb>body there named Murrell—I said "No"—he then said "Any body named Keen?"—I said "Yes, and he would be there at 2 o'clock, and he said he would call again—I told Keen that, and he asked me to describe the man, which I did—I had not then heard that Neave and Bolwell had been taken on the previous day—I am sometimes at the general manager's office and sometimes at the accountant's office—I can't say whether I was at the station on 28th April, I have no reference—if I was away the beer might be handed in without my knowing it—there is nothing to call to my mind whether I was there or not—they may have taken advantage of my absence to commit an irregularity—when I refused to let the officers in four of them were waiting—I had no idea that they came for anything but to apprehend Keen for debt—I did tell them to go to hell when they said they would go to the general manager, I was exasperated—I was auditor of the company at one time; I was transferred and I preferred remaining in the general manager's office—I heard of a clerk being discharged from Moorgate Street about some coin about January or February, I did not know him personally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ticket examiner on the up side at Edgware Road Station, and am in the company's service—I never saw Neave inside the booking office, my duty is at the bottom of the stairs—on 28th April,. I was on duty from 5 a.m. till 3 p.m.—I was not called to drink beer from a can put through the window in—the booking office, nor did I know of two cans being put in there.</p>

                  </hi>. Rivers is not the inspector, who on 28th April was called up and drank beer—he was a fair man, I have seen him since—Castell was not one of the men—I have seen the two shoeblacks, if was the big one, Wright, who went for the beer, the last one called—Waller is not the ticket collector who was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of John Gould, a fishmonger, in Hungerford-market. Prior has been in his employ, and was dismissed the day before the robbery, on Monday, the 18th of July—he was there on the Monday morning, but did not work—on Monday night I left twelve salmon, ten small and two large ones, down in the ice in the cellars—I saw the shop shut up that night, and in the morning, when I came, I found all the salmon gone, and two aprons—they were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—I was not the first person at the shop.</p>

I met Prior, on Tuesday morning, in the Strand, with a basket on his shoulder—asked him what he had in it—he said fish, and he was going to set up for himself—he asked me to go with him, which I did, to the White Hart—he told me, if I could, to sell some of the fish—I sold a crab for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the apron for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the money to Prior, and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it—I told him I must go to a job which I had—I returned in about three quarters of an hour, and asked what he had done with the fish—he said he did not know—I said, "Have you sold it"?—he said, "No, but very likely the Jew boy will take it"—I asked him to go with me to Smithfield, which he did—I expected a job there, but the gen<lb></lb>tleman was out—in Farringdon-street, he hailed a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, who drove us to the White Hart, and there I parted with him; and just before I was taken, I met him again at the Nelson public-house.</p>

            How old are you? - Turned of fifteen. As I was going to ask my father to come to supper, I see this man at this butcher's door taking this piece of beef; he took it up and put it up in his black apron, and he crossed over the way to me, and said, what are you looking at? I asked him what did he think I was looking at? and he made an attempt to strike me, and then he goes down the street and went into this chandler's shop, and I ran back to this gentleman and told him that he was in a chandler's shop down the street, and he went with me and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you know the piece of beef by the sight of it? - Yes, I had just been cutting some steaks off it; I am very sure it was my beef.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along at six o'clock at night and I kicked over this piece of beef, I did not know what it was at first, it was so dark, and the first light I came to I took it in and I found it was a piece of beef, after I had been in about five minutes this man came in and said it was his beef.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What is the value of that beef? - Six shillings it was valued at.</p>

On the 14th of June I went out to see a funeral; I did not lock my room - it is at my mother's house; this printed cotton was mine, and was in my bed-room - I was not absent more than a quarter of an hour; I missed the cotton on my return, and suspected the prisoner - I went and found her leaning over an arch in the New-road; I asked her if she had my gown-piece - she said she had not; I asked her again, and she again denied it - there was not any one with me; I saw something bulky under her apron, and I asked what she had under her apron: she said nothing of mine - my cousin then came up and asked her; she said nothing of his - I said I would send for the Policeman; she then opened her apron, and I took out this cotton, which is mine.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Have you any mark on it? A. No, but I know it is mine; I do not know whether the door was shut - I had left my brother and sister at home; I had not been out above a quarter of an hour.</p>

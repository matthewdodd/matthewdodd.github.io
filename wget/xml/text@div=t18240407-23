The prisoner had left our house in October, but visited me after that, and was at the house on the 17th of February.

            . Q. Did you say that he was at your house on the day you came from the Bank - A. I am not quite certain - he came to visit me very often, and when he was there I was generally with him; he paid his addresses to me. I am sure I never gave them to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you known him - A. Since May. My father was not angry when the notes were gone. I had a great affection for the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a purse in common between you - A. Yes. When he came to lodge with us we had a three year's character with him.</p>

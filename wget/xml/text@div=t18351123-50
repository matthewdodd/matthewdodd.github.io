                  </hi>. I am drayman to Messrs, Calverts, I was walking by the side of my master's dray, in Cooper's-row, on the 23rd of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening—my jacket was on the side of the dray, just against the shaft-horse—I saw the prisoner, who had got about three yards from the dray, with it—he was doubling it up, and going away.</p>

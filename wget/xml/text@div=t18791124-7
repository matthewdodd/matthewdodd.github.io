On 7th November about 8 p.m I was with Thick and Wright in Great Eastern Street, Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner and two other persons, who are in the Dock (See next case)—I followed them to Sun Street and lost sight of them—I went on to the City Road, met the prisoner, and took hold of him by the right sleeve; he knew me and began struggling—rhis right hand was in his coat pocket—I saw his hand come out of his pocket and Thick caught him round the body—this packet dropped from his right hand, I picked it up; it contained four bad florins packed in paper, with paper between each—he was taken to the station, and on the way he said "You did not find this on me, Mr. Aveline, did you?—I did not say anything—when I picked them up I said "I shall take you for having these coins in your possession with intent to utter them," and then he made that remark—he was violent when I took hold of him, but walked quietly to the station.</p>

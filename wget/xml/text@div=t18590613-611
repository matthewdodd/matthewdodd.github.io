                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Reynolds, a builder of 16, Red-cross-square—the prisoner was employed by him as a bricklayer on 23d May—I saw the prisoner's jacket hanging up in a shed—a policeman searched the pockets of it in my presence and found two pieces of lead in separate pockets, weighing not more than two pounds each—I cannot say whose property it was—Mr. Reynolds did not give him lead to work on, but there was lead on the roof of the house and on the cistern—I afterwards told the prisoner that I had looked in his pockets and found two pieces of lead flushing—I examined the roofs, and accused him of having taken lead from the roofs of 7, and 8, Red-cross-street, where he was at work that morning—I missed about 3ft. 6in. from the two houses—</p>

               <p>he said that he had not taken it—I afterwards went to his house in Orchard-street, St. Lukes—it is a marine-store shop—I received the key from his wife, took a constable with me, opened a box in the shop and found sundry quantities of lead, and among them a piece of lead flushing, which I gave to the policeman—we returned to the house and compared it with the flushing on the roof, it was the same sort exactly; and the part of the roof where lead had been taken away, was filled up with the same sort of mortar which the prisoner was using—the lead fitted exactly—I missed altogether between 11 and 12lbs. value 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

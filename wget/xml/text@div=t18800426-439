                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Fanahaw Street, Hoxton—on 29th March, about 9 p.m., I went into a house in Cannon Row with Thompson—I undressed, and put my trousers under the pillow with my watch in the pocket—I turned my back to the bed, and she took the trousers from under the pillow and ran out into the street with them—I saw her go through the door—I did not see the trousers in her hand—I went after her, and she dropped the trousers in the street—I picked them up, put my hand in the pocket, and the watch was gone—I went up to her and said, "What are you up to?"—I went back and began to dress myself, and as I was dressing Cleverly came into the room; he said, "What are you doing in my premises?"—I said, "I am doing nothing much"—he said, "You had better be getting out as soon as you can"—I said, "If you will allow me time to dress myself, I will"—there was another one with him; I could not positively swear whether Anderson was that one or not—as soon as I dressed myself I went and gave information to the police.</p>

About half-past 12 on the night of 29th March Davis came to me with a complaint, and I went with him to 10, Cannon Row—I went into the front room occupied by the female prisoner—I did not see her—I saw Anderson in the passage Davis said, "That is one of them"—I told my brother constable to detain him—I went outside and saw Thompson—I told her I should take her into custody for stealing a watch and chain from the gentleman—she said she knew nothing about it—I went into the room with her and Cleverly, Anderson was in the room at the time—I told Thompson to give up the watch—she said she knew nothing about it—Cleverly and Anderson were sitting on the side of the bed—I saw the watch pass from Cleverly to Anderson, and he put it underneath the bed—Thompson said, "Look underneath the bed, and see if you can find the watch"—I did, and found it there—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced and identified</hi>).</p>

I was called to the house—I met Anderson in the passage—he entered the room, and the other constable fetched Cleverly and Thompson in—Thompson said "Look underneath the bed"—I saw nothing before that—the constable with that pulled out the watch—I told him to take charge of it—I took Cleverly into custody, and told Anderson to come to the Btation, he might possibly be charged with the affair—whilst in the station Thompson said, "You and me, Cleverly, are guilty, but Anderson is innocent—I saw the watch passed from Cleverly to Anderson, and Anderson placed it underneath the bed.</p>

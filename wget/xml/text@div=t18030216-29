               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop? - A. No, not at that time; on hearing the scuffle, Mrs. Whitworth ran to the door, and refused to open it, supposing there was a sight; I went into the shop, and told her to open it; a young man held up a handkerchief, and said, the shop had been robbed, and Glee brought in the handkerchiefs and the prisoner; we then went off to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose handkerchief was it? - A.Mine; it was missing from the window, and another with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it before? - A. In the window; we keep a hosier's shop, and sell these things; I saw it there myself just before dark, and the other;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160022"></xptr>the window was whole when I took the shutters down in the morning, and all day long for any thing we observed.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say, after the morning, whether it was whole or not? - A. Nor particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the boy? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.What time did you open the shutters? - A.Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was not called to the window through the day? - A. No.</p>
               <p> - GLEE sworn. - I am a patrol; I belong to the Office, in Worship-street; On the 20th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going up Shoreditch; I saw the prisoner and two others with him, about eighteen or nineteen years of age; I saw them looking at this gentleman's window; I passed them, and looked at them; I came back again, and looked at the window; the window was then safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was safe? - A. I am confident of it. I went about two or three doors forwards, and stopped about ten minutes; they were walking backwards and forwards; while I was waiting there, Mr. Whitworth came home, and went in doors; soon after he went in, they called one another together, whistling, and calling Joe, for they had separated; the prisoner had his coat off his right arm, and his shirt tucked up; I saw the prisoner push his arm through the window, and take the handkerchief, and put it under his coat on the left-side.</p>
               <p>Q. He put his naked arm through the wondow?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut his arm? - A. No, he pushed the glass right through.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of glass was it? - A. A very large pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. The glass made a considerable noise I suppose? - A. No, it came out whole, and fell on the stockings in the inside; the other boys ran away; I caught the prisoner immediately; I was within three or four yards of him. Here is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He pushed it in whole, and made no noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in Court when the prosecutor gave his evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And heard him say the window was whole in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard there is 40l. reward? - A. Yes, if the Court please to allow it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I went to the prosecutor's on being acquainted with it, and found this glass on the stockings in the shop. - (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - Glee delivered the handkerchief to me, and gave me charge of the prisoner. - (The handkerchief produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitworth. I can swear to the pattern and the quality, and that I had such a handkerchief missing; I cut the handkerchief off the day before; I had four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of that pattern in the window? - A.There was another in the window, but not of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe you swear cautiously; do you mean to swear positively to it? - A. I cannot swear positively; other persons may have the same pattern; I won't swear to it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

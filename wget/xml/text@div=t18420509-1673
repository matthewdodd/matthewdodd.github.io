                  </hi>. I am the wife of Andrew Haynes, and live at No. 3, Church-street, Deptford. My husband is a tract distributor to the Christian Friend Society—I lost a tea-caddy from the front room of my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock on Saturday, the 16th of April, with a silver spoon, a caddy-spoon, and plated sugar-tongs—I keep a school myself, and leave the street-door ajar—this is my caddy, there is tea and sugar in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an out-pensioner of Greenwich Hospital. About eleven o'clock on the 16th of April the prisoner, in company with two more, came towards me—one of them asked me if I would have some tea, and gave me some in my hand—I thanked him—it was loose in his hand—he said, "Down that gate there is a tea-caddy, go and take it"—I stood and looked at it—they said "That is it, it is all right"—I went down the court, put the tea into it, and called to Mrs. Stacey, "Have you lost anything, this is stolen?"—they left me—I left the caddy with Mrs. Stacey, while I went after them—I met the prisoner and two more in the same spot where they gave me the tea—I said, "Did that caddy belong to you?"—"Yes," said they—I said, "Come with me"—they came with me down the alley, and one of them told Mrs. Stacey to give it me, for it was their property—the prisoner had told me that it was his property—Stacey gave</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps a tobacconist's shop in College-street North, Camden-town—on 22d December last, about half past 5 in the evening, the prisoner came in and asked for half an ounce of bird's-eye—I served him—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he paid me with a florin—I noticed it was a bad one and bent it—I told him it was bad, and he said it was a bad job—he paid me with a good shilling and I gave him back the florin—he tried to straighten it with his teeth—I saw him put another florin into his waistcoat pocket—I saw it was bad—he then left the shop with the florin he had given me in his hand—I afterwards spoke to David</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, College-street North—on 22d December, in consequence of something the last witness told me, I followed the prisoner and spoke to a policeman, who took him in charge—I saw him take hold of the prisoner's hand, and then from his hand the prisoner dropped a two-shilling piece, sixpence, and a farthing, that was all I saw—I picked up the florin, after I came back with a light—I was about a minute fetching the light—I gave the florin to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 39). In consequence of what Pratt said to me, I took the prisoner into custody—I asked him what he had done with a two-shilling piece which he had tendered at a tobacconist's shop in College-street—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I then caught hold of his right hand, and took from it a two-shilling piece, a half-crown, one shilling, and sixpence in coppers—the florin was bad and the others were good—this is the florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was going to search his left hand pocket after I had searched his right, and he immediately took his right hand out of his right pocket, and as I caught it, something dropped on the pavement—Pratt picked up sixpence and a farthing, and I picked up a penny—I said, "There was something else dropped," and directed Pratt to go for a candle—he came back and picked up this florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to the prisoner, "This is a case, it is no use to tell me you did not tender the florin"—he said, "I did; I got it in change for a sovereign, but where I got the sovereign changed I can't say"—I showed one of the florins to Mrs. Keen after that, and she identified it as the one that had been tendered to her.</p>

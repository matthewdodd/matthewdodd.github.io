            . I live in Horse-shoe alley, in Moorfields. I work for the haberdashers and milliners. My uncle buys what work I do of me. I have known the prisoner twelve years; he was apprentice to a plaisterer and painter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been out of his time?</p>
               <p>Diggins. I do not know; I have not seen him these eight years till last Wednesday was a week; and then I saw him in Grays-inn lane, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Diggins. In a blue coat, and striped, waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Diggins. In the afternoon, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat?</p>
               <p>Diggins. A plain black hat.</p>
               <p>Q. A wig, or his own hair?</p>
               <p>Diggins. A two curled wig: I had not seen him almost eight years before: He saw me home to my own house that evening: he was with me from three till eight o'clock. I went to a public house with him in Grays-inn lane; I do not know the sign. We went into the Red-Lion in Moorfields before I went home; we staid there about an hour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150044"></xptr>Q. What time did you leave Grays-inn lane?</p>
               <p>Diggins. I believe, about six or seven o'clock; he went home with me that night. I was to meet him next day at Bethnal-green, at one o'clock; I did not go there till two; we staid there half an hour: from there we came down to Mrs. Reynold's house in Baldwin's-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is she?</p>
               <p>Diggins. A woman that has washed for me some time: I went there to dine; as I did not choose to dine in a public house. We staid there from four till ten at night; then he saw me home. At about seven o'clock we drank tea: she fetched some salmon for dinner. I parted with him at eleven. I never saw him from that time till I saw him in Tothill-fields bridewell, when he sent me a letter; that was on Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this man a relation of yours?</p>
               <p>Diggins. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is he?</p>
               <p>Diggins. He may be about thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him eight years?</p>
               <p>Diggins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You grew wonderfully loving all of a sudden; you was extremely delicate, after having been at a public house with this man three hours, you was so delicate as to go to this washerwoman's to dinner?</p>
               <p>Diggins. I could make free there.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a very critical circumstance in this man's case.</p>
               <p>Diggins. I am sorry I met with him.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a strange account; you spent fourteen hours in two days with a man you had not seen for eight years; it is not very much to your credit.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come alone?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; Mrs. Diggins came along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was their business at your house?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Their business was this; she said she knew him from a boy, and did not chuse to go into a public house with him: she asked me to let her friend have some dinner: they had pickled salmon first, and afterwards a dish of tea, and were talking about their little tricks when they were children.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not chuse to go to a public house with him?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; I went for the salmon; it was about four when they came in; they had the salmon about five; they talked till about six or seven, and then had a dish of tea: they departed from that room about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit to hear them talk all the time?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I was at work in my room all the time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask her if she can remember sewing a button upon my coat about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. A button dropped off, and we sewed it upon that coat.</p>
               <p>Q. So you know nothing of this Mrs. Diggins?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. No; I know she is a married woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any relations she has?</p>

               <p>Lucas. You know best.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you say it was the eighteenth?</p>

               <p>Q. Where is the book?</p>
               <p>Lucas. (Fumbles in her pocket a long time.) It was a bit of paper I wrote it down on.</p>
               <p>Q. I want that paper?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I can swear it was the eighteenth of April. I am a woman of character, and my oath will go as far as this. I will say the young man was with me that day.</p>
               <p>Court. A great deal depends upon this paper. I want to see it?</p>

               <p>Lucas: Mrs. Diggins brought this young fellow up to drink tea.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the question; I ask you when you first heard of his being in trouble?</p>
               <p>Lucas. Two or three days afterwards, Mrs. Diggins told me of it; he had the same cloaths and wig, and every thing on as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Diggins's business?</p>
               <p>Lucas. She has friends as well as me; she makes flowers, or some such thing.</p>

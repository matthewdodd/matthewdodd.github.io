In consequence of information on the 7th of Dec., I went with two officers to a public-house in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, nearly opposite the prosecutor's warehouse—I waited there from five o'clock till about a quarter past—there was a gas-light burning over the window—we had a. full view of the prose<lb></lb>cutor's door—I saw the prisoners and another-Walker and the other went to the door with their faces to it—Durall had bis back to them, and bit face to the public-house—he was looking up and down the street—the other two appeared to me to be feeling the door—Durall was two or three feet from them-after that a brewer's servant came towards the door—the pri<lb></lb>soners separated—Redman and I came down stairs, and partly opened the public-house door—Walker then passed close by the door—the other two were then at the warehouse door—Walker went across and joined them—they tried the door repeatedly, but were disturbed several times, by persons entering the street—the last time I saw Durall, with the one not in custody, stand with their hacks to Walker, and their faces towards me—Walker stood at the door<lb></lb>way, and I heard the door rattle—I opened the public-house door, and Durall, with the other, went towards Brick-lane—Walker went towards Helmet-row, which was in a contrary direction—I crossed the street, and followed Walker—he crossed Mitchell-street, looked back, saw me, and quickened his pace—I called to him to stop—he commenced running, and paid no attention to me—I said, "Stop, or else I will knock you down"—he turned round on me, with this chisel in his band, which I believe he took out of his pocket—he held it up to me with both hands—I knocked it out of his band with a stick I had, and secured him—I said I belonged to the police, and that he and his gang were breaking into Mr. Pizzie's warehouse, in Mitchell-street—he said he was never there at all—Redman came to my assistance, and we pushed Walker into a baker's shop—I took this bag from his hat, and took him to the station—I then examined the warehouse door—there was a mark on the door, near the lock, which corresponded with the point of this chisel—the door had been painted green, and there was a small piece of the paint near the top of the chisel.</p>

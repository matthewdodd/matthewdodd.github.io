                  </hi>. I am an accountant, in partnership with Mr. Ruther<lb></lb>ford, at 39, King William Street, City—we were employed to investigate the books of the firm of Newsom, Burke &amp; Co., wholesale tea dealers, in Great Tower Street—we were first engaged about 13th December, 1871—the books were very much in arrear; they were kept by the prisoner—he was ledger—keeper and cashier—we proceeded to investigate the books the prisoner was present the greater part of the time—I produce the rough cash-book for April last year—I find an entry "April 27, 1871, William Sentence, exchanged 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not included in the addition of that page; it is struck out, ruled out by two lines; that ruling out is peculiar to that item; that sum does not appear in the fair cash-book—that book is also in the prisoner's handwriting—the ledger con<lb></lb>tains no account of Sentence &amp; Co.—on 12th May I find an entry in the rough cash-book of "Sentence &amp; Co., 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing; it is ruled out in precisely the same way, and it is omitted in the addition of the money accounted for—there is no entry of it in the fair cash-book, nor is the firm credited with it in the ledger—the entries in the fair cash-book and ledger that day are in the prisoner's writing—the entry is "May 12, William Sentence, see Cartel, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that "see Cartel" refers to the ship by which the teas arrive on 13th May there is an entry in the rough cash-book of "205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., John Howgate"—that is in the</p>

               <p>prisoner's writing—it is ruled out in the same way, and it is omitted in the addition of the money accounted for—the fair cash-book that day is in the prisoner's writing; it is omitted altogether there, and also in the ledger—I have searched through the books, and can say that those three sums have not been accounted for—I made a balance of the amount of money deficient up to 11th December last year, it was 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I spoke to the prisoner with reference to that balance on 5th June—that amount was pointed out to him, and we asked him to satisfy himself of its correctness, and write in the balance, and he wrote "W. Lake, 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to the credit of cash, "remarking "I suppose this is signing my death warrant"—that amount includes the three sums in question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I commenced examining the accounts about 13th December—my partner and I commenced simultaneously, and from that time up to June we have been continually engaged, and also subsequently to 5th June, up to the end of July, the day the prisoner was given into custody—he attended almost daily up to 15th July; he was there that day—I am not aware when Mr. Newsom knew that the prisoner had signed that memorandum—he was absent almost the greater part of the time—Mr. Burke would be aware of it almost immediately, I dare say—there are three partners—I believe Mr. Burke is at the office—he was present at the Police Court—he has not been examined as a witness during these proceed<lb></lb>ings—he did not take an active part in superintending the accounts; he placed the accounts in our hands for investigation, and we made our report to the firm—I did not say I told Mr. Burke of this occurrence; no doubt he would be made aware of it, whether by my partner or myself, I am not aware—on all these three occasions the identical cheques were paid into the bank on the respective days—the fair cash-book was very much in arrear; I can't say how much, several months—the rough cash-book was entered up, but never balanced for a good many months; it was net balanced in any way that I could understand—the fair cash-book had not been balanced from the June previous; the ledgers, of course, were cor<lb></lb>respondingly in arrear with regard to the cash—I could not tell you how long there had been no entry made from the previous balance—the cash-book appears to have been balanced by Mr. Rutherford; he had audited the accounts up to the previous June—there was no change of partnership at that time—the firm of Newsom, Burke &amp; Co. commenced business on 1st November, 1870, and this book refers alone to their business—there had been an audit or balance since then by my partner—on 30th June, 1871, the cash-book was balanced; there is no signature to it, but I know my partner performed the work previous to my being in partnership—I was not present—I have seen his balance-sheet—I had no concern with it—the prisoner told me that he was going to Yokohama—he did not tell me that his father, at the suggestion of Mr. Burke or Mr. Newsom, had made pre<lb></lb>paration for his going there—I did not hear from either Mr. Burke or Mr. Newsom that he had—I suggested some place to him where he could see the Brazilian papers, that was with a view of his obtaining any information he might want—I did not tell him that at New York I should be able to introduce, him to some of my friends—I suggested that I might be able to do so conditionally, upon his satisfying his employers as to the state of his accounts—that was about the end of June—it was after the 15th June when he signed the document which he called his death warrant—I most likely gave him an advertisement of the route—there are entries in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230005"></xptr>
               <p>cash-book of goods received from his father in respect to this money; they are not the prisoner's entries; they are all subsequent to the signing of the document spoken of—an estimate of the amount has been made—I should say it amounts to between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., consisting of tea warrants, policy of insurance, debts owing, and harmoniums, watch and chain, &amp; c.—the entries are Mr. Burke's writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a summary of them; they are all credited; the prisoner was not present at the time they were credited to him; that was prior to his being given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These things were credited against the general deficiency—the 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not represent the total deficiency, it would be about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, of this firm alone; there was also a deficiency in the liquidation of the old firm—the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went against his general deficiency—he did not tell me anything about the tea warrants—I find entries in the ledger by the prisoner after April and May, 1871—the books have been balanced once after that date; they could not be correctly balanced, if omissions are made, no one could do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">CHARLES RUTHERFORD</hi>. I am partner of Mr. Baird—I have been engaged in going through the books of the firm—I had a conversation with the prisoner, about 18th March, as to the subject of his deficiency and the accounts of the firm—a large deficiency had been discovered at that time—Mr. Newsom spoke to him for a very long time in his private room, urging him to confess the deficiency, and so save us further trouble in the investigation—he said "I can't confess because to do so would be to confess to an untruth, and I say in the sight of God, "or "I call God to witness"—I am not sure of the precise words—"I have not had one penny or one farthing of your money"—reference was made to the sums that were then shown as deficient in the cash-book, which amounted to the somewhat singular sum of 1111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was subsequently corrected, but it forms part of the 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 8th April, I was present at a further conversation with the prisoner and Messrs. Newsom &amp; Burke, in their private-room—he was asked to account for two specific sums of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the bank—he said "Oh, I can't account for them, for their not being credited; but have you traced the notes?"—he was told there was no use in fencing any longer about it, that Mr. Burke had been to the bank—after a good deal of sparring and fencing the prisoner said "I suppose I must have had the money"—he said "I have securities to a very large amount, I have private property, and I will not only make good the whole amount of my deficiency, but I will pay for the expense of the investigation of the accounts"—he said he had property at Dorking, in the hands of the London and County Bank, which was in the joint names of himself and his uncle, Mr. Kilner—he spoke of his property as about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 13th April I saw the prisoner in the presence of his father and Mr. Newsom at his father's house, in Goswell Road, very late in the evening, I believe it was after 12 o'clock—the prisoner had not been at the office for three or four days, and Mr. Newsom and I went to his father's house and saw him there—his father said that he must make restitution of all the property that he could, that he, the father, could not do anything himself, otherwise he would do so; but that his son must give up all the property he had—his father asked him what property he had—he said some tea warrants and some jewellery, and a harmonium there, which he pointed out—his father said "Well, will you give up your watch and chain"—he said yes, he would on Monday—he said "Give it now, "and he took it out of his pocket and handed it to Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230006"></xptr>
               <p>Newsom, who returned it to the father—I said to Mr. Newsom, "I don't think you need have any hesitancy in taking it, seeing his father is willing that you should have it, as it has been purchased with your money, "and Mr. Newsom did keep it—I believe these things were credited at their full value—the prisoner said that on the following Monday he would make out a list of all that he had, and hand it over to Messrs. Newsom &amp; Burke—I believe he did make out a list, and property was given up estimated at 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it has not been realised; that was partly the estimate of the firm and partly ours; as regards the warrants it was the estimate of the firm entirely—the total deficiency in round numbers is, I should say, within tens of pounds of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I mean nearly 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of this firm alone, not the old firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The old firm made a composition—I believe the harmo<lb></lb>nium is entered at 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe that was what it realised—I dont know whether Mr. Burke is here; I have not seen him for some time—he was present at one of the conversations—he did not say in my presence that if the prisoner would hand over what he had they would not take any proceedings against him—I don't know why he is not here—I think Mr. Wontner asked at the Mansion House where Mr. Burke was—I don't think Sir Sidney Waterlow asked for him—Mr. Newsom and I did not go to the prisoner's father to see what we could get; we went to ascertain where he was, and if there was any truth in his statement respecting the private property which he said he had—Mr. Newsom did not in my presence ask the father to insure his life for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; something was said about insuring the father's life or the son's life—it was not said that the prisoner would give up all he had and the father would pay the difference—no doubt the prisoner was to give up all he had; probably it was suggested that he should raise the deficiency among his friends—the list of property we made out amounted to 714<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole deficiency was not known at that time; I don't know that we have found out the last item yet—up to 5th June, it was over 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we found out large items after that, before the prisoner was given into custody—he was not assisting me in making up the books on 15th July—he was present, I was not; my partner was—I had audited the accounts up to June, 1871—many of these items would be included in that audit—I looked at the green cash-book; I noticed items struck out, but those were explained—the cash-book was made up to the 30th June—it was not made up subsequently—it was about the end of August that 1 balanced up to 30th June—I saw at the time that I made that audit that the cash-book did not go any further than June—I mentioned it to the firm, and urged upon them and the prisoner that the cash-book should be made-up and balanced monthly, and the prisoner promised that it should be—I found that had not been carried out, and that the firm had not had any balance since June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I audited I relied on the fair cash-book being correct, and also the ledger—I did not go through the rough cash-cook at all; I simply compared, as I was instructed to do, the amounts paid into the bank as shown by the fair cash-book and the banker's pass-book, and they agreed—the books tallied and justified one another—none of the amounts were entered twice over in the rough cash-book—I have gone into the prisoners accounts with the old firm, and found them largely deficient.</p>

               <p>prisoner has been in the service of that and the previous firm seven or eight years—at the time he was given into custody, on 15th July, his salary was, I think, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was confidential clerk and ledger-keeper—it was his duty to keep the books, the rough cash-book, the fair cash-book, and the ledger—on the receipt of moneys, he made entries first in the rough cash-book, then in the fair cash-book, and afterwards debited the accounts in the ledger—on 27th April, 1871, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to us by Sentence &amp; Co.; on 12th May, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the same firm; and on 13th May, 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by Mr. Howgate—those sums were never accounted for to me by the prisoner—in the beginning of the present year, his books were very much in arrear—I spoke to him on the subject, and accountants were after<lb></lb>wards called in to go through the books, the prisoner remaining in our service—in March I had a long conversation with the prisoner, lasting five or six hours; the whole time he strongly asserted his innocence—I pressed him very hard indeed to confess what he had really taken, and be said "I solemnly swear in the sight of God I have not had a farthing, "and I said "If you can say that, you had better leave the place at once"—on 13th April I went with Mr. Rutherford to the prisoner's father's house—I think the prisoner had not been at the office for several days—previous to seeing the prisoner we had an interview with the father, detailing the circumstances of the case, and when the prisoner came in his father interrogated him on the point, and he confessed to having taken the moneys—his father said, "What is this that you have done"—he was rather vague in his answer, and I said "Now, Lake, tell the whole truth"—the exact answer he made I really forget, but he admitted taking the money—the father turned to him and said "Give up that watch"—he said he would do so on Monday; but his father took it from him and handed it to me, and I kept it—he said that he had tea warrants which he would give an account of on Monday, and the father said he should be in attendance on Monday morning to do so—I know of the balance of 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being worked out—I was not present when the prisoner made the entry in the book—I found a large number of racing telegrams in his desk—they were produced in Court, but were mislaid—I have looked for them and cannot find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I discharged him, I think, in March—I can't say the date exactly—it was not before the conversation with his father; I am sure of that—it was before the watch and chain were given up; I don't know whether it was in January, February, March, or April—I don't know whether Mr. Burke is here or not; he is in London—I heard you ask for him on the former trial, and I heard Mr. Wontner ask for him at the Police Court—I don't think Sir Sidney Waterlow asked for him; he asked if he was there—he took an active part in the matter—I am not aware that he made all the entries in this book about the receipt of the property—he received the amounts; I received nothing but the watch and chain and A' ring—the prisoner's father called on me several times—I did not tell him that if it would be any comfort to him and his daughters he might tell them that no proceedings would be taken—something was said about his son going away, and he said to me "Will you get him off?"—I said "I can't say so; but, if he will do his duty now, I will do the best I can with Mr. Burke, but Mr. Burke is determined to prosecute"—I did not say what his duty was, but my idea was that he should show where he had altered the accounts—the circumstances have been much aggravated since—I had not been speaking to the father about the property; I swear that—this</p>

               <p>interview was on the Sunday, as the prisoner said he would bring the list of the property on the Monday—the prisoner remained till 15th July, when he was given into custody—we had then got from him all the property mentioned in this list; I don't know whether it included his school books—Mr. Burke received the property—Mr. Lake's visit to my house was some weeks prior to the prisoner being given into custody—items were being continually found out in the interval—Mr. Rutherford audited the accounts in June, 1871—I don't recollect his telling me that there ought to be a monthly audit; he said the books were not kept up—I did not after that see that they were kept up; I presume Mr. Burke did—I was very much surprised to find they were not kept up—we have always been in the habit of calling in an accountant to audit our books at our half-yearly balance—the fair cash-book should be a copy of the rough—I never looked over it.</p>

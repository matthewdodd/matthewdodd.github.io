                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Castle-street, Holborn. On Saturday night, the 2nd of Aug., I was going to bed about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—I heard some glass falling, which sounded in the lower part of the house—I was in the first floor—I went down and searched the lower part of the house, and the kitchen—as I waa coming up again, I saw through the glass door that the back office was open, which is under cover, and communicates with the house by a glaat door—I went in and found the window of the office wide open, and one pane of glass broken—the prisoner was inside the office, sitting on a stool—I asked what he did there—he said be came there to sleep—I told him that was not a place for him to sleep, and he should not stay there—I fetched the policeman, and gave him in charge—the house is my dwelling-house, and I sleep in it—it is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn—I know the prisoner by sight, from his having been employed by Mr. Bald-win, to whom that back office is under let—the prisoner used to write there for Mr. Baldwin.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you rent this dwelling-hoose, and this part that you let to Mr. Baldwin, from the same person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there is merely a half glass door between the two premises—there is no key to that door—it fastens with a bolt on the side belonging to me—there is an entrance to that office from Took's-court—it was originally a part of my house, and was built at the same time—it is underlet to Mr. Baldwin, reserving a right to me to go through it—Mr. Baldwin's direction</p>

               <p>is No. 6, Took's-court—the prisoner has been lately a writer there, but I believe he is a tailor by trade—Mr. Baldwin is a law-stationer—I never knew the prisoner to sleep there—I told him to go away—he said he would not, he would sleep there—I said he had no right to sleep there, and if he had, he had no right to get in at the window—I did not see him get in, but the door was fastened, and the window was open—he was drunk—it was five or six minutes after I heard the noise that I went into the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law-stationer. I rent this back office of Mr. Beck, for business—I left it on that Saturday night about nine o'clock—I had fastened both the door and window myself—when I came on the Monday morning I found the lock of my desk had been broken, and the desk forced open—it was full of papers, and a cash-box with money in it, but nothing was gone—the cash-box was locked, but the key was in it—I had been in the habit of employing the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has not the prisoner been writing for you in that place as late as twelve or one o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, generally in the night—I am not aware that he has slept there—it might be that he had slept on that stool while sitting at work—he could not have come for work that night—we never have any work on Saturday night—I never recollect his getting in at the window—I never allowed him to be there without some<lb></lb>body with him, because I knew nothing of him—I have always kept the cash-box in the desk—I never trusted him with money, nor to receive money—I had seen him in the middle of that Saturday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

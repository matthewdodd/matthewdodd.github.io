               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor about half-past three o'clock in West-street; he asked me to go and light his fire, as his wife had left him; I made his bed, and cooked his fish - I went again the next morning, about nine, and he left me in the room; I do not deny taking the hone, but it was from distress; he did not give me any money; he said if I would tell him where it was he would give me a glass of gin; I took him to the place; he said "I will not hurt a hair of your head;" he has my tea-pot and cups and saucers in his room, and he had my apron on at Marlborough-street.</p>

Last Saturday night this man came into my room; about one o'clock awaked and saw the man in the place; I asked him what he wanted; he said, he wanted to lodge; I left the door on the latch, it was a public lodging house; I look upon it the time he came in he was in liquor; I don't know exactly that the man came in with an intent to rob; I did not catch any thing on him but I charged him with the constable, and I missed the two guineas about six in the morning, but I cannot charge the prisoner exactly; there were things in the place that I saw him undoing, but there was nothing found on him.</p>

On the 24th of August I locked the doors at nine at night; some people lay over it but a good way off; after I had locked the door, I went home to my own house; when I went out I gave the key to one of the servants. At eleven o'clock I was alarmed by a watchman that the fore door was open. I went into the yard of the counting house; I could discover nobody there, I went out again; on Sunday in the morning I found the nail of the shutters forced out; they had drove it; at eleven the night before I found some blue split upon the floor; there was twelve or fifteen pounds gone from one place; in the whole there was blue taken away to the amount of forty or fifty pounds weight.</p>

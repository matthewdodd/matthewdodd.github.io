On the 24th of February, having missed calico I marked some, and some brown Holland with a pencil mark, locked the shop up at night, and in the morning gave the servant the key to give to the prisoner. I went into the shop about half-past seven o'clock, and found him cutting some shalloon - the shutters were not open; he said he was cutting it for a wrapper, and afterwards that it was to cover over some things. I looked and found about a yard and a half was cut off the brown Holland. I searched him, but did not find it - I gave him in charge. The coat was stolen a year ago.</p>

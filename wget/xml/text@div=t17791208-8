I gave them a few shillings; they demanded my watch. I said it was an old metal watch not worth their taking. I argued with them a great while about the indifferent value of the watch. They were resolute, and took my watch. My friend who was with me was robbed too. The postboy drove on. Soon after we were informed that a man was taken a little behind the chaise. I got out of the chaise, and saw him lying upon the ground, and several men were standing about him. I cannot swear to either of the men, my eye-sight is bad, and there was a small rain at the time, and it was a dusky night. I cannot possibly swear to the watch, because the outside case was lost; it was a watch Mrs. Ogg wore, which I borrowed to go out with; as I did not expect to be robbed, therefore I took no particular notice of it; it was a metal watch with a kind of enamelled case to it; it had to it a steel seal, with the impression of something like a Griffin upon it, and it had a striped ribband; (looks at it) I believe this is the same seal and ribband. I saw it produced afterwards at Sir

               <p>I am a corporal in the Oxford Blues. I was returning from London to Brentford in a stage-coach, on the evening of the robbery. Between Kew-bridge and Turnham-green the coachman said he saw two men robbing a post-chaise. Myself, and three more, who were in the coach, being told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080008"></xptr>this, got out in order to apprehend them. The coachman showed us where they were. I did not see them stopping the chaise, but being pointed out to us we crossed the road, and seized the prisoner by the collar; he at first made a great deal of resistance; he struck at me with a drawn hanger, and cut me through the hat, not withstanding this out I secured him, and found two watches in his pocket, and upon the ground close by him I found a hanger, with which he had cut at me, and this watch which has been produced close by it, and nine shillings and sixpence in silver in his coat pocket; that metal watch was found by him without a case, and that dirty ribbon was to it, and a steel seal to it. I saw them at Mr. Drinkwaters, and the prisoner being asked how he came by these watches, said he bought them at different places which he named.</p>

               <p>I was driving this coach. When we were about one hundred yards on this side Gunnersbury-lane, I saw one man, but that man was not the prisoner, stopping a chaise. I suppose the other man was on the other side. I was a little behind at the time the chaise was stopped, but in driving up I came close to them. The fellow who stopped the chaise, who was in a smock frock, said if I did not drive along he would blow my brains out; in consequence of that threat I drove on. When I got to Gunnersbury-lane end I told the passengers, there were but two of the footpads, and I apprehended we were strong enough to take them; the passengers got out. I fastened the horses to a post, and we pursued the two men, one was in a smock frock. The prisoner, and the man in the smock frock, were the persons who stopped the chaise. The corporal ran towards the prisoner, and the prisoner struck at him. I am sure the man in the smock frock was the person who stopped the chaise, and who held the pistol to me, and threatened to blow my brains out if I did not drive on, and I am equally sure the prisoner is the man who was in company with the other person that stopped the chaise, and they seemed to come in the same direction as if they came from the post-chaise. The prisoner struck at the man with a rusty naked hanger. It was moonlight; it was a full moon, but it was rather a dull night. The prisoner being searched these watches were found upon him, and the other watch was found upon the ground, together with this hanger.</p>

               <p>I live at Brentford. I was a passenger in the coach that night; I jumped out of the coach when it stopped; I saw the footpad hold the pistol to the coachman before, swearing he would blow his brains out if he did not go on; the coachman then drove on about an hundred yards; we got out of the coach; I saw one of the men in a light coloured frock, who was the person who swore he would shoot the coachman if he did not go on, and the prisoner was in company with him, they were as near as this young man is to me (close to the witness's elbow) going along with him; when he was taken, the corporal of the Blues held him while he was searched and took the watches. We found this watch upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor (inspects the watch) I could have better sworn to the watch had it had an outside case; it had a kind of enamelled case which was particular, I could have known it by that, but I cannot swear to the inside case only, which I seldom saw, it being my wife's watch, and I seldom had it in my custody, but the seal has exactly the same impression with the seal I lost; the ribband is the same pattern, and is equally dirty with that I lost, and has the same appearance.</p>

               <p>Did you give him any money? - Seven shillings and six pence; then he asked for my clicker, and kept pushing at me with the sword all the time.</p>

               <p>By your clicker he meant I suppose your watch? - Yes. I did him take it; he felt the watch, but could not find the string, it was put in; I puiled the watch out, and he snatched it out of my hand.</p>

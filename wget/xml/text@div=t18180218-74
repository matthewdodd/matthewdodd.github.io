               <p>WILLIAM BAKER. I am bailiff to William English, who lives at Edmonton, and has a farm at Rumford, Essex; the sheep were there under my care - I live there. On the 15th of February he had twenty sheep in a field about 200 yards from my house - I penned them all in with a hurdle that night-the field is also enclosed with a hedge and gate; I saw them all safe within hurdles at two o'clock that morning, and missed them about seven the next evening, which was Sunday, the 16th. I found the hurdle open for about two yards. I traced them, by their foot-marks, through two fields belonging to Mr. Hawes-it appeared as if straw had been shook over the foot-marks to hide them. I traced them into a bye-road which leads to London, got a horse, and came to Smithfield, where I heard my sheep were stopped at Hackney; I immediately went there, and found nineteen of them, and the other at Worship-street, where the prisoner was in custody; I knew it to be one of them, it was marked D on the left hip-those at Hackney were also marked so, and two of them had a stripe down the back beside. I have known the prisoner ever since last summer. I saw him in the same field; he is a labourer, and lives at Chattle, within a mile of Rumford.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY READING. I am patrol of Hackney. On the 16th of February, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was at Lee Bridge turnpike, and saw the prisoner drive sheep up to the gate, the tollman asked how many he had, he said a score; the man demanded 10d.; after a little while he said he had only sixpence; the man said he could not let him through; he then said he had left his master at four o'clock, and he said he would pay the toll, and that his master would pay the four-pence. He appeared in a great hurry and agitated, which made me suspect the sheep were stolen. I followed him over Lee Bridge, which is in Middlesex; he drove them very hard. I asked him where he was going with the sheep, he said, to Smithfield? I asked him where his master was, he said he did not know. I then asked him where he came from, but he would not answer me, and I collared him. In about a quarter of an hour he said he came from Chigwell. I asked him at what time he left there? he said at twelve o'clock. I asked him if he took them out of a pen or a field? he said, out of a field, and that a gentleman and a butcher were with him when he took them. I asked him if he should know them again? he said, no. I took him to Hackney, and gave both him and the sheep in charge to Garva.</p>

            . I was with Reading, his account is correct in every particular. I asked the prisoner if there was any other person present but him and his master when he fetched them out of the field? he said, no I told him it was odd that the gentleman who belonged to them was not there. He then said his master and the gentleman brought them out of the field the overnight into a meadow by the road-side.</p>

            . Reading and Reader gave the sheep and the prisoner into my charge; I asked him where he brought them from - He said, from the Chigwell road; that he met a man on Sunday afternoon, who employed him to take them to Smithfield for eight pence. I asked at what time he brought them from there? he said at twelve o'clock at night. I asked him if he was waiting at any public-house until that time? he said his master and him waited in a lane, and that he did not know who his master was, for he never saw him before, but that he was dressed in a pepper-and-saltcoat. Baker saw the sheep in my possession. I found a knife on the prisoner, and some rope yarn, with which the hurdles had been tied.</p>

             re-examined. The hurdles were tied with rope yarn. No one had any orders from me or my master, to take the sheep to Smithfield, or any other place. My master does not do any thing with the farm, I manage every thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was travelling about, out of work, and met a butcher, who offered me eighteen pence to drive the sheep to Smithfield with him; he said he would pay the gate, the patrol said he saw him come to the gate; he left me, saying, he would fetch seventy-two more, and I never saw him again.</p>

               <p>What was the value of that tobacco that you suppose was taken away? - It might be two hundred pounds weight, or five hundred pounds weight, I cannot be sure, there was more than two hundred pounds, it was worth thirty pounds I think, it was fine tobacco; three or four days after, I heard the prisoner at the bar was taken up for a watch, and my wife went and knew her watch, it was at the watch-maker's to be mended, the watch-maker has the watch; I never got the tea-spoons, nor any part of the tobacco.</p>

               <p>Did you in fact lose a watch? - Yes, I have seen it since, I knew my watch, it was at Mr. Allen's, the watch-maker's.</p>
               <p>Was it in the same state as when you lost it? - No, the spring was broke, but the outside fish-skin was there, but the woman's chain was taken off, and the paper taken out.</p>

On the 11th of January, the prisoner brought this watch to my shop, to get it repaired; I looked at it, and told him the main spring of the watch was broke, he stood motionless, and almost speechless, he made no reply to that, I asked him when he wanted it done, he told me to suit myself, he was in no hurry; I made him for answer, he should have it the latter end of the week, he went out of the shop, I saw him no more till I saw him at the Justice's; one of Justice Green's men came to me on Thursday and enquired about the watch, his name is

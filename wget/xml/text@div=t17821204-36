               <p>On the 6th of November, between seven and eight at night, I was unlading a cart of Messrs. Smith, Kemble and Co. in <placeName id="t17821204-36-crimeloc177">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Then this is not the man that knocked the bag off of the cart? - I do not know what became of the bag, I did not see it on the ground, it was on the other side of the cart, I saw the man knock it off the cart; they brought the prisoner to the King's-arms Tavern opposite; they gave me the bag, and the constable took it; there is the same mark as was on it; it was directed to one Bailey at High Wycomb (look at the bag); I am sure it was one of the bags on my cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When they came into the tavern they asked him how he lost this bag, and he said at first he was hoisting up a hogshead of sugar.</p>

               <p>I am a young lad, and come out of Wales to buy beasts for my mother and father; there was a gentleman that lives at No. 1, Church-court, in the Strand, coming by, I picked up this bag, there was two or three carts standing, I knew not what cart it belonged to; I went to the pastry-cook's to look at the direction, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I immediately delivered it out of my hand, it fell down; I went on, they followed me, and stopped me; when I took it, I meant to see the direction, and carry it to the owner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040055"></xptr> and if not, to advertise it; I have a witness, a carman.</p>

               <p>Court. Was not the carter the most likely person to have enquired of? - To be sure, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Had not it the appearance to you that it had fallen from the cart? - It was just by the cart-wheel, under the copse of the cart.</p>
               <p>Then you would have enquired of the carter, would not you? - To be sure I would, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Venables. Did he seem to run off when he picked up the parcel? - He walked very sharp, to be sure, but I cannot say he ran, there was a cart coming by at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Sadler. Who was in the cart at the time that this parcel was thrown down? - One of my fellow-servants, I called to him: all our men have brown jackets.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw the man with the brown coat on at the wheel of the cart before you cried out, Stop thief? - It was two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Then that man had gone clear off? - There were two or three on the other side of the way, they stopped a little while and walked on; I did not see the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, at 11, Salisbury-crescent, Pitt-street, Old Kent-road—I am eleven years old—I was sent by Mrs. Green, at Mr. Campbell's, in Rood-lane, with a bundle of things to my mother's, to wash, on a Monday in October—I saw the prisoner on Lon<lb></lb>don-bridge—I had not known him before—he came up to me and asked if I would like to have a rabbit—I said 'Yes,'—he said he had got seven at home, and he was going to sell three for ninepence, and he would give me one—I walked with him—I had the bundle in my hand—he told me to leave the bundle in a shop he pointed out, while I went to get the rabbit—I did not know the shop before—it was a chandler's shop, and the person's name was Eliza Reynolds; I have seen her since—the prisoner was standing at the window outside, while I left the bundle—we then went on, and he told me to stay while he went and got the rabbit—he went down a court—he did not come back with the rabbit—I did not see him afterwards—I went to the chandler's shop for the bundle and it was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Reynolds, Crucifix-lane, Bermondsey; my husband keeps a chandler's shop—Noakes called at my shop one day last month; he asked me whether he could leave a bundle—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You will not open it, will you?"—I said, "Lord bless the boy, no"—I saw the prisoner looking in at the window—</p>

               <p>I think he could hear what Noakes said—the prisoner said, "Come along, come along," and hurried him out—the prisoner came back in about ten minutes—he spoke very slowly, and asked for the bundle—I did not understand him; I said, "What do you say?"—he said, "I want the bundle"—I thought it was a bundle of wood—he said, "No, the bundle"—I said, "You are not the boy that left it"—he said, "No, it was my brother"—I gave it to him and he went away with it—Noakes came after<lb></lb>wards, and I told him what had taken place, and I told a policeman who was passing.</p>

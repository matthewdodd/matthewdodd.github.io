I live at Crouch-end—I happened to be at this coffee-house on Saturday, 7th May—while I was sitting in one of the boxes I saw the prisoner Heath look in at the door; he said, "All right" and immediately two other persons followed him in, and sat down in a compart<lb></lb>ment in advance of me—when Miss Holmes went away they appeared to be simulating drunkenness, when any one could see they were not drunk—Heath in a braggart style was pushing the other men and pretending to quarrel—Mr. Foster returned with the note, and said, "You must bring better notes than this here, if you want me to change them"—the last time</p>

               <p>he came in he pushed Heath further into the shop, and said, "You are not going away like that;" he was following Bentley, the third man, who had just that moment gone out—before that, Bentley had said to Heath, "We had better pay for what we have had and <hi rend="italic">step</hi> it"—upon that he went away, and Heath was following him, when Mr. Foster stopped him.</p>

On Saturday, 7th May, about half-past 7, Clouter came into my uncle's shop and had something to drink—I can't remember the amount of it, but it was very small—he tendered a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in payment—I gave it to my uncle, and in consequence of what he said I wrote this on the back of the note—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave the prisoner the change—the barmaid asked him his address, and he said "48, Judd-street."</p>

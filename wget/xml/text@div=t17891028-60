               <p>Court. It is very unbecoming in you, to come into court in such a condition; I do not like to examine a witness who represents himself to be a schoolmaster, and comes into Court in such a condition: tell your story with as much decency as you can? - I was going home just after eleven; just as I came to <placeName id="t17891028-60-crimeloc290">Queen's Court, Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Court. I think, gentlemen of the Jury, no person who sees this man and hears him, but is satisfied that he is in a very drunken condition, and it is a shame he should come into a court of justice, however that justice may be done, I will call the other witnesses.</p>

               <p>Was he intoxicated? - Yes, I took him to be in liquor when he passed me, which was just before, the prisoner was with him; I said to the woman I believe you have robbed that man; I did not examine the woman; I brought her out of the court; I sprung my rattle; and when the watchman came to my assistance, I gave charge of the prisoner; I brought out the prosecutor; he could not speak for some time; I took them both to the watch-house, and the constable of the night searched the prisoner, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor make any charge against the prisoner at that time? - No, he could not speak.</p>

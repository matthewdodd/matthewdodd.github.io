               <p>JOHN HODSON. I live at a public-house in Park-street. On the 5th of September I was working in a stable in <placeName id="t18260914-195-crimeloc1117">Seymour-mews</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18260914-195-crimeloc1117" type="placeName" value="Seymour-mews"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. What hour was this? A. About twelve o'clock; he had half-a-crown in his hand, but I would not take it; I swear I had no money of him. I was going up the steps to fetch the breeches. They both ran away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner and the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He called me into the stable, and showed me some things, for which he asked 10s. more than their value - I said I could not buy them, but if he had any shoes or hats I would buy them; he showed me these shoes, said they were mis-fits, and I should have them for 6s.; I said I would give 4s. - he said I should have them for 5s. - I put them into my bag, and gave him 5s. for them - he then ran after me, and tapped me on the shoulder, and said if I did not give him 6s. he would give charge of me, because I was a Jew.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN HODSON. Q. Did you ever mean to sell these shoes? A. No, I never received any money. I saw but one half-crown in his hand, and that I did not have: these shoes had been too small, but I had them stretched, and then they fitted me very well; I had no conversation with him about them.</p>

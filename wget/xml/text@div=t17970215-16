               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. About ten or eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased, or either of the prisoners, then? - A. I was smoaking my pipe, my grandson came in, and desired me to go out; I went out, and Painter was swaggering with his money, and wanting to fight him, five guineas to four.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. Between his house and mine, he lived next door; I made answer to him he should fight him; we went to put the money down, and thought the putting the money down would put an end to the quarrel that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the money down - A. No, no money was put down, but I pulled my money out, then the gentlewoman of the shop would not take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman? - A. Mrs. Townsend, who keeps a chandler's shop; we went in there to put the money down, and she would not take the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Each offered to put the money in her hands, Painter for himself, and you on behalf of your grandson? - A. Yes; then Painter came up directly to him at the door, and stripped, and then they went to fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your grandson strip? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they continue fighting? - A. I don't know, I went into the house, and a gentleman, one Mr. Bligh, came in to me; I saw no more till he came home, and had done fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after? - A. The whole was but about ten or twelve minutes.</p>

               <p>Court. This will not do, his declarations cannot be received but when he was in expectation of dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of his bed? - A. Yes, he got out of his bed and came into mine, I believe on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not your grandson say this to him, "I never had bailiffs in my house"? - A. Yes, I suppose he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Painter then said to him, "nor I Jem"? - A. I don't know, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your grandson did not say immediately to him, "d-n you, will you fight"? - A. No, he said no such word to my knowledge, I never heard him challenge him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath I ask you, did not Painter say to him, I will not fight you now, but I will fight you on Monday morning, for five guineas? - A. I never heard any such word mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor nothing like that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would fight him for five guineas, did not you say, "no, d-n you, you have not five guineas"? - A. I don't know that I said any such word at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake positively to say that you said no such thing? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. After your grandson had been fighting with this man, was he not washed all over at the pump with cold water? - A. I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him speak to his sister? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in, was he not in good spirits? - A. Yes, seemingly he was.</p>

               <p>Q. That was the reason he gave for striking him? - A. I heard him say he bit him on the side, but did not say that was the reason of his striking him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you at Whitecross-street the Saturday night this happened? - A. I was; the first I saw was, they both came out of their respective shops, stripped, and they engaged directly as they came out; I saw three or four rounds; they both fell; Richardson was uppermost at that time; I saw several men holding of Richardson; I desired them to let him loose, not to hold him; some one made a reply, they did not hold him; with that I saw a man in a smock frock give him several kicks; they were both then upon the ground; I asked them whether they were going to murder the man; with that Painter got up, and said d-n my eyes, they are going to murder me; after that they were going to set-to again; this man in the smock frock began hustling me about; he desired me to get out of the way; with that he d-d my old eyes, and bid me get out of the way, I had no business there; with that I took his advice and walked to the other side of the way till it ended.</p>
               <p>Q. Who that man in the smock frock was you don't know? - A. I do not; the last fall they had they came close to where I stood, on the other side of the street; there was great pushing among the people, and several of them sell, one in particular sell in the kennel, my attention was taken to him, and I did not see any more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your attention was not drawn to it till they were actually stripped? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you did not know the man in the smock frock, it was neither of the prisoners? - A. To my knowledge it was not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a sawmaker: On the Saturday evening this affair happened, about the hour of ten or something after, as I was going to buy some necessaries for the succeeding week, I saw a mob of people standing before the door; I heard Painter say that he would fight the other, six guineas to five; they went from there over to the chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see go? - A. Painter; somebody followed him, I cannot say who it was; they went into the shop, and I saw Painter come out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Richardson at this time? - A. I believe he might be in doors, I did not see him; when Painter came back again, I heard Richardson say, he never had the bailiffs in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To Painter; I heard Painter say, nor I any more than you; and Richardson replied then, I did not say you had; then afterwards there were some words between them about buying pigs, but I did not pay much attention to what they were saying; then I saw Richardson pull off his coat and waistcoat and shirt, and come out to fight the other, and they sell to fighting, and while they were fighting I saw several people hold Richardson up with their knees, to support him from falling; and one round, when they were falling, I saw a man kick Richardson's face.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that man dressed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jenkins there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing? - A. No, I did not; I saw them fall, and Richardson was undermost; my shop-mate said, "D-n you, are you going to murder the man; "the men were then picked up.</p>

               <p>Q. The first person you saw stripped was the deceased? - A. No; the first person I saw stripped was Painter.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Richardson stripped, and coming out? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Was you at the beginning of this unfortunate affair? - A. No, I was not; I came down from my own house, Richardson was standing with his back towards his house, and Painter and he fighting a round, and Painter threw him down right a-cross the kennel; I went to pick him up, and somebody gave me a kick a-cross the nose; who it was I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You parted them, did you? - A. Yes; I took him away to the Bell public-house, and desired Mr. Brunnell to rub him in the face with some brandy, to prevent him having black eyes; I left him there; his face seemed to be bruized very much, it was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You looked upon it as a mere black-eye business; you did not know any harm was done? - A. No; not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see whether he was washed under a pump? - A. There was no pump in the place, he washed his hands under the cock; he was not there a quarter of a minute, I don't suppose there was a quarter of a pint of water on him.</p>

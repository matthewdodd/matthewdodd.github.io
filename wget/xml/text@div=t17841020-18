             bought two yards and an half of flannel, which she paid for, and the instant they went out, I missed a pair of silk stockings; they all came in and went out together, they staid about five minutes in the shop, I did not see them take the stockings; I saw them in the hands of Spencer, while she was in the shop; I thought she was putting them out of the way that they might not fall down, or something of that kind, but I saw them on the counter after that; I said, directly after they were gone, that they had stole a pair of stockings, and I bid the boy run after them; he went and brought Baker back, she said, she had stole nothing, I asked him why he did not bring the other back, he then went again, and brought back Catherine Spencer, with the stockings in her hand; she said, she did not mean to steal them, she thought the other woman had bought them; they had a particular mark on them, which I myself put on them with the price.</p>
               <p>I see these stockings are in form of a printed T, therefore you cannot swear to this being your hand writing? - I know it is my mark, I know the stockings, I know they lay on the counter, they were brought back from a Gentleman who did not like the colour of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Spencer. Did not I stop at the door a few minutes after I left the shop, with the stockings in my hand? - I did not see you.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts did the prisoner Baker stand in the shop? - All together.</p>

               <p>I went after the prisoners, I saw Spencer take up the stockings, and lay them down again, Mr. Carter desired her, I called them all three back, Baker was the nearest to our house, they were about twenty yards off; Spencer was in the middle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200038"></xptr> and the other women a little before; Baker came back, and I went after the other two, and I saw the stockings in the hand of Spencer openly.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not she attempt to conceal them? - No.</p>
               <p>Had she not a cloak on? - No, I asked her to deliver the stockings, I told her they were ours, and she said, she would not, but she would come back with me; I did not hear what she said when she came back.</p>
               <p>What reason did she give for chusing to come back rather than deliver the stockings? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>This good woman came to me in the morning, and asked me to go with her to buy with a few articles, we went to several shops, and she bought several things; we went into this shop, and she bought some flannel, it was put down, and every thing she bought in the course of the day, I put into my apron, and I was to have the making of them; I never observed the stockings till the boy came after me, when I came back the Gentleman asked me what business I had with his stockings, I begged his pardon, and told him I took them through a mistake; they took us to the office, and they sent to the hosiers and to another place, and those people said, they had lost nothing, and found every thing very right.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into this shop, and asked for a bit of flannel, I bought two yards and a half at fifteen pence a yard; the boy came after me, and said you have stole a pair of stockings; I went back and said, you are welcome to search me; they sent for a constable and searched me, and the constable took fifteen guineas out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - My husband is a traveller and pedlar in the country, he settled me in London till he returned again from Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Were the stockings in a paper? - The stockings were laid on the compter on a bit of paper, she had the paper about them in her hand, the third woman had the flannel, she did not come back.</p>
               <p>Spencer. The stockings were in the flannel, I had it then, but after I was taken into custody the third woman had it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Baker called one witness to her character.</p>

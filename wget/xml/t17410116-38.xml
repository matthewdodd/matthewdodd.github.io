             . On the 17th of December, about 11 at Night, I lost my Gelding out of the Stable , and the next Morning I found him in Paddington Pound. I likewise lost the same Night 18 Geese and 9 Ducks; and as I was on the Road coming to Town, I met a Man, who told me he had seen a Man selling such Fowls as mine in Carnaby Market ; accordingly I went to one Bowton's , a Butcher in the Market, and he shewed me a Duck which he had bought, and I knew it to be mine. The Prisoner Willis was described to me to be one of the Persons concerned, and I took him a-bed at his Lodging; I charged him with robbing me, and he owned that he and Briggs took the Ducks and Geese, and finding them pretty heavy, they took the Gelding out of the Stable, and loaded him with them; but when they came to Tyburn . they turned him loose. I found 12 of my Geese at Willis's House, but all my Ducks were disposed of. He gave me this Halter, and said, it was the Halter which was on the Gelding, when they took him out of the Stable.</p>

             . I went with Mr. Twyford to Willis's House, and found him a-bed; we charged him with taking these Things, and he confessed that he had taken the Fowls, but did not own the stealing the Gelding till Brigg's was taken; after we had secured him, we went after Briggs, and found him a-bed; he confessed every Thing, and did not desire but to be transported, but hoped he should not be hanged. After this we brought them both before Sir Edward Hill, where Willis said, that Briggs fetched the Gelding out of the Stable, and they both came away together.</p>

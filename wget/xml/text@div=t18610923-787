                  </hi>. I carry on business in the firm of Coster, Beater, Dennant, and Russ, 3 and 4, Aldermanbury—the prisoner was a clerk in our employ—he was chief cashier—his duty was to receive monies, for which he was to account to Mr. Dennant—he was to enter them in his cash-book, which was kept by him alone—from something that came to my knowledge, on Monday, 5th August, I had an interview with the prisoner in the counting-house—I told him that I was quite sure there was dishonesty on his part, that if such was the case, he had better confess it, for I was determined to find it out—Mr. Lovell, the ledger clerk, was at this time also in the counting-house, and I said to him, "Lovell, do you know if Ward has robbed us?"—about that moment Ward left the counting-house, leaving Lovell there alone with me—Ward came back in about ten minutes and flung down this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The ledger was kept by Powell, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By Lovell—hi has posted that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he posted the ledger from the cash-books—there, was the credit cash-book also, kept by the prisoner—Mr. Dennant, my partner, balanced with him every two or three days—the prisoner's duty was both to receive and pay monies—one of the partners, either Mr. Dennant myself, signed the cheques—when a customer like Mr. Weeks, who was teemed very highly, wanted money for a few days, we had no hesitation in letting him have it—if it was of any amount it was lent by cheque—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be beyond all question by cheque—being by cheque the amount would appear in the pass-book, and in the cheque-book where the cheque was drawn—the cheque-book is here—the pass-book is not; it is in Alderman bury, I suppose—I do not know where it is—I have never seen it—the cheque-book I hare seen, and the banker's-book; they are here—I have not seen the pass-book—there would be no difficulty at all in testing the accuracy of an entry—there was not anybody, I believe, whose duty it was hi to check the cash-book with the ledger as posted—there are three partners in the firm who attend to the business; and one has been very ill for the last two or three years and been unable to give his attendance—there was no one whose duty it was to check the entries in the cash-book—nobody has ever done it at all—there was no one whose duty it was to check to accuracy of those items there, of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and such sums—it would be put in the balance-book, and would be assumed to be correct—I have been in the firm some fifteen or sixteen years—that is the mode in which the business has been conducted ever since I have been in it—I belive there is not any check at all upon the accuracy of any items, either a the cash-book or ledger, and never has been since I have been in the firm—the amount of transactions which have passed through the books in that way in the course of the year is, perhaps; 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the case that that is the way of business; that there is that amount passing through the books in the course of the year, and that there is no check to the items, great or small—that position up to recently, eight or ten yean ago, was filled by one of the partners, and consequently no check was required—for that eight or ten years, since the duty has devolved on a clerk, that sum has passed through the books without any check being made on it at all—Mr. Weston was the chief cashier up to the time the prisoner entered on that position—I should say, from memory, that he has ceased to be cashier eight or nine years—the prisoner has been chief cashier eight or nine years—certainly there has been some investigation into the state of affairs during that time—we always knew exactly our position—there was no yearly or half-yearly audit of accounts—the accounts have never been audited since I have been in the place—balance-sheets were made up twice a year on an average; occasionally, only once a year—I was not is the habit of borrowing from time to time sums of money from the chief cashier privately—I was in the habit of drawing money for my private expenses through the chief cashier, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as I wanted it—it may have been perhaps, as much as 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I drew in that way in the course of last year—it may have been as much as 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I do not think it was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you were debited to the extent of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., advanced to you in sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, could you check that, whether it was accurate or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would never be the case—it would be impossible that such a case could arise, as I balance with the prisoner every three or four weeks—it is never more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that goes before my partner sometimes every two days—there was an account kept of advances made to me—there was the prisoner's balance-book showing the monies that I had; the book which went before my partner every two days—there was no entry made at the time—I have kept memoranda, but I have destroyed them or thrown them away—there is no book which is handed to me and in which I make an entry at the time, of the amounts—there was no book which it was the prisoner's duty to keep, in which from time to time, as the advances were made to me, entries ought to be made—I believe he did keep an account—I never saw any such book—he would keep a memorandum on his file—nothing more, I believe, than a mere slip of paper—that was the way in which monies to the amount of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year in the aggregate ware handed to me; but never more than 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—my brother borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the prisoner, I do not know how long ago—I did not know it at the time—it came to my knowledge some eight or ten months ago—my brother has nothing whatever to do with the firm—there was no other loan from the prisoner to him—I only know of that one—the prisoner was never required, that I am aware of, on the occasion of the balancing every two or three days, to hand over the balance in his hands—I did not transact the counting-house matters—I have never known him required to hand over a balance—he simply gave I O U's for the balance—I O U's for any balance which appeared against him at the end of the two or three days were treated as a debt against him—he accounted for the items in that page of the banker's book—I know nothing about whether he kept a banking account himself—sometimes he has had as much balance as 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that would chiefly consist of half-notes, bills, I O U's, traveller's expenses—there would never, I should say, be large amounts of cash in his hands; never more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—I cannot tell—I judge so—some of them were cash balances in his hands so far as I know—I do not know anything about how much they were—Mr. Dennant is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the only book in which there was any account pasted between the prisoner and Mr. Dennant? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, The only book which showed the results—it was Mr. Dennant's duty to check them, not mine—that book was an account from the prisoner to Mr. Dennant of the balance every two or three days—Lovell has been our ledger-clerk for, I should think, eight or ten years, I cannot tell—he is here—I am not aware that I have mentioned in evidence, before this morning, the statement that I made, "You can do so if you like; but mind, I hold out no promise or inducement"—I have spoken of it before this morning; not in the prisoner's presence, that I am aware of—I was not present at any consultation between me and my Counsel—I am quite sure that it is the very expression I made use of to the prisoner—I made no memorandum of it—I have no written memorandum of anything that transpired—I did not say, "Remember what I told you yesterday"—nothing of the sort—this was on the same day—I did not make any allusion to what had taken place in the morning—I did not know that I had</p>

               <p>held out any promise, and therefore I made no allusion to it—when I said he had better confess; I did not use the words in that sense—his words were, "Whether you prosecute me or not, I shall do so"—they wore his words so nearly that I could not tell them nearer—I mean to swear that he said, "I shall come to-morrow morning and point out those things"—he said that, after he had made a statement; those very words, so that it is impossible for my memory to speak to them nearer—what he said was not that he would come presently and give me information; that was previously—he said he would come to-morrow morning and give me every information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the expression he made use of, "I will give you every info Infor<lb></lb>mation;" and not "I will point out those things?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really am not prepared to say so nearly as that; it was either "point out," or, "give information"—it meant the same thing—I say the words made use of were "I will come to-morrow morning and point out those things," or that which ex<lb></lb>presses exactly the same thing—I would not swear to being correct in any word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did he not, instead of the words "I will point out those things," my "I will come to-morrow morning and give you every information in my power?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I apprehend it is ridiculous It suppose that I can give every word.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your memory on the matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My memory is, that he said those words, as near as I can recollect, "I will come in the morning and point out those things"—my memory is very strong on that point; but it may have been "and give you information"—whether he added "in my power," or not, I don't know.</p>

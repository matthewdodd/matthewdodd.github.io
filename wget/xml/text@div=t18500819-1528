                  </hi>. I reside at Clayhill-farm, Plum-lane, Shooter's Hill. I commenced living there about Christmas, 1848—I was put in by Mrs. Lidgbird, to do the best I could with the farm, and afterwards I was to have a lease of it for twenty-one years, if it answered—it was in as bad a state as it could be; everything was all to pieces—the landlady had the house repaired, and I had the painting and papering inside to do, stoves, and everything put into the house, built a stable and pigery—the farm was of about forty-six acres, and the cultivation had been very much neglected—there had been a person of the name of Wynn in it—I expended on the repairs of the house and on the land about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw Mr. Dallen, the clergyman of Shooter's Hill, Mrs. Lidgbird's son-in-law, about the farm—in Oct., 1849, Mr. Dallen came to me, and said Mrs. Lidgbird was in want of a little money, and would be glad if I could let her have a little—I sent her 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing had been said about the rent for the farm until such time as I had the lease—there was something mentioned, but there was no kind of writing <hi rend="italic">whatsumever</hi>—on</p>

               <p>5th June last I was in the occupation of the farm—I had gone on cultivating and attending to it properly up to that time—there were several horses, and a cow or two, on the farm, two pigs, and one cart—I had furniture in the house, and my wife and six children resided with me—I had no servant—about March or April a distress had been put in for rent—they took the ploughs, harrows, breaks, and everything they could—if they had been fairly told, they would have been worth nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but the ploughs, which cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were sold for about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the harrows at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—a man named Cahan seized them—I have received no account of that sale—on 5th June, about twelve o'clock in the day, the defendant, Graham, came to the door, and demanded 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, as rent, for Mrs. Lidgbird—I told him I did not see what business I had to pay any rent—he then went behind the house, and gave a whistle, and the four other defendants came running in directly, like to many wild beasts—Binks is a broker—I then went to the sty, and turned two pigs out into the yard—Hitchcock said, "Lock the b—up," and he went to take the pigs out of the yard—I went to shy a brick to drive the pigs back, to stop them, and it hit Hitchcock on the leg—I had told them the first thing to quit the premises, and I told them so several times, and asked what authority they had—they made no answer, but "Look him up"—Graham pulled a paper out of his pocket, something about this money—he said he wanted the rent for Mrs. Lidgbird—it was a bit of brick I threw which hit Hitchcock, not a brick—he then pulled off his coat, and challenged me to fight—Mrs. Cook was present in the yard at the time—I believe the children were in-doors, but do not know—Mrs. Cook came out of the house at the same time the men came rushing in—Hitchcock laid hold of a stick which laid in the yard, and ran after me with it; and I ran and picked up another at the back of the house, and defended myself with it—Harris also had a stick, and they all came on me together, saying, "Kill the b—"—I drove them all back, out into the yard, and from the yard into the lane—Harris there pinned me by the arms, and Hitchcock struck me on the head with the stick, and gave me a wound two inches long—I went to Mr. Turner's, a surgeon, afterwards—they then went into the village, and fetched two policemen to lock me up—the blood flowed from my head like a fountain—my wife washed my head, and had some difficulty in stopping the blood—the wound was very painful; I suffered from it for about three weeks, it is healed now—the prisoners did not go away, they remained about the premises, smoking and drinking a good deal, in the stables and in the garden—they were there seven days, night and day, all the five of them—now and then a <hi rend="italic">refreshing</hi> came, and the others went away, but they came back again—on the night of the 8th, Hitchcock and Harris attempted to break into the house, at a quarter-past one—I was outside, watching—they lifted up the window, and tried to force open the shutters—the other men were walking round the front of the house at the time—at the end of the seven days, they took away seven horses, and pigs, and a cart, and a quantity of harness—the horses were grass horses that I had, and belonged to other persons—two belonged to a dealer, that I do not believe had been on the farm, but they drove them on—I cannot say exactly what they did take, but I should say it was to the value of nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an account of the sale some few days after<lb></lb>wards—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed "William Graham," and states they were sold for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Mr. Dallen lives with her—I was put into the farm to do the best I could—they talked of rent when I took up the lease, but I never did—there was a bother about getting a man named Wynne out before I took it—I think when I took up the lease the rent was to be about 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it might have been 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I cannot say—if the farm turned out to our satisfaction I was to have a lease for twenty-one years—I had to lay out a good deal on it—I sold two houses for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mr. Davis's estate—I had to pay a mortgage on them, but I got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the mortgage might be about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I had got money to pay it—I went in between Christmas and March, about the middle of the quarter—I was to pay no rent till they granted me the lease—no time was fixed for granting it—I was to get the land into working order—I did not expect I was to pay a farthing—they were afraid to make any agreement because another man holds the lease, and how could they grant me one; I did not know that at the time—the first distress was about twelve months after I went in—up to that time I had paid nothing; not of rent kind—Mrs. Lidgbird sent down to me, saying she wanted some money, and I sent her up 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this is the receipt she sent me back (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sent it out of kindness—I do not know whether it was lent, paid, or given—I thought, perhaps, she might have been short of money—I believe she is a lady of for<lb></lb>tune—I thought we might arrange it somehow between us—it was neither given or paid—I thought we might come to some terms on different things—she put in the distress in March, for rent from March 1849, to March 1850—I did not replevy—I ordered the broker off the premises, and put him off—I shoved him off—he did not get his head broken—I did not strike him—he rolled over a small lump of dirt by the gate, and caught his heels as I pushed him back, and fell on his back—he was not one of the parties who distrained the second time—perhaps he had had enough of it—the greatest part of the land is grass land, and about fifteen acres of ploughing land—I have had no crops off it—how could I, when they took my ploughs and harrows away—I have had a little hay off the grass land—the two pigs were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not let them out of the sty to prevent them being distrained, but because it is a thing we very often do in the yard—I should have let them out if Graham had not come—I threw the brick to stop them, to turn them back—Hitchcock could run as fast after he was hit as he did before—I might have pitched two pieces of brick; I do not know—the second did not touch the man or go near him—I did not have a bill-hook in my hand—there was one on the chopping-block at the back of the house—I will swear Hitchcock did not wrest it from my hands—I never had it in my hand—Hitchcock took it off the block at the time he took the stick—I hit Hitchcock and Harris with the stick, but the one they hit me with was as big again—I hit Harris on the hand, I think, and Hitch<lb></lb>cock on the thumb or finger—I went to the doctor the same day—I was afterwards summoned before the Magistrate, at Woolwich, by Hitchcock and Harris, and charged with an assault on Hitchcock with the bill-hook, and a further assault on Harris—the prisoners all gave evidence against me, and was bound over to answer the charge at the session—I immediately went before the Grand jury here, and preferred this charge against all five—I had previously taken out summonses against them, but there was no inquiry on my charge before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cook. On 5th June, as my husband and I were sitting at dinner, I heard a rap at the door—it was Mr. Graham—he wished to go in-doors, and I wished to know why—my husband went to the door, and he said he was to distrain by Mrs. Lidgbird's orders—they stood talking outside, and I closed the door—I afterwards heard Graham whistle, and five or six men came into the yard to him—they came with very abusive language, not fit for me to repeat—Hitchcock threw down his coat and hat and challenged Mr. Cook to fight—Mr. Cook wished to know what they wanted—they said they had come for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he wished to know what it was for, and they began with their abusive language, and would not tell him, no more than it was to distrain by Mrs. Lidgbird's orders—all this was before the pigs were driven out—after the pigs were driven out Hitchcock picked up a stick and followed Mr. Cook—he picked up another, and Harris held him by the shoulders while Hitchcock struck him a blow with his stick and made a wound—I was close to them—I saw the brick thrown—Mr. Cook threw one to defend himself from Hitchcock's stick—the pigs were then driven down the lane by Melton—Hitchcock was making his way towards Mr. Cook with the stick when the brick was thrown—he threw it to defend himself from him—Harris also had a stick; none of the others—Harris had no stick at the time Mr. Cook threw the brick, he took it afterwards—the blow Hitchcock struck Mr. Cook was a very severe one—I bathed his head with two pails of water and a soft towel; it bled very much—he said, "Fetch me some water to bathe my head, I am a dead man"—none of the children were at home—the prisoners remained seven days on the premises, all five of them, and sometimes more, and they were drunk the best part of the time—they made a great noise—the place was never quiet night or day—they were walk<lb></lb>ing about the premises all night, trying to get in—I was very much alarmed—I never went to bed one night while they were there—they had lights in the stable and straw to lie on.</p>

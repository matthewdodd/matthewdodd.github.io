On Sunday morning, the 31st of August, I was called up about one o'clock by Jones. I looked out of the window, and saw my-son-in-law bringing a man by his collar. I dressed, and came down into the counting-house, and found all the articles stated in the indictment moved from the places where they were the night previous. They were taken from the counting-house cupboard, and put on the desk, ready to be taken away. He brought the prisoner into the counting-house. I said the scales were gone. He pointed to them, and said.</p>
               <p>"There they are, Sir." They were on a chair. I said</p>
               <p>"Here is a drawer gone." He pointed to it, and said,</p>
               <p>"There it is." I asked for the key of the cupboard. He shewed it to me on the desk. I gave him in charge. We found the counting-house window lifted up. There are no shutters to it, as it is enclosed in a yard. He said he got into the yard at half-past eight o'clock, and secreted himself by a waggon.</p>

            . I sleep in this house. On the 30th of August, about one o'clock in the morning, I came home, unlocked the gate, and on entering the passage I saw the counting-house door open. I turned aside, and put my hand on a man's back behind the passage door, just outside the counting-house. I brought him out to look at him by the gas. It was the prisoner. I knocked up my father-in-law; took a light into the counting-house, and found these tools moved out of the cupboard. Four cupboards had been forced open. I found he had bored above the lock of the desk with a gimblet, and sawed it about three-fourths of an inch deep to get it open. He said he hid himself behind a waggon about eight o'clock at night among some straw, and after that got in at the window.</p>

               <p>MR. ARCHER. The counting-house is part of the dwelling-house. It is enclosed within the same wall, but is not under the same roof. One wall enclosed the whole. The whole wharf is enclosed from the street, and from the river. He could not get out any way.</p>

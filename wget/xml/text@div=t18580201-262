                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Lowe, of No. 13, Charlwood Street, Pimlico. I knew the deceased child—his name was Harry Clark Tordoff—he was the son of my sister, the prisoner; she is single; the child was a year and a half old when he died—he was always delicate—he had a cough from his birth: the doctor has that on his books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 5, Great George Street, West<lb></lb>minster, and medical officer to the workhouse. I saw the child on the morning after it came in; it was in a very emaciated and deplorable state, covered with sores all over it's body, which conveyed to me the impression that it was the result of neglect, not of disease—it was always under the care of one of the nurses, and I prescribed for it daily, but it did not want medicine, only food—I gave it all the food I thought right—it had arrowroot and brandy—it rallied for a little while—it did not gain flesh at all, but it seemed to have more power—it died on the 11th, and I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion—theblood vessels of the brain were rather congested; the ventricles of the brain were full of serum; the cavities of the heart contained a very small quantity of fluid blood; the pericardium, or membrane surrounding the heart, also contained some serous fluid—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and also the liver, stomach, and intestines—the small mesenteric vessels, which are often in a state of disease which produces wasting, were very little enlarged, but they were somewhat larger than the proper size; I do not think that material—the omentum covering the intestines, which should have a good deal of fat, was entirely transparent; the musoles were very pallid—there was really no cellular tissue between the flesh and the skin, and the whole body was in a very emaciated condition—the heart having that very small quantity of blood indicated extreme want of power and debility—I think the child died from want—there was effusion of water on the ventricles of the brain—there was no evidence of any disease to cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In addition to those symptoms, was the child affected with diarrhoea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it had in the beginning, but it subsided—much mental anxiety or bodily toil would affect the mother's milk, both in quality and quantity—a child suckled with milk which did not give the proper degree of nutriment would sink—when a child is partly suckled by the mother and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802010069"></xptr>
               <p>partly fed by biscuits, diarrhoea frequently follows, and it would lead to further mischief if there be a predisposition to disease—I have frequently met with cases in the higher walks of life when, in consequence of a child being partly fed and partly suckled, a disordered state has arisen—there are cases in which, however great the supply of milk may be, it is of such a quality as not to agree, and disease ensues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLATT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If this was the case, and disease ensued, would you not find something after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you would find the mesenteric glands very much enlarged, and the liver in an unhealthy condition; that was not the case here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the liver be enlarged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not be healthy, but studded with tumours the same as the lungs—the effusion which I found in the brain might have commenced before it came in, or it might have begun to take place before the remedial measures were taken, as, during the nine days it was in the workhouse, it had every thing which my skill could suggest—thestomach often retains it's integrity after symptoms in the brain have commenced—starvation produces effusion on the brain, because the powers are so feeble that the whole of the tissues and fat get absorbed; that supply ceasing, the functions give way, and you get effusion; it is a deficiency of power—I think the symptoms might be produced by starvation and want, and yet the appetite continue—those symptoms would not prevent the food from nourishing—the mischief was done before I saw the child—all I could do would not give it real power—there was some diarrhoea, and that would interfere with the nourishment; it was, undoubtedly, better for what I gave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PLUMTREE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the difference between starvation from want of food and starvation from emaciation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every parent could find a remedy for starvation from want of food—I have seen a child reduced to such an extreme state as this boy was, through the nourishment of the mother not agreeing, and they not liking to have a nurse; in that case a healthy wet nurse becomes indispensible—I cannot undertake to say that the symptoms I found were the result of neglect, but it looked like a case of neglect—there was nothing scrofulous about the sores—there was nothing in the heart to indicate disease, but it was small, empty, and had been acting feebly—I found nothing to account for cough and irritation of the chest; the lungs were healthy—it's head was dirty and sore, but it had not scald head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Perry, of No. 1, Old Pye Street, Westminster. On 1st Nov. the prisoner brought the child to my house and asked for a bed—she sent out for one ounce of arrowroot and a halfpenny<lb></lb>worth of milk—I made some arrowroot with that, and gave it to her, and she fed the child—it looked rather ill, and I asked her what was the matter with it—she said that it had been ill some time—it had a little cap and a frock and petticoat, and she had it wrapped up in her shawl—I saw no trace of illness or cough—it ate a cupful of food rather greedily—she went up stairs to put it to bed, and then came down, saying that she was going out, and would not be long—I asked her if the baby would be quiet till she returned, and she said it would—it was quiet, and slept very well—it's clothes were very dirty—it's flesh was clean, but covered with sores—I saw nothing of the prisoner after she went out, till she was in the station house—she paid me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave the baby some milk during the night, and at half past 7 o'clock I gave it half a pint of bread and milk—finding that she did not come home I went to the workhouse, but they told me they could not admit the child till I had been to the station house.</p>

On the 16th of May I was alarmed about half-past two o'clock in the morning, by hearing the dog bark - I got up, and heard a noise in the hen-house; I went and found four dead fowls at the door, and the prisoner concealed in a corner - they are mine, and were alive the night before - I asked how he got there, and he made no answer. I called the officer, and gave charge of him; I showed him the fowls on the ground, and asked what he had done - he made no answer. He has lived in the parish some time, and was frequently at my house.</p>

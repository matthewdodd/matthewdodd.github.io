                  </hi> I am a jeweller, in partnership with Mr. Thoms, at 43, Ludgate-hill. In Jan. last, the prisoners Gardiner and Holiday came to our shop—Holliday said he wished to look at a liqueur-frame and a cruet-frame, that he had a commission for Hamburgh, and if they suited him he would purchase them—he said they were to be sent to Theberton-street, Islington, to be enclosed with other things that were to be sent to Hamburgh—I showed him some articles, and he selected a plated liqueur and cruet-frame, worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the two—the two prisoners conferred together, and it seemed to me as though Holliday required the approbation of Gardiner before he concluded the purchase—he gave me this card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Thomas Holliday and Co., Commission and General Merchants, London, 6, Pinner's-hall, Old Broad-street")—I packed up the things, and sent them to Theberton-street, by Paton—next day Holliday called again alone, and said that he had a further commission for a gold-watch and gold-guard—he said that the gentle<lb></lb>man who was with him when he purchased the frames was connected with one of the wealthiest firms on the continent, and that the frames were for that firm, which was Schulkhauser, Brothers, and Co.—he showed me this card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Schulkhauser, Brothers, and Co., Merchants, London, 38, Moorgate-street")—he said that that firm owed him a large sum of money, and that if I would allow him to have the gold-watch and guard he would obtain a bill from that firm for the payment of it, including the payment for the frames purchased on the previous day—I said that would be a matter for consideration, in the first place I must make inquiries respecting this firm, which I did, and ascertained that that firm, as well as Holliday and Co., were swindlers—I think this was about 7th Jan.—Holliday came again on that day to inquire if I was satisfied—I said I had not been able to ascertain com<lb></lb>pletely, to my own satisfaction, who that firm was—the result was, that I did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220180"></xptr>
               <p>not let him have the watch and guard, not being satisfied with the solvency of the firm—five or six days after, I made inquiries at Pinner's-hall and The<lb></lb>berton-street, for Holliday and Co., and found that they were gone from both places—I afterwards made inquiries after Schulkhauser and Co., and they were also gone—my attention was called some months afterwards to the ac<lb></lb>count in the papers of some persons who had been taken before the Lord Mayor, in consequence of which I went to Giltspur-street prison—I saw fifty prisoners there, and out of them I selected Gardiner and Holliday—I saw my cruet and liqueur-frame produced before the Lord Mayor, from Mr. Boyee's, the pawnbroker.</p>

                  </hi> I am in the service of Mr. Deputy Corney, who is the owner of Pinner's-hall. I am housekeeper there—I know Holliday, and knew a person named Schulkhauser—Holliday and Company occupied No. 6 as an office—I always understood that the "Company" was Schulkhauser—I have seen him with Holiday at the office—I am not certain whether I know Cusell—Holliday and Schulkhauser came about 23rd Nov., and stayed till nearly the middle of Jan.—I knew of their having gone, soon after they left—several persons called too inquire about them afterwards—they did not pay for the office—they engaged to pay 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for two offices—" Holiday and Co." was on the door—I have seen their cards—this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced by Mr. Benson</hi>)—I have seen cards like that—I do not know where they went to after leaving the office—I cannot say that I know any of the prisoners perfectly but Holliday.</p>

C." and the diamond—that is the mode by which goods intended to be shipped are marked—when I took the invoice on the 11th, Seager said, "Very well," and told me to get the others as quickly as possible—I might have seen him again before the 28th, but only in the outer office, to ask him if Gradiner and Holliday were within, and to deliver the account of the second parcel—I delivered the invoice and general account—the invoice of the second parcel was made out in the same way as for shipping—I do not remember what Seager said about the second invoice—until the 28th, I thought the goods had been shipped for the Cape of Good Hope—I went, on the 28th, for a general settle<lb></lb>ment of the account, and saw Seager—he said Gardiner and Holiday had gone to the docks respecting some goods that there was a dispute about, and had left word that I was to draw a bill on them at three months, as arranged—I asked whether the goods there was a dispute about were mine, or whether my cordage was shipped—he said my cordage was shipped.</p>

               <p>cwt., and that will be 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I wrote him a check for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he signed his name at the back—I never saw him again for two months—the sale which I intended to put this rope in, did not come off, and I advertised a sale for the 5th Aug., and put it in my catalogue as advertised for public sale—on 4th Aug., the night before the sale, Seager came to me, and said he did not wish me to sell the goods in the next day's sale—I said, "Why, you have had my money, I must have the goods turned into money again, I have no reserve on it"—he said, "What shall I give you to pass them to-morrow? because I can sell the rope for more money than you will get in your sale"—I said, "Give me three sovereigns, and clear the rope in the same time the purchaser would, and I will give you the rope"—he said, "I cannot give you there sovereigns, I have only got 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I will be sure to clear it as soon as a purchaser," which was on the Monday, three days after the sale—I found, from a person that had been to look at the rope, that I had advanced too much on it, or I should have charged him 5 per cent.—the sale was adver<lb></lb>tised in the ordinary way; it appeared in the paper for six days—it was a sale by order of the Admiralty—there were also merchants' goods, and this rope was inserted—there were about 300 catalogues circulated—on the day of sale, when I came to the rope, I passed it—Seager never came to clear it—I have never seen him since—the rope is now in my possession.</p>

What tools do you mean, I don't understand you?"—Mr. Crauch said, "Oh, you must know what I mean, it is about those tools which Gardiner and Holliday have got from this chest of mine Mr. Bond for shipping, and which they are now offering for sale"—Cusell stammered a bit, and then said, "What shall I do for my money?"—Mr. Crauch said, "We had nothing to do with his money," and asked what money he meant—he said money he had advanced on them—Mr. Crauch asked what he had advanced on them—he said he could not tell exactly—he admitted that he and his friend Mr. Loup had advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as near as I can recollect he gave us to understand that he had advanced 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.., and Loup the other 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Crauch, Cusell, and 1, then went together to Gardiner and Holliday's office—we saw Holli<lb></lb>day, who said Gardiner had gone to Ramsgate, to purchase a vessel—Cusell said he must be paid, and he went away to fetch his friend Loup—we were to wait till he came back with him—we waited about twenty minutes or half an hour, and finding he did not come back we went in search of him to Loup's office, in Aldermanbury—they were not there—we went back and found Loup and Cusell at Holliday's office, with Holliday—Gardiner was not there—Seager was in the outer office—Loup said that if the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he advanced was paid he had no objection to the goods being given up—Mr. Crauch had not mentioned to Loup the circumstances under which the goods had been obtained from me—a good deal was said—Mr. Crauch said in Loup's presence, that the goods had been obtained for shipping, and they were evidently trying to sell them for anything they would fetch, and if they were not given up, or the money paid, we should go before the Lord May or immediately—this was about 16th Aug.—it was then agreed that I should receive my tools back upon Gardiner and Holliday's paying Loup the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently got my goods back from Johnson and Day—I had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get them back—I was some five days waiting before I could</p>

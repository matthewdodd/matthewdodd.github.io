               <p>ALLEN LAMBERT. On the 2d of March, about eight o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18270405-230-crimeloc1264">Eastcheap</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18270405-230-crimeloc1264" type="placeName" value="Eastcheap"></interp>

I turned round, collared the prisoner, and said, "You rascal, you have taken my watch;" he made no reply, and I offered him a glass of grog to restore it; he made no reply; I then said, "I will give you a bottle of wine," and then offered a sovereign; three or four persons surrounded me; he then said he had not got it; I endeavoured to persuade him to give it me, as I wanted to get home by the mail to Bromley, in Kent; I am sure nobody else was near me; only a few seconds passed before others came up. Kilby then came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you very much in liquor? A. Not till afterwards; I swear that it happened in Eastcheap, not in Gracechurch-street; I did not accuse two other persons; I did not hear the prisoner send for the watchman - he might be sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this gentleman give you in charge? A. He did, after we had been in the watch-house; Kilby did not advise him to give me in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one Myett come up and say, "It is of no use taking this gentleman; I have seen this man charge two other persons, who shook him off, and said 'Get along, you drunken vagrant?" A. No; I dined at the Belle Savage with some friends, and had some wine, but I was sober at this time - but by the suddenness of this transaction and my treatment at the watch-house, I got tipsy; I took no more liquor. I was taken to the Compter, and kept there all night; I might have said it happened in Cannon-street, as both are in one line; I now say it was in Eastcheap; several persons came round us in Eastcheap. When I was in the watch-house I offered 1l. to have my property back; a person there said it was not enough; I then said I would give 2l.; this person then accused me of collaring two or three other person; I denied it, and then he said to the prisoner, "Give him in charge for disorderly conduct;" I was then given in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard a noise up a court in Gracechurch-street, which leads to Gye and Balne's printing office; I went up, and saw the prosecutor and three or four others; he was calling Watch! I said, "What's the matter?" he took hold of the prisoner, and said,"This man has robbed me of my watch;" the prisoner said he would go any where with me, and walked quietly down the hill with me; the prosecutor followed, and fell two or three times on my back in going along; he was so much intoxicated I searched him, thinking he might have his watch, but not know where it was.</p>

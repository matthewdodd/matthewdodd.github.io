                  </hi>. I am a gold and silver refiner, at No. 89, Aldersgate-street. On 26th May the prisoner came to my shop, about 11 o'clock—he offered for sale some spoons and forks, which I produce—they have a mark on them, which has been erased from one of them—I kept him engaged, sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—they all bear marks of erasure except one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Place's-cottages, New Town. I have charge of the plate at the Euston and Victoria Hotel—these spoons and forks are part of the property which was in the victoria Hotel—they are marked "H. and C."—they are usually in the coffee room, which is a public room—we have missed upwards of twenty within the last eighteen months—we have missed nothing within the last six months—I have no acquaintance with the plate of other hotels—I do not know that the plate of other hotels is marked with initial letters, such as "C," for coffee room—the coffee room is not a part of the hotel—the hotel is private, but the coffee room is public.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head waiter at the Victoria Hotel, Euston-square. These spoons are some of my property—I know them by the marks, and there are two on which I distinctly see the impression of the crest—the crest consists of a coronet and a garter—there are some other marks upon the spoon—the figure "7," and the letters "C. and H.," which stand for "Coffee room and Hotel"—I do not know the prisoner—I could not swear to him.</p>

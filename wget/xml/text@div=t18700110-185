I keep a general shop, at 18, Belmore Street, Wandsworth Road—one night, 16th December, I went out a little after 9 o'clock—the shop-door was a little way open—there was nothing the matter with the window when I left—it was broken when I came back, and I missed a square red box, containing about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, from a shelf by the side of the window—the glass was broken enough for anyone to put their hand in, and take the box—next morning I received some information, and found the box over a wooden fence belonging the London and South-western Railway—it was empty, and it has no fastening.</p>

On Thursday morning the two constables came down to our house, and took me and John Wright out of bed, and took us down to Larkhall Lane, and fetched the lad to swear to us—he took no notice of me—he picked out a detective first, and then he picked out John Wright—he slept in the same room with me, at 11, Portland Cottages, and on the 16th last December, the two prisoners were in my company from about 11.5 to 11.7, at the Royal Albert, playing at dominces—there were two more young <hi rend="italic">chape</hi> there, named Henry Lubbert and Tom Dickson, but he has gone for a soldier, I believe—I believe there is a young man named Atkinson, down the road, I don't know whether he was there—there were several other persons in the house, but that was all that was with us—there were five of us playing together—I did not hear of William Wright being taken into custody ou 17th December—I had not seen him for a long while—I know John Wright was taken before the Magistrate—I went</p>

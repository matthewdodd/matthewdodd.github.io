            , a smith; we live at Little White Lion-street, Seven-dials. Avis, an officer of Bow-street, introduced me to a person of the name of Fidler. I went with her to No. 1, William-street, Spa-fields - twice on the 10th of October with her, and again on the 11th, by myself. Avis gave me two shillings and a sixpence - I had no more money about me - it was all marked before it was given to me. He put the mark on one of the letters, I think it was I. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220052"></xptr>about eleven o'clock on the 11th, and tapped at the window, because Fidler told me to do so - I did not tap the day before. Mr. Nash came to the door; when I went in I saw Mrs. Nash, as I then understood her to be - they were both in one room - she was sitting rubbing some half-crowns with some stuff; she had some white stuff on her right hand, and some liquid on her left, and was using both; she asked how many half-crowns I wanted; she put her hand under a cloth and pulled out four; the white stuff was thick, like paste. Mr. Nash followed me into the parlour and remained. I saw a candle by her, and she held the half-crowns over it, in the flame, and then put each into a separate paper. I paid her 2 s. 6 d. for three, and put them into a little bag. The officers stood at the door, and took the bag when I went out; they rushed by me just as I came out; one of them asked me of whom I got the half-crowns, I said from the lady, pointing to the female prisoner.</p>

            . I have heard the evidence of the last witness as to the transaction; what she mentioned with respect to myself is true. I had her in sight the whole of the way. Taunton took the bag with the three half-crowns from her, as she came out of the house. When I went into the room the prisoners were standing by the table - I took them, and handcuffed them together. I told the woman to keep away from the table; the right hand was not confined, and she cooked the cup off the table, which contained some white liquor - I found some white powder. There were thirty-three half-crowns and twenty shillings uncoloured. I searched the table drawer, and found five shillings and two sixpences, base money, in a finished state. I saw Taunton search

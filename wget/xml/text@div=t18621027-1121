I am a carpenter, in Park-place, Carlisle-lane—I was at Marsh-gate on the night of 5th October, close under the window of the Crown and Cushion—I saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor's head down, while a woman took a purse out of his pocket, and handed it to another man, and they all went down the New-cut together—I afterwards saw the prisoner come back, and I gave him into custody—the prosecutor was in<lb></lb>toxicated—I knew the prisoner before by sight.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Berners street, Oxford road. All that I know, about half past five I saw the prisoner come across Berners street with a box on his shoulder and a bundle under his arm, the same morning the fire was at Covent garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see in what direction the prisoner was coming from - A. He was coming up Newman street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come along Oxford street or Castle street - A. He came along Castle street into Berners street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know at that time that Covent garden theatre was on fire - A. I saw it was on fire, and heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him - A. No, I did not take any notice of him first of all; he had passed me thirty yards before I took any notice; I should not have taken any notice then if he had not let the box fall on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to you to be by accident or design - A. It was an accident; the box fell down, and the side was broken in, and the money fell out; he took up the box and put it on his shoulder again. I followed him up Wells street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260041"></xptr>Q. Did you hear the money jingle on the pavement - A. Yes; he did not stop to pick it up; the working men picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask the working men for the money that picked it up - A. No, he set off and left it, in the direction of Castle street, towards the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk - A. He walked pretty sharp, he did not run, and by holding the box on his shoulder the bundle got loose; a gown, petticoat, and a blue jacket, were hanging down under his arm; I went up to him and said, my friend, I think you have been to the fire at Covent Garden; he said what was that to me, or something of that sort; then I looked at at him and took him by the collar, I saw he had a very fine shirt, and a black silk handkerchief in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean besides the shirt he wore - A. Yes, and a black silk handkerchief besides. I asked him where he was going to with the box; he said to No. 3, in Margaret court, Cavendish square; I told him there was no court of that name near Cavendish square, I have known Cavendish square well, near forty years; there is one of that name at the corner of Oxford market. I believe I told him then, as he seemed to be so saucy, I would take him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him there was no such court as Margaret court near Cavendish square, what did he say, did he correct himself, and say I mean Margaret court, near the market - A. I will not be positive whether he did or not explain it at Oxford market. When I told him he should go the watchhouse with me, he threw down the box and said, then you shall carry it; I took him by the collar, and called my partner, Hughes, to carry the box; Hughes carried the box. I took him to Marylebone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing as he was going along - A. No, nothing particular past then. I delivered him up to the constable, and left him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shirt and with the black handkerchief - A. They are in the box, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You have not told us all - A. I have told you all.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you have not told us all, because he told you that he brought the things from the fire - A. He told me that he brought the things from the fire! he never told me so.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said to him, I think you have been to the fire at Covent Garden, you said, he said what is that to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In your deposition you said he said they had been given him by some person at the fire - A. I never said so, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have not only said it but swore it - I have just another question to ask you - He was very drunk, was not he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your attention called to him by his staggering about - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he, as he passed you, appear to be a drunken man - A. No; I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He let the box fall, and the end of the box was broke by the fall, and several shillings fell out, and he did not take any notice to stop and pick them up - you saw him pick up the box and not the shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when he took up the box, down fell the bundle - A. I do not think he was quite sober, but he was not so drunk but that he could carry the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sober now - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            . Q. Are you a watchman - A. Yes; my station was at the corner of Titchfield street. On the morning of the fire at Covent Garden, I was calling half past five going down Castle street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far down Castle street does your beat extend - A. To the corner of Adam and Eve court, not quite so far as Well street. I saw the prisoner come with a box on his shoulder, and the watchman after him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner had your partner hold of him - A. No, he was following of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw him with the box did he appear to you to be in a state of drunkenness - A. He walked sturdy enough to carry the box, but he did not appear to be quite sober. When he came from the opposite side of the street, my partner laid hold of him and told him he should go with him to the watch-house; he said if he was to go to the watchhouse he should carry the box, and he hove the box down; my partner collared him and then called me to carry the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account while you were by where he got the box from - A. Not while I was by; I put the box on my shoulder and carried it to the watchhouse and there left the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he reel at all - A. Not before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Did he walk straight - A. He walked so straight that he carried the box.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer - A. He did not appear to me to be sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk straight - A. He did walk straight so far as the corner of Castle street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he walk straight all the time you saw him - A. He did, from the corner of Adam and Eve court to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I dare say you had made him sober then - from the first time that you saw him, to the time that you took him to the watchhouse, did he walk straight - A. He did not come five yards before my partner laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for those five yards did he appear to walk straight - A. He did appear to walk straight.</p>

            . I am watchhouse keeper to St. Marylebone. I searched the prisoner; I found upon him a habit shirt and a bit of a silver spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any black silk handkerchief - A. No, that was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the habit shirt - A. That was in his pocket and the spoon too, I believe; when I pulled the habit shirt out the spoon dropped down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sensible - A. Yes; he was sensible; he was rather in liquor; he said they were given him at Mr. Salter's, Covent Garden; he wanted me to go in the morning and let Mr. Salter know, and likewise for to go to Margaret's court, Oxford market; he said the people that lived there were relations.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he was and where he lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260042"></xptr>- A. He told me to go to his wife in Stanhope street, Clare market, in a court there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was not he like a person, though very improper, that had been sitting up all night drinking - A. Why he seemed stupid from liquor, and for want of sleep.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the house drinking gin and water at the same time the alarm of fire began; I cannot saw whether it was her or another that put the box down by the side of the glass, and shoved the glass down; I was dozing, and their shoving the glass down awoke me. Mrs. Graham was in the house, she said for God's sake take this box and bundle and go off with the servant; I was so drunk I could not tell what I did; I took as much care of the box as I could in my druken state, and gave answer where I lived, and desired them to send down to Mr. Salter's immediately.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Aldgate High-street. I received some information, and told the prisoner I wanted to speak to him. He said he knew what I wanted-it was the first time. I said how many have you got? I had not charged him with anything. He said half a score, I asked the price of them. He said half-a-crown. I said, "Then the market has fallen." He gave them to me out of his pocket. They appeared quite fresh. He said he bought them of a Jew, in Petticoat-lane. He emptied them out of a paper which they were in.</p>

            . The ten shillings are all counterfeits, and of the same die, and appear never to have been uttered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Jew offered me the money. I refused to have them. He sent a boy to follow me. I afterwards found half-a-crown taken out of my pocket, and this money put in.</p>

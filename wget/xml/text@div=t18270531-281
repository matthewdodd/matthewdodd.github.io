No; he was frequently left in the shop if he wanted change - I always left a lad in the shop who had got change, if it was wanted, except on this occasion; if he was out he could send the servant for change.</p>

            . On the 25th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Hollins gave me three half-crowns and three shillings; I marked them, and sent Hall to purchase 1 lb. of tea and 6lbs. of sugar; I gave him all the money I had marked; the articles came to 10s. - he brought me 6d. change; I afterwards examined the prosecutor's till, when the prisoner was sent out, and found two shillings short of that money - this was in about half an hour; the three half-crowns and one shilling were there; an officer was called in, and when the prisoner came home, I said, "You have robbed your master;" he said, "No, Sir, you are mistaken, I am an honest man; I have only two shillings, which I brought from my wife this morning;" he was searched, and the two marked shillings and two other shillings found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it your money? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLLINS. It was agreed that the purchase was not to stand good; it was only to detect the prisoner; the goods were returned. He said nothing about giving charge.</p>

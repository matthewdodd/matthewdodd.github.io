            . I am an officer. The prisoner was at the watch-house on the 30th of May; he acknowledged to me that he had pawned the diamond in Shoreditch and buried the ticket in his father's garden - I went to his father's and searched the garden, but could not find it; I found this diamond had been offered at different pawnbroker's, and found it had been pawned at Mr. Cotton's for 1s.; I took it out to see if it would correspond with the watch - which it did.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Woodbridge. On Thursday, the 5th of May, in consequence of information, I went with a search-warrant to the father of Drake, a labouring man, at Redfield-street, Woodbridge, and found her and her mother there—I told her I was come with a search-warrant to search for property stolen from London—the prisoner asked me what property—I said, I dare say she could tell me better than I could myself, and asked her to show me her boxes—she showed me two boxes—I searched a clothes-box, found a small mahogany box in it, opened it, and it contained a gold neck-chain, which I produced, a gold brooch, a gold tooth-pick, a bodkin and case, and a pair of small scissors—in the large box I found a pair of stockings marked "E. S."—I took a pair of gold ear-rings out of her ears—while I examined the box, I saw her put something into her bosom, and took from her bosom six silver tea-spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs—I took her to my house—her uncle came to see her there, and requested her to tell the truth about the mat<lb></lb>ter,</p>

The prisoner is my sister—I lodged at No. 2, Molineaux-atreet, West-end, at the time I was examined—I have left now—I lived there about three weeks ago—several servants lodged in the house—the prisoners Gowland and Barry had the second floor front and back room—they had their dinner and breakfast always together, and kept the lodging-rooms jointly—they lived in the front room, and the servants, who lodged with them, slept in the back room—they did not keep the house, only the second floor—a day or two after I had been there, Mrs. Barry told me my sister had been staying with her for a fort<lb></lb>night, and had taken her a watch to sell, and she said Mr. Gowland had taken it out to sell—that was all she told me about it then—when I beard my sister was taken in the country, I came home to Mrs. Barry's house and told her I heard my sister was taken for the robbery—I told her about the watch—it was about ten o'clock at night—she went and called Gowland up, and after that we all three went out to get it out of pledge—I stood at the corner of the street till she came back—it was the same night—I went out with the two prisoners—they walked together, and I by the side of them—we went into Oxford-street—Barry went into some back street, I and Gowland stood at the corner till she came back—I cannot say where she went—she was gone about ten minutes—when she came back she told Gowland to take the watch, and put it into hit pocket—she put it into his hand—we all went home, and went to bed—when we were going to bed, she said we must get up very early in the morning, and take this watch down into the City—I had told them I had an uncle living in the City—the said they must get up very early and take it to my uncle, who was to take it and give it up to the Lord Mayor, or to the prisoner Drake—we got up next morning a little after six, and had breakfast—Mrs. Barry said, "Be as quick as possible, and take the watch into the City"—we were going into the City, and met a constable coming—I told him Gow<lb></lb>land had got the watch, and they were apprehended.</p>

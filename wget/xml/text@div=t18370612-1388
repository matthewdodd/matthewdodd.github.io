                  </hi>. On Sunday, the 28th of May, I was at the Jolly Ostlers, at Uxbridge—I went there about half-past ten o'clock—I did not stay half an hour—I came out before eleven o'clock—there were plenty of people there, but they were all strangers to me—the two prisoners were there all the time I was—I had only one pint of beer—when I came out, the two prisoners and another came out after me immediately—the other, who if not taken, came up, and seized this medal, which was hanging on my side, with a ribbon—(I have been in the Queen of Spain's service, under General Evans)—he asked me if it was silver—I told him it was not, it was composition—he drew out his hand, hit me in the mouth, and knocked me down—Stevens then came up to me, while I was on the ground, put one foot on my sto<lb></lb>mach, <hi rend="italic">and another on my throat</hi>, and with his hand he unbuttoned my coat, and took from me a bag, containing a shilling, a penny, and a half-penny—he then went away—the other prisoner stood about ten yards from me, and called, "<hi rend="italic">Fogle</hi>, hunt the b——! the medal! the medal" but he never came near me—they then all ran away—they were all strangers to me—I never saw them before—I laid on the ground about ten minutes, and then got up to look for the watchman, and gave him information about two o'clock the same morning.</p>

               <p>so very often, and he spoke to me so very cross, I thought it not worth while to tell him, but I told the under-watchman the moment I saw him—I do not suppose there is any one here who saw me with the shilling and bag—I was not begging while I was at Uxbridge—I did not beg of a gen<lb></lb>tleman in a chaise that afternoon—I did not ask alms in Uxbridge—I did, coming into Uxbridge—I saw Kedge next morning, when he was taken into custody—I knew him directly I saw him—I said at once, "That is one of the men"—I asked him to speak before I swore to him—I did not at once swear he was the man, because he had not the coat on which he had at the time—I said to the constable, "That is the man; but I should be more positive if he spoke," because he had a long coat on that night; by his speaking I should identify him better.</p>

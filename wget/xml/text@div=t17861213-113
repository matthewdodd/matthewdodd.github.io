               <p>(The indictment opened by Mr. Fielding, and the case by Mr. Solicitor General, as follows, viz.)</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: It is necessary for me to state to you, that the indictment now preferred, imputes a crime to the prisoner of the last importance in a country, circumstanced and situated as this is; without a free and uninterrupted circulation of the paper money of this country, in which an infinite proportion of it's property consists, it is evidently clear that trade can no longer exist; and so sensible has the legislature been of this, that for many years last past, they have thought no security could be sufficient against the embezzlement of letters, or bank notes contained therein, excepting the exposing the transgressor to the hazard of his life. Gentlemen, I state thus much to you, God knows not to prejudice the prisoner, or tincture your minds in the smallest degree against him; but to convince you, and every man in this Court, that a frivolous or vexatious prosecution is not laid before you; and that there is public and essential, and material ground for this prosecution: I say this, knowing as I do perfectly well, that no twelve gentlemen of this City can get into that box, without being impressed with a still stronger duty, which is the attention to the interests of their fellow subjects, and fellow creatures: on the one hand therefore, you will be impelled by public necessity; on the other hand you will be impressed by the feelings of men, and from these two contending forces, your judgment I am convinced will go in a strait and right line.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the unfortunate prisoner was employed as a <rs id="t17861213-113-deflabel569" type="occupation">supernumerary letter carrier</rs>

Gentlemen, enquiries were made by Mr. Fawcet after this letter at the General-post-office; no account could be given there of any individual letter; but you will see the channel into which it got, and you will find it was in a regular course of transmission to him; Mr. Fawcet was casting about in his mind how he could trace so, valuable a letter; it so happened, that on the 27th of October, one of these bank notes so inclosed was paid at the Bank; it occurred to Mr. Fawcet in the course of these six or seven days, that it was no very uncommon accident that it might possibly have slipped in among those letters, that the Post-office are in the daily habit of sending to the General penny-post-office; because if it be beyond a certain district they deliver it over to them to deliver; accordingly Mr. Fawcet made enquiry, and on the 30th or 31st of October at the chief Penny-post-office in Throgmorton-street, he learned that on the Friday, the 20th day of October, a letter which had been received in London, addressed to a person of the name of Mr.

             of Bucklersbury, and he desired a Mr. Hayward to make a memorandum upon it, and that it might be returned to the Penny-post-office in Throgmorton-street; in this return this crime was committed; Mr. Hayward being so advised to write upon it Pancrass-lane, he did so, and Mr. Gibbs put it into the box to go to the chief Penny-post-office, all the letters so to be returned, being regularly placed in this box for that purpose. Gentlemen, between seven and eight that evening, Mr. Hayward took the letters out, and this letter of Fawcet's, which had now become remarkable; he did in the common course of office tell the number of letters, and the amount of the postage; the number of letters were fifteen, which were so taken out of the return box; the postage was eight shillings and fourpence; he tied them up, and prepared a ticket to go with them, having arranged them according to the usual course of the office, they were ready for the person that was to take them back to the principal office; about eight the same night, the prisoner, whose employment it was to take them back to the principal office, came to the South office, and he took the letters and the ticket to carry to the great Penny-post-office; these letters were delivered by Dobson, all of them, but this one, between eight and nine that night, at the chief office; on the next morning, on looking at these letters, it was found that there was not fifteen but fourteen, and that there was a very considerable difference between the sum that these letters amounted to, and the eight shillings and fourpence charged for postage, for in truth it amounted but to six and twopence, which is two shillings and twopence short of eight shillings and fourpence; on the 31st of October, when all these circumstances were known, the chief letter sorter of the Penny-post-office sent for Gibbs, who checqued this letter as I have mentioned, and the prisoner at the bar were both examined about this matter, that is material<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130129"></xptr> for you to advert to; of course he would say he delivered all the letters, and Gibbs was very sure that this letter had been amongst them, however he denied it; and there the matter rested for that day; on the 1st of November it was Dobson's duty to have attended, in order to be further employed in the course of the business; but he did not attend on that day, and on enquiry at his lodgings, no such person was to be found; now, these are the two circumstances that are to be connected together in your minds, that he had notice on the 30th of October, and on the 1st of November he absconded; on the 1st or 2d of November he was advertised in all the public papers; this advertisement, it is more than probable, might have come to his knowledge; and accordingly a letter was received by a woman of the name of Kinneaman, at No. 4, Colchester-street, Whitechapel, without any name, but in the following words.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Kinneaman,</p>
               <p>"I most humbly obliged to you if would</p>
               <p>"put the inclosed into the first Penny-post-office</p>
               <p>"as soon as possible, and as in</p>
               <p>"duty bound to pray for you." This was directed to a gentleman of the name of Horne, Mrs. Kinneaman knowing the letter to be of the prisoner's hand writing, though there was no signature, she carried this letter immediately to the General-post office, Mr. Horne opened this letter directed to him, and found it contained twelve bank notes, eleven of 20 l. and one of ten; on comparing these notes, there is every reason to apprehend, and good reason will be given to you to believe they are the same notes; from these circumstances it was adverted to where this letter should come from, and finding upon it the Bawtry post mark, the prisoner was traced and apprehended at Lithgow in Scotland; and on his being apprehended, from what motives I do not know, he himself chose to reveal every circumstance of the case; no sort of insinuation, no intimidation whatever was used, but in the same spirit that he returned all these notes, of which probably he had not made any use, in the same spirit it was, that his mind induced him to tell the whole story. Gentlemen, I think I may venture to say, that that will be demonstrated to you as clear as possible; it will be proved to you, that Tennant during his residence at Liverpool, never had in his custody more than four ten pound notes, one was sent to him by a gentleman of this city of the name of Bowman; and he received the other three from Fawcett, and three of those I can assert to you in the most clear and satisfactory manner, three of the thirty bank notes which I have mentioned to you, were ten pound bank notes, the numbers were 7055, dated 9th July, 1785; 1204, dated 7th July, 1786 and the note stated in the indictment 7553, dated the 26th of September, 1786: now, gentlemen, this was on the 12th, that Fawcett forwarded these notes to Liverpool, of course they were there on the 14th, which is material; Mr. Bowman sent on the 6th of September, one ten pound bank note with other notes, the number is 6042, dated 6th of September 1786; these notes sent on the 16th, must have arrived on the 18th; and this sent on the 12th, must have arrived on the 14th; between the 14th and 18th, therefore, Mr. Tennant was in possession of those four bank notes, and those only he will prove to you; and they will be traced, that he paid away three of those bank notes at Liverpool; two on the 16th, therefore these must be two that Mr. Fawcett sent; the other was paid on the 18th, which was the day of its arrival at Liverpool; and the fourth was transmitted to London on the 18th, in the letter to Fawcett; therefore it is clear that three of those notes were not Mr. Fawcett's notes, because you will have the numbers and dates of those three spoken to; and if three were paid away, that one which was not paid away of such a date, must be the one sent to Mr. Fawcett in the letter. Gentlemen, you will see that these two 7055, dated 9th July, 1785, and No. 1204, two of those sent by Fawcet to Tennant of Liverpool, were paid into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130130"></xptr> Bank on the 18th of October; consequently they must be two of those that were paid to Mr. Tennant of Liverpool; those notes that were paid at the Bank, were paid on the 16th; now the third note, which is the ten pound note, that was put off at Liverpool, was paid by Tennant to a gentleman of the name of

             of that place; he paid it to Mr. Medcalf; he gave it to Mr. Vose, another clerk in that house; he entered from the note itself in the bill book a description of the note, in which it will appear to you, that this note was 6042, dated 6th of September, 1786, and is that identical note that was sent by Bowman on the 16th of October down to Liverpool, Gentlemen, the consequence of this deduction will be, that it will be very clearly proved to you that the note of ten pound No. 7553, was that note that was contained in the letter that was so embezzled; you will clearly see that two of these notes sent by Bowman, were paid at Liverpool, came here to the Bank and were there paid in cash; one of them sent by Bowman was also paid at the Bank; then the only remaining one which never was disposed of at Liverpool, or at all, which never has come to the Bank, and been received there, and which never was received by Mr. Fawcett, is the one that is left, therefore must be the fourth note; in as much as only four notes were in Tennant's possession there, and three of them are traced from his hands to their's. Gentlemen, this is the scope of the evidence I have to lay before you; that such letter was put in by Tennant of Liverpool; that such letter did find its way to the Post-office, at Saint Saviour's, Southwark; was observed and noticed, came into the hands of the Post-office; that a letter was missing, and a considerable portion of the total of the sum of the postages short; it will be proved to you, that four notes of ten pounds were in the hands of Tennant of Liverpool; that three of them were there disposed of; and the necessary and the irresistable consequence, is, that the fourth is this ten pound Bank note; if this evidence is proved, I should conceive that there will be but little doubt of your being under the melancholly necessity of finding the prisoner guilty. If you should think upon the whole, that there is not evidence enough to risque the life of a fellow subject; I am sure there is no man if it be done on good grounds (of which I am not aware) that will be more satisfied than I shall be, with the prisoner's acquittal; at the same time I am perfectly convinced that from the materiality of the case in either view of it, you will freely give it that portion of extreme attention which a case of this sort demands at your hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel, desired to have the witnesses examined apart, except the gentlemen of the Publick Offices.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the chief Penny-post-office in Throgmorton-street; the returned letters are put into my desk; I examined these letters that were returned from the South office, the 20th of October; on the 21st they were fourteen in number, and the postage amounted to six shillings and twopence; and they were marked from Mr. Hayward himself, at the South office, fifteen letters, eight shillings and fourpence; there was two shillings and twopence short; I returned the letters back to rectify that mistake; and they found out the twopence, but could not find out the two shillings; there was an error of twopence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. From the time that these letters that came from the South office were tumbled down upon the table, to the time of the office shutting up, how long might it be? - I cannot tell; I do not know; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130135"></xptr> was not there when they were put in; I saw nothing of them till the next morning.</p>
               <p>How long does your office remain open in an evening? - It used to be open till ten, but now it is shut up some time before.</p>
               <p>Your box where these letters are put into, is it a lock box or an open box? - An open box.</p>
               <p>It is open to any person that chooses to resort to it? - There was no lock and key; there is a place in the office that is partitioned off, so that every letter carrier may have access to it, but he has no business to go.</p>
               <p>But a person being so disposed might go and examine those letters if they please? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Might strangers who come in with letters? - I do not imagine they might; but the carriers may go there if they choose it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find them all in a bundle together in the morning? - I found them tied up as usual, with a ticket which I have now, and the string.</p>

               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner on the 31st of October last? - When I found that this letter had got into the Penny-post-office, and was missing; which I was first informed of a day or two before the 31st: Mr. Fawcet's clerk called upon me; I sent for Mr. Hayward, the clerk of the South office, and I sent for Mr. Dobson the prisoner, and told them there was such a letter missing, and examined them both; Mr. Hayward said, he dispatched Dobson at eight from the South office with a bundle of returned letters, and this letter to Mr. Fawcet, upon which he had written Pancrass-lane; the prisoner declared he received these letters from Mr. Hayward, brought them to the chief office, and there delivered them on the desk; the usual place where the general letters, and Penny-post-letters are emptied; I told the prisoner it was a very serious business, and if he knew any thing of it, it would be better to say something; he declared he knew nothing of the letter being missing, but that he delivered them sound and safe, as he received them from Mr. Hayward.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner or not attend his duty the following day, the 1st of November? - He was not on duty after the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry after him in consequence of finding him not on his duty? - I did not go myself.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any letters from a woman? - On Saturday, the 4th of November, I was sent for over to the Secretary's office, there I found a Mr. Kinneaman, who produced a packet before Mr. Beazley, one of the clerks in that office, and in that packet there was a letter addressed to me.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing written in the letter addressed to you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>What was contained in it? - Upon the receiving that letter, I imagined from the direction of it, it was Dobson's hand writing; the letter contained several bank notes, and one 10 l. bank note, all of which I indorsed with my own name. (Looks at the bank notes.) This is the cover that contained them, and this is the ten pound note that was in that cover.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Dobson's hand writing? - I have seen him write, and I believe this direction upon this cover to be his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Pray was any of them so well done that independent of your knowledge of the paper and other things, you could not know it from your own hand writing? - No, I think upon an examination I could always find out the forgery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

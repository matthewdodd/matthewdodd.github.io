The prisoner was in my employ about two months: I dismissed him, and after that I received a letter from some one, which I made the subject of inquiry; here is that letter - the Grand Jury threw out the bill, and two or three days after that bill was ignored. I received from the postman this other letter, on which this prosecution is found; I had seen the prisoner write while he was in my service, and I believe this to he his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go before the Grand Jury with the former letter, by legal advice? A. I put the whole affair into the hands of a solicitor, but he was committed before I had consulted the solicitor, and I was bound over to prosecute; I presume this indictment was drawn up by my solicitor's advice - I received other letters while the prisoner was in gaol on the first charge; I am not sure whether he is married: he was first taken before Mr. Hoskins, and he wished him to be remanded till Mr. Rawlinson could attend; then I wished him to he remanded to bring forward other evidence, and the third time he was brought up before Mr. Hoskins alone- I think I received three letters while the prisoner was in custody; he left prison on Thursday night, the 16th of December, and on the following morning I received this letter- he was taken again the same night; I think I received two letters while he was in gaol, before I went before the Grand Jury; I did not make either of those letters the subject of any charge before the Grand Jury - (letter read.)</p>
               <p>SIR, - If you do not immediately raise the wages of the persons in your employ, your premises must share the same fate as others have. SWING.</p>
               <p>To Messrs. Braithwaite and Nicholls.</p>
               <p>MR. BRAITHWAITE. These other letters are what I received while the prisoner was in custody on the first charge, and these others I have received since he was in charge this last time; I told the prisoner's wife and a gentleman named Day that I had received them - I saw his wife on the morning after he was first committed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said you believe the letter produced on this charge to be the prisoner's hand-writing? A. Yes - he was my drayman, took out beer, and booked the names of the persons he delivered it to in my books; he was employed about a fortnight or three weeks with the dray, and made entries in the book every day; I have seen him repeatedly - my clerk books the beer, but I was there; my clerk is not here - he could not swear positively to having seen him write, and he thought comparison of writing was not sufficient.</p>

            . I am a brewer, in Oxford-street. The prisoner was in my employ for a year and a half or two years as <rs id="t18310106-17-deflabel100" type="occupation">drayman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310106-17-defend252 t18310106-17-deflabel100"></join>; I had many opportunities of seeing him write in the counting-house of an evening, when he booked his beer - he kept a delivery-book, but that was written out of doors; he entered his name in the book in the counting-house - I believe, from the similarity, this letter to be his writing; I have compared it, and can come to no other conclusion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you saw him write? A. It must be two years, as he has left us that time - I think I have seen him write within two years and a quarter, but it is impossible to speak to a quarter of a year; I think I can safely say I had seen him write a dozen times - it was the booking-clerks' business to notice his writing more particularly.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the clerk in your service now? A. No, he has left me about six months.(Letter read, see indictment.)</p>

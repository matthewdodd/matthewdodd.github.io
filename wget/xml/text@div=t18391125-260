                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-street, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, with my father, William Spiers—it is his house. I bought a silver watch of the prisoner about five weeks ago—I did not wear it at all, but gave it to my mother to take care of, in the course of the day, and did not see it again till it was at the pawnbroker's—I had a box with one sovereign in money in it in the house, and there were three sovereigns and five half-sovereigns in a small box in another room—my own box was in my own bed-room, and there was a half-sovereign lying on a table in the room—the other box was in my mother's care—on the 3rd of November I went up stairs to get some money, as my mother asked me to let her have a few shillings, and I found the box broken open—I had seen that box about a fortnight before—my watch was not in that box—I missed the three sovereigns and five half-sovereigns—I missed a sove<lb></lb>reign from my own box, which was also broken open—I had seen that box safe a fortnight before—I did not see my mother's small box a fortnight before, as I did not know where she kept it—the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my father's house for three or four months—he used to work with me, and came backwards and forwards to the house every other day.</p>

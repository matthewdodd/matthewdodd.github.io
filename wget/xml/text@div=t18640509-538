                  </hi>. I am a master coach-builder, and live at Tollett-place, Brompton-road—on 9th November, Lord Mayor's Day, about a quarter-past 9 at night, I was standing in Tollett's-place, close to my own house, with my wife, a watchman named Nagle, who was watching some premises be-longing to Mr. Cowling a builder, and a young man named Yates—the prisoner was on the left of me—there was a quarrel in a public-house close by, and I said to Nagle, "What a pity it is that these Irish labourers will quarrel, and that the absence of brotherly-love prevails among them so much, whereas it is so prevalent among Englishmen"—the prisoner was close to me, and as soon as I said that, he leaned back and pulled out a small trowel, and said, "Here's brotherly-love for you," and, with an oath, he struck me with the trowel on the left side of the head—I was para<lb></lb>lysed directly; I lost the use of my limbs there and then, and had no more recollection for some time afterwards—about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock that day the prisoner had shown me five different new tools, and wanted to sell me four or five—he had a glazier's putty-knife in his hand amongst them, but before this happened he had pawned those tools for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

No</hi>—one of the tools was a new putty-knife—I am an Irishman, and have great brotherly-love to all Englishmen; I have good right to do so—the public-house was not more than two or three yards from me—I don't know what was going on there; there was some quarrelling amongst themselves—I was not there—I don't know whether they were fighting; they were at high words—I had been attending to my business all day—I left work at 7—I had been into that same public-house for a pint of half-and-half—the prisoner was standing not an arm's-length from me when he struck me; he had to move back when he stabbed me—we were about three or four yards from the corner of the bridge; there was no old gas-pipe near there—it was a new building—there were no bricks lying about—I don't know what the prisoner is, unless he is a bricklayer's labourer—I never knew him before; I had seen him scores of times, but did not know his name, or what he was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I was with him in the Fulham-bridge-road; he was speaking to a man named Nagle—I saw the prisoner take his hand out of his right-hand pocket, and, with a bitter oath, he said, "Here's brotherly love for you," and he rushed at my husband, with something in his right hand, and struck him on the temple—he bled pro<lb></lb>fusely—I could not swear what it was that the prisoner had in his hand; it was something of that form. (<hi rend="italic">Describing it with her hand</hi>)—it was rather dark; it appeared to be iron—the prisoner ran away immediately he had struck my husband—I ran after him, but, of course, he was out of my bands in a moment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you an Irishwoman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I know Mrs. Fraser—I have not spoken to her about this affair since the prisoner was taken—she says she saw it done; whether she did or not I don't know—I did not offer her any money to come up here and say she saw the prisoner do it—I made an offer to any civilian that would give thorough information</p>

                  </hi>. I was married on Low Sunday—on 9th November last I was in the Fulham-bridge-road—I saw the prosecutor and prisoner there, and Nagle and another man—my husband was not there—Barry and Nagle were speaking together; the prisoner was close to them—I did not hear him say anything to Barry, but I saw him take his hand out of his pocket, and strike Barry on the head—he fell to the ground—when he got up he was bleeding from the back of the head—he was carried in—since this I have married a cousin of Mrs. Barry's, and have received some presents from her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 112, Brompton-road—on the night of 9th November last I was called in to attend the prosecutor—I found a large semicircular wound <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the upper part of his head, stretching from the crown round to the front and then backwards to the ear—it was about six or eight inches long, and extended quite to the bone—it was a clean cut, such as would be made by some sharpish metal—I do not think a fall on the hard ground would have produced it, or a fall against a stone—I attended him for about six weeks; the wound healed in about three weeks, it was a severe and dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three years—in my opinion, the wound must have been made by metal of some kind—I don't think a fall against a broken gas-pipe would have done it; it would not be sharp enough—it might be done by a blunt instrument, or by some sharpish metal.</p>

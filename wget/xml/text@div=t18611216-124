                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 1, Bond-street, Chelsea—on 1st December, the prisoner was at my shop between 1 and 2 in the afternoon—I had been out, and when I came in he was bargaining with my wife, and was putting on shoes, and I asked him whether those shoes would suit him better; that was a strong pair—he purchased a pair, and tendered four half-crowns and a sixpence—I put the half-crowns in my pocket—there were no others there—he went away then and took the boots with him—sometime afterwards he came back and brought another customer, who, he said, required a better article than he had had; so I showed him a pair of my best boots—the prisoner said he wanted them for his friend—his friend gave me six half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence for the pair which he agreed to take, and I stood a pot of beer—I put the half-crowns in my pocket—the two men went out with the boots—in, I should say, a quarter of an hour the prisoner returned again and purchased another pair of boots, which were 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I came down sixpence for those, he being a good customer—he paid four half-crowns, which I put in my pocket—all the half-crowns were then in my pocket—I paid two of them and a shilling away that evening to a Mr. Stephens, who came the next day and gave me one back—I cannot say that I knew that one to be one that I had paid him—in consequence of what took place with him, I looked at the other half-crowns—I had previously given them to my wife, and she put them in a basin by themselves—afterwards the whole of this money was taken out—I cannot. exactly say how many there were taken out, but the whole that were taken on the Sunday were taken out—I gave them up to the policeman, Sutton—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the person who came on the Sunday—I had some doubt about him when I saw him again, because he was sitting down.</p>

               <p>—I said it twice—I had no notion that the half-crowns which I paid away were bad—they were brought back to me on the Monday morning, and I then went to the basin—I did not find the bag tied up and the other half-crowns in it—these half-crowns were left loose in the basin—I am sure there was no money except the half-crowns that I received on the Sunday, in the basin—I examined them.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on Sunday, 1st December, I was in the shop and saw the prisoner come in between 1 and 2 o'clock—there was no one but myself and my little grand-daughter in the shop then—he asked if I had got a pair of shoes to suit him—I showed him some—I said I had but one pair of strong boots that I thought would suit him, but they were a customer's pair of boots, and I expected a young man from Marylebone for them—he tried on some of our shoes and found a pair that fitted him at last—I cannot say how long he was before he made a bargain; but a goodish bit—while bargaining with him my husband came in—we agreed on the price, and the prisoner paid my husband four half-crowns and a sixpence, and then went away—he was gone but a very short time when he returned with a friend—I was in the shop then—the prisoner said he had brought a friend who wanted a pair of light boots—a pair was chosen, and he paid six half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence—I think the young man that had them, paid—the prisoner was standing by all the time—he went away, and in a very short time returned again alone, and bought another pair for which he paid my husband four half-crowns—I was in the shop at the time—I am certain the prisoner is the man—my husband gave me the money that evening—I held the basin, and he put the money in it—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was a shilling and two sixpences; the rest was all in half-crowns—there were fourteen half-crowns—this is the basin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that I put the money in—there was nothing else in it at the time I put the money in it, no money—my husband put the silver in this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the Saturday night, and the gold in this purse, and it was put away—the bag was tied up, and the prisoner's money was put in the basin loose—the bag was not in the basin when I put the prisoner's money in loose—the basin was quite empty—I did not afterwards put the bag into the basin; it was put in the drawer—the basin had those half-crowns, and the shilling, and two sixpences—I gave him back that money the next morning, Monday—the money I received from that young man was the same that I gave my husband.</p>

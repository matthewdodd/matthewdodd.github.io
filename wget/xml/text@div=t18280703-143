The prisoner came on the 6th of June, and asked permission to go into my private parlour to take a pint of porter, as he was afraid of some Irishmen coming to abuse him; I gave him leave: I then went out on business, and on returning in threequarters of an hour, I met the prisoner going out: he said he should be in presently: my wife went into the parlour, and cried out, "Stop that man! he has got my candlesticks:" I ran and collared him, and said, "You have got the candlesticks;" he said by his God he had not got them, but an Irishman had taken them; I said, "I shall take you, and you may look for the Irishman:" I found the candlesticks, one in each of his inside pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go there to receive some rents. I had hired an Irishman to put on a lock; I was looking at some prints, and he took them and put them into my pockets; I did not know it till they were found in my pockets. I live with Mr. Brodie, of Lincoln's Inn-fields.</p>

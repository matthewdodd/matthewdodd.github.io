On the evening of the 10th of December a young woman came and told us a cloak had been taken from the door; I went out, and found it on the prisoner, who was walking along Windmill-street, about a quarter of a mile off - it might be an hour after I had noticed it in the shop; I asked him to let me see what he had got in his handkerchief - he said Yes: I said, "Come to the light," and he ran away; I pursued, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there no other persons with him? A. Not at the time I took him.</p>
               <p>ELLEN WEBSTER. I was near the shop, and saw the cloak taken from the door, about six o'clock; the person pulled it down as he went by - I cannot say who it was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Castle-street, and saw two men turn out of Friendly-place, one of whom dropped a bundle; I took it up - two young men came and asked what I had got: the witness then came up, and through fear I did run away, but I stopped when I had got about twenty yards.</p>

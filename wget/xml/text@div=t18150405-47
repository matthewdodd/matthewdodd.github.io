I first went to the prisoner and bought nine counterfeit tokens at the Red Lion Petticoat-lane; I purchased the nine three shilling tokens, I paid him thirteen shillings and sixpence for them. I saw the prisoner there, I told the prisoner I wanted some of the tokens he dealt in; he said, he had nine; he gave me nine, and I gave him thirteen shillings and sixpence for them. On the 15th, I went to him again, at the same place; I told him I wanted twelve; he gave me a dozen; these are the dozen I bought of him on the 15th of February; I marked all the three shilling tokens before I delivered them to Mr. Westwood. I told Avory, the officer, of this; I shewed Avory where this transaction passed; it was agreed that we should go and apprehend the prisoner on Sunday; I saw Avory apprehend him in the City Road, he was selling oranges; I am sure the prisoner is the same person.</p>

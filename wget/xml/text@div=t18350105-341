                  </hi>. I occupy the house No. 3, Charles-street, in the parish of St. George-in-the-East, Middlesex. I have one lodger—I rent the whole house—on the 28th of December, I was up stairs in my top room—I came down for a book between eight and nine o'clock—I went through my shop into the parlour—the parlour window was then open sufficiently for me to put my hand out of it at the bottom—I had seen the window about eight o'clock, and then saw my wife fasten it—my shop door was on the spring-lock, and was shut—it is a whole door—the spring-lock could not be opened outside without a key—I went to a box for a book, and missed a gown, a cloak, and the materials for some trowsers—I did not know how many at the time—my wife had just gone out on an errand, and came in in about two minutes—I stood in the passage till she came in, and next to the street door—when she came in I told her what was gone—she ran out at the street door to give information, and I shut the door, and searched about the place—I could not find any thing about the premises—I could see marks on a chair where a person had got out at the window—my back door was fastened by two bolts—I examined my front door, which was fast as before—I saw my property in about ten minutes afterwards—the policeman found it in the yard, and showed it to me—the gown was loose—and the trowsers and cloak, the band of the gown and caps, were tied up in a handkerchief, which did not belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Charles-street. On the night of the 28th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, my dog made a noise—I went out to examine the back of the premises—it was after candle-light—the dog was trying to ret over the adjoining palings—my house is twelve or fourteen yards from the prosecutor's—I have two houses, and the yard of my second house comes against his—there is another yard between part of my yard and his—I suspected some<lb></lb>thing, and went in, doors where I could not be seen, and watched—I then saw the prisoner coming over the palings of the yard between my house and Wearing's—I immediately went out to him, and asked him from where he came—he said he had been drinking, and got over the yard he did not know how, and the dog would not let him get back again—he said he was looking for a man, a farrier, mentioning some name—the dog was chained—I took the prisoner into custody, and detained him while I sent to make inquiry at my neighbours'; and, in about five minutes, I found what had happened—I gave him in charge of a policeman who came.</p>

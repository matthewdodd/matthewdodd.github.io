               <p>Q. Are you sure they were whole the over night?</p>
               <p>Pateman. Yes; the hinges were wrenched off, the shutters were on the outside; they had put up the sash; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them); the prisoner Fosset had been my apprentice, but had run away; he had lived with me five years. I heard he lived a bad life, therefore I suspected him. We got a search warrant, and I found my goods in his apartments.</p>

             produced the goods, which were deposed to by the prosecutor and his daughter.</p>
               <p>Boucher. I found these things in the prisoner's apartments; he was present at the time; Mr. Pateman was along with me; I was in a room up one pair of stairs; the woman prisoner was with him; as soon as the prosecutor saw him, he said that is the man; I took him by the collar, and immediately Chapman put his hand upon the things. The prosecutor said, O you naughty lad, you have robbed me before, and he confessed it, and said he took them at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you threaten him or promise him favour if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he said if you will forgive me I will go to sea; I said no, he should have what the law would allow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it should be better for him or worse for him, or any thing of that sort respecting a confession?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Boucher. He owned he took them between three and four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked him as to the time?</p>
               <p>Boucher. I believe his master; he said he broke open the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose lodgings are these?</p>
               <p>Boucher. The man's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman there at the time?</p>
               <p>Boucher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the custody of the goods?</p>
               <p>Boucher. They were in the lodgings; they were all in the room: I took this handkerchief from her neck; when the man came in he said it was his handkerchief. An apron was about her feet, it was not tied about her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Boucher. She said they were the things Fosset gave her; and she said she had them from that bundle; she said she had lived with him two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Morley and Gay, of Gutter Lane, warehousemen—on 22nd November I sold to Mr. Johnson, of Yarmouth, seven pieces of twill of different widths—these goods (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are similar in quality and width, but the ends have been torn off to get rid of the marks—they are soiled now as they were before, and two are rather shorter—to the beat of my belief they are the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I sold a great many goods that day, but I had no more of this class of goods, the narrow ones—I am not in the habit of selling narrow widths of soiled stock—it is not usual in the trade to take the marks off, only the weights—other persons sold to Mr. Johnson that day in other departments, and two trusses were made up—twill is a very common thing in the trade—we had seven pieces in the warehouse of the narrow width—we do not sometimes have 100 pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer to Gay and Morley—on 22nd November I packed some trusses for Mr. Johnson, of Norwich—I put some twill into one similar to this—I am not certain whether I or the foreman directed it—the two trusses were handed over to the Great Eastern car<lb></lb>man—the material of the wrappers was similar to this produced—there is no name on this, because it has been cut in pieces.</p>

               <p>I checked Coborn's load, in which were two trusses for Johnson of Yar<lb></lb>mouth—they would be taken off the van and put on the <hi rend="italic">bank</hi>, and taken to the train—the prisoner was employed at the Blossoms Inn.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The Blossoms Inn is in Cheapside, and the goods are taken to Brick Lane—they are loaded into a cart in the yard, not in the street—20 or 30 people are employed there, but not in unloading—I do not know what van these things were put into; I only received them—I saw the two trusses taken off the cart and put on the <hi rend="italic">bank</hi>, but did not see them put into the other van—I remember that it was a wet night, and these were the only two trusses in the load—they are not taken straight from one van to another, they are put on the <hi rend="italic">bank</hi>, and the man calls them off—they have shipping notes—there were 12 or 13 packages.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Dixon is not here—Eills called out the trusses, but other men were calling them besides—I said before the Magistrate "Only one truss was called out to me by Ellis"—that was to the best of my belief—Ellis is not here—Simpson was the driver of the van—it is a closed-in yard; the public have access to it—people are passing by while the packages are there.</p>

About 7. 30 am. on 27th No<lb></lb>vember I went to 3, Squerries Street, knocked at the door, and the pri<lb></lb>soner put his head out of the window and asked what was the matter; he then came down and opened the door—I asked him whether his brothers Arthur and George were staying in the house—he said "No, I know nothing about them"—I said "I will see," and was going in—he put himself in the way and said "You will not go in here unless you have a warrant"—I pushed him aside and entered, and on the ground-floor in a cupboard I found these four rolls of calico standing up—there was nothing else in the cupboard, but there were traces of coal—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for them—he said that he knew nothing about them—three other people lived in the house—he was partly dressed—I told him to go upstairs and dress—I sent for Detective Rolfe, who said that the prisoner wanted to make a statement—I went up and he said "About three weeks ago a man brought the calico to the door on a barrow, and said 'Is this Mr. Green's?'—I said 'Yes'—he said that he was told to leave the things here, and I took them in"—he said that he did not know who the man was, but thought he should know him again—I took him in custody, and on the way to the police-court in a cab he said "I am sorry I took them in, or had anything to do with them; it is very likely they are intended for the old man (<hi rend="italic">meaning his father</hi>); somebody being in the way, they could not bring them there"—the old man had been in custody nearly a month before that—he also said "The man said he would call for them again, but did not do so"—Squerries Street is about two miles from the Blossoms Inn.</p>

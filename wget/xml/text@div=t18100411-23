            . I am a pawnbroker. I live in Little Knight-rider-street, Doctors'-Commons. On the 3d of March the prisoner brought a lamp to pledge I had received information from Mr. Pellatt. I took the lamp to Mr. Pellatt and Green, in <placeName id="t18100411-23-crimeloc133">St. Paul's Churchyard</placeName>

               <p>APSLEY PELLATT, Jun. On the 3d of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, on my coming down to let the men in to work as usual, I perceived both the burners of the street lanthorn gone, and there was a ladder there on the outside of the shop, and one of the panes of glass of the lanthorn was broken. I immediately went to the pawnbrokers round about, and informed them of the circumstance, and described the lamps. About ten o'clock the same morning Mr. Taylor, servant to Mr. Lock, brought the lamp, which I thought to be ours. I immediately called the man who trimmed it, and he swore to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman - A. I never saw her before; she seemed very much intoxicated when she was taken. The ladder that was left on the right side of our shop was not marked; we could not ascertain whose ladder it was; we have it still in our possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Paul's-chain, about six o'clock in the morning, I found the lamp there by one of the pillars in St. Paul's Church-yard. I am a <rs id="t18100411-23-deflabel134" type="occupation">chairwoman</rs>

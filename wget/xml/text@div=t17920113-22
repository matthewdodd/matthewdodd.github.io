            ; I live at West-Ham, in Essex: on the 3d of January I lost thirteen yards of flannel, in two pieces, eight yards and a half of check, six pocket-handkerchiefs in a piece, two ditto in a piece, and one single, five yards of dark brown stuff, one yard and a half of calico in a waistcoat-piece, and one half-yard of kerseymere; I had them all packed in one parcel at Mr. Horne's, Minories, where I purchased them, and directed to be left at Mr. Simms's, the White-hart and Tobacco-pipes, Whitechapel, where I had a cart; my little boy and I went there, and these things were put into the cart; I saw them in, and my little boy was driving me down: rather this side of the bell-founder's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130034"></xptr>in <placeName id="t17920113-22-crimeloc137">Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Is he the same person, on your oath? - He is the very same man; I am quite sure, I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

               <p>How old are you, my little man? - I am little better than thirteen.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What will happen to you, if you should happen to swear any thing that is not true? - I shall go to hell.</p>
               <p>(Sworn.)</p>
               <p>Was you with Mrs. Whitney? - I was; I drove the cart: as I was driving off the stones, my mother said, there are some boys behind the cart; I looked round, and saw this man get off the tail-board of the cart; I had a full view of his face; then he stood about three minutes, looking at us; I looked at him all the while the cart was standing, and my mother called out she was robbed, and a little boy came up and told her there had been two people behind the cart; this was directly as the man was run off; I had seen one on the tail-board before the little boy came up; then they told me to turn the horse round, and stop at the Rotation-office, where she gave information, and we came home; and she went again back that night, and I went with her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had your cart a tilt upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any body that night? Yes, I saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Now be cautious, and speak not rashly; did you, when you saw him at the watch-house, was you sure it was the same man, or did you believe it because other people said so? - I know him from his own person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before you went, a gentleman came to tell you the man was taken? - Yes, we went to him into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>And the man was brought to you; and the man you expected to see was brought to you?</p>
               <p>Jury. We consider it only as the evidence of a child, Mr. Garrow, and you should not try to draw things from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was no intention to draw any thing from him but what is the truth; you do me great injustice to suppose me capable of doing any such thing; but it is my duty, and the duty of every one else, to get at the fact: however, gentlemen, it is in your hands, and much good may come of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went into the watch-house where he was, was any body else in the watch-house? - Yes, I picked him out; he was not shewn to me.</p>

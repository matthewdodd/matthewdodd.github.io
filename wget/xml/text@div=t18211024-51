I shewed it to his young man in the shop, it was never out of my sight - I brought back the same note, and afterwards went out with the prisoner and the goods towards Finsbury-square, and in the way I asked him several times if Mr. Reily was busy, he said They were not very, at present. Before we got to Finsbury, he wanted to turn down a stable-yard in Little  Moorfields, as he said Mr. Reily was down there, and he would go to him; I said I should not allow him, he must go to Mr. Reily's - we went, he was at home, and said in his hearing, that he knew nothing of him, and never sent him - I said, you said you came from Mr. Reily; Mr. Reily then asked him who sent him, he said a gentleman in the street, whose name he did not know - I told him to return the note to Mr. Reily, as he said he had it from him, he said he should not; I said "Have you got the note?" he said "Yes" - I then told him he must go back with me to Mr. Ward, he objected to go; I said if he did not, I would send for an officer, and then he went quietly back to Ward's, who sent for an officer - before the officer came, Mr. Ward searched his pockets but found nothing; I asked what he had done with the note, he said he had thrown it away - the officer found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Cripplegate. On the evening of the 24th of April, the prisoner was given in my charge, at Stevens's wine vaults. I heard the charge against him; I asked him after we got out of the shop, where he had taken the note - he said of his master, on the Saturday evening before, Mr. Turnor, a paper-hanger, at the corner of Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, for wages, and if I would go there with him, he dare say his master would be at home - I went up with him, but Mr. Turnor, was not at home; a woman there said he had worked there, but had not been there for two or three days, (I believe this was on Wednesday evening), she could not tell whether Mr. Turnor had paid him any wages, on the Saturday night or not. I accordingly brought him back to Warner's, he was not at home, and as he said he did receive it from his master, I kept the note and let him go, on his saying he would appear next day at Guildhall, with his master, and bring another note with him; previous to my letting him go, I asked where he lived, and to the best of my recollection, he said, No. 1, Garden-row, Willow-walk, Leonard-street, Shoreditch; I went there next morning, about nine o'clock, found he did live there, but was not at home - I then went to Mr. Turnor's. I attended at Guildhall, at eleven o'clock - I had told him to be there about half-past eleven o'clock, he never came; I was there till half-past twelve or one o'clock. I went in search of him, and found him that night at twelve o'clock, in bed at a public-house in Newgate-market (they let out lodgings to single men). I asked why he did not attend, he said he could not.</p>

I went to Mr. Christian's for change, he gave his opinion on it - it was not out of my sight - he came back with me having it in his hand.

I found 1 s. 6 d. in silver on him, and above 30 s. in silver on Parson's, two new black silk handkerchiefs, and a pair of new yellow gloves. I took them in custody; they were afterwards discharged. After the examination at Shadwell office, I searched them again, and found ten of the 30 s. which Parsons had, on South; this was the same day; they had had some refreshment; Parsons only had 18 s. then. I wrote my name on the note.</p>

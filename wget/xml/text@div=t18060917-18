On the 28th of August the prisoner came to my shop to purchase a cap, value two shillings and sixpence, she paid for it, after which she requested to look at some shawls, I was in the back room, I saw her come in and I saw her go out two or three times, the last time that she went out she was brought back by a constable; I searched her, we took three shawls from under her clothes, she then said she bought them in Holborn, afterwards she said she would pay for them if we, would let her go, she offered two guineas to let her go; we took notice she appeared very pregnant we asked her if she was pregnant, she said yes; we took her into a little back room, the constable searched her, we found eight shawls in each pocket, she had drawn the shawls in her pockets before her, it appeared as if she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been taken out of your shop. - A. They had; about an hour before I had them in my hand.</p>

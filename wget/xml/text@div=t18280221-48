On the 5th of January, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner walked into the shop, and stood looking at the play-bills several minutes; I was serving in the ladies' shop - I came out and asked his business - he nodded, and said he would speak to my son, who was serving a customer, and then attended to him; he said he had come from Captain Allen (whose ship lay at Cox's Quay) to be measured for a strong pair of boots - he said the captain, who was his father, had bought shoes of us before, and so had he; my son said he had some ready made to fit him - he said he should be glad of them, as the ship sailed on Tuesday; my son showed him a pair - he took a piece of string from his pocket, and said he wanted a pair that length, for his mate, and if the man went with him, with some of that size, he would pay for both; he put on the new boots, and left his old ones to be mended; our porter went with him to fit his mate, and to bring the money back; my son said he did not know Captain Allen.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Wilford. I went with the prisoner to receive the money for the boots he had on, and to try some on the mate; I was ordered not to leave them without the money; when we got to Cox's Quay, the prisoner said, "Wait here, till I see if my father is on board;" he went on board a vessel, looked about, and hallooed - he then returned, and said his father was not on board, but if I would go into the vessel, he would see if he was at the public-house - I waited on board about five minutes, then began to suspect, and found he had absconded with the boots - he was apprehended last Thursday week.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 10th of September putting any notes in your desk - A. Yes; I put in my desk a five pound, two two-pound, and sixteen one pound bank notes, and three guineas; the prisoner stood by me, saw me count them, put them in, and lock my desk. About five o'clock in the afternoon I and the prisoner went to the

            , we had tea there; we went away together about six o'clock; I went home with him; I went into my parlour, I saw my desk and opened it, the prisoner stood by. I looked at my notes they were just as I had left them; I locked the desk. I went out, leaving the girl in the care of the house. We then went to the Green Dragon in Stepney, we had there some brandy and water, and wine and water; the prisoner said he must leave me, he must go to get his coat and apron, he was going to get a bullock out of the drove, to hunt him; I told him he had better stop where he was; he said he must go, and away he went; he returned to me in half an hour, with his coat and apron, he had them tied up in an handkerchief; then we left the Green Dragon together; he said he was going into the city about particular business. When we got to Whitechapel church he left me; we was to meet again at Stratton's, the corner of Newgate market. I got to Stratton's public house about half after ten at night; the prisoner came to me in a very great heat, and very uneasy, and said he wanted to be off. We both went home from there.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of his apron and great coat - A. He took it with him, and I took it at Whitechapel church; when he parted with me he desired me to carry them till he met me at Stratton's. We got home about half past eleven, I was going into the parlour, he laid hold of my shoulder and said, come up to bed, sir. I was just then by the parlour door, he said you can see nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the room with you - A.Yes; in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the servant maid at home when you came home - A. Yes, she had just gone up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Rather before eight o'clock; he had just got the shop opened when I came down. I then went into my parlour, I observed the desk broken open, it appeared to have been broken open with a chopper; I found the chopper in my shop; I looked in my desk, and I missed all the notes, and the three guineas, and a gold watch which hung by the desk. I went into the shop and told the prisoner my loss; he shook his head and said, d - n it, you are born to be unlucky; he then said, never mind, I will work for you for nothing; then we went out together out of the house; we walked down Whitechapel; he left me to go to Smithfield, and I went to my brother's to tell him what had happened. In the course of the afternoon I met him in Smithfield market, I spoke to him, but did not tell him I suspected him. In about two hours afterwards I was in the Lock and Key, Smithfield; I told him I thought he was the person that had done it; he denied it; he said he had no objection to be searched, he was, and nothing was found. Then he said I suppose you have done with me, I made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him again - A. It might be three or four days; he came to my house in about a fortnight afterwards, and saw him once in Smithfield market between that he; he came up to me and said he had been down for his box, and he could not find it, he asked me whether I would let him have it; I said, yes. He came the next day and asked me if he might have the box, I said yes, I should like to see what he had in it. There was a pair of gloves, a waistcoat, and a snuff box in it, they were mine; I had lent him the waistcoat, but not the gloves nor the snuff box; he took the box and went away, leaving my things.</p>
               <p>MARIA CLAFTON. Q. You were a servant on the 10th of September to Mr. Strangeways - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Strangeways and the prisoner going out on the 10th of September - A. Yes, between five and six o'clock, and they came home together about half past six, they did not stay ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten the sash down before they came home - A. No, George came home. I left the sash up on my hearing him knock at the door, he came into the parlour, he asked me to go up stairs for his coat, I asked him where it was, he said he did not know. I must look for it; I fetched it, when I brought him down the coat, he asked me to go up for his apron. I was to bring him the biggest apron I could find; he wrapped his coat in the apron and tied it up in a handkerchief, he said he would go in the shop and see if the block was against the shop door; he said yes it was.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you went up stairs, at either time; or both did you hear any noise in the parlour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010020"></xptr>- A. I heard him walk across the room, and push the bolt of the shutter back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where were you at that time - A. Up stairs over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you hear any thing else - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had been in the shop, how soon did he go away - A. He staid about five minutes in the shop, he said I must be sure to go to bed, at ten o'clock, he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the parlour after he was gone, A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you left the sash up; when you went into the parlour after he was gone; was the sash up or down - A. Down, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Untill your master came home during the time that they were out, was there any body else in the house but you - A. No, not till my master and he came home. I went to bed a little after eleven, I was awake when my master came home, I heard them come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get in - A. My master had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any watch being in the parlour - A. Yes, I looked at it at six o'clock, to see what o'clock it was, that was between the time that they both went out together, and the time that they came home together, and I saw it again just before George came in by himself; I did not see it afterwards, I never looked for it; I never examined the bolts, till the next morning, and then I observed the middle bolt, was pulled not quite back.</p>

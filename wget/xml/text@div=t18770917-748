I am a merchant and live in Poland, I bad been in England five months in May, or June, 1877—I do not know whether that was the date of my going or of my coming back—I do not know a word of English; I corresponded with the prisoner before I left here—I arrived in London again on Wednesday, 8th August, and put up at the hotel Causier, 23, Broad Street, Bloomsbury, and telegraphed to the prisoner announcing my arrival in London—he came to my hotel the same night about 6 o'clock, and I had a conversation with him in Polish—he told me he should be able to purchase some Chamois skins—he did not say who from, only that he would call next day about them—he said that to-morrow about noon we should go to the merchant, but did not give me the merchant's address—about 11 o'clock next morning his wife called and I went with her to 43, Clifton Crescent, Peckham, where they live—we went into the dining-room where I saw the prisoner in bed, he said that he had caught cold and had sent for the merchant who would be there in two hours—I remained there, and at the end of that time Mrs. Pfeiffer came upstairs and said that the merchant had arrived—the prisoner put his clothes on and went down with me to the merchant, whom I had never seen before—I have since pointed him out at the Cafe Monico, in Piccadilly, to Mr. Woolf; his name is David Von Hand—the would be merchant produced a little bag in which there was one Chamois skin as a sample, and they conversed in English which I did not understand—I examined one skin and made a bargain for</p>

               <p>170 dozen of them, which amounted to 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. English—Pfeiffer asked me twice to give the money to the merchant—I said that as I had the pleasure of seeing the merchant for the first time in my life and did not know him, I would rather not part with my money until I got the skins—they conversed together and Pfeiffer sent out for some brandy, and we had a glass together—it was arranged for Pfeiffer and the merchant to come to my hotel, and we were all to go to the warehouse and inspect the skins—no address was given where the skins were—Pfeiffer told me that I could trust any amount of money with the merchant, that he had had transactions with him to a very large amount—after several attempts made by Pfeiffer to induce me to part with my money to the merchant, he told me to give it to him, and I gave him a deposit, for which this receipt produced was written; the body of it is in my writing and the signature is Pfeiffer's—the figures on the receipt stamp are mine—I gave him 2,200 Prussian bank-notes, marks, and 1,000 francs in French gold. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt as translated was for</hi> 2,200 <hi rend="italic">Prussian bank-notes, and</hi> 1,000 <hi rend="italic">francs; as a deposit for the purchase of</hi> 130 <hi rend="italic">dozen Chamois skins; to be returned if the bargain was not concluded, and signed Martin Pfeiffer</hi>, 10<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1877.) The date is a mistake, it took place on Thursday, the 9th—the next day Pfeiffer came to my hotel without the merchant—he said that the merchant had not come, no doubt something had happened to him and I must be quite easy, very likely I should see him to-morrow—next day Pfeiffer came again without the merchant and said that most likely very important business had kept him from coming on so slight an affair—I smelt that the business was not right and said "This is not <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> business, it looks like a swindle"—on the following Sunday I went to Pfeiffer at Peckham, and told him to go to the—merchant—I said "I do not want any skins, give me my money back"—he said "I have not got the money, I gave it to the merchant"—being Sunday he said "We cannot go and see him, the merchant does not live in. London, he is only a travelling merchant"—we went on that very Sunday to look after him in a public-house or coffee-house—he told me that generally the merchant was there about 6 o'clock in the evening and very likely we might meet him there, but the place was shut up—Pfeiffer then told me he should try and find him to-morrow, and for certain he would come to me on the Monday, and said that he was not able to find him—I asked for the merchant's home and residence; he told me he did not know it himself, that he only met him in that coffee-house—he had said on Monday that the merchant was a Frenchman—I saw Pfeiffer every day after that—I returned to Nottingham on Sunday, 19th August, and returned on the following Tuesday with Mr. Woolf—with the exception of those days I saw Pfeiffer every day until I gave him in custody—I kept secret that I wanted to arrest differ; I did not see him after the 16th—I went to Dover on Thursday, the 16th, that was the Thursday before I went to Nottingham—the prisoner went with me to the station, and was with me up to the starting of the train—I paid for my ticket; I asked the prisoner for my money, and he said I should have it when I got into the carriage—when the train was going to start I asked him for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I was going to Poland, but my intention was to keep secret in London that I might arrest him—I did not. get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wished him good-bye, the train started, and he stopped at the station—he was taken custody on Wednesday night, August 22nd, after which Mrs. Pfeiffer gave me a card of Mr. Kipps, of Bermondsey—I went there on Saturday, 25th August with Mr. Woolf, who spoke to Mr. Kipps in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tanner, of 94, Bermondsey—I have known the prisoner six or seven years; he is a respectable, trustworthy man—I have had transactions with him in selling skins for shoe manufacture—he was in my employ six years ago, and afterwards set up as a leather dresser—I do not know whether he is able to carry out contracts for the purchase of skins—I have done business with him within two years, and have a bill of his running now, and should be willing to have another, I have so much confidence in his honesty—to my surprise one day, Mrs. Pfeiffer called on me to say that her husband was in trouble, for conspiracy and fraud; would I be bail for him, and she called again on 25th August and asked me if I would refund the money for him—on 25th August Mr. Woolf and Mr. Bergman called and Mr. Woolf asked me if I would pay the money for him—I said not unless I knew the facts of the case first—he said that Mr. Pfeiffer had had the money to execute a contract, and had failed to do so, and they could neither get the goods nor the money—I asked what was the amount, he said 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses—I said it was exhorbitant to expect 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they reduced it to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I placed that on paper, but previously to that I said that it would be wrong for me to compromise the matter, the best way would be to ask the solicitor's opinion—I afterwards met the prisoner at the station for Nottingham, and told him I could not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He left me two or three years ago, but I did not lose sight of him—he frequently called and bought goods—I do not know whether he was carrying on business at the time he was taken—I did not give Woolf a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I made no proposition, the proposition came from him—I have been outside the Court while this case has been proceeding—I have had a very few words of conversation about the matter—somebody came out and told me to go away from the place, but said nothing with regard to the evidence I was to give, except that I was to hold myself</p>

               <p>in readiness, and that he was pleased I had come here—I bad not a lengthened conversation with the solicitor's clerk; there is no truth in it—I was to give the bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they would accept it, that was to be a settlement of the claim.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is not true that anyone suggested to me a word of the evidence which I have given.</p>

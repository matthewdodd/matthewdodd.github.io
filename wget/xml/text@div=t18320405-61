            . I am shopman to Murphins and Co., linen-drapers, Tottenham-court-road. On the 20th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner purchased a few articles at our shop, and paid me a 5l. Bank note - I gave her the change, and gave the note to the cashier, without getting her address on it; he returned it to me - I took it back to her, and asked her address; I am sure it was the same note, for it was not out of my sight - she gave me her name, Mrs. Willson, No. 24, Portland-street, which I put on the note - (looking at a note, No. 17,880) I am sure this is the note I received from her; I afterwards applied at No. 24, Portland-street, and found no person named Wilson lived there; she wore a straw-bonnet, a black veil, and dark clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose she was a stranger to you? A. Yes; I do not recollect what goods I served her with, not the exact amount -I believe I have said it was about three or four o'clock, but believe it was about four - I was not very busy that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What distance is your shop from Poplar? A. I should think five or six miles - it was on a Tuesday, the day before Fast day.</p>

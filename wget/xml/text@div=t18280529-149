            . I am a gardener. I was employed to watch a stable by Mr. Charles Reynolds' foreman - there was a mare and a foal there; it required my attention the whole of the night of the 10th of May; I went out that night about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I know the time, because I heard the clock strike; I saw John Bond at the hen-house door - I was within five yards of him; I had known him for a year and a half before - I could not be mistaken in his person; he had a white hen in his hand- I saw him throw the hen down, with two more, at the door; the door was put too, locked, and the key taken out; I said, "John, is that you?" he went round the yard; I met him again, and said, "John, I see it is you - you have no occasion to run; Mr. Reynolds is coming;" he got out at the gate, and shut it against me; Reynolds came in at another gate, and I met him; I told him what I had seen, and I stopped at the place to watch; I found three fowls at the hen-house door, quite warm, recently killed; Reynolds went with me to the hen-house door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you not seize him? A. Because I knew him, and he ran away - I told the Magistrate that I knew him by his face and dress too.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you a lantern? A. Yes, and used it; I am certain it was him; I told master who it was directly I met him at the wicket gate.</p>

Avery was employed on the night of the 10th at my stable. where I had a mare and a foal; I was out that night, and returned about a quarter past twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell; I have known the prisoner for years; as I approached my premises, I heard my farm gate slam too - I approached the gate, and heard Avery say, "John, you may run - I know you," and he was approaching towards me with his light; I said, "Who went out at the gate?" he said, "A man;" I said, "Do you know him?" he said"I do;" I do not know that he told me who it was, and I do not know that I asked him; he took me to the hen-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290077"></xptr>house, and I saw three fowls lying dead, they were warm, and the necks bloody. On the Sunday I was out, and I believe on Monday the prisoner was taken - he lives within three hundred yards of me; he got to his own house in two or three minutes, I have no doubt, from my gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Avery tell you who it was? A. On the Sunday morning, at breakfast time; he called out, "John Bond, don't run," that night, to the best of my judgement - I think he said Bond; I am not certain about it: I did not ask who he meant; I was out on Sunday, and could not go after him. I thought Avery was talking to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was talking to himself? A. I suppose he was - I judge so; the constable who took him is not here; it was rather a dark night.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said before the Magistrate, that Avery said it was a man whom he knew, and told you that it was John Bond.</p>

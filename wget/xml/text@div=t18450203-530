                  </hi>. I am a copper-plate printer, and live in Tavistock-street. On the 28th of Jan. the prisoner came to me to know whether he might assist me in moving a number of copper-plates, from No. 11, Tavistock-street, to No. 32, Charles-street—he said my warehouseman had sent him—I said he might assist me—in two hours he asked me for some money for beer, and about five o'clock I told him he might come to work nightwork at eight o'clock—he said he did not want to come then—I said, "You must, or I must get a man"—he then said he would—he left me, and I saw no more of him till he in custody—the plates produced I am quite sure are mine.</p>

I was going through Vin<lb></lb>egar-yard, about five o'clock that evening, and met the prisoner, who was carrying something covered with a handkerchief—I followed him to White Horse-court, Drury-lane, and asked what he had got—he said some work, and he was going to his home, in Clerkenwell—I said it was a heavy load, should I carry it for him—he said I might—I took him and these plates.</p>

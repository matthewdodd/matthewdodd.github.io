The Evidence against her was plain, the Nurse, the Chair-woman, the Midwife, the Master and his Servant, all deposing, that she denying the Key, they broke open her Trunk, where they all saw the Child Dead, wrapped up in a Cloath, with a Rag in the Mouth of it, as big as a Handkerchief, and that the Child being something Warm, they tried all they could to recover Life in it, but to no purpose. The Prisoner said little for herself, but that she knew nothing of the Cloath in the Mouth of the Child, and that she had not her Senses; and was Light-headed. Then the Statute was read to her, wherein, If the Child be found Dead and, Concealed, though it were so Born, the Person Concealing it, shall suffer Death as in case of Murder, except she can prove by one Witness at least, that the Child so Concealed was Born Dead. Upon full Evidence, she was brought in <rs id="t16880113-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 284.) On Saturday, the 16th of Oct., I was in a pawnbroker's shop in the Mile-end-road—a person came in to the next box to the one I stood in, and wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on an iron wrench and an oil stone—I could not see him, there was a partition between us—the pawnbroker took the wrench in his hand and asked if it was his property—he said, "Yes"—the pawnbroker said, "Here are the initials of the London and Birmingham Railway Company on it"—the man said, "Yes"—the pawn<lb></lb>broker asked whether it was his, he said, "Yes it is mine"—the pawnbroker handed it to me—I looked at it and handed it back—he took in the oil stone, but not the wrench—I then went out, met the prisoner at the side door coming out, and asked him if the wrench belonged to him—he said, "Yes, it is mine'—he had it under his coat apparently putting it into his side pocket—he handed it to me—I said, "How is it it has the initials of the London and Birmingham Railway Company are on it"—he said, "The smiths put it on"—on the way to the station he said, "If we can get it away for a pot of beer, it is better than paying 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he also said, "I have several tools in</p>

               <p>my chest at home, marked with the same initials"—he said he lived in White-horse-lane—I went there, searched his chest, but found he had no tools with this mark on them—I found a duplicate for the oil-stone on him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a foreman in the carriage department of the London and North-Western Railway Company—this wrench is their property—when persons who have not got tools are employed by the Company, it is the custom to permit them to have the use of tools—it is their duty to take them back to the store when they have done with them, where they are booked to the party who takes them out—the prisoner worked for the com<lb></lb>pany twice—the last time was five or six weeks ago—it is not true that I gave or lent him the wrench—I never knew he had it—it is a strict rule that no person shall take tools home with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I lent the Company's man a wrench of the same size six weeks ago, he broke it and showed it to the foreman, and wanted to get it mended, and could not; the foreman gave me this one instead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not correct—I might have lent him one, but this one has been in store since that—I know it by a particular flaw and some dots which are on it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a coach-maker in the service of the London and North-Western Railway Company—I know the wrench produced—I have worked with it—it is the duty of a workman to return it to the store when he has done with it—no workman is permitted to pawn the goods of the Company—it was in my charge—I worked with it six or seven weeks ago, I lost it, and could not tell what had become of it—I missed it about the time the prisoner left.</p>

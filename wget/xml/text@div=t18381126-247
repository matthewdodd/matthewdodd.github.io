                  </hi>. I am a wagoner, in the employ of Mr. Coome, of Linfield, in Sussex. On the 21st of August I was with his wagon, going from London, home—I started from the White Hart, in the Borough—I got near the Elephant and Castle at half-past eleven o'clock at night, and had got into the wagon—the prisoner called me out of the wagon—I got out, and he begun to abuse me very much, and spit in my face twice, and asked me how I liked it—I said, "I do not like it much, but I suppose I must put up with it"—he then knocked me down—I had not said any thing to him—I felt I could not stand up against him, nor had I any disposition to do so—he knocked me down with his hand—whether he had any thing in it I can<lb></lb>not say—my mate was at the horses' heads driving the wagon—there were three men standing with the prisoner, very near him—they stepped back on the pavement as soon as I got out of the wagon—they remained there—I did not want to have any thing to do with it—I am fifty-seven years old—when I was knocked down I fell near the wheel—I was stunned by the fall—I understand the three men who were with him lifted me up into the wagon, but I was not in my senses—I came to my senses directly after, and found my pocket was turned inside out—I had had no money there—I found my watch and guard were gone—I had had the watch in my hand, just before, as I was late, and looked at it by Kennington-gate, against the time-piece, and it was exactly right—it was just by the Wagon and Horses, below the Ele<lb></lb>phant and Castle, that he called me out of the wagon—I had not sense enough to make an alarm, but when I came to myself I told my mate to stop, but we could not see an officer about, as it was Camberwell fair</p>

I want to see him"—I do not know why he should spit in my face—I never had a <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>—word from him in my life—I never raised my hand against him—I cannot say how long he has been in business—I have not lived at Linfield long myself—I lived at Brighton a good while—the last service I had was at the Catherine-wheel, in the Borough—I kept flys at Brixton, and kept a beer-shop in Kingsland-road, which I left because it did not answer.</p>

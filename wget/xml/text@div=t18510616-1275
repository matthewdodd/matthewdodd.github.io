                  </hi>. I occupy chambers at 7, Stone-buildings, Lincoln's-inn, with my brother-in-law. On Monday or Tuesday evening, 5th or 6th May, I accompanied a lady to a house in Rupert-street, Haymarket—I gave her a sovereign, and passed the night there with her; between 10 and 11 o'clock next morning, we were both in the room—I was preparing to leave—I came out of the room with my coat on my arm—the prisoner came in—I had not seen him overnight—he bowed, and asked where I was going—I said I was going away—he said, "You are not going that way; you must give some money"—I said, "What money?"—he said, "You have got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay me before you go"—I said I had not got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; all the money I had got I had given already—he said it was better for me to do so, or I should meet with more annoyance; he and the girl then spoke in German some few minutes, and then he said, "Let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you may go away"—I told him I had no money—he left the room for a minute, and the girl told me it was better to settle with him quietly, for he was a bad temper—he did not go far from the door, but returned, and asked what I was doing in London without money; that I should have either money or friends, and if I wrote a letter he would <hi rend="italic">skip</hi> it to my friend—I wanted him to let me go, and I would go with him and give him the money—he said no, he should have the money before I should leave the house—he brought in a portfolio, told me to write a letter to a friend, and he would <hi rend="italic">skip</hi> it, and when he got the money he would let me go—I wrote a letter—he left the room with it, locking me in—the place was in Regent-street, very close, and he returned in 10 or 15 minutes, and said the person was out, but he would call again, and would take care I should not leave the house till he got the money—he went out again, returned in about 20 minutes, and brought a letter from the person I had written to, open, and said that would not do, and if any one knew me he would take my <hi rend="italic">good:</hi> I understood he meant a bill, and that he bad plenty of money, and would lend me the money himself—after some time I asked him, and he agreed to come out with me—I wanted to get outside the house—I was putting on my over-coat—he took hold of it, and said, "No; you don't take that; when you give me the money, I will give you the coat"—the coat was left there—we went to a tailor in Regent-street, where I had formerly had some clothes, and where I had written the letter to—the prisoner stopped outside the door—I had some talk with the foreman—the prisoner came in, and wanted the foreman to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a piece of cloth, and if I did not pay for it, he would next day—the foreman said he had no money belonging to his master, and told me, if he annoyed me, to charge him with the first policeman—we left the shop, and he wanted me to get into a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and go off and get the money—I said, "No; if you persist in annoying me, I will charge you"—he remained a few steps behind—I had not gone many steps, when a policeman came up to me, and said I was charged by the prisoner with stealing a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went with the policeman to the</p>

Mr. Lawrence, of St. James-street, of 11th Hussars—I have been in the army, in the 97th regiment—I left it about nine years ago—my age is about twenty-nine—I have been three months in London—I came from Ireland—I did not describe myself to the girl as the Hon. Mr. Lawrence, of the 11th Hussars—I do not know anybody of that name—she knew my name to be Linch, because she took some letters out of my pocket and read them—I had never seen her before—I met her at 9 o'clock at night, at the corner of Regent-street—I was alone, coming from Brook's Club, in St. James's-street; I cannot tell you the number—I am not a member there—I went to see a friend, but did not see him—I went direct from Regent-street to Rupert-street with the woman—I bought two threepenny cigars on the road, and changed a half-sovereign—I had a sovereign and a half—I gave a sove<lb></lb>reign to pay for the entertainment I had—the woman wanted me to have some wine, bat I would not—I have not subpoenaed her—I have seen her here—the prisoner told the inspector he was living with her—he did not complain that I had not paid her—I wrote to my tailor, because I did not want my friends to know it—if I had had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would have given it to get away—I told him I had no money—I bad half-a-crown, but he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not assault me at all—the wine was not procured—I had some coffee—I thought there was something in it, and only took half a cup—I told the woman who brought it I could not drink it—I had breakfast there in the morning—I took very little of it—this took place on the first-floor—there were windows—it is most extraordinary that I did not call out when I was shut in—I asked the girl to let me out—she said she could not, and dare not—I was in the army three years—I was an ensign.</p>

             came into the parlour to me with a shilling; as soon as I saw the man I recollected him; I began to rub the shilling I had received from Mrs. Pittard; the prisoner said, if I rubbed it I should spoil it; I told him I wondered he should offer me bad money, when he had tendered me bad money so often before; the prisoner made no answer to that. This conversation brought out Mr. Debatt; he told him, he recollected his being there two or three days prior to that, when he had tendered three bad shillings one after the other; he desired Mr. Debatt not to send for an officer, but he told him he would. Mr. Debatt sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. I delivered the shilling to Mr. Debatt, and he delivered it to the officer in my presence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pastrycook, at the Mansion-house: On the 12th of April I was at tea; I heard an altercation, and came into the shop; I recollected the prisoner's person immediately; I told him, I was surprised he should come again, after the remonstrance I made with him last time; I do not recollect what his reply was. I received a shilling from Mrs. Debatt; I sent for an officer; I do not recollect whether I gave the shilling to the officer or to the prisoner; I saw him searched; in one pocket were found two sixpences, one shilling, and some halfpence, all good; and in the other pocket two half crowns and eight shillings, all bad apparently; he was then taken to the Compter.(Edward Alderman, a constable, produced the money.)(Mrs. Debatt identified the shilling she received from the prisoner.)(Mr. William Parker proved the shilling to be a bad one; as also the two half crowns and the eight shillings found upon the prisoner.)</p>

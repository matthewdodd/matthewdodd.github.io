On the 1st of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pair of walking shoes. I shewed her several pairs of shoes and boots, but said she did not very well like them. She then pitched on a pair of cork-soled boots; and as she tried them on, she laid them on two stools, and while I was getting the boots out of the window, she got up with her hands behind her, and appeared all of a tremble; I thought she was in a fit. She sat down again, got up, and stood against the window, and said she should like to see the cork boots; I handed them to her. As her hands were behind her, I suspected her; she sat down and asked the price of them; I said 7 s. 6 d., she paid for them, I wrapped them up and she went out. I followed, and told her I thought she had a pair too many, she was ready to fall down. I gave her to a person to hold till the officer came and took her.</p>

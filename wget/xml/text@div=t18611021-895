                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, in the service of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company—on 23d September I was engaged in taking a train of empty carriages from New Cross to London Bridge—there were two engines, one in front, and one behind—the one I was driving, was the one-at the tail of the train—it was a few minutes before 5 in the evening—after I had passed the Bricklayer's Arms Station, between there and Corbitt's-lane, signal station, I saw a man on the east side of the line with a gun—I was going very slowly—about fourteen miles an hour—the man was on the embankment—he put the gun to his shoulder, put it down, then put it up a second time and fired it off—he fired as if he aimed at the engine—one of the shots caught me on the bottom of the chin, and fetched the blood out, and several caught the boiler—I heard them rattle on the boiler—the wound on my chin is quite well now—I had never seen the</p>

I am a varnish manufacturer, having my premises under the railway arches—on the afternoon this occurred I was standing at the end of the factory, which is under the arches, and I saw a man on the bank, fire a gun as the train was passing, and I saw some one at the engine pat his bands up to his face at the moment the gun went off—that drew my attention—the engine went on—I followed the young man to acquaint him of the circumstance, as I thought he was not aware that he had bit anybody.</p>

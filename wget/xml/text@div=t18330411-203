On the 10th of April I was in my front room, and heard a step on the stairs; I looked out, and saw the prisoner going down the first pair of stairs, with a bundle under his arm - I directly ran to the front window, and saw the prisoner go out of the house and turn a corner; I and my daughter ran down and pursued him; I ran a short distance, and then returned - my daughter went on; he was soon after brought back by Kelly, with the bundle, which contained all these articles; the scarf had been taken from a line in the attic, and the other things were taken from a box, which had been locked, but which I found wide open, and the room door also, which had been locked; the street door is always open, on account of business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had found these things? A. No - he did not say any thing to me; I did not observe that he was lame.</p>

I went with my mother in pursuit of the prisoner - I followed him down Shire-lane and Crown-court - I stopped him, but he got from me, and ran down Crown-court and Star-court, which is no thoroughfare - the officer then came up, and he was taken; he dropped the bundle upon me when I first took hold of him; when he got to Star-court he threw the shawl into a dust-hole - I took it up.</p>

             (Police-constable F 139). I heard the alarm, and went to Star-court; the prisoner was coming towards me; I found this key on the prisoner - it would not open the prosecutor's door; I went at the solicitation of his wife to No. 5, Crown-street, Westminster, and the key fits his own street door.</p>

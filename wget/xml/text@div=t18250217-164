On the 11th of January, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, I missed a set of bed-furniture and a sofa cover, which I saw in the washhouse at eight o'clock. I and a chairwoman were sitting in the kitchen; the washhouse was locked, but about a quarter past eight o'clock I found the door open; it leads into the yard, and is about twenty yards from the kitchen: the lock must have been picked. Persons could come in at the back door, which was on the latch, and get to the kitchen; the wash-house is across the yard. I am certain it was locked, and the key hung on the kitchen stairs; nobody could get to the key; the street door is always kept locked. Three boys came and knocked at the door, and gave us information. We have never found the property. I value the property at 35 s. - The wash-house is quite separate from the house, but is in the yard; we go to it without going into the street.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Tilner, at the King's Arms, Chelsea, but at the time in question I was out of place. I am a pot-boy. I and two other lads were standing at the corner of Hector-court, Homer-street, playing with some more boys, and about eight o'clock, or five minutes past, I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Hector-court. The other man had a sack under his arm; they looked very hard at us, and the prisoner said something to him, and in about five minutes they went in at the back door of No. 9, Homer-street, which leads into Hector-court; they were in there ten minutes or more, when the prisoner came out with a sack on his back, and something in it, which appeared to be so large, it would not go to the bottom. The other man came behind him; we said it could not be all right, and watched them nearly to the top of Homer-street, and then lost sight of them all in a moment. We returned to No. 9, Homer-street, knocked at the door and gave information. They went into the yard. I am certain the prisoner is the man; he is a baker; I have frequently seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. They looked at you? A. Yes; before they went in; the prisoner went in first, and the other after him. The door was shut. I don't know where he lived, but have frequently seen him smoking at the Castle public-house, at the corner of Chapel-street, New Road. The other boys described him to the watchman, and I was present that night when he was taken at the Castle. Beck told the watchman of it about a quarter of a hour after we saw him go away. I had been out of place nearly three months. I never quarrelled with the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Harcourt-street with my father who is a baker. I saw the prisoner and another man go in at the back door in Homer-street, with an empty sack, about five minutes past eight o'clock; the watchman had just gone eight o'clock. I had seen them there for about five minutes; the other man had the sack when he went in but the prisoner brought it out, full, in about ten minutes. Both went up Homer-street; we watched them nearly to the top, towards the New Road, then lost them. We went back and knocked at Mrs. Moss's door; I told her, and told the watchman. The prisoner was taken at the Castle public-house in about a quarter of an hour. I went in, thinking I might see him, as I often had. I sent the watchman to the Castle public-house; the other man was not there. We were playing by Mrs. Moss's. I have known Simmons about a year; the other boy lives in Shouldram-street; I have had no quarrel with the prisoner; they saw us when they went in, and when they came out, but did not speak to us. The prisoner had his working dress and a brown cap on.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live in Shouldram-street with my father, who is a shoemaker. I was with these boys one evening; I don't recollect the date; it was the day before I was examined at the office. We were standing at the corner of Hector-court; I saw the prisoner and another come and make water against the wall; the other had an empty sack under his arm; they looked very hard at us: the prisoner went in at the back door, the other followed. They came out in ten minutes or more, the prisoner carrying the sack: it was so full, the things could not go to the bottom. We followed them nearly to the top of Homer-street, to see what became of of the sack, but they crossed the road and we lost sight of them: I could see no watchman. In about twenty minutes I saw Beck and Simmons coming down the street with the watchman, who had got the prisoner. We went back to Mrs. Moss before that, and told her. I am quite sure of the prisoner - I knew him before; he used to live in Homer-street where he was apprenticed: I never quarreled with him. He has an uncle - I don't know whether he has any parents.</p>
               <p>MARIA MOSS. When these boys came to my door, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170079"></xptr>went and missed the property. I did not go for a watchman. Nobody but the chairwoman being in the house, and being lame, I could not follow. I stood at the door and saw the watchman bring him by; the boys said he was the man: his uncle keeps a shop on the other side of the New Road.</p>

I took him to the watch-house, and then told him the charge, he said nothing against it. I took him by Mrs. Moss's, but did not stop, as there was a crowd.</p>

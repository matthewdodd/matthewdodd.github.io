                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Beer-lane, Christ-church, Surrey. I was at the King of Prussia public-house on Saturday night, the 3rd of April, at a little after twelve o'clock—I was a little the worse for liquor, but not much—I had six half-crowns, five shillings, and a rule—when I got out I sat down on a step—I could have walked hone if I had been let alone—several people came round me—three people said they knew me, and lifted me up, and one of them took me on his back—when I came a little to my senses I found my shoulder hurt very much, and missed my money and rule—I was thrown down by the party, which made me insensible for an hour—I was not very drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother and father, in Red Lion-court, Union-street. I was in Gravel-lane on the 3rd of April—as I passed the King of Prussia public-house they turned the prosecutor out, and he sat on the step of a door—he appeared drunk—a mob got round him—he was lifted on a man's back, and carried to the Two Brewers public-house—as they went along I saw the prisoner walk by the side of the man who carried him, and when they got him down to the Two-Brewers they flung him down, and he fell on his shoulder—I saw the prisoner feel in his waistcoat pocket—he did not appear to take any thing out of it, but then he felt in his trowsers pocket, and took something out—I did not see a rule—I had known the prisoner for above twelve months—there were only three about the prosecutor at the time—after that the prisoner went with the other two men to a pork-shop in Gravel-lane—they stood at a window there, and he shared the money between the three—I saw money pass from him to the two—they left the prosecutor lying on the ground, not very far from the pork-shop.</p>

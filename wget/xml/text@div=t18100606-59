               <p>ANTHONY MANLEY. I am a butcher. On the 24th of May I was in Cow-cross, and just by the Compasses I saw Parker very much in liquor in the cart. Barker was driving the horse very fast, he stopped the horse all at once and they both fell back in the cart together, Parker's hat and handkerchief fell out of the cart, I picked them up and chucked them in the cart. Barker went on again till he came to the sign of the Hop Pole in Cow-cross, he stopped again; he said, butcher, step up here, here is son nver lying in the front of the cart; I it stepped in the cart and picked up some shillings, and Barker picked up some, I put them into his left hand, and got out of the cart. In about two or three minutes Barker called me again to see what notes he had got I got into the cart again, Barker had five one pound notes in his hand, I put them into the bag he had in his hand.</p>

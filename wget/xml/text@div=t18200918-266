About a quarter before eleven o'clock the prisoner came to me in Fieldgate-street, and said she had a watch, which she meant to pledge - I had known her by her walking the streets. She said she got it out of Stepney-fields. I asked her for it, she gave it to me, and I took her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HEMBREY. On the 26th of January, I left Holborn about five minutes after eight o'clock in the evening. I went into King-street, Drury-lane, and the moment I got into <placeName id="t18170219-4-crimeloc26">King-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170219-4-crimeloc26" type="placeName" value="King-street"></interp>

This was about a quarter after eight o'clock, as near as it could be, they held both my arms and feet; I found my watch, ribbon, two seals, and about 20s. in silver, were gone. I felt my watch go from me, and felt a hand in my breeches pocket, where my silver was; they did not hold me down more than a minute and a half; it was just under a lamp. They held my cheek-hones quite tight, but did not close my eyes; I noticed them, and the prisoner, Davis, was the first that caught me by the throat, I observed his dress, it was as it is now; the prisoner, Hill, was holding me while I was being robbed. I saw those two in particular. I am sure Hill is the man, he was dressed in black; there was also a man of the name Fox, who has escaped. I only saw three men. Just as they were taking my watch, one of them called out,"Mary," with a low voice; the prisoner, Lowe came, stooped down, and then ran away with them. I am positive it was her. I did not see Daws. They all ran away but the prisoner, Davis, he kept his knee on my chest, and stopped my mouth. He ran away, and as soon as I could make a noise, I called out that I had lost my property; the watchman was about twenty yards off, he took Daws as he was running from me; some people came out and took me into a house; I was very much hurt with the blows that I had received; the watchman pursued the prisoners, and took three of them, he came from the watch-house, and asked me if I should know them; I was rather better, and described them to him, but I was not well enough to go to look at them. I went home in a coach. I was so ill the next day that I could not go to Marlborough-street. I described the woman to the watchman the next morning, and he took her. I was robbed on Sunday, the 26th, and went to the office on the Monday week after, and saw the four prisoners in custody, I then perfectly recollected the three that I have spoken to. I am sure Hill was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had been to the Castle Inn, Holborn, I did not stop there five minutes, and was going home; I live in the Westminster-road. King-street is near the end of Drury-lane. It was about a quarter after eight, I left the Castle five minutes before eight o'clock, it could not be more than that; the Castle is about half a mile from St. Giles's church - I walked by myself all the way. I had not seen either of the prisoners before; it was a tall man, with a great coat on, that made his escape, he must have been six feet high - I described him to the watchman. I did not see the prisoners again till eight days after. Crawley came and told me that the men were apprehended the same night. The officer did not tell me that Hill was dressed in black. Nobody was passing at the time, but on my crying out some people came up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of January, I was going my rounds, I had just called eight o'clock; when Mr. Hembrey was attacked, I was coming back, at about the middle of my beat, which is Cross-lane, one end of which goes into Parker's-street, and the other end into Newton-street, which leads into Holborn: there is a passage in Cross-lane, that comes out of King-street; I saw the prisoner, Daws, and a sailor, running in great haste down the passage, out of King-street, I am not quite sure that it was Daws; there are three steps which come down into Cross-lane, when they came down the steps. I was within two yards of them - I knew Daws before. After they had passed me I heard somebody call out, "I have been robbed, I have lost my watch!" as I was going towards King-street, I turned round, and followed them into the Coach and Horses, in Charles-street; as soon as they went into the house I sprung my rattle, when Crawley and the private watchman came to my assistance; we went into the back parlour and found Daws there-the sailor was not with him; I gave him into Crawley's custody, and went back towards King-street to look for the prosecutor, I found him in a chair in the street, he was very much hurt, and could hardly speak - We took him into a shop; I asked him, if he should know either of them, and if one was a sailor? he described the sailor to me as being dressed in a sailor's blue jacket and trowsers; he only described one of them to me them. About an hour afterwards we took Davis from the same house (the Coach and Horses). I secured him in the watch-house, and went back to the prosecutor, he had a surgeon with him, and was sent home in a coach. I went to his house the next day, he was not able to attend, and the prisoners were detained. I took

            . I am a watchman; I heard the rattle spring, and was with Trimbey when he took Daws, nobody else was in the room; we went to the prosecutor the next morning, and he described Lowe to us, from his description I went to her lodging - She was not at home, we found her and took her; I had taken Daws on the Sunday night, about eight o'clock. As we were taking him to the watch-house, the prisoner, Hill, crossed me several times, I told him to keep off-there were several people following me to the watch-house, he would not keep from me; when I had secured Daws in the watchhouse, I went out and secured Hill, and took him in - He was pushing against me, and wanted to rescue Daws. I asked him if he knew any thing of Daws, he said, no; but when Furzeman searched him, he said he did know him, and had known him a long time, and that Daws had worked for his father. We went back to the prosecutor, he described Davis to us, and we went to the Coach and Horses and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It might then be near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READING. I am a watchman. About half-past eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 26th January, the rattle sprung. I went up and found Trimbey at the door of the Coach and Horses. He sent me to the back of the house to prevent any body from escaping. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190007"></xptr>brought Davis out. Crawley took him to the watchhouse. As we were going along, we were pressed several times by Hill. I am sure it was him. I spoke to him several times, and pushed him off the curb to prevent his pressing us. I told him to keep clear off, he had no business with our prisoner. He muttered and grumbled, and went down the Coal-yard. When we got to the watchhouse, Crawley came out and took him. At first, he said, he did not know Daws, and then he said he did. Trimbey returned, and we all went to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was St. Giles watch-house. I first saw Hill following us in Drury-lane, we had Daws in custody there, he was between us. Hill pressed me a great deal. He came by the side of us, and between us. I told him to keep away. It was about half-past eight o'clock. I did not hear him say any thing.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am the watch-house keeper. On the 26th of January, Crawley brought Davis in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock. Hill was brought in about three minutes after.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and work for Mr. Stubbs, in Camden Town. I live with my father in Kentish Town. I have known the prisoner, Hill, four years, he lives with his father in Kentish Town. I was in his company on Sunday, the 26th of January. I met him at the King's Arms, in Kentish Town, about four o'clock in the afternoon, nobody was with him, we remained there till near seven o'clock - We were quite sober when we left. We went to the Three Brewers, in Moor-street, at the bottom of Crown-street, which leads in a line from Oxford-road to Seven Dials. We got there about twenty-five minutes before eight o'clock, we stopped there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, we did not meet any body there. From there we went to James-street, Covent-Garden, to a public-house at the corner of the Piazza, and waited there about half an hour, we came out at half-past eight o'clock, and parted. The watchman was calling half-past eight o'clock as we came out, and the public-house clock was half-past eight. Before we parted, we agreed to meet at the top of Monmouth-street, Tottenham-court-road end, to go home together, he said, he would meet me there in a short time. We only came to town for a walk. I went there and stopped an hour, he did not come. The next morning I heard he was taken up.</p>

The Fact being done, and the honest Man ruin'd; his miserable Daughter-in-Law, finding her self deceiv'd and disappointed in her Companions, made herself an Evidence against them. There were other Witnesses to fix the Fact upon Hurrell , beside the Circumstance of his own Confession, which however could not affect the other two. They all denied it at their Tryal; and Hurrell brought an Evidence who swore, that Breeman's Daughter was in Bed all that Night with a Young Man, in the same Room that she lay in with two others; That there were three Beds in it, and that the three Prisoners lay in them, from 8 a Clock that Night till 10 next morning.

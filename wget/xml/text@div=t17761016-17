               <p>Cannot you tell when you came? - No; I cannot tell what day nor what month.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived with him before this happened? - This happened five weeks ago; I lived with him fourteen weeks before, I think; I sat up for my master and a gentleman lodger yesterday was five weeks; about twelve at night my master came in first, and asked me whether my mistress was in bed? I told him she was; he asked me how long she had been in bed? and I told him according to the time; he sat down in his chair and pulled his garters off, and then got up and gave me a kiss; I asked him what that was for? he said, there was no harm in a kiss; I said, yes, there was, as he had got a wife; he then asked me if it was agreeable to me to go to bed with him that night? I said, I should agree to no such thing; he said, if it was not agreeable to me, there was no harm done, and he wanted to be rude with me in the kitchen, he put his hands up my coats; I struggled with him, and told him, if he meddled with me I would cry out; I told him I took him to be a gentleman, and I found him to be a rogue; I bid him let me alone, or I would make an outcry, and desired him to go to bed to his wife; he lit his candle and went to bed: I sat till the gentleman came home, and then I fastened my door and went to bed; I got up the next morning as usual, lit the fire and got breakfast, and packed up my things, intending to go away after breakfast; my mistress was in the kitchen; I said, madam, I am going up stairs to look up my things, I am going away; this might be about half after nine, breakfast was over; she made me some answer, but I don't know what she said; I went to my room, looked up my things, and put them up into two bundles; I thought after I had looked up my things I would make Mr. Dixon's bed; I made the bed, came down with the chamber-pot, and went up again with the pot and put it in its place; coming out of the room, I met my master in the landing-place of the stairs, he took me in his arms; I said, what be you going to do with me? he said, no harm; upon that I cried out murder; he carried me up stairs into the second room, my mistress's bed-room; I struggled with him from one bed-post to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160028"></xptr> other; I told him I would die or lose my life before I would yield to him, and I would cry out again; I struggled as long as I had any strength in me; he took me by the two shoulders with my hands behind me, and threw me down upon the bed; after he laid me on the bed, I cried murder, and struggled as long as I could, till I went into a fainting fit; and then he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You recovered from the fit? - No; I could not assist myself, I was still in a fainting fit ; I could not get from him; then he lay with me; I felt him in my body, and felt something come from him, but I know not what.</p>
               <p>You mean to say you felt his private parts in your private parts? - Yes; and something came from him; after he had lain with me, he violently ran his hand up my body; I felt his hand and fingers in my body, he hurt me very much; I shrieked out, and said, I was almost dead; after that, he went down stairs, and I went into my own bed-room; I was almost half an hour in my own room fainting away; I was obliged to pull my linen off, and afterwards put a cloth.</p>
               <p>For what reason was you obliged to pull your linen off? - Because it was so bad with blood; after I had pulled my linen off, and rested a bit, I was ready to faint away; I got down stairs by the bannisters of the stairs, and went and got a drink of water, and then went into the kitchen, and sat about eight minutes, and then he came into the kitchen; he had two gentlemen in a little room with him; I did not see the gentlemen, I only saw their cloaths; he said, Bet, go fetch me some sugar; I said I would not; he said, I should; I said, there was some sugar I had bought of my own, he might have that; he said, that was not enough.</p>
               <p>Were the gentlemen gone? - No; they were in the place; he insisted upon my going for the sugar; I told him I did not think I was able to go so far, and I could not go; he insisted upon it I should, and gave me some money to go for the sugar ; but in my fright I did not know what he gave me, whether a sixpence or a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, I went for the sugar, and put it down on the dresser; the gentlemen were in the passage; I gave him the change.</p>
               <p>How far did you go? - A few doors up; I don't know what sugar I brought, whether a pound or half a pound.</p>
               <p>What sort was it? - We generally had seven-penny, it was the same I imagine; just as I delivered the change my mistress came in, and a gentlewoman with her, I was crying; she asked me what I was crying for; she said, my eyes were almost out of my head; I said, because my master would not let me alone; I asked her to let me go to a neighbour's house for half an hour, because my master would not let me alone; she gave me leave, and I went to Mrs. Bolton's, she had washed for us; I went into the room crying, the other lodgers came into the room; seeing me crying, Mrs. Bolton wanted to know what was the matter; I would not tell her till they were all gone out of the room; Mrs. Bolton desired to know what was the matter; after I had cried a great while, I told her my master had ruined me, and desired she would go for my mistress; she sent for her; I had a fit which held me an hour; three or four people could hardly hold me; when I came to myself, my mistress sat by my side in a chair, and she had brought a woman with her, to hear, I imagine, what I said; the woman of the room was there all the time; my mistress said to me, Now, Betty, tell me the whole truth what has passed; tell me whether or no your master has been great with you before this; I said, my master never said nothing to me in his life, nor never kissed my lips, nor did any thing bad to me till last night; I said, madam, last night I sat up for Mr. Dixon; you know I always sit up for him of a Friday night.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her what you have told us? - The same story; I only told her that he had ruined me, and what he had offered the night before; I mentioned nothing to her of my linen; she never asked me any such thing, and I never resolved her; I thought she might stop my linen; I told my mistress what passed the over night, as I have told now; there was one thing I forgot before, when I went up with Mr. Dixon's chamber-pot, as I was on the stairs, I heard the street door shut; my mistress went out.</p>
               <p>This is what you told your mistress? - No, I did not tell my mistress all this; I told my mistress he had ruined me, and what had happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160029"></xptr> over night, and what had happened in the morning; and she went away crying, and said, she would hear no more of it; I told her I would swear a rape against him; after she went out, my master came into the room; he pulled his-hat off, and flung at me, and hit me in my eye; I was on my knees on the ground, just come out of a fit, and a woman was holding me; he threw his hat at me, and called me b - h, and said, he had done so and so with me; he said, he had lain with me against my consent; he said, that it was not above three inches in, that he could not get me with child, and that he put his hand into my body; I have three witnesses here that heard it; but he said, I might do as I had a mind; I replied, I would swear on Monday, and would swear nothing but the truth; upon that he went out of the room; I was in fits almost all that day till night, when night came, I came out of my fits and got better: I desired Mrs. Bolton to go to my mistress for my things, if she would not let me have my wages; she went, and she would not let her have them; I said, I must have them; if she would not let me, I must have them by help; she said, if I could go she would go with me; I went with her, and told my mistress I was come for my things, and my mistress said -</p>
               <p>Was your master there? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must not tell what your mistress said when your master was not present? - I came out with my things, and brought them to this woman's house; none of my friends knew what had happened, I said nothing about it that day; I went to my aunt the day after, she lives in Suffolk-street in the Borough; I said to the woman, if I was able to crawl, I insisted upon going to my aunt's to let her know the affair; she got a man, and he and she went with me to my aunt's; when I came there, my master's brother-in-law was there.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I never heard his name; I had seen him a great many times before; he was telling my aunt the story about my master and me, and wondered my aunt had not heard it; I came in while he was telling my aunt the story; my aunt said, this man tells me you have been great with your master, if you have, I will not encourage you in my house, it cannot be a rape, and desired me to tell her the story; I told her what happened on Saturday; I was very bad, the walking made me worse; they led me out of the kitchen; I said, Aunt, what is the matter with me, I am worse than I was, it seems as if my inside was coming away from me; she bid me not frighten her; upon that, she said she would not encourage me, she could not have the trouble of it: my master's brother wanted a coach to carry me to my master's house; I said, I would not go to my master's house, I would die first, and he ordered Mrs. Bolton and the man that went with me, to take me to my master's house; I said, I would not go; he said I must, and they got me into a coach and ordered the man to drive to my master's; when I came there, I could neither stand nor walk I was so bad; I desired the young man that carried me in, to go for a doctor, to see what was the matter with me; with that a doctor came who is a quaker, a Mr. Vaux; when he came, my master called him into the little room, what he said, I know not; when he came out, I was ordered to go up stairs, and the doctor had me into the bedroom to see what was the matter with me; I said to the doctor. I was very much hurt and injured by my master; that I was a poor woman, and hoped he would do justice on both sides; he told me I was very much hurt and swelled, and I was so; he told me not to fret myself and grieve, for he would get me well so soon as he could; he gave me medicines to cure me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were the medicines to be taken inwardly or to apply outwardly? - To take inwardly; he gave me medicines two or three times a day, and then he said he would give me something for my fits; I had fits all day on Sunday and Monday; on Tuesday I was better, but could not assist myself to make water or any thing; I had a nurse to sit up with me on Tuesday and Wednesday; on Wednesday the doctor came to see me, and said my swelling was better; all the while I was in the house he attended me two or three times a day; he was with me once or twice a day from the Sunday night till the Thursday; on Thursday he brought a doctor to see how I was, and to take me away to a lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160030"></xptr>Who was that? - Mr. Grindall; he looked at me, but never said any thing to me how I was; after he went away, now says he, young woman, I will take you away to a country-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must not mention what he said? - I was carried away to Walworth</p>
               <p>What day was that? - The Thursday another doctor came, and dragged me down three pair of stairs; after he left me another strange doctor came to me; I was had away from my master's house by a doctor grown out a little in his back, I never saw him before; he said I must go, and dragged me down three pair of stairs to the lower pair of stairs; I said he would kill me; my legs were under me, sometimes before me, and sometimes behind; the coach was standing at the door; they put me into the coach and carried me to Walworth, and my mistress went in the coach to see where I was ; I was there a week, and the doctor that took me there attended me twice or three times a day; I had a nurse to attend me; I was very bad, and did every thing under me; I could not help myself the least in the world; I was there a week ; I was light headed; he gave me medicines, and at night stuff to make me sleep, but I never slept six hours while I was there; he gave me physic several times, and when it worked me he came to me at night and said I was thoroughly cured and well, that that was all he wanted; I said I was very bad ; he said you must go from this place; he told me my master was to come in the morning to let me know I was not to be any longer in that place; the next day he came again and said, if I was bad, I was bad; if I was well, I was well, but I must go out of the house, and the woman must get me out how she could; the woman told him they that brought me into the house must get me out; he said, he did not know that: the woman said, I must go to the hospital; he said, he did not know that, that he would not do any thing, and she might put me where she would; my mistress came the next day and my master's brother.</p>
               <p>Don't tell what passed between your mistress and you. Did you see your master again? - No.</p>


               <p>How long did you stay in that house? - A week, then I was sent to the hospital with the fits, and was weak and bad in my inside.</p>
               <p>When did you complain to a magistrate? - So soon as I had my senses, and was out of my fits that I could go.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more of your friends before you went to the hospital, besides Mrs. Bolton and your aunt? - No.</p>
               <p>Which of your friends did you first see at the hospital? - When I came to the hospital I saw my mistress first.</p>

             came crying into my room; I was a scouring pewter.</p>
               <p>You are a neighbour of hers? - Yes; I washed once at her master's house where she lived.</p>
               <p>How near did you live to her master's? - About three or four doors off; she came to me about twelve o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, crying sadly; I insisted upon knowing what ailed her; she was some time before she told me; she at last said her master had used her with violence and ruined her; she cried all the time, and said she wished her mistress did but know; I asked her if I should go for her mistress, she said, yes; I went for her and her mistress came in, and presently after her master; her mistress asked her what her master had done to her; she was in a fit; her master came in; he threw his hat into her face, called her a b - h, and said he only put his hand up her body, and his thing went in but three inches, and that could not get the b - h with child; Mrs. Warton was in the room, and her mistress and her master; Mrs. Warton went out, she could not stand it any longer, I suppose; that is all, I took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Did not you examine the part to see whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160032"></xptr> or no the story was true that she had told you? - I did not look, but her mistress took up her cloaths a little way; she staid with me that Saturday night; on Sunday I took her to her aunt's; I was afraid of her dying in my house; she was very ill that day, she was more in fits than out of them.</p>
               <p>What sort of fits, fainting fits, or strong convulsion fits? - They were not fainting fits, she struggled; I could not master her; what sort of fits they were I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did she beat herself much about? - No.</p>
               <p>Could she speak when in fits? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not faint? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not beat herself much? - To be sure, she struggled, and was in a fit very often.</p>
               <p>Was she subject to fits before? - I don't know; she told me she never had a fit in her life; I never had seen her but once before.</p>
               <p>Was she able to take any refreshment with you that day? - She did not eat once to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did she drink any thing? - She might drink some water; I don't know whether she drank any thing else or no.</p>
               <p>The next day you went with her to her aunt's? - Yes, being better I got the young man to help me lead her there; we were a long time getting her there; I staid some time at her aunt's house; there was a relation of her master's there, who afterwards took her in a coach to her master's.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>She struggled very much? - A good deal; she has been worse since.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what time she went to bed that night? - I don't know for certain, she was on the bed almost all day; she went to bed before me; it was the very day the fire happened.</p>

             came in? - I was in my own room, and my door was open; I saw this young woman come up stairs; my room is up three-pair of stairs forwards; she came up crying; I said to Mrs. Pratt, what is the matter with that young woman? by that time she came to the top, I heard her stamp with her foot and shrick, I followed her into the room, and asked what was the matter?</p>
               <p>Whose room was she in? - Mrs. Bolton's; I said, what is the matter? the young woman saw me, and said shut the door and let nobody in; I said again, what is the matter? Mrs. Bolton laid her hand on her, and said, what is the matter? then I went down into my own room; a little after Mrs. Bolton came down and spoke to me, and I went up into the room to her.</p>

               <p>When did you first hear of what has happened to this unfortunate young woman? - To the best of my knowledge it was the 23d day of the month; I think it was on a Monday;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160033"></xptr> I believe it was the Monday se'nnight after it happened, then I heard she was at her master's house; I concluded I should not go there to see her till she was moved; I found she was at Walworth ; I heard that from a woman she had lived with before; I went that night with her late mistres's mother and a relation of mine to Walworth to see her; when I saw her, I asked her how she did? she told me she was very ill; I desired her to relate the whole affair to me; she told me her master treated her exceeding ill, and ravished her; that the night before he committed the rape, while she sat up for the lodger and her master, her master came home first, sat down by the fire, undid his garters, and got up and kissed her; that she resented it, and he said there was no harm in a kiss; she said there was, as he had a wife of his own; that after that he put his hands up her petticoats, and she struggled with him, and then he went to bed; that she got up in the morning and did some of her work, and intended to go and pack up her things, and go after she had made the lodger's bed; that she went up with the chamber-pot, and that as she came out of the room she met her master on the stairs; that when she went up she thought her mistress was up stairs, but she heard the door shut afterwards; she told me her master had ravished her, and told me the particulars; I examined her, and according to the appearance I saw, I think she had been used extremely ill; this was on the Tuesday se'nnight after it was done, according to the best of my rememberance.</p>
               <p>What were the appearances from whence you concluded she was used very ill? - From the outside appearance, she seem'd to have received bodily hurt, she seemed exceedingly sore and inflamed.</p>
               <p>JURY. How long have you known this young woman? - I have known her ever since she was about five or six years old.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing whether she was subject to fits? - I never knew her having any thing, but once a fainting fit upon a fright, her mistress's child appearing to be almost dead.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunities of being with her much? - Not very much; her father and mother left her very young; she was bound out by the parish, and then she went to service; she was bound out to a relation; I have enquired at the places I knew she had lived at, if she was subject to fits, and cannot find that she has had more than one.</p>

               <p>I live in the house with Mrs. Bolton; I was in my own room; I heard a noise; they said Mr. Arnold's maid was in fits; I did not go up directly; I went up afterwards and she was out of fits and on the bed; I saw her linen; she told me her master had ruined her, and told me in what manner he had served her.</p>
               <p>In what manner did she tell you he had served her? - That he had run his hand up her body, and after that was concerned with her.</p>
               <p>How did her linen appear? - Very bad; I thought there was blood upon her linen.</p>
               <p>Any other appearances but blood? - Nothing else.</p>

               <p>Mr. GRINDALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I think it was on the Wednesday after the Saturday that this thing is said to be done on, that I was desired by Mr. Vaux to meet him to examine the young woman who lived at Mr. Arnold's; I did meet him, and went up to the bed-room where she lay and examined her thoroughly, as much as possibly I could; I was surprized to hear what she charged her master with, for I never saw in my life less reason to suppose a woman had been injured; and as to the hand, so far from the parts being sore, or being hurt, there was not the least swelling, the least inflammation, not the least discolouring; there was not the least reason to believe she had been so treated, as there must have been matter from the sore; upon passing my finger the passage was so narrow as scarcely to admit it; the parts did not seem the least torn.</p>
               <p>As these were the appearances, what was you called in for? - Mr. Vaux, who is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160034"></xptr> Quaker, thought from the young woman's charging her master, that somebody should be called upon to give affidavit; he agreed with me, that the fits were all that was the matter with her, and that a little country air would do her good.</p>
               <p>He agreed with you in the appearances? - Yes; I afterwards went to St. Thomas's, and examined her with Mr. Smith and the sister of the ward, and my assistant; we all agreed upon the appearances; she was brought into St. Thomas's last Thursday was three weeks ; I have no reason to believe any thing had been done to her; I thought on one side from the appearances that she had been scratching herself with her own nails; there appeared a scratch that was not there when I first saw her; there was no appearances of swelling or inflammation; there was at that time two or three streaks of blood on her shift, as if made with her finger stroked down.</p>

               <p>Had she any cloth on? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Was she in a convulsive fit or what? - I don't know what fit.</p>
               <p>Did she lay still while Mrs. Arnold searched? - She did not struggle; I believe she did not know Mrs. Arnold searched her; she told her afterwards, she said nothing to it.</p>
               <p>You are sure Mrs. Arnold told her she had searched her? - Yes, I am perfectly sure of that, I heard her.</p>

               <p>I live in Crutched Friars, I am a Cooper; I have known Mr. Arnold twenty-three years; I was at his house on Saturday morning the 14th of September, about eleven o'clock, in the left hand parlour.</p>
               <p>How far from the kitchen? - But a very little way.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Russ there? - Yes; Mr. Arnold asked me to come in and have a little wine and water with him; upon that he wanted some sugar; he said his wife was out and had taken the keys with her, but he would send for some; he put his hand in his pocket and gave her a shilling at the room door, and bid her go for some sugar and make haste; she did, and returned in five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Did she argue with her master and say she could not go nor would not go? - She did not; she seemed to be in perfect health, she went very cheerfully, and returned so; I never heard any bad character of the prisoner; he was always an industrious man, and a man that bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>She did not go out of the house with any reluctance? - Not a bit.</p>
               <p>- DOBBINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Rood-lane, Fenchurch-street, I am a taylor: I have known Mr. Arnold sixteen or eighteen years; I never heard any thing bad of his character in my life.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn.</p>
               <p>I lodge at Mr. Arnold's house; I have lodged there about seven years; he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the time you came home on the Friday night before this happened? - It might be one o'clock.</p>

               <p>The Lord Mayor was too ill to sit upon the bench during the Trial, but his Lordship came into Court previous to the evidence being summoned up to the Jury by Mr. Baron EYRE.</p>
               <p>The Rt. Hon. the LORD MAYOR sworn.</p>
               <p>I understand from Mr. Baron Eyre's summing up of the evidence, that the prosecutrix has deposed here,</p>
               <p>'that she was in a fit; that</p>
               <p>'upon recovering from that fit, she found he</p>
               <p>'had emitted in her;' before me she declared,</p>
               <p>'that it was the weight of his body that kept</p>
               <p>'her from struggling, and that she was in her</p>
               <p>'senses the whole time:' I understand, from the learned Judge's summing up, that she has said,' she went afterwards to pack up her</p>
               <p>'things;' before me she said,</p>
               <p>'she had packed</p>
               <p>'them up before, because her mistress had</p>
               <p>'given her warning; that she shifted her linen</p>
               <p>'and put on a cloth, but pulled it off before</p>
               <p>'she went to Bolton's house;' she stated to me that Mr. Vaux had said,</p>
               <p>'she had been</p>
               <p>'used extremely ill;' Mr. Vaux said before me in her presence,</p>
               <p>'that he never had said</p>
               <p>'any such thing; all he said to her was, don't<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160036"></xptr> ' be alarmed, you shall be taken care of; to</p>
               <p>'that she made no answer.'</p>

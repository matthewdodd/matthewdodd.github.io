               <p>You had but very little opportunity to observe his person? - No, but I knew him again, I just saw his face; he took the watch as fast as he could; I had only a hasty view of him, it was near ten.</p>
               <p>Then can you undertake to say, from that view of a man in a moment when you was laying on the ground, that the man that was brought back was the same man? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Have you ever seen him before? - No, not that I know of; I swear that is the man that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Was your watch ever found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who found it? - A young boy is here that picked up the watch; when the prisoner was taken, he said he had not the watch, and a young boy ran, and picked up the watch.</p>
               <p>Who was that boy, what is his name? - He is a stranger to me, I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself? - He said he had not the watch; they did not let me stop with him, because I had a quantity of goods; he was taken into custody, and I went the next day to appear against him.</p>

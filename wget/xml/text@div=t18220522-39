            . I live at Oxford. On the 30th of April I came to London in care of a deranged gentleman. We got to the Gloster coffee-house in a post-chaise about four o'clock in the afternoon, and called a coach which the prisoner drove; I told him to drive to Warburton's, <placeName id="t18220522-39-crimeloc208">Bethnal Green</placeName>

            , it contained the property stated in the indictment. I locked it up myself; he drove it to Warburton's - I paid him the fare, and forgot to take out the box, it was on the front seat, he had put it there himself; he sat us down about half-past four o'clock, and in a quarter of an hour I recollected the box; I am not certain whether his number was 860 or 862. About twenty minutes past eight o'clock I saw the coach on the stand at Cornhill, and knew it. I looked in, and the box was gone; the prisoner was fetched to me as the driver - I knew him directly, and told him I was sorry he should have drove off with my luggage, and asked if he had not set me down at Mr. Warburton's, he said Yes. I asked what he had done with the box of clothes and my great coat, he said he knew nothing about it; I collared him, and said I would insist on having it. I gave him in charge. The beadle got into the coach and searched it, and the whole of the property was found except a pair of slippers, and the box was broken all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. When was the property found - A. While I was gone to the Compter.</p>

Grubb went after him, he said if Grubb would forgive him he would endeavour to get back his property.

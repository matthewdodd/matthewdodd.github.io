                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising in New Square, Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn, and have been a great number of years in the profession—I knew the prisoner's father many years ago, who was also a solicitor—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated the 4th August, from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained a request from the prisoner to Mr. Appleyard, to undertake an administration suit for the winding up of his late father's estate</hi>.) The estate had never been properly administered, and he asked me to communicate with Messrs. Rail, which I did, and the various letters which I have here passed between us in the matter of this estate—in September, the prisoner brought me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) headed "Bank of England, Liverpool Branch," dated the 15th September, 1876, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "Ernest Thelli<lb></lb>sod," endorsed "Percy Robinson," which I passed through my bankers, Messrs. Gosling—he told me Mr. Thellison was administrator of his father's estate, and had given him that cheque as a loan and that he had applied for it on account of some expected share in the remainder of his father's estate—he told me he had seen Mr. Thellison, at the Victoria Hotel, Euston Square—he asked me to keep it for a day or two because he did not mean to take "it as a loan, but demanded it on account of some part of his father's estate—he afterwards brought me this letter signed E. Thellison. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir,—Mr. Percy Robinson borrowed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me which I sent him by cheque on the Bank of England, Liverpool Branch, requesting its acknowledgment In a letter received from Mr. Robinson, he informs me that he has deposited his cheque with you. May I request to know what is the fact, and what I am to expect," &amp;c.) I gave the prisoner 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 16th September, on the cheque at his request, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more at his request, and the balance 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to remain in my hands to pay some costs of copies of deeds he had ordered, which were to be sent to me on his business—in the course of business 1 sent the cheque to my bankers, and it came back dishonoured—I then communicated with Mr. Thellison.</p>

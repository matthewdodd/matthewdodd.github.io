               <p>- SPENCER. I am a constable in Tottenham. I was directed by Mr. Isaacs to watch his stable. I put myself in a place to observe without being seen, the first hat I observed was Kelly's boy bringing the horse and cart into the Roebuck yard, the horse and cart was put under the shed; a little white afterwards the prisoner Kelly came.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the cart - A. Rags and baskets of iron. When the prisoner came he took the baskets out, and cleared the corner of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart and horse from Mr. Isaacs stable. - A. About three or four yards. After he had cleared the cart I saw Beadle the horse-keeper bring corn in a sack, and he put it in the cart, Kelly was then standing in the hind part of the cart; after the sack was put in the cart Kelly then got in the cart and covered it up with some things over the sack containing the corn.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know at that time that the sack contained corn - A.No, he covered it over with rags so as to conceal it, he then backed the cart out and got into the street; I went after him and came up to the cart about ten yards from the Roebuck yard, I told him he was my prisoner, I took him for receiving corn belonging to Mr. Isaacs; he said he did not know that there was any corn in his cart. I took out the corn and the sack before his face.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find it covered with rags - A Yes, it was. I took out the sack, it contained oats, more than a bushel. I saw the direction on the cart,

            , in some court, Kingsland-road, he was a ragman. I have seen him often go up and down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Isaacs see the oats afterwards - A. Yes. The sack did not belong to Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the sack of oats come out of Mr. Isaacs' stable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Beadle - A. Yes, he was tried and convicted here. I have know him this twenty years, he is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a man able to buy corn, is he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Beadle say for himself in the presence of Kelly - A. His master wished me to let him alone till he had done his work. I let him alone till he had done his work. The corn is here in the sack.</p>

On the night of the 20th of June, I had a dispute with my comrade; he said that I should not sleep with him that night; I said I would find a bed at another place; I went out into the street and met with the prisoner; he asked me if I would go along with him; we went down Chelsea, to find a house open, it was twelve at night; finding no house open we agreed to lay under the trees till morning. In the course of the night, I was disturbed by the prisoner pulling my watch out, he cut the fob of my trowsers, and while I was taking my hat up he ran away, I could not catch him; at eight o'clock in the morning I found him in his lodging.</p>

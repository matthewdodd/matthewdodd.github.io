                  </hi>. I am barman at the Fox and French Horn, Clerkenwell—green. On 22d June, at a little after 10 at night, the prisoner came to the bar and asked for a screw of tobacco—he tendered a bad fourpenny piece—I saw it was bad, and told him so—he said, "I did not know it—he then left the house, saying he had no more money—he neither took the tobacco nor the fourpenny-piece—he went away, and I followed him into Exmouth-street, which is about four minutes' walk from our place—I saw him go into a small cigar-shop, and watched him through the window—he purchased a cigar, and put down a small coin; I went in as he was about to leave, and asked the woman belonging to the shop, what money he had given her—she said that he had given her a bad fourpenny piece, and she showed it me—the prisoner began saying the same that he had told me; that a gentleman had given it him for carrying a box—I did not give him the fourpenny piece back; this was another—I told him I should charge him with knowingly uttering counterfeit coin—I met a constable and gave him in charge with the fourpenny-piece.</p>

               <p>ANN NAYLOR sworn. - I am the wife of John Naylor: On Monday last I was going to the play-house in Well-street, about six o'clock in the evening, Charles Allen was with me; I had a child in my arms, and felt something at my pocket; as soon as I could get out of the mob, I felt for my money, and it was all gone; I had a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, two half-crowns, and two shilling and six-pence in silver; I immediately called out that I was robbed; the prisoner was behind me; I turned round, and pulled my gown over.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your money since? - A. No, I found half-a-crown upon the stairs.</p>

            Near where you stood when you felt something at your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ALLEN sworn. - I was with Mrs. Naylor; I had my hand upon her shoulder to keep the mob off from her child; she cried out that she was robbed; I immediately went down stairs; I laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with having robbed her; I had observed him having hold of her clothes near the pocket-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed that, why did you wait till she called out? - A. The mob made a push all at once; and when she said she was robbed, she said that was the man making down stairs; immediately upon her calling out, the prisoner made down stairs, and had got about as far as I am from your Lordship; I held him till the constable came; I was present when he was searched at the watch-house; there was a seven-shilling piece and a knife found upon him.</p>
               <p>JOHN TALBOT sworn. - I am a constable: On Monday night, between five and six o'clock, I was sent for to take charge of a man; it was between light and dark; I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>

            (To Allen.) Do you believe the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to the theatre, and I might be behind the lady, I cannot say; all of a sudden, she said she was robbed, and, in turning round sharp, several people fell backwards on the stairs; I was one, and then they laid hold of me. <rs id="t18020217-27-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

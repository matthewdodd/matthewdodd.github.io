                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my mother, Elizabeth Howard, a widow, in Church-street, Camberwell. The prisoner had been in her service not quite nine months—on the afternoon of the 7th of June I went into the room where the prisoner slept—my attention was attracted to a box there—I lifted it, and went and told my mother—we waited till the prisoner returned from church, about half-past four o'clock—she then opened the box—I found in it a brooch belonging to me, and two handkerchiefs belonging to my mother—the box was locked—I had kept the brooch in a drawer—this is it—we had given the prisoner warning on the Saturday night, to go away in a month—I know these handkerchiefs to be my mother's—we have more like them—one of them was dirty—the prisoner did not dress smartly till very lately—I had no reason to think she wore my things or my mother's—we never saw her—she had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there were no, wages due to her—we had a good character with her—I do not think she had been a servant at that place, but merely looked after the children—she seemed deserted by her friends—we gave her warning because she had been very deficient lately in attending to what was said.</p>

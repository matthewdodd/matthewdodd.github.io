                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 17, Heddon Court, Regent Street—on the 8th July last my house was broken into, and two coats and other things taken—Murray worked for me two months ago—last Wednesday week he came to my house—I said to him, "You are a nice young man to do what you have done to me." He said, "I am sorry for what I have done. I have come to give myself up"—he said he knew where the things were sold—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 328 A). I was called to the prosecutor's house—the prisoner was there—Mr. O'Niel told me that Murray had come there for the express purpose of giving himself up—he said, "I charge this man with breaking into my house on the 8th July, with another man, or two men, one of them in custody and the other not"—Murray made no reply—afterwards he said to me that he had been seen about the streets by several men who knew him, and he knew he should be taken into custody, and he did not want an innocent man to suffer—Barrett was in custody at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Leicester Street—about a quarter to nine on Sunday evening, the 8th July, I saw Barrett in Regent Street—I saw him again at half-past eleven coming out of Mr. O'Niel's house with a bundle—another man was with him, but I could not say that it was Murray.</p>

I went to bed on the 8th of July about twelve o'clock—I left home about nine o'clock and returned about twelve—the place was locked up when I left—I am quite sure of that—I did not discover my loss until the next morning, and then I found a window in the back yard had been broken through, which any one could put his hand through and unfasten.</p>

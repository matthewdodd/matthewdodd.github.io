Parsons' bank, and from there to 5, Sun-square, Bishopsgate, with Everett and a clerk from Janson's bank—it is a small cot<lb></lb>tage, the prisoner lives there—he was brought down to the front door by Everett—I told him that I was a policeman, and asked him if he had given a bill to be cashed for him at the London Joint Stock bank that morning, he said that he had—I told him that bill with a number of others had been stolen, and asked him how he came into possession of it—he said that he re<lb></lb>ceived it from a woman named Armstrong, next door—I asked him who she was and what her husband was—he said, "A tailor, and she is a tailorees, and works at Clare-market"—I asked him if she would be likely to be at home—he said, No, he was certain she would not—I said that he must accompany me to Clare-market to see if his statement was correct, and asked him if he had got any more papers or cheques which he had received of the woman—he said, "I have got one cheque and a piece of paper"—I accom<lb></lb>panied him upstairs to the attic and he took from his waistcoat pocket this cheque for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a coupon—three females were present, the last witness was one of them, but nothing was said upstairs about Mrs. Arm-strong—just before he went up I requested him to search his pockets very particularly to see if he had any more papers, received from Mrs. Armstrong—he said, "No, I have no more, and certainly I must know what papers she gave me"—immediately I had received the cheque and the piece of paper Mrs. Armstrong said, "I shall not wait any longer," and left the room—the other two remained—they were the prisoner's wife and mother—I then made some inquiries in the square previous to leaving the neighbourhood and found that Mrs. Armstrong had been seen in the square while I was upstairs, not two minutes before—though she was in the room I did not know it was her—she was in the room when the prisoner said she was at work in the market—I afterwards went and said, "It is of no use going to find Mrs. Armstrong, for she has been seen in the square not two minutes ago, if you come with me to the several public-houses we shall find her"—the prisoner seemed reluctant about going, and I said, "Who was that woman who left when I was here?"—he said, "Oh, that is a particular friend of my wife's "I said, "Where does she live?"—he said, "In Long-alley"—I said, "she knows something is wrong, I do not feel satisfied with the account you give, you must accompany me to the police-station"—he said, "I may as well be straightforward and tell you the truth, that was Mrs. Armstrong who left while you were there; I suppose you are going to look over my place"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "you will find several more papers"—I said, "Are there any more bank notes?"—he said, "No"—I found this bill case and several papers with "Brown, Janson, and Co." on them.</p>

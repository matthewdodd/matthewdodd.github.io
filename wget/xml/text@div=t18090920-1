I asked her if she knew whether it was a good note; she said she believed it was. I saw it was directed to Postlewaite, London; I asked her where that Postlewaite resided; she seemed to hesitate; in a little time she said she believed in Tooley-street. There was Westham, Essex, upon the note. On further questioning of her she said she believed the banking house was a large shop. I saw it was a new note, the writing was fresh; It was dated in January.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who gave you the half-crown? A. My sister; I did not look at the money as I gave it him - I had 7s. 9 1/2d. in my hand; the prisoner had plums in his basket - I did not see it drop in; the plums very likely covered it - I did not state that I gave it him - I threw it; I have said I did not think the prisoner had any idea of stealing it - the officer made me prosecute here to-day; the Magistrate sent a warrant - I was unwilling to prosecute - the officer did not scold me; he said it was his duty to take him when he found the half-crown upon him after his denying it.</p>

            . I am the officer. This girl applied to me - I went up to the prisoner; she was entreating him to return her the half-crown which she had given in place of a half-penny - I said, "If you have the half-crown, return it back;" he said he had no half-crown in his possession - he then turned out his pockets, and said,"If you doubt my word, search me;" I searched his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160140"></xptr>pockets, but found nothing - I took off his hat, and the half-crown fell down; I said, "I must take you into custody;" he begged hard, and said if I would let him go he would do so no more - I said I must do my duty to the public.</p>

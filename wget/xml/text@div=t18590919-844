                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Francis John Fowles; we trade under the firm of Fowles and Co.—there was a contract between the defendant and ourselves with reference to some coals coming by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation and the Eagle;</hi> this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated August</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd,</hi> 1859, <hi rend="italic">by which Messrs. Fowles and Co. agreed to sell, and Messrs. John Nicol and Co. agreed to buy, two cargoes of East Hetton double-screened nut coals from</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 250 <hi rend="italic">chaldrons, to be shipped from East Hartlepool, at </hi>11<hi rend="italic">s. per chaldron; payment cash, on handing bills of lading.</hi>) On 24th August, I went to the defendant's counting-house, in Lombard-street—before that time the cargo of the Specu<lb></lb>lation had arrived, I had given the bills of lading for the Speculation on a former day—I received a communication from our traveller, Mr. McGregor, on 24 th; he was then at Hartlepool—when I called at the prisoner's on 24th I took with me the two bills of lading by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle;</hi> I did not see the prisoner then; I met him in Finch-lane in the course of the morning, from half-past ten to eleven, perhaps nearer eleven—I told him I had received the bills of lading for the cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi>—I showed them to him—he wished me to leave them with him: I told him that that was not according to contract; that the money was to be paid upon handing bills of lading—he told me he wished to show them to his buyers, and if I doubted his honour in the matter, we had better not do business—I replied that a dis<lb></lb>pute had already taken place with reference to the previous cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation,</hi> and that it would complicate matters my doing so, but that if he would give me his word of honour that this matter should have no reference whatever to that, I would let him have the bills of lading; he said it should not, or words to that effect—I then asked him at what time I should call to receive the amount of the invoice—(I had left the invoice previously on the Eagle's coals)—he said at three o'clock, or from three to half-past—I then stated that I would call at three o'clock to receive the money, or the bills of lading to be returned, and that I would endorse them when we settled—we parted then, I think—the bills of lading were not endorsed at that time. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of lading was here read, dated Hartlepool</hi>, 23<hi rend="italic">rd August,</hi> 1859, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 148 <hi rend="italic">chaldrons East Hetton double-screened nut coals, shipped by Fowles and Co. in the Eagle; master, Benjamin Graham; to be delivered at Cherbourg. The invoice was dated Water-lane, Tower-street, August</hi> 24, 1859. <hi rend="italic">Messrs. J.

That was the invoice of the coals by the Eagle—it is not true that the bills of lading were given to the defendant on the understanding that they were to be handed to Mr. Wigdahl to enable him to send them to Cherbourg—I was not aware that he was going to use the bilk of lading until I had endorsed them—I have never been paid.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">with Mr. Poland</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I perceive you call yourself "Fowles and Co.?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Fowles is my brother-in-law—he has never appeared at all in this transaction—our offices are at 16, Water-lane—Mr. Fowles is there daily—he is about twenty-two and a-half years of age—we have been carrying on business twelve or eighteen months as general merchants, which includes coals as well as anything else—we had been dealing in coals about two months before this prosecution was com<lb></lb>menced—this contract was the first transaction I had with Mr. Nicol—this contract includes both the coals by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> and the coals by the Eagle—I did not present myself at his counting-house and solicit his custom; I believe Mr. McGregor did; I was not there—when the cargo arrived by the Speculation, and I delivered the invoice and the bill of lading to Mr. Nicol, he paid me the money for it, 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., after calling a second time—I had left the invoice, not the bill of lading—he was at home when I called; the money was paid about an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after being paid that 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did Mr. Nicol communicate with you and complain, whether rightly or wrongly, that there had been a breach of contract on your part, and that the coals were of a very inferior quality? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he sent along to my clerk in the afternoon of the same day, but I did not know the result of the conversation till the Monday—I do not think I saw the prisoner on the Monday; my clerk would manage the whole affair afterwards, I think wholly, up to the time of his leaving for the North of England—he intended to have gone to Hartlepool, or rather I proposed his going to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other places: he went to Hartlepool in consequence of a telegraphic message that he received from Mr. Wigdahl; I did not send him there—I am not aware that previous to his going to Hartlepool I had any conversation with Mr. Nicol on the sub<lb></lb>ject; I cannot swear I had not, but, as far as my recollection serves me, I say no—I cannot recollect that he ever stated to me that he had sold that very cargo of coals to Mr. Croll, the proprietor of some gas works, and that they had been returned upon his hands as little better than rubbish; I cer<lb></lb>tainly know, through my clerk, there was a dispute about it, but I never to my recollection saw Mr. Nicol on the subject—I saw this bill of lading of the Speculation before I was paid the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the word "heap" is written in here, in very small characters, and also in the margin—those words were in this bill of lading at the time I handed it to Mr. Nicol—I do not know who put them in; they were the same as we received them from the shippers—the original contract did not contain the word "heap"—I cannot say whether the quality of East Hutton double-screened nut coals is different to heap; it depends entirely upon how long the coals have been on the heap—I am not aware that the coals by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> are at all inferior to East Hutton double-screened nut—whether heap coals are inferior to East Hutton double-screened nut depends upon how long they have been on the heap—I am not aware that the description of coals stated in the contract is different from that described in the bill of lading as heap; it would depend upon the sur<lb></lb>vey or examination of the coals—there is sometimes a difference of from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between heap coals and coals not heaped; not in all cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Sometimes they are of less value? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I never knew</p>

               <p>heap coals to be of more value, they are subject to the contingency of being of less value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not "heap" a deteriorating term, to distinguish them from first class coals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it may be so; I should think it would be—there is not a word about "heap" in my receipt for the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo—the whole invoice is not in my writing, but my clerk's—the words "best double screened" were written by me at the request of Mr. Nicol—he did not refuse to pay until I wrote that; he asked me if I would do so and I put it—I wrote the receipt at his office—by the receipt I mean the words "creditor by cash"—I do not recollect whether Mr. Nicol produced the contract or not; I cannot swear that he did not, or that he did, it was such a matter of indifference at the time—I do not of my own knowledge know that the cargo of coals was refused by Mr. Croll, and that it was sold subsequently on the Coal Exchange at a loss—after Mr. McGregor was sent to Hartlepool, and before the cargo by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> arrived, I called on Mr. Nicol about three times with the Captain of the <hi rend="italic">Speculation,</hi> who wished to have it discharged; I think it was before the bills of lading had arrived—on those occasions the loss or damage accruing to him by reason of my alleged breach of contract was not the subject of discussion; he told mo that he was endeavouring to get Mr. Croll to take the coals, and that he had been offering Mr. Croll to allow him so much for taking the cargo off his hands; I think he said he offered 10 per cent.—he told me on the day that I took the other bills of lading, that Mr. Croll had refused to have anything to do with them—on the day that I applied for the bills of lading by the <hi rend="italic">Eagle,</hi> it was talked about leaving the matter between us to arbitration, but I refused, in consequence of his not performing his promise of the morning by returning the bills—on that 24th August, on receiving the bills of lading, I called at Mr. Nicol's office, and found him not in; I then left the invoice—Mr. Nicol had not previously requested that the bills of lading should be made out in his favour according to the usage of the trade—I do not know who the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> was chartered by; I never saw the charter party—he did not tell me that he had chartered the <hi rend="italic">Eagle;</hi> he might have told my clerk that he chartered her for somebody else—I did not charter her—by the bills of lading of the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> the cargo purports to be shipped by Mann, Brothers; they are the merchants who we purchased the coals of—the <hi rend="italic">Eagle</hi> cargo was likewise purchased of them—according to the usage of the trade the bills of lading ought not to have been made out to the order of Mr. Nicol; he did not request to me that they should be made out to him—the first bill of lading being to the order of Mann, Brothers, they endorsed it—it was handed to me with their endorsement on it, and I handed it to Mr. Nicol—the second bills of lading were not made out as the first, because we acted on our own account, Messrs. Mann, Brothers, got the bills of lading signed as our agents; our clerk attended to it—I never promised Mr. Nicol that the bills should be made out to his order, and never intended to do so—the two guineas for expedi<lb></lb>tion was charged, I believe, in consequence of a telegraphic message sent down to Mr. McGregor by Mr. Wigdahl, which I did not know at the time, to expedite the shipment of the coal; I only knew that from Mr. McGregor; subsequently—I did not know from Mr. Nicol that the bills of lading were required to be sent off to Cherbourg that same night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you understand about this charge "Expences in securing bill of lading, two guineas;" it is one of your own charges? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On receiving a letter from my clerk at Hartlepool I made out an invoice for</p>

               <p>the coals; and in his letter he stated that I was to make a charge of two guineas for expences he had been put to in having to go to Hartlepool to see these coals shipped, and I believe for some fees to expedite the shipment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not hear of Mr. Wigdahl's name in the first instance from Mr. Nicol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not—I only knew Mr. Wigdahl's name as a ship-broker—Mr. Nicol told me, after 3 o'clock, that he had handed the bills of lading to Mr. Wigdahl, and that he had got paid on account—he did not say that the bills of lading must be sent to Cherbourg that night; not a word about it—there was no one present at the conversa<lb></lb>tion in Finch-lane but Mr. Nicol and myself—I met him in the middle of the lane; he said he merely wanted to show the bill to his buyers—he did not say that he would settle at 3 o'clock, if all was in order, and only upon those terms—when I met him in Finch-lane, I think he had not been to business—he did not then speak to me about reducing the chaldrons into tons by adding 10 per cent, according to the usage of the trade—the first invoice was reduced into tons at his request when I went to settle for the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo; the percentage was not added—Mr. Nicol asked me how many tons there were, and I referred to the certificate, and found on the certificate 305 tons; that makes 104 chaldrons—when I saw him at twenty minutes to 4 it was at his counting-house—he did not then tell me that he had given the bills of lading over to Mr. Wigdahl—he told me that at the second interview; that was about ten minutes after we parted—he did not say that they had to be sent to Cherbourg—he said he had handed them to Mr. Wigdahl, and had received part on account; and he said if I would take back the bills of lading by the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo, he would pay me the difference, and I was to take the cargo in part payment—I presume he was prepared to hand me over a certain portion of the money he had received from Mr. Wigdahl; if I gave him credit for the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo, he would give me the balance—this cargo was more than the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> cargo—the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Speculation</hi> came in during that interview, that is Captain Wetherell—I don't know whether he is here to-day—I saw Mr. Nicol a second time, when he told me about Mr. Wigdahl—I refused to settle upon those terms, stating that it would not suit us to take a voluntary liability upon ourselves; that we were in the same position as he was; that we had bought and sold accordingly—he did not then say, "Then as a man of honour my mode of business is fair between man and man, let us refer the matter to some independent party, and I will deposit the money in the meanwhile"—he never offered to place the money in the hands of a third party; I was willing to refer the matter—he did not offer to refer the matter to some independent party; he said if I would indemnify him for his coats and expenses in sueing Mr. Croll for non-performance of contract, that he would do so, and I refused—I am not aware whether I saw him again next day—I went to Mr. Wigdahl that evening—he did not give me Mr. Wigdahl's address; I knew Mr. Wigdahl—I am not aware that I called on Mr. Nicol next day; I might have done so; I believe I called at the office, but he was not in—I really cannot recollect whether I had a conversation with him the next day—I did not then write down upon a piece of paper the basis of a settlement between us, and afterwards tear it up—that was on the previous evening.</p>

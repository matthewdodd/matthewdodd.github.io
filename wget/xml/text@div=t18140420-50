My handkerchief was in my outside coat pocket. A person tapped me on the shoulder, and told me that I was robbed. I immediately applied to my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone. I did not perceive it go from me. The officer shewed me the handkerchief, and asked me if it was mine. I am quite sure it was mine. It was a silk handkerchief, worth two or three shillings. An officer had hold of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer in the city. I first saw the prosecutor looking at Aldgate clock. I saw the prisoner trying to pick his pocket there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200030"></xptr>he did not succeed in picking his pocket; then the prosecutor passed me. The prisoner followed him until just before he came to the Bull inn, Whitechapel; there I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket. The prisoner had a companion with him; I took them both. The person that was with him did not feel in the prosecutor's pocket. He was committed. The bill has been thrown out. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief; I seized him immediately; he threw the handkerchief down the instant I seized him. I picked up the handkerchief and shewed it to the prosecutor; he claimed it. This is the handkerchief. Smith, the officer, was with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To the best of my knowledge that is the handkerchief I had in my pocket; I have got the fellow to it in my pocket now; they were both cut off one piece.</p>
               <p>- SMITH. I was with Drinkwater; he has told the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home with a shipmate of mine; I got stupid drunk. I have been in his Majesty's service a great many years; I had a severe wound in my head; I was discharged.</p>

            . I was on duty; coming to the top of Vine street, the prosecutor said he had been robbed. On the next day, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I went to the house, the landlord told me the prisoner was up stairs in liquor. She owned to me that she pawned the watch in Cranbourn alley. She had not above a penny about her when I searched her.</p>

I met the prosecutor at the bottom of Long Acre, I told him I was going home to warm myself; he asked me where my home was; I told him close to Chandos street; he asked me if I cohabited with any man; I said no. He gave me six pence to get some spirits; he asked me to bring a pipe of tobacco and a pot of ale; I did; we went to bed together; after I was in bed I said I should like to get up and have some supper; he said I might get up. I went immediately with the watchman and shewed him where the watch was pawned.</p>

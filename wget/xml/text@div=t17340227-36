               <p>David Morgan. I left my Window shutters fast about 10 at Night, I found them broke open between 6 and 7 in the Morning, - It was then Day light. The Roof of the Shutters was broke, and so they were pull'd pown - I lost 3 Ale-house Quart-pots, 3 Pints, a Half-pint, a Quartern and Half-quartern. A Table-cloth, a Child's Mantle, and an Apron - here is the Quartern-pot - this is the third time I have had my House broke this Year.</p>

I offer'd them something for it, but they both refus'd - Word was afterwards sent me to heave the Pot away, because it was got in a Robbery.</p>

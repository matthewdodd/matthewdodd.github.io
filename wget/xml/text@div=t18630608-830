                  </hi>. I am a servant at Mr. Farmiloe's, Tillery-house, Park-road, Holloway—one Friday night, about the end of May, at half-past seven, I went all over the house and saw that it was properly fastened up—I looked particularly at the windows, they were shut—about half-past five next morning I heard the police talking to Master, and I went down stairs and missed four coats; two from the hall and two from the dining room.</p>

About half-past three on the morning of 23rd May, I was on duty in Park-road, Holloway, and saw the two prisoners standing on the foot-path—they saw me, and directly walked away down the Park road towards Holloway, and turned to the right along the Holloway-road, and again turned to the right into the Camden-road—I saw no more of them for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I then saw them standing by Tillery-house—I walked up towards them, and they walked down to meet me—I passed them and saw they were followed by another constable behind—I spoke to him, and we both followed them down the Park-road to the Holloway-road—we met Sergeant Gould—I then went back to the Park-road immediately, and found the garden gate at Tillery-house open, and saw footmarks on the mould in the garden, and on looking into the area I saw these four coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying there—I waited there till Gould came, and then rang the servant up, and examined the house—there were marks on the catch of the front parlour window sill, which looked as if a knife had been used—I afterwards compared the marks on the garden mould with the boots of the prisoners, and found them to correspond.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, N</hi> 40). About four in the morning of 23rd May, I saw the prisoners in Holloway-road, being followed by the last witness—they were taken to the station-house—I asked them what they had been doing—Ayres said he was only out for a walk, for the benefit of his health, and he had called on the other to take a walk with him—we took their names and addresses—I previously knew where Ayres lived—I went to Tillery-house after that, and saw the footmarks on the mould—I also saw some dirt on the iron railings in front of the kitchen window, and saw the coats in the area—I also found marks of some nails on the window sill of the drawing room, as if somebody had placed their feet there—the catch of the window was pushed back, but the window was down—I called Mr. Farmiloe up, and we examined the place—I found some gravel from the garden on the cushions of the chairs in the drawing room—it was easy to get to the drawing room window from the garden—about nine o'clock that morning; I took the prisoners into custody, on suspicion of breaking into a house at Holloway—they said it was not them, they knew nothing about it—I took a boot from each of the prisoners and compared it with the footmarks on the mould—I made an impression alongside of the footprints, and they made the same impressions—on the window sill there was a mark caused by some nails—several nails in one of the boots corresponded with these marks on the window sill.</p>

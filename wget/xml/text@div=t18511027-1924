                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at Hither-heath. On the evening of 20th Oct., I was going from London with my father's cart—his name is James Field—when I got to Southall, at about 9 o'clock, I had the hay-cloth safe on the tail of the cart, and the rope—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—the cloth has my father's name on it—about half a mile beyond Southall I missed them from the cart—the prisoner was following me with his cart, walking by the side of his horses when I left Southall, and he afterwards passed me—when I got to the "Wagon and Horses" at Hayes, I left my horse and cart there, and went after the prisoner who had gone on—I got a policeman, came up to the prisoner, and asked him if he had seen the hay-cloth and rope, and he said, "No"—I asked him if he had them in his cart, and he said he had nothing but his own—the policeman then searched his cart, and found them—the prisoner had a boy with him, and before I got to him I heard him say to the boy, "You young b—, pull the cloth up or it will fall off."</p>

The last witness complained to me, and I went with him after the prisoner—I asked the prisoner if he had anything in his cart belonging to Field, he said he had nothing but what was his own—I searched his cart and found these things—he had two carts with him, but he was driving the one where I found them himself.</p>

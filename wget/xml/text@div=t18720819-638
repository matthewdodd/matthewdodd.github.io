                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man, Princes Street, Bear Lane—I know the prisoner by seeing him in my house two or three times before—I went into the house on 27th June—on 5th August, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I served the prisoner with a glass of beer, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad shilling, and I gave him a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—he remained a quarter of an hour after that—the shilling looked heavy, and as I had taken a bad shilling on the Saturday it raised my suspicions, and I kept it by itself—on Tuesday, the 6th, he came again for a glass of ale, and gave me a bad florin—I gave him the change—he picked it up, and was out in a moment, without time for me to apprehend him—I did not put the florin into the till—I sent my potman after the prisoner, but as he could not find him I went out myself, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after he had left—he accosted me on my way to the station, and said "Good evening, landlord; it is the first time I have seen you out; what are you going to stand?"—knowing the bad character of the neighbourhood I thought I had better do so, and we went into the Oak Tavern, where I stood him a glass of ale, and left him there—I gave information at the station to Lamming, and he was taken from my description—I produce the shilling and florin.</p>

The potman came out, and spoke to me, and half an hour afterwards the governor came out, and said "Good evening; have a glass?" I said "Yes," and he gave me one, and bade me good night. I was at work all Wednes<lb></lb>day, and was not in his house at all, and on Thursday I was arrested.</p>

            . I am a public informer. On Monday, the 3rd of September, I was passing Half Moon-street, in a gig, and saw a female in a fit; I saw the prosecutor go towards a crowd of about twelve people - the prisoner went up to him, and appeared to hustle him; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket - I took and held him by the collar till the Policeman came and took him; he took it from his near side pocket.</p>

             (Police-constable C 95). I took the prisoner, and took the handkerchief, which the prisoner had dropped down; I had been there assisting the person in the fit - I took him to the station, and found a crape shawl on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home about twelve o'clock on Monday night - I saw a crowd: I stood a few minutes, and the witness laid hold of me, and said I had taken the handkerchief - I denied it: another person said,"Here it is," and he said, "I suppose he has dropped it."</p>

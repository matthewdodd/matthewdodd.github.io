He was brought back by him, with a piece of linen handkerchiefs, containing ten in number, which had my own private mark upon them. About a fortnight after, I had reason to believe he had conveyed goods down to his father.</p>
               <p>Upon these being brought back, had you him committed? - No; being a young man, and knowing his friends, I was willing to shew him all the lenity I could. I let him go down to his friends at Horsham. By the return of the post, I acquainted his friends with what had happened; I likewise acquainted several of my friends with what had happened. In consequence of some letters from friends of mine, I went down to Horsham. I applied to a magistrate: he granted me a warrant to search his father's house. Upon searching it, I found concealed on the bed-teaster, a callico gown, four yards of sprig muslin, and six yards of Scotch Lino, all of them with my private mark upon them. The offenders were carried before the magistrate, and all committed to Horsham gaol.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Prince's street, Leicester-fields. On the 4th of August, the prisoner brought a piece of handkerchiefs, in the morning, to my shop: he wanted half-a-guinea on them. I asked him who he brought them from? He mentioned a person's name I don't recollect now; but he said a draper's, in Holborn. I stopped him, and sent to know the truth of it: I could not find any such person. I told him there was no such person, and desired he would inform me where he got them. He made some frivolous excuses: he first said he got them from one person, then from another. I said I could not give credit to that, and if he did not tell me, I would take him before a magistrate. Upon this, he confessed he had them from Mr. Stamford's; that he lived with him. I thought it was his first offence, and took some pity on him. I carried him to Mr. Stamford: I said I would leave it to him to do as he pleased about prosecuting. Mr. Stamford said he would consider of it, and consult some of his friends. I delivered the handkerchiefs to Mr. Percival.</p>

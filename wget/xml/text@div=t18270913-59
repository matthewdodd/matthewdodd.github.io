            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I missed from my drawers, in the first floor back-room, two yards of ribbon, a brooch, and a 5l. Bank note - the note was locked up in the chest of drawers; the prisoner left us on the 4th of August; I missed the 5l. note next morning, which was Sunday. I went to Bow-street, and got an officer; and on Tuesday morning, the servant who succeeded her, met her in the Park, and gave her in charge; she was brought to my house - her box was found at the British Coffee-house, Charing-cross; the officer searched, and found two keys, which would open all my drawers. I had seen the note safe on the 4th of August, a few minutes before the left; she had given me warning - I should have been glad to have kept her, she was such an excellent servant. I paid her her wages 25s. - I have not found the 5l. note.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was fetched on Tuesday the 7th; the prisoner was pointed out to me - I found her in a public-house, in company with a private soldier; I told her I took her on a charge of stealing a 5l. note and other articles from her master; she said"Oh! they can't prove it against me; I have not had a 5l. note in my possession how can Mrs. Neele accuse me of stealing a 5l. note, when she has been in the habit of lending 5l. notes to her husband and his brother; she must have lent him one and not put it down." I searched and found two keys in her possession - I asked where she had taken lodgings, she said, "Up there;" pointing towards Westminster - I asked her to shew me the house; she took me to the British-hotel, in Cockspur-street; she said,"That was her place, and desired I would not open her box nor let Mrs. Neele do it; but to take particular care of her keys;" she said they could prove nothing against her - I went to Mr. Neele's, and tried one of the keys, which I found in her possession - it opens the drawer the note was in; I went with Mrs. Neele to search her box, in which I found the ribbon and comb, also some new linen-drapery, with a bill of it, bought in Greek-street, Soho; amounting to 2l. 2s. 3d. - the keys open any of the drawers.</p>

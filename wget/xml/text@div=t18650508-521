                  </hi>. I live at 1, Crown-court, Portpool-lane—on the night of 20th April, I was at the Coach and Horses in Eyre-street-hill—Mrs. Silman was there—Mr. Silman was outside—I saw the prisoner—she pushed open the front door, and rushed up to the bar, and made a blow at Mrs. Silman—I put up my hand to protect her, and got my finger cut—Mrs. Silman was behind the bar—she is the landlady—she was standing up with her elbow on the counter—I did not see that the prisoner had a knife until I was cut—it cut three of my fingers—the blow was aimed towards Mrs. Silman's neck—there was a cry that she had got a knife—Mr. Silman came in and seized hold of the prisoner—I did not see what took place then—I had not seen her before that night—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a common penknife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you the wife of James Metcalfe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have been married to him—we were married down in Yorkshire—my name is not Mary Ann West—I never married a man of the name of West—the prisoner came into the house before Mr. Silman—she came in by herself—he came in a few minutes afterwards; as soon as he heard the cry about the knife—he did not follow her in immediately—he did not push her in through the door; I swear that—I saw her push open the door, and rush up to the counter—I think she would have stabbed any one that night; she looked in an excited state—she struck at Mrs. Silman—I know a man of the name of Franks by sight—I believe he is a witness here—I have not been talking with the other witnesses in the case—I was behind the bar—it is not a very large one—it was not crowded that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlady at the Coach and Horses—on the night in question I was at the counter when the prisoner came in about five minutes past 10—she came with a double handful of mud and threw it at Franks—she intended it to go over Franks—it went over another gentleman instead—she then ran away—she came back in about three-quarters of an hour—I was then on the private side of the counter, leaning on my elbow—the prisoner rushed up to the counter with her hand closed—I did not see</p>

               <p>that she had got anything in it—Mrs. Metcalfe was standing by the side of me, and she sent the prisoner's hand on one side—the knife was within a few inches of my neck—Mrs. Metcalfe caught hold of her hand, and the prisoner drew the knife between her fingers, and nearly cut three of them off—I saw the blood on her hand—my husband came in to catch hold of the prisoner, and she turned round and cut his little finger—after striking at me she stabbed Mr. Franks in the shoulder—she went deliberately up to him, as he sat in the seat—when my husband caught hold of her, she fell on the ground, and he held her until a policeman came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been married to Mr. Silman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three years—I am perfectly certain the prisoner rushed in—it must have been five minutes between the time of her coming in and in cutting Mrs. Metcalfe's hand and the entrance of my husband—my husband did not say anything at the time she threw the mud; he had not got time, because she only ran in and ran out again—he did not go outside the public-house and stay for nearly three-quarters of an hour waiting for her—he was not in the bar all the time—he was in the bar when she threw the dirt, and when she came back again he was outside looking at the lamps—he was not out more then ten minutes; prior to that ten minutes he had been in the bar—I could swear most positively that he did not push the prisoner into the house—he was not near her—she made use of a very bad expression when she used the knife—it was meant for Franks—she said she had not done for Franks yet, but she intended to do so, and intended to do for three of us that night—she rushed up very wildly at him—she went deliberately from me to him after cutting Mr. Silman's fingers—Franks was not drink<lb></lb>ing with anybody in the bar at the time—I have beard of a woman named Hewitt—I have seen her in the house—I only know her as coming to the house as a customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Coach and Horses—I was there on the night of 26th April when the prisoner threw this mud at Franks—I ran outside to see whether I could see her to give her in charge, but could not—I saw her again at ten minutes before 11; I was standing outside looking at my lamps, and saw the prisoner rush into my house hastily—I followed her in, and I heard Mrs. Metcalfe cry out, "She has got a knife, she has stabbed me"—I went towards her, but before I could reach her she stabbed Franks in the shoulder—I caught hold of her left hand, and in attempting to catch hold of her other hand she jobbed me deliberately on the hand with the knife—I secured her other hand, and in the scuffle we both went down, and she said to me, "I will put the knife in your b----belly"—I held her down till the knife was taken from her—this is the knife, it cut my knuckle down to the end; it was a very bad deep wound—I believe the prisoner had been drinking during the day, but she was sufficiently sober to know anything and do anything—she was sober at the time she came to my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Gloucester-street, Clerkenwell, and am a basket-maker—I know the prisoner, I lived with her between five and six years, as my wife—I had left her about six weeks before this affair took place, as near as I can judge—I was not living with anybody else, but I was very often in company with a young woman named Hewitt, through whom the whole of this affair has taken place—I was at the Coach and Horses on this night, drinking with her; the prisoner came in, threw some mud at me, and ran away—when she came in the second time I was looking through the door, and I saw Mr. Silman deliberately push her into the place—I was next to the doors—she was in Mr. Silman's arms inside—of course I was a great deal affected at the time—I own she struck at me, but after she struck at me I sat down—where I was hit I don't know—I was cut very slightly indeed, on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you and the prisoner lived together, were you very happy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were for a long time—she had seen me with Hewitt—Mr. Silman pushed her in, and as soon as she got inside the doors were bolted—I recollect hearing some one say that there was a knife somewhere—after she threw the dirt Mr. Silman went out of the house and remained out upwards of three-quarters of an hour; if he swears he only staid out two minutes that is false, his hat was sent out to him by Mrs. Silman after he had been out ten minutes or quarter of an hour—I did not see him come into the house again before the prisoner came in—I did not see the prisoner stab at Mrs. Silman; I did not see her cut Mary Metcalfe—when she struck at me she was in Mr. Silman's arms, he did not let her go at all—when I passed out he had hold of both her hands.</p>

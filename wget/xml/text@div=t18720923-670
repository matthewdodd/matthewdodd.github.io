                  </hi>. I am a watchman in the employ of the Millwall Dockyard Company—on 12th September, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty, and heard the noise of men wrangling, and then a splash in the water 4 or 5 yards from the wicket gate convenient to the bridge and about 30 yards from where I was standing—I called out "Help! help! a man overboard!" and ran with the lifebuoy in the direction of where I heard the splash, threw it into the water 4 or 5 yards, but no one took hold of it—I then gave the land end of it to the mate of the Nile—he is not here—I saw the two prisoners and a third person on the bridge before I heard the splash—I did not see any one fall, but I only saw two afterwards—the prisoners did not come and help me when I called out—they were looking at me—I went and got the drags, and dragged for twenty minutes, and almost immediately after I had finished dragging, the prisoners came to the wicket gate which admits persons into the docks—I let them in, and they came through—I asked them what ship they belonged to—they both spoke and said Von Platten, and passed on—I sent a man after them, because I was suspicious, and sent for my sergeant, and reported the matter to him. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out on a model the position of the swing bridge, the wicket gate, and the lock gates.</hi>) I ran across the lock gates with the buoy—there are three iron chains on the bridge, with stanchions about 3 feet 2 inches high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Coming from the lock to the swing bridge there is no fencing or guard—persons coming on this side from the river could not pass along here, because there is a gate which locks; the bridge comes across the public road, and a gate and paling prevent persons from going to the unprotected part—it is about 15 yards from my lodge to this gate—the bridge is 84 feet long—there are lights on the bridge inside and outside—it turns round on a pivot, and there are no lights in that part a it—the light is seven or eight yards from this end, and the same distance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230037"></xptr>
               <p>from the other end, and there are two lights on each side of the pier head—a little light burns in the box all night—I do not know who the third man was—the prisoners both appeared sober—it was a very loud wrangling—I should call it a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—there were only words till the splash came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I heard the wrangling I looked in this direction, and saw three men; and after the splash I looked on the bridge and saw only two—there is a gate here which was locked that night—it is always locked, except when a ship is coming in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the Millwall Dock Company—I pre<lb></lb>pared this model on a scale—the bridge is 125 feet from end to end, and there is 80 feet span of water—it is about 128 feet from the watchman's box to the end of the bridge, but where the men stood is a little nearer—he can stand in his box and reach the wicket—it is about 10 yards from the bridge to the lock gate—there are two very large carriage roads on the bridge, and outside them on each side are the public footpaths, which are a foot and a-half wide—the descriptions of the chains and stanchions is correct—Graham called me up on the night in question, and I went to the ship <hi rend="italic">Von Platten</hi>, which was lying nearly a quarter of a mile off in the river dock—I went on board, and shook Bernston, who was asleep—he awoke, and I asked him how many men came aboard the ship—he said "There are two of us"—I said "Where is the other one that was with you on the bridge?"—he said, "In the water I believe"—he can talk English very nearly as well as I can—I said, "What makes you think he is in the water?"—he said, "Because I was standing with him and that man, "pointing to Christiansen, "on the bridge"—I would not allow him to say anything more—I tried to awake Christiansen, but could not, as he would not—I rubbed him and pulled him—Bernston then said, "We three were standing together on the bridge; me and the man who is in the water were always good friends, the other two were wrangling together; after they had been quarelling some two or three minutes I turned round and left them to go to the dock, and in about a minute I heard a splash in the water, and turned round and saw the man struggling in the water like a dog, "and he put up his hands like this—I asked him if he called for any help or assistance—he said, "No, I did not; I went towards the gate to the police-station"—I said, "Did you do so?"—he said "No"—I said, "What became of the other man?" he said "In about two or three minutes he came round by another direction to me and said, 'Let us get on board'—I said, "Did neither of you call out for assistance?" he said "No, we went on board"—I could not awake Christian<lb></lb>sen, and I believe he had been drinking—When I got back, I assisted in dragging for the body, and we found it in about an hour and a-half afterwards under the centre of the bridge—it is dead water; there is no flowing in or out only when they are locking. We communicated with the Metropolitan Police, and the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the ship about 12.50 and found both men in their berths, sound asleep—other men were in their berths—I saw the officer of the ship—he is not Jacobson.</p>

               <p>evening of 12th September I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi> barge in the docks, from 80 to 100 yards from the bridge, and just before 12 o'clock I heard a noise like two men quarrelling; it was very loud, but I could not make out whether the words were English or foreign—I then heard a very heavy smack as of flesh meeting flesh, and directly after that a splash in the water, and some one called out—I did not see a man come along this bridge, but I heard chains rattling and saw a light, but could not see the person with the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that I heard a sound as of the <hi rend="italic">clash of flesh; us the smack of an open hand</hi>—I thought it was on a barge close to the bridge—I was on the same side of the water as the wicket-gate, and about 8 yards from the noise—I had no means of leaving the barge, as she was not lying against the dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Von Flatten</hi> at the time the accident happened, but I left that day—the two prisoners were seamen on board—they were shipped in Sweden—Johann Petersen was also a seaman on board—the last time I saw him alive was about 1 o'clock in the day on the 12th—he was working at the cargo with the other two when I left—they were all three good-conducted men, and, as far as I knew, there was no ill-feeling between any of them—they always seemed to be the best of friends, and I had to deal with them hourly, so I know—I did not see them again till the morning of the 13th at 8 o'clock, when I said "You must have been beastly drunk last night; I can see it now, "and I knew that they had no liquor on board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The ship was going out of dock that very morning, but she was detained till the next day on account of these men being taken away—the men have a little drink the night before a ship goes away—I had seen the prisoners and the deceased for three months—they may have had a word over their work, but nothing of any consequence—I wish to explain that any sober man may fail in there on any dark night—these chains are not fit to be taken hold of.</p>

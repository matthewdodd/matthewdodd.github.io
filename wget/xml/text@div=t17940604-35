Finding neither the prisoner nor Mr. Tuting to call for two or three days, I enquired what became of the prisoner, we sent to Mr. Tuting to Chelsea, and could not find him there, we wrote to Newmarket to Mr. Tuting, he answered the next morning and came I believe the second or third day. That is the letter we sent.</p>

            Look at that draft which you say was the one presented? - This is the draft. I don't think that this is Mr. Tuting's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about the draft when you went to him? - I did not suppose at that time that it was wrong; I withheld the money from him then, from his then state supposing he would make a bad use of it, my suspicion arose afterwards from his not coming in two or three days.</p>

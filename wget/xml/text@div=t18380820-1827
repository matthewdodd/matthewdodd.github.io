I did live at No. 2, Oddy's-row, Islington-green-about a year and nine months ago, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper-in consequence of which I went to No. 3, Jewin-court, Jewin-street—I there saw the prisoner—I said I called in reference to an advertisement I had seen in the paper, stating that money was to be obtained on freehold property, life Interest, &amp;c.—inquired for J. Pepper, Esq.—the prisoner said, "I am the prin<lb></lb>cipal—I caused the advertisement in the paper—I do business in that way, walk in"—I went in—he inquired the nature of the property, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200056"></xptr>
               <p>I described as a manor farm, and land situated at Wadsworth, in the west Riding of York—I told him I had a quarter share at the death of my father, who was aged sixty-four or sixty-five—he inquired the sum I wanted—I told him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had no doubt he could obtain that sum for me—he said he had clients, making use of their names, living at Ips wich, who would purchase the property, and he had no doubt they would give me that sum—he desired me to call again in a few days—I did so, and saw him—he said he had seen his clients, and that he could not give me that, but he would give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I agreed to—he said he would give it me, part in money, and part in a bill at two months—I agreed to that, and left—I was desired to call again, which I did a few days afterwards—he then said he had heard from his clients, who not having any money at their command, would give me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, or two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—that was the third time I called, which was about a week or a fortnight after the second time—I agreed to take two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—he did not give me them on that occasion—on the next visit to Jewin-street, which was the latter part of November, when I went into the front-parlour, or office, I saw two bills lying on the table—the prisoner then said, "I have received the bills from my clients in the country," meaning Ipswich—he produced them—they were ready prepared, with the exception of my signature as the drawer, on the supposed acceptor—this is one of the bills he so produced—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I looked at them—I inquired who this "Nicholson and Co.' the acceptor, was, and what they were—he told me they were merchants—I inquired what merchants—he answered, "general merchants," and that they resided at Ipswich, and were highly respectable men, and the bills would be paid on the day they were due—there was no address on the bill, but "3, Jewin-court, Jewin-street," as their address—I inquired how I was that the address was "Jewin-court," when he had just informed me they lived at Ipswich—he said they lived at Ipswich, and they would be in town, and the bills would be paid at Praed and Co., bank<lb></lb>ers, Fleet-street, where they were made payable—he then brought the bills from the front parlour to the back, where I saw Mr. Adolphus Warres, Attorney at Law, and Mr. Lewis the clerk—the latter two persons left the back and went into the front parlour, and the prisoner brought the two bills to me, and, laying them on the table, said, "Put your name there as the drawer"—I did so—we then went into the front parlour, where I saw a parchment lying on the table-when we went in, the two persons left, and went into the back parlour—they were then called into the front par<lb></lb>lour—I then signed the said deed or parchment—one deed, and a memorial—they were not read over to me before I signed them, nor was I asked to have them read—after I had signed the bills were delivered to me by the prisoner in the presence of the two other persons—he said, when he delivered them to me, "Now, here are two bills as good as the Bank of England," and that they would be paid on the day they were due—the prisoner and myself then returned into the back parlour again, and after that, he took a sovereign out of his pocket, saying, "I will lend you this out of my pocket, which you can repay me when the bills are met"—that was in the back parlour—we then went to a public-house at the corner of Jewin-street, where we had some refreshment, for which the prisoner paid—he then named about the bills being good, and not to go and fool them away, for they were as good as the Bank of England-when the bills became due I presented them at Praed and Co's., but they were not paid—consequence</p>

               <p>of that I called on the prisoner on my way home, and saw him—I told him they were not paid-"Oh,' he said, "my dear fellow, they will be paid; there is three days' grace allowed on all bills"—I went three days afterwards, and they were not paid then—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner again—he told me his clients were then in the country, but would he shortly in town, when the bills would be paid—I called repeatedly af<lb></lb>terwards, and saw the prisoner repeatedly at the public-house—he always made some frivolous excuse, saying his clients would be shortly in town, and the bills would be paid, and so forth—I shortly afterwards gave him to custody.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Dawson, you have never been asked who you are, or how you get your living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am, I believe, what is termed a gentleman, though a little reduced perhaps—I do not live with my family—I have ceased to do so some time—I am at my fa<lb></lb>ther's almost every day—I presume, Mr. Clarkson, this has nothing to do with the inquiry—I have lived away from my family about a twelvemonth—I have lived there, on and off—sometimes I am there and sometimes not—the last time was about two months—I have slept there within less than two months ago—my father lives at No. 2, Oddy's-row, Islington-green—I now live at No. 4, Ann-street, Wilmington-square—I have lived here about five or six weeks-before that I lived in Wood-street, Old-Street-road, and several places—I lived in Northampton-street, Northamp<lb></lb>on-square, before I went to Ann-street—I went from there to Ann-street-occupied a back parlour in Ann-street—the landlady's name was Miss o'Brien—she is a single woman, to the best of my knowledge, between twenty and thirty years old—I have known her ever since I have been in the house, not before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What rent do you pay? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Am I bound to answer that question?—well, I will satisfy you-3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week latterly, but it was more before-Ebbs was my landlord before I went to Ann-street—I am not a married man—I do not live alone—I live with a lady, who has, been some time under my protection—I have supported her as my wife—she is as virtuous to me as, if you have a wife, your wife is to you—it is not Miss O'Brien—I lived in the back parlour in Northampton-street—I lived there a fortnight—I lived in Queen-street, Northampton-square, before I went there—that is the next street, I think—I lived there about two days-allow me to say I paid my way-before I went to Queen-street, I lived in Popham-street, Lower-road, Islington—I lived there, I think, as hear as I can guess, about six or seven weeks, or it might be two months or ten weeks—I was a lodger there-before that I lodged at Mr. Baker's, No. 7, East-street, Hoxton Old Town—I lived there about the same time-eight or ten weeks-before I lived at Mr. Baker's I lodged in wood-street, Old-street-road—I had one room—I lived about eight or nine months there-before that I lodged at No. 8, Paul-street, Finsbury, between two and three months, and with the same landlady as I lived with in Wood-street—she left one house and I moved with her to the other—I went by the</p>

               <p>name of Dawson—I never went by any other name—I have never taken apartments in any other name—I always went in my own name—I shall not answer your question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What means had you of living from the time yon went to parl-street, up to your coming to Ann-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That which was afforded me by my father—I told you my father supported me in the first instance—that is the way in which I got, and still get my living—the only way—I do not get it in a dishonest way—I get it only by support I have from my father—I do not get it by any sort of work—I live by my father's support alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had money from the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money has passed between our hands. Do you mean as consideration, or what different sums have passed, sometimes a sovereign at a time, sometimes half, and sometimes less-never more-altogether I suppose I have re<lb></lb>ceived between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—I will swear I have not received above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sovereign is the largest sum I have received at one time—I have had a sovereign once or twice—I will swear I have not received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I have given a signature for every sum I have received—I will swear positively that I have not had more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether from him-when I saw him the first time I asked him if he was Mr. Pepper—he said, "No, I am the principal—I caused the insertion in the paper"-when I asked him if his name was Pepper, he said in an off-hand way between yes and no, "Walk in, I am the principal"—I believed he was Mr. Pepper-when I asked him, he said "No."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the prisoner authority to put up this property by public auction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I first saw the prisoner in October or Novem<lb></lb>ber, last twelvemonth, about that time—I cannot tell what month it was in—I unfortunately kept no memorandum of these transactions—I have other property besides this coming to me at the death of my father, rever<lb></lb>sionary property—I do not live in a secluded way—I have played, and believe all of us have more or less—I think you are playing on my feelings now—I do not feel myself bound to answer whether I have played a good deal—I am twenty-nine years of age—I don't feel myself bound to tell you when I left my father's roof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think I understand you to say you put your name to the deed and a receipt for 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without reading it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know the sum I put my name to—I supposed it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never saw the consideration money—I could have read the figures, but I did not observe them—I don't believe the figures were there—they could be added after-Warren and Lewis were present when I put my name to it—I do not feel myself bound to tell you whether I applied to anybody else to dispose of the property, now how many persons I applied to, or how many persons I unsuccessfully ap<lb></lb>plied to—I do not know who furnished the prisoner with the schedule of the land—he has been up to my father's, and he has a plan of the estate—he has been once to my father's—my father knew I was about getting money on the property.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I forget how long it is since you swore you always paid your way? I said from Queen-street, where I only staid two days—I paid my say for two days—I do not feel myself bound to say how many lodgings have gone away from without paying my rent—I will not answer—after executing the deed I only received these papers, which are no use to me, and how could it pay several pounds which I was in debt?—I do not feel would to say how many pounds I was in debt—I have always endeavoured pay my way—my circumstances have remained the same since I exe<lb></lb>cuted the deed as before—I was pressed for money at that time—I put my name as drawer to these bills, on the day I signed the deed—I read the bills, and asked several questions about them—I took particular notice of them—they were dated, November 23rd-when I signed the deed, I did not exactly notice the date of it—I was not aware of the date of the deed, till I saw it at Hatton Garden-had I known the day on which I signed the deed, was the 5th of December, I should then have made more inquiry respecting the date of the bills, being the 23rd of November—I believe I executed the deed about the 5th of December—I signed the bills the same day I received them—that was the day I executed the deed-as I said before, the deed not having been read over, I did not know whether it did not bear the same date as the bills—I first went to Praed's banking-house, on the 21st or 22nd of January last, and I went the second time three days after—I think the first time was on Monday, and Thursday was the second time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever go to see Mr. Crook the auctioneer, to see if he could sell "the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes-being recommended by the prisoner—I went once to Mr. Crook—I do not remember whether that was in October last year—I made one application to get the bills discounted—I cannot exactly state the person's name to whom I applied, but he re<lb></lb>sides in a turning out of Holborn—I did not see him before I went to him for that purpose—I have seen him since, passing by—I do not know the name of the court—it is a turning leading into Lincolns'-inn-fields—it is in Turnstile—it is a tailor's shop—it was a young man in the shop I went to—I cannot positively say whether he was the master or the fore<lb></lb>man—I was not referred to that young man by any one—I suppose it was some little time after I took the bills, that I went—I cannot say how soon after—I have applied to somebody else—I cannot exactly recollect the day I went to the person to discount the bills—it was not a month after I signed them—I cannot answer whether it was a fortnight or a week, it was under a month—I cannot say nearer—it was not a person I knew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was promiscuously passing by and saw the party there—I went into the shop and asked him to discount the bills—the tailor's shop—I inquired if they did business in that way—He was the door and asked if I wished to buy any thing—I said, "I am not in want of any thing at present, but have you plenty of money in the house?"—he said, "Yes, I have a little, I have got enough for you; how much do you want?"—I said, "Why I only want a hundred, a couple of fifties;" and there is something for you to laugh at—I said if he had money in the house, as he said he had, I would have no objection to take a</p>

               <p>coat and trowsers or so, if he would discount these bills—he said, if the bills were good he would do them for me—I do not recollect what name was over the door—I did not particularly observe the name—I never noticed, and I did not ask him his name, not till I went again-of course I went again—I never saw the man till I went the first time—he asked me to take a dress—I said, "I have no objection to take an article or two, I am not particular to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so"—he said, "If the bills are good I will do them with pleasure; and if they are good you can have the money to-night"—this was Saturday afternoon—I never saw him after<lb></lb>wards on business—I might have met him promiscuously—I never saw him but that once, to be in his company, that I am aware of—I do not remember whether I went to the house again the same night—he said it the bills were good he would do them-another party came up stairs into the shop—the young man who had taken the bills of me passed them into his hands, to take down the particulars, the names and amounts; and he was going down to the kitchen, or cellar which he had come from with the bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this the first time or the second? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only called once—I said the bills were good, and I also said, as the prisoner told me repeatedly, that they were as good as the Bank of England—it was my firm belief, then, that they were, not knowing any thing about the prisoner, I took him for a gentleman—I had got the bills in my pocket—I had been walking about to call at one place or another—the party was about taking them down into the cellar to take the particulars of them, but being a little doubtful, not having been in the shop before, and not knowing any thing of them, I said, "Can't you take down the particulars before my sight?"—I did not like the sight of the stairs, being very dark—I was a little doubtful of the appearance of the place he was going to, and of the security of my bills, and I might speak a little firm to him—he went down a few steps—the other called him up and said, "Come up here, the gentleman is doubtful about the bills—he is fearful you are going to run away with them"—he said, "Oh, here are your bills"—I wanted the money, and rather regretted being so sharp with him—I said, "I am very sorry I have offended you, I merely said to this gentleman, 'Why can't you take down the particulars before me as well as taking them down stairs?"—he would have no more to say to me, and put them down—after talking to the other one, I said, "I am very sorry I have offended you, if you will do them, I will give you a certain remuneration, and I should like them done as soon as possible"—he said "No, I decline them, if I had done them you would have had the money to-night, but I decline them altogether"—I said, "Oh, the fact is this, you have not so much in the house, and you will not do them, and put me of with an excuse because I spoke so sharp about them"—he would not cash them—I became vexed at my hastiness, and endeavoured to urge him to do them, and said I would give him remuneration—I cannot tell what month this was in—I did not ask his name-if he had taken down the par<lb></lb>ticulars before me, I should then have said, "To whom do I entrust these bills for discount?"—or, in other words, ask his name, but he did not take the particulars—I recollect making another application to get the bills discounted—that was before the bills became due—it was not a month after the first application—I did not say that it was—I said it was under a month—it was not a week after the first—I made the second application</p>

I lived at Ipswich—I know Thomas Nicholson—I have seen him Write—I believe this acceptance to be his—I saw him write at the Bull, in Jewin-crescent—I cannot say what he was writing—I know Henry May—I saw him serve that same Nicholson with a subpoena on the 10th of July last, at a quarter to ten o'clock at night—I have heard that Nichol<lb></lb>son</p>

               <p>lived in White Lion-street, but he was served at No. 10, Leicester-square—I cannot say whether that is a gambling-house—I afterward went with Mr. Lewis to serve him with a subpoena to attend this Sessions—I saw him then at the same place—we were waiting sometimes two hours, sometimes three, and sometimes four hours, before we could get an opportunity of serving him—we were there at night as well as day—we served him in a butcher's shop, in Castle-street, on the 17th of this month—we had been looking for him two hours that night, and frequently day after day, on the 21st and 24th of July, and the 3rd and 17th of August—I have known Nicholson since the autumn of last year.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed to serve a subpoena on Thomas Nichol<lb></lb>son before the last Sessions—I fancied he was the man—I had seen him once before, but at the time I first saw him I did not know him to be cholson—I afterwards found it was Nicholson—I served him with a sub<lb></lb>poena last Sessions through a court leading to the Panorama, in Leicester-square, No. 16, but there is a back-way to it—I have understood it to be a gambling house, but I do not know it—he received the subpoena from me.</p>

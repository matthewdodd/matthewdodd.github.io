            . I am shopman to Mr. Smellie. I have known the prisoner nearly twelve months. On Monday week he and his brother called to see me. I asked him into the parlour while his brother went to fetch some spirits. I left him in the parlour while I went to serve a customer; he went out in about a minute, and did not return. He did not stay to drink the spirits. His brother came back. A sovereign and five half-crowns were on the mantle-piece, in a half-pint measure, with other silver; it was all taken - I had seen it an hour before; nobody but me and Wood had been in the parlour. I went to look for him, and met him the same night very drunk. I gave him in charge.</p>

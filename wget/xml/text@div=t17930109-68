The lead was not laid in the gutter at the time it was taken. The man is a slater. I did not see it compared, I was with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>(The lead deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The three pieces exactly corresponding with the one piece found, except a piece which had been cut off from the side of one of the pieces since it was left at the public house, opposite the sessions house in the Old Bailey, the last night.</p>

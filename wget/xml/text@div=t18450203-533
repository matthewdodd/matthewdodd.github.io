                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Cowper, a linen-draper, in Beech-street. About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th of Feb., the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked for bonnet-ribbons—I showed them some—they said we had none to suit them, they wanted black satin with stripes, and we had not one of that sort—Smith then went outside to see what sort we had, and I went with her—she did not point to any, and came in again—I had, before she went out, seen Davis take a ribbon from a drawer I had on the counter, and put it under her shawl, and when I came in again I told a young man that she had it—she said she had not—I said, "If you have not got the piece of ribbon, you have given it to the other girl"—Smith then said, "If you don't give us in charge, I will tell you where it is"—Smith after<lb></lb>wards gave it up from under her shawl—this is the ribbon—it is my master's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> I did not take it out of the drawer; Smith took it off the counter, and gave it him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Cowper's employ. About five o'clock on the 4th of Feb., I saw the two prisoners in the shop after they had taken the ribbon—I heard Clark accuse Davis of taking a piece of ribbon—I saw them make an attempt to go out of the shop—I held the door—I told Davis she had the ribbon—she denied it, and took off her shawl, and wished me to search her—I told her I should not do so, but to give me the ribbon—the ribbon was produced by Smith—I sent for an officer, and gave them into custody.</p>

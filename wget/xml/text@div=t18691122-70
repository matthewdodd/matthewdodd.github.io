                  </hi>. I live at 55, Englefield Road, Islington, and am a retired tradesman—I was formerly a wholesale shoe manufacturer—I have known Mr. Russell twenty-five years—I always found him an honest, hard<lb></lb>working man—he is an intimate acquaintance of mine—on this day I was at his house, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I always used to call on him once or twice a week—I was with him from 3 o'clock, with the exception of a quarter of an hour, about 5 o'clock to 6.57—he left me about 4.30 to go and clean himself, to go to the Britannia Theatre—during that time I had a glass of ale at the public-house, facing where he lives—he joined me there at 5 o'clock—I wished him "Good night," and went away for a quarter of an hour—I then found I had left my carpet-bag and two lasts behind, and I returned back to the house—the prisoner was there—the shop was shut—I rang the bell, and he opened the door—he had his hat on—I told him I had left my bag and the lasts, and we went into the shop to look for them—I had a pair of trowsers in the bag—the lasts were not in the bag—we looked for the lasts, but could not find them, and I said, "We had better light the gas"—the meter was under the window of the shop—he turned it on and lit one jet—we found one pair of lasts and the bag, and I took them away—we were about twenty-five minutes looking for them—we went out to have a glass of ale—the prisoner shut the door, and locked it—I did not see what he did with the key; put it in his pocket, I suppose—I did not see a piece of rushlight on the floor, near the baskets, when we left the house—I never saw it or thought of such a thing—after we came out of the public-house the prisoner said he did not care for sitting so many hours in the theatre—I was going down Shoreditch, and he walked with me—we went down Pitfield Street and Shoreditch, to Hoxton—when we got to the theatre I took my watch out and said, "It wants three minutes</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You went to the shop at 3.30, I understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was then having a glass of ale, and I went over to the public-house to him—we remained there till 4.30—I had a bottle of soda-water, and he had a glass of ale—we played at skittles—he went away to dress about 4.30, they were going to leave home at 5 o'clock—if it had not been for leaving the bag I should not hare gone back again—he came back to the public-house after he was dressed—I bade him "Good night" directly, and left him in the public-house—I went back to his house about a quarter of an hour afterwards—the shop was shut, and the family had gone some time before—the prisoner had his hat on ready to go out—when we left the house again he had another glass of ale—I had some soda-water again—we remained there about ten minutes—we came out of his shop both together—we left the gas alight when we came out, that was done intentionally—it was what I should have done myself—it was my suggestion that it should be left alight—I think I said, "Leave that alight, I think it will be safer"—I saw him turn the gas on at the meter—I did not smell any gas at all—we were only in the shop—it was about 6.5 when we left—I can't say exactly—I noticed some baskets against the wall—they were in their usual place—I did not smell any paraffin—we did not hare any candle—we could see well enough by the gas—I do nothing now—I did lend money; but I lost 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in five years, and I gave it up—I hare lent money to the prisoner, as a friend—if he asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would have it, or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he owes me a few pounds at this time; about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—not more, on my oath—he had that before this affair happened—he paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the week before—I did not know that he was not paying his rent—it was not time to pay it then—he has been seven, eight, or nine months in this house—I can't say exactly, I am sure.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called as a witness for the prosecution at the Police Court—I am twelve years old, and am the prisoner's daughter—on 13th October I went to the Britannia Theatre with my mother and the rest of the family, except my father and Mary Ann Jones—my father came to the theatre afterwards, about 7 o'clock—the performances had commenced at 6.45—the baskets produced used to be put on top "of one another aquarist the wall—they usually contained paper of any sort—my father was taken in custody after we came home that night—he had not left us till we left the theatre to go home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and estate agent, of 116, Culford Road, De Beauvoir Town—on 19th November I made a valuation of the goods, stock, and furniture, at the prisoner's house, St. John's Road, Hoxton—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I valued each thing separately, and put a price on each, excepting the drawers and trunks, which were valued piece by piece, and then put in as a whole—the total is 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a description of property was given to me by Mrs. Russell, as having been taken off the premises independently of what I have taken—I have valued that separately—the 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is all that I actually saw and valued—to the best of my judg<lb></lb>ment that is a fair and proper valuation—the front room first-floor was nicely furnished—the furniture was very good—there was a cabinet piano-forte, and some engravings in gilt frames; a gilt looking gloss, some carved mahogany chairs, and an ottoman—I valued the stock at over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think it was a fair and proper stock for a shop of that size.</p>

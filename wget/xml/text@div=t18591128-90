                  </hi>. I am manager of the business of John James Russell and others in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars—they are iron-tube manufacturers—the prisoner called on me at their place of business at the latter end of July—he said "I want a list of prices; I shall require some tubing, and as the job will be a large one, I shall require a large quantity. I have the contract in a very low figure, and I want your prices"—I furnished him with a list of prices—next day he came again, and said that if the prices were our lowest they were not quite so cheap as he could get them, but as it was necessary to have a good article, he would give us the order—he gave me his card—this is it; it has on it, "July the 27th"—I wrote that on it—I then asked him for references, and he gave the names of his re<lb></lb>ferences on the back of the card—one of them I declined to receive, on account of its distance, and he gave another one, Mrs. Scott, near Bethlehem Hospital—I did not go there myself, not till afterwards; I sent a man—I went 2 or 3 days afterwards—I never saw the prisoner after he had the first lot of goods, which he had the next day or thereabouts—after I had the report from my man, I told my man it was not sufficient for him to have a large quantity of goods—I supplied the prisoner with goods before I saw Mrs. Scott—he told me he had a large square of houses erecting at Bow; that he had a number of men there, and they were waiting for the tubing to go on—I was not present at the delivery of any of these goods—the reason for my parting; with the goods were the references he gave me and his own statement that he was an extensive builder and a contractor, and that he had works at Bow, and that he had a number of men waiting to go on with their work and they were waiting for the tubing to go on—he said the work he was doing at Bow was building a square of houses—he did not mention the number, only it was a square of houses—he did not mention any particular part of Bow—he said he had got a wharf at Branch-place, Hoxton—Branch-place wharf, I think he called it—I went down to Branch-place after he had the goods—I did not find him there—I did not see any person representing him—there was no business whatever going on—there was no name—there was no wharf or any appearance of a builder or con<lb></lb>tractor; nothing whatever—there was no timber-yard—I made inquiries about houses being built at Bow; I did not find any, nor any building going on—I did not see any square of houses in course of being built—I inquired of residents there and sent my man there—I saw the district sur<lb></lb>veyor there.</p>

               <p>and other persons there are none—it was about 27th July that the prisoner first called on me—I was not. present when he was indicted for stealing these tubes here—the case has not been tried here, only before the Magistrate—I can't repeat the words that I said, exactly—he was not charged with stealing these very tubes; it was simply an error in the indict<lb></lb>ment he was not tried for stealing them; it was Withdrawn—I was here in court—I did not hear a verdict of Not Guilty I went before the Grand Jury, but he was not charged with stealing—I don't think the work was used—it was before last Sessions that I went before, the Grand Jury—I heard Mr. Sleigh say that he was charged with obtaining these goods by a trick—it was merely the correction of an error made by the Magistrate's clerk putting down "stealing" instead of "obtaining by false, pretences"—it was on 27th July that be first came—I wrote, the date, on the card my self at the time he gave me his card—gave me the, name of Williams as a refer<lb></lb>ence—he said this on the card was his own, name—he gave me his card, and said that he was a builder and contractor, and that was his name—in reply to my inquiry, "What is, your name?" he gave me his name—in reply we gave prices we required to know the name of the person and he presented me his card and said, "If you have any order from me they will be printed orders in the name of John Maher"—I never heard of persons carrying on business in another name than their own—I never heard of persons buying a business, and letting the old name remain—I never heard of Mr. Smith buying a business of Mr. Brown, and Jetting Mr. Brown's name remain—I don't remember an instance of it—the prisoner gave me a reference to Mr. Williams, which was a long way off—I did not go to, inquire if there was such a person; I sent to inquire—it was partly in consequence of that reference that he gave me that I supplied him with these goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If that reference had been given, would you not, have supplied the goods, even if you had not know anything of other parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if I had had a reference given, and I found that reference was satisfactory, I Would not have supplied the goods on that reference alone, but combined with the other statements—reference, was made to Mrs. Scott—I sent to Mrs. Scott to inquire, and the reply was very flattering to Mr. Maher—I am not certain whether the goods were supplied before I made inquiries of Mrs. Scott, or after—I am rather inclined to believe that I got the reference first—it was partly in consequence of the reference that I supplied the goods, and partly on his own representation—the first lot of goods was supplied about the day after his first application—I did not supply the first lot myself—I did not give him any of these goods myself—I told my men not to supply the prisoner with any goods—that was, after he had had the first lot—the first lot was about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not direct my men not to give him more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was not decidedly 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but a, few pounds' worth—I did not to the best of my recollection say 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never mentioned a definite sum, but a few pounds' worth—I never told Jackson, but my own men, ward and Evance, who are here in court—I told them not to allow him to have any more but a few pounds' worth—I told them about the time that he. had the goods—it was on 27th July that he called on, me, and the goods were had within a day or two afterward—I won't be sure that it was before 1st August that I told Ward and Evance not to supply him—I never saw him after he had any goods, though I wrote for him—I went to Branch-place, myself when he had had the first lot of goods—I am not quite certain that it was before 4th August—there is a No. 10, Branch-place—I went there, and was shown into the back room—I saw the house at the. back—that room looked</p>

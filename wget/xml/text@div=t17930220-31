               <p>- FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was digging a shore in Somer's Town, on the 23d of January; we always make it a rule to go to dinner at twelve o'clock; the carpenters go to dinner at one o'clock, and one of the carpenters was going to dinner, and the man that was wheeling some stuff away was saying something to him about the carpenters being likely to lose some of their tools; in consequence of hearing this I went round to see, in the pursuit of the man, and the other man followed me, and I saw the prisoner at the bar out in a field, just behind the building; this was at about a quarter after one; I followed him out into the field, when I got within an hundred yards of him I saw something under his arm of his left side; he looked round and he saw me a coming, and made towards a ditch where there is a good deal of water, and then I saw him drop the saw from his coat, from his left side into the water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I was going across the ditch and he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. With that I never stopped at the ditch to see what it was, but I made away and catched him by the collar, and when I catched him by the collar I asked him what he put into that ditch? and he said, nothing; with that says I, come back, you shall go back and see; when I brought him up to the ditch he dropped the saw in; the water was all muddy; I told one of the carpenters that was in pursuit of him, I told him to put his hand into the ditch and see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200056"></xptr>what it was; with that the man pulled out the saw, and I asked the prisoner at the bar whose saw it was? I had him then by the collar; with that he said, it was his own; I asked him how he came to put it there? then he said, he saw me coming after him and I might think that he stole it, with that he said then, that the saw belonged to one John and Richard, but did not mention any surnames; with that I told him he must go along with me to the public house, and he refused, and he said, he brought the saw from Knightsbridge; I took a plane out of his right hand pocket at the same time, which he said, he brought from the same place, and that he was going to carry them to Cambden Town to these two men; I was not satisfied with this, I took him to a publick house and sent for the constable; he first offered me six shillings to let him go; I told him no, if he gave me six guineas I would not let him go; with that there was a number of carpenters in the house, but none of them owned the saw or plane, with that he offered me nine shillings to let him go, and produced the nine shillings and three halfpence on the table; that was all the money he had, with that the constable said, there was no owner for the saw or the plane, we had no right to detain him; I told the constable I would take him before a magistrate till there was an owner; we took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed till the Monday following; I heard nothing of any owner till the Monday; I have got the saw here; before we took him to the office he seemed rather impertinent, and I insisted on his being searched, and he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper, with that he kept it in his right hand and refused to let any person see the sight of it; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a number of duplicates, the first duplicate that was looked at, it contained three saws, being pawned for eight shillings and six-pence; we told over the duplicates and they amounted to twenty, and in the twenty duplicates there was seventeen saws pawned, and two rules, two planes and a plow; two coats, a waistcoat and two pictures. (The saw produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Chilton. How could they get at this saw? - They may get up a temporary ladder up a wall, and I sat in the other room eating my dinner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man gave it me, the saw and the plane together and asked me to take them to pawn for him; I work for the man, his name is

They rode through Colbrook, and then two Men followed them at a distance; and on this side Longford, the same two Men came up to them, with Handkerchiefs in their Months, and their Wigs and Hats pull'd forward over their Faces. He on the Chesnut Horse held a Pistol to this Evidence, and said, you must go along with me; and then taking hold of his Horse's Bridle, led him down the Lane; the other Man bringing Ludbrook in the same manner. Then making them dismount, he on the Chesnut Horse said to this Evidence, Are you the Lad that swore against Child? No, says he, I have been Post-boy but a very little while. Was you ever rob'd yet? (said the other) No, said the Boy; Why then you must pay Beveridge now, said he, and swore he'd be reveng'd upon somebody for poor Child's sake. Then they turn'd Ladbrook's Horse loose, having first cut his Bridle. One of'em then went off with the black Gelding, (on which this Evidence rode) and the other bound their Hands behind'em, ty'd'em back to back, and fasten'd'em to a Tree in a Ditch. The Man then ask'd Ladbrook if he had any Gold in his Pocket, he told him he had but 3 s. 6 d. He then put his Hand in Ladbrook's Pocket, and finding no more Money, did not take any thing from him, but went away after the other. This Evidence and Ladbrook with strugling got from the Tree, and went tied back to back to an Inn in Longford; from whence the Ostler came with them, and went down the Lane, where they found the Gelding loose, and the Bags cut open.

             deposed, that he had known Hawkins two Years, but had not been acquainted with Simpson till last August; they had often consulted together to rob some Mail, and particularly about a Week before the Fact was Committed, they laid their design of Robbing the Bristol Mail. Accordingly about Eleven a Clock on Sunday the 15th of April, they took Horse at the Blew Boar Inn in Southwark; Hawkins on a tall bay or brown Gelding, Simpson on a Chesnut or Sorrel Mare, and this Evidence on a dapple Grey; they crost the Water at Kew Ferry, din'd at the 3 Pigeons at Brentford, staid there till 6 in the Evening, call'd at the Post-house at Hounslow, loitered on the Road, till they came to the Post-house at Colbrook: where they supt on Horseback, and heard that the Mail would come by between 1 and 2 in the Morning; from thence they came to Langly broom about midnight, where they agreed to dispatch Simpson alone to meet the Mail, he went, they loiter'd till his return; and about 1 a Clock they saw the Post Boy and a Traveller together, and Simpson following them. They then consulted again, and resolv'd that Simpson and this Evidence should both follow the Mail, and that Hawkins should watch at a distance: because he being pretty bulky, would be the more remarkable. Hawkins and this Evidence then chang'd Horses, and followed the Boy and Ladbrook through Colbrook; and on this side Longford, this Evidence and Simpson rode up to them, and taking hold of their Horses Bridles, led them down Harmonsworth Lane, where they dismounted them; this Evidence left Simpson to bind them, and took the Gelding and Mail to the end of the Lane, where they found Hawkins waiting: they all rifled the Bags, and carried several of them to Hounslow Heath, where they selected the Bath and Bristol Bags, and threw the rest away; thence they rode through Kingston and Wansworth, and riding down a bye Road, they searched the Bags; and putting what they thought proper into their Pockets, they threw the Bags and the rest of the Letters over a hedge; and taking their way through Camberwell, came along Greenwich Road to the Hand Inn in Barnaby-street, between 5 and 6 on Monday Morning. There they put up their Horses, drank a pint of burnt Wine: and sometime after took Coach and drove to the Minories, where they parted, and went by different ways to Francis Green's, at the Cock and George in the Minories, at which House they went into a Room by themselves; and the better to take off suspicion, they call'd for a Candle, Wax, Paper, Pen and Ink: then lockt the door and examined their Prize: and reserving only the Bank bills, they burnt all the other Notes and Letters with the Candle, which they set in the Chimney. They had Three 20 l. Bills, One of 25 l. half a 50 l. Bill, and 2 halves of 25 l. each; which they equally divided. That the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172205100003"></xptr> Monday following, this Evidence being Apprehended, made this same Confession, before Mr. Carteret Post Master General: and by his directions the Prisoners were taken, at a House in Green Arbour Court in the Little Old Baily.

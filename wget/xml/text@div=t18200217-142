            . For some time we had missed wine, and in the course of five days we found the stock eighty-five bottles less than had been sold. On the 3d of February I received information, and went down to the warehouse about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, when the men ought to be at breakfast. I found one half of the beer-cellar flap, which opens into the street, open - they ought both to have been down. I called out,</p>
               <p>"Below! Who's there?" After a moment's hesitation, the prisoner said he was. I went down, and at the bottom of the beer-cellar stairs, on the right-hand side, is the door of the wine-vault, which I found forced open by the hinges. Thinking somebody else was there I told the prisoner to go up; I went up with him, and put down both the flaps. When the cellarman came, I told him, and desired him to keep the prisoner in the cellar till I got an officer, but he let him go, and told me he had run into the mill next to my premises. I followed him, brought him back, and put my hand to his pocket; I felt something hard, and told the cellarman to search him. Finding me determined, he pulled a bottle of Port wine out of each pocket - it was drawn out of a pipe I had. I charged him with robbing me; he made no answer, but presently after he took two more bottles from the ground, which were, uncorked, and dashed them into a tub of water - they were on the ground in the beer-cellar, not in the wine-vault; no wine ought to have been there. I took the bottles out; they both had wine left in them. I gave him in charge, and desired them to search the beer-cellar. The cellar-man said, in his presence, that there were two more bottles at the end of the beer-cellar. The prisoner was my servant, but had no business there at that time.</p>

            . I am cellarman to Mr. Hill. On the 5th of February, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to breakfast, and left the cellar quite secure. I shut both the flaps, barred them, and put the keys in the counting-house. I returned about half-past nine o'clock, and found it open, went to the wine-vault, and found the hinges off the hooks, and the door broken open. There was a pipe of Port on the draught - I had left no wine in bottles, except three that were uncorked; the prisoner went into the wine-vault with me, and my master told me to secure him. I observed his pockets bulky; he went to the mill for water, but I followed, and brought him back. My master told me to search his pockets, but he said,</p>
               <p>"That is more than you or any man dare to do." I said,</p>
               <p>"If you have got any thing in your pockets, deliver it up." He took two bottles of wine out, one corked and the other uncorked. I sealed them, corked them both, and gave them to Mr. Hill; it is the same sort of wine that was in the pipe. I asked him what induced him to do such a thing? he said he did not know. He said there were two more, and he wished me to take them away, or throw them down, but I did not touch them; he took them up, and put them into the water - Mr. Hill took them out. He said there were two more bottles behind the prickles, and I found them there. I found another bottle of wine with the seal partly cut off.</p>

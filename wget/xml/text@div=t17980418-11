               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. This indictment charges the prisoner with the greatest offence that can be committed by a human being, under the aggravated circumstances of the object of it being a poor unprotected child, the fruit of her own body, when it had no power to struggle for the preservation of its own existence.</p>
               <p>Gentleman. This is a case which deserves all your attention. There are circumstances so extraordinary in it, that those who look at it superficially, will hardly, perhaps, be prepared to decide, with satisfaction to their own minds, to what the death of this child was owing. It is an arduous task that is thrown upon you, and you must decide; considering the case with fair mercy and indulgence to the prisoner, taking care at the same time, that false mercy does not supersede that duty which you owe to society, that offences of this mighty magnitude, if they are committed, may not remain un punished.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. That the offence of murder has been committed, there is no doubt upon earth, and the single enquiry here is, to whom that guilt attaches. (Here the noble and learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, Upon this evidence you are to decide by what means this child came by its death; and it is not necessary, in ascertaining the guilt or innocence of a person, that parties should be present seeing the blow inflicted, or the thing done, which produced the death of the child; if there are pregnant convincing circumstances, which work conviction upon your minds, that is the evidence which you will follow, when your aim is to arrive at the truth of the case; and as I said in the outset, I say again, this is a case which calls for all your attention, and all your deliberation: and, with respect to this prisoner, with you are the issues of life or death, for if you impute guilt to her it is impossible that mercy can interpose between the conviction and the consequences of that conviction, the execution of the law upon her. The case against the prisoner leaves the child in possession of the mother, in full health; the child is found dead; there was no other person in the house, and there was no communication with any other person, which could tend to produce the death of the child. Then the evidence brought by the witnesses for the prisoner, is a very extraordinary story, and you are to say whether it is a true history of the transaction, that a man, God knows who not known to the prisoner at the bar, should go to these two houses in the neighbourhood, and enquire, at an early hour, for a child, with no view but to murder it, is a very extraordinary occurrence; that, afterwards he should go to this woman, having no connection with her, and put the child to death. If one stops and considers what should act upon the human mind to produce such consequences, one is lost and bewildered in the enquiry - But how is the child found? Why it is found stripped of its day-clothes, and its day-clothes were folded up and deposited in the place in which the mother used to deposit them:- Well, is all this done suddenly? there is time taken, the petticoats are pinned up, and a brick pinned up in them, in order to produce with more certainly, the death of the child, by sinking it in the water-tub. Could this be done immediately? Where do we hear of her crying out for help? The house is in a row of small house; the next door neighbour hears no outcry, and nobody appears to have called out for help.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. This is the evidence, and these are the observations which my situation extorts from me to make; you are to draw the conclusion; you are to consider the case with all the leanings of humanity that justice will permit, but, remembering always, that you are not to lose sight of justice; that here is an inquisition for blood, a fellow-creature has been deprived of life. and somebody is guilty of it; whether the prisoner is guilty or not, you will answer by your verdict.</p>

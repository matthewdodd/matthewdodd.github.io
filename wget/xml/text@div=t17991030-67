On the Wednesday following, in the evening, he came again, and asked me why I did not come; I told him my man did not like to go out after six o'clock; I was to fetch it from Tavistock-hill, on the Hampstead-road; I then declined having any thing to do with it, and I recommended him to a neighbour who had light carts and small horses, his name was Webb; I went with him to Webb, and he told him he had twelve or fifteen trusses of hay to part with, and he was to go the next evening about six o'clock for it; and the next evening Webb overtook me as I was going there; I walked up Tavistock-hill to a public-house, the sign of the Load of Hay, and called for a pint of beer; I was not present at the conversation between them; that is all I know of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep horses and carts for hire, on the Hampstead-road, about nine doors from the Adam and Eve; On Wednesday evening, the 9th of October, the prisoner and Dayson came to me, Dayson asked me if I wanted any hay; I told him my horses went to grass at present, and I had hay enough for them in the mean time; Dayson said, because this man has got ten or a dozen, or fifteen trusses of hay to dispose of; I agreed for it; the prisoner asked me whether I could fetch it that evening; upon that, I asked the prisoner where the hay was; he told me close by Tavistock-hill; I told him I could not fetch it that evening; then the prisoner said, can you fetch it in the morning, I told him, no, I could not fetch it in the morning; I would fetch it in the evening of the Thursday; he told me to come to the Lord of Hay, upon Tavistock-hill, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know in what service he was? - A. No, I did not; I gave information of it to Crocker, the officer, at Bow-street, because I began to have some suspicion of him; I went on the Thursday evening with my horse and cart; I overtook Dayson on the road, and he walked with me as far as the Load of Hay, there I saw the prisoner; we called for a pot of beer, I sat there about a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner followed me; he desired I would go with him, and he would shew me where the hay was, and not to bring my cart up first; I told him I would stop till he was ready, and I stopped about a quarter of an hour at the public-house; I did not see Crocker, but he was waiting somewhere about the neighbourhood; my horse and cart stood in the road facing the public-house; the prisoner came, I followed him up to the farm, and he laid hold of my horse's head, and led him into the rick-yard; he turned the horse about, and the tail of the cart stood against the barn-door, I was in the cart; he said, you have no occasion to come down, I will give you the hay up; then he gave me some hay out of the barn, done up; in trusses, there were twelve truffes in all, as they were counted afterwards; says he, stop, and I will cut some more; then he cut another truss from the rick, and was making the band for to tie it up, when his master, and Taylor, one of the Bow-street officers, came and took him; Crocker came up directly afterwards; Mr. Allaney said, what, Mr. Holyoak, I have got you at last; says he, master, I think you have got me first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was all a contrivance of your's to induce that man to do what he ought not to do? - A. No; it was no contrivance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it not a contrivance of your's and Crocker's, and Dayson's, to entrap this man into a selony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You made a bargain with the prisoner for this hay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you not think it would have been more kind and moral in you to have said, I do not think you are doing that which is right, and I will tell your master if you do it? - A. I do not know his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think it would have been more honest, more moral, and more humane, to have told the man he was doing wrong? - A. I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Allaney that you were to receive this hay from this man? - A. No; Crocker did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Allaney knew of the fact, did he not? - A. Certainly he must.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore Mr. Allaney was robbed by his own consent? - A. I have said all I can say; Mr. Crocker had told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you at all persuade this man to make you an offer to fell hay that did not belong to him? - A. No; he came to me without my expecting it.</p>

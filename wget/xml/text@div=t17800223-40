I missed a silver salve-box on the 12th of this month, out of my shop or parlour. I had it out with me on the 10th. When I came home on Saturday the 12th in the forenoon, one Matthews came and asked if I had lost my salve-box. I looked in the place where it was generally kept, and missed it. I went to the Rotation Office, where Matthews produced the box. The prisoner was at the office.</p>
               <p>What passed there? - I could only say that it was my property.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of this month, I was called up by a lodger of mine, and told that they had found this box in the hampers belonging to the prisoner. He goes out with apples in hampers on an ass, and sells them for me. I received it from one of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>(It was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Vine-passage. On the morning of 3rd Sept. I was drinking with the prisoner and some companions at my house—I told the prisoner to get up and walk out of my house—he did so, but some bad words passed on both sides first—about ten minutes afterwards he called me out—he was standing at his gate—I went up to him, and he struck me with a hammer—I fell insensible, and have been in the hospital ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to the prisoner—I saw him standing at his gate, speaking to M'Carthy—he struck M'Carthy over the eye with a hammer from in-doors—M Carthy was taken up insensible—I heard the prisoner use bad language, but not M'Carthy—the blow was inflicted the moment he came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. On 3rd Sept. I examined M'Carthy—he had a lacerated wound of the eyebrow, a contusion of the forehead and face, and concussion of the brain—I could not see the eye at all—he was in danger three days—I believe this large hammer was the one used (<hi rend="italic">not the broken one</hi>)—the jagged part pro<lb></lb>duced the wound, and this large surface the contusion, which I doubt whether the smaller hammers would have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was the one with the broken handle; I did not handle the other for six months before. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The handle, or any foreign body, might have produced the contusion, but I do not think it possible anything but the iron would produce such a wound.</p>

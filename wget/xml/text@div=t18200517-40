            . In consequence of information I watched Mr. Farncomb's house, I was six or seven yards off - the prosecutor's house is up a court. About ten minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came out of the court, I followed him to Fenchurch-street, and took him into a grocers'-shop, near the corner of Mincing-lane. I took from his pockets five bottles of wine, and asked him where he got them from? he said the cellarman had spoken to his master about them, and he was to pay for them on Saturday night; I took him to the Mansion House, and then to the Compter. I went and took the cellarman, but he was afterwards discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wine Office-court, Fleet-street. On the 27th of October, my wife's cloak was lost from the house—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the habit of coming to see a lodger—she was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody and then charged her friend, whom she visited at my house, with taking it—that person is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Abethel, a pawn-broker in Calthorpe-place, Gray's-inn-road. This cloak was pawned on the 27th of October, by the prisoner for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Mary Smith—I am certain of her—she carried it in her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at Somers-town—she said she did not steal the cloak, nor pledge it, but she met a young woman in Fleet-street, who asked her to go with her to pawn it, that she went with her, but did not go into the shop—I asked, if she knew the young woman's address—the said, no, she did not know where she lived, nor her name—I took her to the pawnbroker, and he identified her.</p>

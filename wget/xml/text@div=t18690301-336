On the morning of 12th February, about 12.30, I examined an empty house, 145, Edgware Road—I observed a footmark half in and half out of the house door—I looked through the letter-box in the door, and saw a man looking over the banisters—I called 116, and directed him to run round to the rear of the mews—I looked through</p>

               <p>the letter-box, and saw three men go from the landing window on to the leads, which form the roof of the stables—I went on to the leads, and went along from one end of the mews to the other; when about half-way, I heard a noise of glass breaking, and when I got to the end of the houses, I saw a man's legs going through the skylight or trap-door of Nos. 2 and 3, Tich<lb></lb>bourne Street—I jumped down the trap-door and caught hold of the prisoner Johnson—Smith then ran after me, and caught me by the throat, and with the force of the pressure I was obliged to let go of Johnson—I drew my staff and struck Johnson, and my staff broke—<hi rend="italic">D</hi> 40 came to my assistance—I found this cord beside the door where they had got down—it was a very wet night, and the cord was perfectly dry—the place is a printing office—all the type was upset, and the gas fittings broken—I saw Britton in the house when we took the other prisoners, he hid under some boxes in a corner.</p>

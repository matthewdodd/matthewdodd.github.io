                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman, No.</hi> 414). In consequence of information from Mr. Moses, I watched James's residence, 14, Oxford-street, Stepney. On 17th Nov., between eleven and twelve, I saw James come out with this parcel in brown paper tied up under his arm—I was in plain clothes—I followed him to the prisoner Lee's, 89, Fore-street, Cripplegate, it is a tailor's and trimmer's shop—they sell woollen pieces and cloth—James went into the shop, placed the parcel on the counter, and Lee took it off and placed it behind the counter, on the ground, without its being opened—the counter concealed it when it was on the floor—no money passed between them—I should say Lee's shop is three miles from Oxford-street, James went along the back streets—when James came out of Lee's I went in and asked Lee where the parcel was that the man had left who had just gone out—he said, "What parcel?"—I walked to the end of the counter and said, "That is the parcel," pointing to this one—he said, "O, yes, a man did leave it this morning"—it was still unopened—I asked him what he gave for it—he said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if he had bought any money—he said, "No," he had not, and he did not know the man only by his coming in now and then—I told him 1 should search the place—he said, "O, I have bought a little more calico of him"—I searched the place, and found altogether six parcels, which I produce, containing altogether 285 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8 yards—some of the parcels were tied in brown paper, and some loose—Lee said he bought the whole of them</p>

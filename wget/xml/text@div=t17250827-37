               <p>Sam. Wilkinson thus deposed: About Ten at Night I met the Prisoner in <placeName id="t17250827-37-crimeloc152">Shoreditch</placeName>

She carry'd me to her Room; I went to Bed, and gave her a Shilling to fetch some Drink. I had 12 s. then left in my Tobacco-Box, which I put under my Pillow. She went out two or three times; there was no persuading her to come to Bed to me, and so I got up again about Two o'Clock in the Morning, and feeling for my Box, it was gone. I charged her with taking it, and sent for a Constable. She deny'd it at first, but afterwards own d that she had it, and that she gave part of it to a Soldier to stand by her. She offer'd me Half a Crown to make it up.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence: The Prosecutor desired me to help him to a Lodging: I brought him to my Landlady's; but she having no Bed to spare, he would go into mine. I desired him to get out; but he said there was Room enough for him and me too: Whereupon I left him, and went and sat at a Neighbour's House, in hopes he would be gone. And so finding that I would not do as he would have me, he got up and charged me with this Fact. <rs id="t17250827-37-verdict153" type="verdictDescription">

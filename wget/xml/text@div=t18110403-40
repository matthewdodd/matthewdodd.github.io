               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and tell me whether you know her person. - A. Yes, she came to me on the 19th of March, the day before the fast day, between twelve and one, she came by herself, she had no child with her, she asked me for a glass of gin, she offered to pay me by a sixpence, the glass of gin was twopence, I gave her four pennyworth of halfpence and took the sixpence. I put the sixpence in the front of the till where there was no other, and she went out. In five minutes afterwards there came in another woman, she asked for a glass of gin, I gave her the gin myself, she gave me a sixpence to pay for it, my husband stood at the left hand of me, I asked him to look at the sixpence, I had suspicion by their being two Irish women, and by my shewing it to my husband I concluded it was a bad one, I told my waiter to call her back, she came back with the four pennyworth of halfpence in her hand, it was not the prisoner, it was the second woman that was brought back that uttered the second sixpence, she said she had no more money in her pocket, she would go and ask her friend who was in the street, I immediately went out and saw the prisoner in the street, I told the prisoner that she had offered me a bad sixpence the other woman ran away, the prisoner refused coming back with me at first, afterwards she came back with me, and took out of her bosom a bag and put some sort of money out of her pocket into that bag, tied it up and kept in her left hand. We sent for an officer, Mr. Herman came, she was taken up stairs and searched, he searched all her pockets, she had four pockets round her, two at the front and one at each side, and in them was twopence or twopence halfpenny, and a bad sixpence, I laid that bad sixpence on the table and the prisoner took it up, we could not find it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards did you before the Lord Mayor deliver the sixpence that was uttered by the prisoner. - A. Yes, to the constable, he has it and the sixpence uttered by the second woman, I now produce, this is the sixpence.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 19th of March I went to the Black Boy, the prisoner was sitting in the tap-room, I took her up stairs and searched her as close as I could with decency, I found she had got four pockets on, in one of the pockets I found twopence halfpenny and a sixpence, I have had it ever since. The sixpence that I took out of her pocket I put on the table to Mrs. Burch, to know whether it was a good or a bad one, and before I took it up again it was gone, Mrs. Burch delivered to me the sixpence that the prisoner uttered before the Lord Mayor, I have had it in my possession ever since. I brought the prisoner down stairs, they began to look under the seat of the chair where she was sitting, they found this bag under that chair, the waiter gave it to his master, and his master gave it to me, I have had it ever since. The sixpence that Mrs. Burch took of the prisoner is wrapped up in that bit of paper, and Mrs. Burch has put a mark upon it.</p>

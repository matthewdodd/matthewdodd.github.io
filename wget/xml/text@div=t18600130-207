               <p>the letter, but it was too late—she came about half-past 7—5 o'clock is the latest hour at which a letter can be registered—I told her it was too late—she then gave me the letter that she had brought; it was open—she gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I placed it inside the letter, and then sealed the letter—I called Hartley to hold the taper for me whilst I sealed it—I sealed it with wax, and put R.O. my own initials on it, with my own seal—the prisoner stood by me while I did so—when I had sealed the letter I gave it back to Mr. Greggins—I told her to put it in at the red letters; that is the district box—before she left the shop I said to her, "You see that the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note is put in safe;" her reply was, "Yes,"—after she had gone out I told the prisoner that there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the letter—nothing else passed then with regard to it—the collection of letters at that office would be despatched at 9 o'clock—they would be taken from there to the West Central Office—I am not in the post-office—nobody is employed there from 7 till 9, when they make up the collection—if a person were to go into the place where the partition is he could have access to the letter-box; it was unlocked—there is a window to the street from the post-office—there are shutters put up at it—we commenced putting up the shutters on that evening at about twenty minutes to 9—they are put up on the outside, and fastened in the inside—Hartley and a boy named Sewell put them up—Hartley generally fastened them inside—after that, shortly before Christmas-day, an officer, whose name I don't know, called at Mr. Dawbarne's—a conversation passed between him and me relative to a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he wished for my name—I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and also the name of J. W. Hartley, at the officer's request also—he took away the piece of paper on which those two names were written—Grunson was in the post-office at that time—the officer went there first, and Grunson sent him over to me—after the officer was gone I told the prisoner that I had written his name down on a piece of paper, and also my own—I said that the officer had come about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that had been passed at a public-house in Vauxhall—the officer had told me that, and I told it to the prisoner—the prisoner said he hoped it was not the note he had passed at Vauxhall—he said that I ought to have called him, and asked him to write his own name—I had not known, before this, that he had passed a note at Vauxhall—he afterwards complained to Mr. Dawbarne about my having written his name down—I think that was on the next Sunday morning after the officer had come—it was before Christmas—I have seen the note which is produced—there is a signature, "J. W. Hartley," on it, in the prisoner's writing—on 14th January Mr. Dawbarne had some conversation with me about the note—I told him that the prisoner had passed a note at Vauxhall—on Wednesday, a few days after that, the prisoner went with me and some other persons from that house to the post-office.</p>

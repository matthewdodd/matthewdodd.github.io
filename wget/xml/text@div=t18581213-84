                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hird, an upholsterer, of 143, Tottenham-court-road. On 5th October the female prisoner came to our shop—she drove up in a four-wheeled pony-chaise—she said that she had taken a house, 24, Grosvenor-road, St. John's wood, and she wished some person to come there and look at the house, to see what furniture she required—she said that her name was Chesterfield—next day I went to look at the house to see what furniture Mrs. Chesterfield required—she said, "Now you see what rooms there are, you see what furniture is required?"—I said, "Yes,"—she then said, "What are your terms?" I said, "Cash"—she said it was not convenient to pay the whole of the money, but she would pay half of it down, and the other half on the 1st or 2d of November—she then told me her husband was a retired maltster, and she had an in<lb></lb>come of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I agreed to those terms, upon having a respectable reference—she said her husband had been a maltster at Wey<lb></lb>mouth—I then left the house—she came the following day to the shop</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130002"></xptr>
               <p>and selected goods; a mahogany couch, six chairs, a loo table, some carpeting, and a large chimney-glass—the value of the first goods we delivered was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; altogether they amounted to 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she gave me a reference to a Mr. Scott of 48, Alma-street, Hoxton—I went there the next day and saw the prisoner Elsom, who answered to the name of Scott—I said I had come respecting a reference of Mr. Chesterfield—he said he was a highly respect<lb></lb>able man, and a retired maltster from Weymouth, and Mrs. Chesterfield had an income of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—at that time Elsom had whiskers—I went back to Mr. Hird, and told him that the reference was satisfactory, and he said, "Send the goods;" and they were sent to 24, Grosvenor-road, St. John's-wood—I went there about a week after—I saw the prisoner Stacey—he opened the door to me—I asked if Mrs. Chesterfield was at home—he said, "No;" she had gone down to Mr. Hird's to select some mote goods; that his name was Chesterfield—I went back to the shop, and found Mrs. Chesterfield there, and I served her myself with the goods—the goods were supplied in two parts; that was the second part—I went again to Grosvenor-road on 2d November, and found that the goods were gone—I found no one in the house—I traced the goods from there to Lyndhurst villa, Lyndhurst-road, Peckham, and I saw Stacey and asked him for the goods—that was the first place I went to after I found the house shut up—Stacey came to the door to me, and he shut the door in my face—the following morning we went over to Lyndhurst-villa, and found the goods were gone from there—they were in the house the previous day; I did not see them there—we followed them to Dane-street, Islington, and I waited there all night—I did not see any one there—I saw Stacey come to the house in the morning, and as soon as he saw me he turned away, he did not go into the house—I went from there to the police-station in Old-street, and identified some goods that the female prisoner had been offering to pledge—on Saturday, 6th, Mr. Hird and I went to 7, Copenhagen-street, with a police-constable, and took the three prisoners into custody—Elsom and Stacey were in bed—I was induced to part with the goods through the reference.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of police at Weymouth—I am forty-two years of age, and have been an inhabitant of Weymouth all my life—I know no maltster there of the name of Chesterfield or Stacey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there many maltsters in Weymouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four; Mr. Debnish is one and Mr. Westburne another—Mr. Flowers has been a brewer and maltster; he is collector of rates now; he is not here.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MERCER</hi>. I am a plasterer of 8, Bousfield-terrace, Holloway—I knew the hosier's shop at No. 6—it was opened three months ago, and closed three weeks afterwards—a man named John Cartwright was the proprietor—I saw the prisoner Elsom there—he was known to me as William the shopman—I was not acquainted with his sirname—I saw him there the last week that the shop was open, and I saw him previous to that, as a visitor I supposed—I saw him once in the shop parlour—I have seen him there in the evening as well as in the daytime—I have seen Cartwright in custody.</p>

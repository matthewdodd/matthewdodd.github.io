On the 22d of October, this lead was securely padlocked and chained in my front court before my house. On the 23d, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the padlock lay on the wall, and missed about ten feet of lead; between nine and ten o'clock, Smith came to me - I went and found some of it at the watch-house, Waters said they had some more at the next watch-box - I went there, and saw a piece that exactly fitted that part of the sheet which was left on my premises.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 23d of October, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240060"></xptr>prisoner and another come out of a gateway leading to Mr. Pass's dye-house. I went towards them, and they walked away, I looked at the prisoner very minutely, he turned down Bateman's-row, and knowing the dye-house had been attempted to be robbed some nights previous, I went and found a piece of lead - I sprung my rattle, and called Stop thief! they had passed the watchman in Bateman's-row - I took the lead to the watch-house, they had left it at the dye-house - Underton's is five or six hundred yards off. In the morning Smith and I found him out.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Bateman's-row. About three o'clock, I saw two men run by me on the other side of the way, I pursued as soon as the watchman gave the alarm - I believe the prisoner to be one of them but cannot exactly swear to him; I found a piece of lead twenty yards off, in the way they had ran, against the back of the dye-house - I carried it to the watch-house.</p>

            . On the 23d of October, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, Manly brought a piece of lead to the watch-house, we went and found the owner, the other piece was laying at Hollywell watch-house; he claimed that also, we compared it with the other piece, and both matched exactly. He brought a piece which remained on his premises, and both corresponded.</p>

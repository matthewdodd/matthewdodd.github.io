                  </hi> I am overseer of the warehouse of William Clowes, and another, printers, at Charing-cross—Clissold was in their employment—after detecting him, I went on Friday Morning to the prisoner's, who is a marine-store dealer—I did not see him then, but I saw him on Saturday morning, and said I had come about paper which the boy had sold him, which was stolen—the boy was with me,—the prisoner said he had sold him no other paper than what was there (pointing to some dirty paper on the shelves)—I said I should communicate with the police—I had no further conversation with him—I had previously spoken to the boy's father.</p>

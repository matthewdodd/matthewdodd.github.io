                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Spearman. On 1st May I was at the Hanley Arms—the prisoner came in about 8 o'clock—I served him with half a pint of beer—he threw down a shilling; I gave him the change—he left, and I then found the shilling was bad—my mother went out after him, and brought him back, and a constable—the prisoner said he was not aware that it was bad, and if he was let go he would bring back the change; he said he had spent 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was part of the change—I let him go but he never came back—I gave the bad shilling to the constable.</p>

The prisoner wet given into my custody—I took him back to the Hanley Arms—he was charged with uttering a counterfeit shilling—he said he did sot know that it was bad, and if he was allowed to go he would fetch the change, and come hack in ten minutes—he was allowed to go; it was then a little after 8 o'clock—I received a communication from Mr. Spearman, and about a quarter to 11 o'clock I took the prisoner at the New Dover Castle, Westminster-road, which is about 500 or 600 yards from the Hanley Arms, for attempting to pass another bad shilling there, and another, a few minutes before that, at the Carlisle Arms—I took him to the station, and found on him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of halfpence; he said he had lost the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Spearman—I pointed out to Revel the spot where I took the prisoner the first time.</p>

The prisoner came there on 1st May, about a quarter to 8 o'clock—I served him with a pennyworth of gin—he tendered a shilling—I put it in the detector, and told him it was bad; he said, "I have only a sixpence, and if that is bad, you must give me credit"—he gave; it to me; it was good—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he left, taking the bent shilling with him—it was a George shilling, and, to the best of my belief, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

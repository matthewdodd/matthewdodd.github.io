I am a livery stable keeper at Highbury, Islington—my place goes by the name of "Wilson's Yard"—it is close to Highbury-place—on 10th June, the prisoner called there, and said he wished to hire a horse and chaise for a Mr. Lee, who was a wine merchant, and was going that day to the Jolly Butchers at Southgate, and he wished it to be sent to 70, Packington-street—I said we would get it ready, and send it down, and the ostler's young man took it there—I believe the prisoner did ask if he</p>

               <p>should take it himself, but we refused that—he was a stranger to us—he hired it for the day—it should have been returned that night—I saw the ostler start from the yard—I know Packington-street very well—I did not know anybody named Lee there—I afterwards found the chaise it Mr. Sawyer's, a livery stable keeper, at 71, Curtain Road—I received two letters—I do not know whose writing they are—I saw the prisoner next at Wandsworth police-station last Thursday week—the pony and chaise were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Wilson as ostler—on 10th June I took a pony and phaeton to 70, Packington-street—about 100 yards before I got to the door the prisoner got into the chaise—he said it was a very nice pony and trap—he drove himself from there to No. 70—when we got there, two other gentlemen came out of the door, jumped in, and drove off as fast as they could drive—I saw no more of the chaise and horse for some time.</p>

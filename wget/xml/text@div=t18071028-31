            . What do you know of this transaction. - A. If you will give me leave, I will relate the circumstance as it was at this time. I am a carpenter; I was sent to No. 2, Duchess-street, next door to Mr. Magarth's, on Friday the 16th of the present month; I was putting up a bed furniture; not being used to work in that end of the town, it caused my eye several times to see casual carriages; the window was up, and I was looking at the window. A few minutes before twelve, I perceived the prisoner at the bar standing on Mr. Magarth's steps, together with a tall man very much of my own make, a slim made character. The door was opened, and the tall one entered; after he had entered I proceeded on with my work for a minute and a half or two minutes, then I heard a bustle at the next door and a woman's voice, the words she said were - you villain, you have stole the glass; the tall man came out of the house and made off; then I looked the second time out of the window; I then perceived the top of a glass; I saw the men come from the step of the door; the prisoner made his way towards Duke-street with this present glass. I saw the prisoner receiving it, I could not see both their two arms; the other man went to the right, the prisoner went to the left, and

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that you saw receive the glass from the house. - A. Yes; the window was so situated I saw the step of the door, and he received it; had he been off the step of the door I should have seen who gave it him. I am sure he is the man, and this is the glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tilly-street Tenter-ground, Christchurch, Spitalfields. I occupy one room on the ground-floor—I have known the prisoner eight or nine months—on the evening of the 1st of May, about eight o'clock, she came into my room—she and I went away together—I locked the door, and took the key with me—I left the prisoner at the bottom of the street, which was not many yards—I returned home about half-past nine o'clock, found the panel of the door burst in, and the door open—the panel laid on the floor—I went to look for tome lucifers, which laid on a middling-sized mahogany box, and the box and all was gone—the property in the box belonged some to me and some to my son,—I gave information to the police, and saw my property next night in the hands of the policeman—ten sovereigns and four half-sovereigns are gone—they were in an old tin box, in the mahogany box—I have never seen them since—there was some silver in the same box, but that has been found—my son had given me the silver the Wednesday before.</p>

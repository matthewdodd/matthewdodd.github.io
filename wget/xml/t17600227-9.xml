            . On the 3d of February the prisoner was standing at a door, two doors from Hog-Lane: I was going by, and call'd hip, Moll, and she followed me to the corner of the street, where I put my hands up her petticoats, and her hands were in my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch at the time you called hip, Moll?</p>
               <p>Walley. I am sure I had. About three minutes after I missed it, and pursued her, but could not find her till the Saturday after, when, by searching many publick houses, I found her at the Two-Brewers in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you do to know her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176002270007"></xptr>Walley. By the light of the moon. I am very sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch after?</p>
               <p>Walley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Walley. It is worth five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Walley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Walley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Walley. No.</p>

            . I live at Tottenham-green. On the 25th of April, I was coming out of my garden, I saw a man come out with a basket, and hollowed to know what he wanted; he said I have been offering these things for sale, he had shavings - I was about thirty yards from him, and believe the prisoner to be the man. I missed two coats from the passage. I sent Dudley in pursuit of him.</p>

            . I went in pursuit of the man - I was on horseback. I went to the bottom of Bruce-grove, and saw a man with a basket; I rode up, and saw there was two of them - the prisoner was one; he had not got the basket. I said,</p>
               <p>"I believe you are the two men I am looking after;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Go on or I will smash you," and kicked at me - the other man put the basket down, turned the coats out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't say any thing." They walked away; I walked by their side, and saw Mercer, and told him; then the prisoner bobbed under the rails, and ran away; the other walked back - I ran after him, but my hollowing frightened the horse, and it ran away with me.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Tottenham. Dudley alarmed me, and said the two men had stolen two coats - the prisoner got under the rails, and ran off; I took him - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use saying you will have me, for you will not," and that he would walk no further. I saw somebody coming, he then got up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220033"></xptr>walked - I lead him to where I found two coats, and picked them up.</p>

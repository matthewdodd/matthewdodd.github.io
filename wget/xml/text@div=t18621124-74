                  <hi rend="italic">Hudson's Defence.</hi> I know no more about the robbery than a child unborn. I certainly was out this night, or the morning this robbery was committed, and I stayed at the Oak until half-past 2, when I left the house, and went down in the direction of the Pakenham; from there I made my <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> in this coffee-house, as this policeman says; I fell asleep, and he came in and woke me up. I went out, but I did not go home. I went to the Two Brewers' public-house; I went straight there from the coffee-shop, and I remained there for an hour or an hour and a half, and then went home to my lodging, and got home at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning. I never was in that man's shop that night later than 11 o'clock; staying in a public-house at night is not my occupation. I was in the shop with one or two working men, who bid me good night.</p>

On Sunday morning, between four and five o'clock, I saw him unlock the door of their vaults; he went down and came out with a pail of beer, and left it in the yard. I said nothing to him - he then opened the gate, and let in two watchmen, who went up to where the pail was; I went out, but could find no watchman - I found a patrol and took him in, and gave charge of all three - the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done, and he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Have not the men an allowance of beer? A. Yes; half a gallon a day or night - I give it out before I go away; another person had given him his that night; he has been there ten years, as a labourer - there is both porter and stout there; I cannot swear this was beer - when I came back, the pail was gone.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are stout and porter called beer? A. Yes; there was about a gallon and a half in the pail; I did not know he had the cellar key - he did not say it was his portion.</p>

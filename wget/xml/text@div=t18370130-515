                  </hi>. I am a porter of Newgate-market, and am employed by Mr. George Cowper. He bought two pigs, and employed me to take them to his house in Newport-market on Saturday morning between seven and eight o'clock; I put them into my cart, to be sent up to his house—I then returned to the market—I went to the cart again, and the pigs were there—that was about three minutes after I put them in—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 28, Rupert-street, Haymarket. I saw my brother's cart—the prisoner walked away from the tail-board with the pig on his shoulder—I called after him—he would not, or did not hear—I then went and asked him where he got that pig—he said some man gave it him to carry—I said I saw him take it from the cart, and told him to bring it back, which he did.</p>

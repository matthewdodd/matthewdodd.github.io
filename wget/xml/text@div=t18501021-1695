Dear Sir,—I received a letter last night regarding a situation in the country, and wishing me to forward my testimonials on receipt; I will there<lb></lb>fore feel much obliged to send me down the small desk, where all my papers are kept; the papers are in the upper part of it. I beg you will not dis<lb></lb>appoint me, as if I do not have them posted to-morrow morning it will be too late—it is something connected with the police. I wish I might be fortunate enough to get it. Mr. Young called last night about some letters. I solemnly declare that I have no letters or papers belonging to either you or he. I never read a letter of yours in my life, although you may suppose so. I trust you will send me these papers in the course of the day. Yours truly, P. Fraser." On receiving that letter I was about to send the desk by the porter, but I first examined it, to see whether he had any letters addressed to me, and found this pocket-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing nineteen pawnbroker's duplicates—there are five here now—I sent to one of the clerks and made a list of them, which I handed with the pocket-book to Mr. M'Gregor, on his coming to the City from the country—the desk was unlocked—the desk was locked when he left, and the next day I saw it picked by a locksmith, and it was partly examined by Mr. M'Gregor—it was then put into an enclosure under one of the counters in the inner warehouse—it was not locked—other persons could have access to it if so inclined—it was left there from the 4th to 26th—this is the desk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pocket-book was here in a secret part, a little out of sight—it is not a secret drawer—I cannot swear that it was there on the 4th—the papers in the pocket-book now, and some others, were in it when it was found—this letter, directed "Thomas M'Gregor, Esq.," was not; it was one that Mr. M'Gregor has received since—I cannot say whether this envelope, directed "Paul Fraser," was there—I do not recollect any in his own handwriting being there—I have never seen him use the pocket-book—my master does not sell ready-made coats, but be sells doeskins, and the prisoner had access to them—there is no mark on this piece of doeskin, but it is similar to what my master sometimes sold, and these two patterns were made in Yorkshire expressly to his order—the style of weaving is different from that of the other doeskins of the same sort—these we call crape doe<lb></lb>kins—the others are a little different—no other house deals in goods of this description—I swear it has been part of my master's property—I did not myself miss any property from the warehouse—I cannot speak to the coats.</p>

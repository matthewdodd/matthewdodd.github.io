               <p>—it was in Brook's Market that I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the men rifling his pockets—to get from there to Fox Court you go along Brook's Market into Brook Street, and Fox Court is leading from Brook Street; you do not turn round into Brook Street, it is a straight line—you have to turn a corner into Fox Court, to the right—I don't know what became of the other person, I kept my eye on the one—I only saw two men—I was the first policeman there—I did not see the prisoner's face until I caught him—I should say the prosecutor was not drunk—he was more excited than drunk—he was not sober—I should call him under the influence of drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the lodgers pay me—sometimes Mr. Welsh came and fetched the money himself from some of the lodgers, and some<lb></lb>times his son—I was not in the same room the whole evening, I was up and down the house—I did not go out—I don't know whether Mr. Welsh has got more than one house there—I was discharged on the Saturday that I got the summons, the Saturday after Boxing-night—I was once charged with stealing pots—I had taken a drop, and I took a pot by mistake, and</p>

               <p>it has been thrown in my face ever since—I had twenty-one days for it; it is about three years ago—Mr. Welsh's eldest son discharged me; he said I was not wanted any more; that is the son who is married, and is now in the place—my attention was called to this night the morning after Boxing-day; the prisoner came and asked me if there was anybody up for the money that night, and I said not—I collected from some of the lodgers that night—some only pay weekly—I collected from all that came in that night, and kept it in a basin till Mr. Welsh came up next morning—they pay 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I was not discharged for drunkenness; the son did not complain of my getting drunk—he said I was not wanted any more—I was discharged on the Saturday after Boxing-night, when I got the summons to come here.</p>

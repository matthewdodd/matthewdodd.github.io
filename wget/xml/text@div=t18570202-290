                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 48, Westbourne Park road. The prisoner Chandler lived with me as my wife down to 23rd Jan.—in the middle of Nov. I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in consequence of a note I had received from Mr. Meade, my landlord—I desired Chandler to pay that money to Mr. Meade for his rent when he called, as he said he would—I believe I saw the receipt on the evening afterwards—Chandler showed it to me—this is it—she handed it to me—she continued to remain with me till 23rd Jan.—on that day, about 8 o'clock in the morning, the landlord came to my house—I showed him this receipt, in presence of Chandler—he said it was not his handwriting, and Chandler said, "Mr. Mead, I know it is not your handwriting "—soon after that the landlord left my house, and something occurred which directed my attention to Pavis—I had seen Pavis once or twice—she lives about five minutes walk from my house—I knew she was acquainted with Chandler—I went to Pavis, and took this receipt with me—I asked her whether she had done any writing for Chandler in Nov. last—she said, "Yes"—I showed her the receipt, and asked her if she had written that—she said, "Yes, Mr. Fesdorf, and I am very sorry I have done so; I have done it with a trembling hand; I did not like to do it, but she persuaded me that she would soon get the money together again, and she would then get a proper receipt"—Chandler left me the same afternoon, about 4 o'clock—this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent me about 10 o'clock in the evening—it is Chandler's writing.</p>

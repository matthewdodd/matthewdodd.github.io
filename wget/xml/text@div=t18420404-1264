I met the prisoner with this beef in a bundle under his arm—I asked what he had there—he said "Some meat"—I said, "Why, you live with Mr. Housego"—he said, "Yes"—he then said if I would take no notice of it he would make me any recompense—I told him I was placed there to prevent such things, not to connive at them—he went on his knees, and said he hoped I would not take any notice of it, as his master would prosecute him with the utmost rigour of the law—I took him to the station—the inspector asked whit account he had to give of the meat—he said, "I stole it from my master, it is the first piece I have ever taken."</p>

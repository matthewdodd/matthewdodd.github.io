               <p>JAMES FLIGHT. I am a labourer, and live in Radnor-street, St. Luke's. I work for Mr. West, the superintendent of St. Luke's; the prisoner was employed to break stones in the yard - I had three hammers under my care, and missed one from the window-ledge, about twenty yards from where the prisoner was at work, on the 4th of August; I saw him leaving the yard in the evening, and called to him - he refused to come back; I asked what he had got wrapped up in his jacket - he said only a piece of wood, which was of on use to me; I went after him, and he was brought from a public-house - I saw the handle of the hammer projecting from his jacket; I took it from him, and found this hammer, which is the property of the overseers and guardians of St. Luke's - he afterwards said he merely meant to take it home to break up a piece of wood; but he had denied twenty times that he had any thing of the kind.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the stone yard. I left out two or three hammers, and I saw this taken from the prisoner's person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He said that I was a very old man, and he would get rid of me if he could; he has been saying how much he got of the parish since I have been in prison. Witness. It is not true.</p>

            . I am watchman in the employ of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170031"></xptr>Mr. Maidlow. On the 1st of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner with a bed of bricks about ten yards from the stack where they were left. I asked him where he got them; he said from Mr. Chard's stack in the grove. Mr. Chard lives about a mile and a half from there. I asked where he was going to take them? He said to Braid-street. I then told him I should go and see where he took them; he took them to Conduit-place, near Bayswater, where I found a bricklayer setting a copper; he had used some bricks but different ones to those. I asked the bricklayer who he was at work for, and he told me quite a different name to what the prisoner had said. I asked him where the labourer was to go for the bricks; he said to the wharf, and that he had the money given him to buy them. I then went to Mr. Chard, who knew nothing about the business. I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was setting a copper in Conduit-place. Baxter brought the prisoner to me, and asked who I was at work for; I told him Mr. Thorber. My master had given the prisoner money to go out for bricks, but I do not know where he got them from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to get half a hundred of bricks for my master, who had given me the money. I got them at the wharf. I then had to go out again for more, the wharf was shut, and as I thought Mr. Chard and my master were partners, I took them from his stack, and meant to return them the next morning. I did so last summer and told Mr. Chard of it. I did not take them from Mr. Maidlow's stack.</p>

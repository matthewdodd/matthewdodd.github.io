                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Ratcliffe. On the 6th of Sept. I was at home, alone—Morgan and Craven came to our house with nine pigeons—they asked if we wanted to buy them—I said my father would be at home about eight o'clock—they left these eight pigeons, and took one away, and I told them to come about eight—they came again about half-past nine, and I sent them to Lucas-street, where my father was at work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Parnham-place, Ratcliffe. On Wednesday morning, the 6th of Sept., I was at work at a house in Lucas-street, near my own house—Craven and Morgan came to me—Morgan came up the ladder, and said, "Will you buy those pigeons?"—I said, "Yes, what do you ask for them?"—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were eight of them—I asked where they lived, and whose they were—Morgan said they belonged to his brother, in Bethnal-green—I went with them to my own house, and said I would go and see where they lived—I noticed a mark on the third feather of the wing of the pigeons—I said they should neither have the pigeons nor the money unless they could tell me the mark—they could not, and went away—I gave information, and they were taken—these are the eight pigeons.</p>

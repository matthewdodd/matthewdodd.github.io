I got a half crown from her on 31st May, about 10 minutes before 2 o'clock, and a crown about 4, or 10 minutes before 4—I went round to the prisoner, and said, "You are the person that was here this morning for a quartern of gin"—he said, "No, sir"—I said, "Yes, you are"—he said, "I will go and get a good shilling to pay for the rum"—I said, "No, you will go to the station with me"—he went a short distance, and then turned round and ran away—we had a long chase after him—the postman stopped him—I kept the crown and the half crown till the prisoner was committed, and I gave them to the officer—the prisoner said his master gave him the crown—I said he could send for his master to the station.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Howell. On Sunday the 15th of October, I had been in the room up one pair of stairs about four in the afternoon; the sashes were all close shut down then. About eight o'clock the ladies who lodged in the room came home; they could not get in; the door was fastened on the inside; they called to the servant, and the servant found two chairs laid back to back to the door to keep it shut: the servant pushed the door open; I went up with the ladies; we went into the room, and missed a counterpane off the bed in the next room to the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Whose counterpane was that? - My master's.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I found the counterpane in the garret in the prisoner's house on the 26th in the morning, hanging on a line.</p>
               <p>Did Bagnall say any thing about it? - He said it was his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether, when Noon was tried, you said I owned the counterpane to be mine? - The judge did not go on with the evidence, but ordered the man to be acquitted, and tried on the other indictment.</p>
               <p>(The counterpane was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the counterpane.</p>
               <p>To Bull. Do you know that counterpane? - Yes; there are marks of ink on the corner: it is Mr. Howell's counterpane; the same that was lost off the bed the 15th of October; there is a mark across it, made by its hanging on a dirty line, which I know it by.</p>
               <p>Did you find the windows open, when you went in at eight o'clock? - One window was quite up as high as it could be.</p>

At 3 o'clock in the morning of 23d October, I was on duty in East-street, Walworth—I saw the prisoner come from Wood's-buildings, out of Alfred-place, Old Kent-road, about 200 yards from the prosecutrix's house—he had a woman's dress on his arm—when he saw me coming he dropped it in the road, went on the other side of the road, and ran away—I pursued and took him, and asked where he had taken the woman's dress from—he said he never saw it and never had it in his possession—I am sure he is the person that dropped it—there was no one else about—he was wearing this coat at the time.</p>

I keep the house, 5, Alfred-place, Old Kent-road—on the night of 22d October my parlour-window was down, and the shutters pulled to—I went to bed about 12 o'clock—everything was then safe—next morning I found the shutters open, the window up, and the Venetian blind pulled down—I missed a black shawl, a coat, a jacket, aud other things—this is the coat—the other property has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor of 62, King's-cross-road, and have a shop at No. 4—on 16th February I locked up all the doors, and left for the night—about half-past 3 next morning, I was sent for, and found the shop in great confusion—eight umbrellas had been taken from the window, and laid on the counter for removal—this coat was taken out of the window, and another was lying on the floor—they are mine—the shop and gas-pipes were damaged, and the fan light over the door broken, which I had locked before leaving.</p>

I am an apprentice to the last witness—I sleep in the back shop—I heard a noise in the passage, but waited till the person got to the door of the back shop, thinking it was one of the men—I said, "Is that you, Charley?"—he did not answer—I said, "Is that you, Charley?" he said, "Yes"—it did not sound like the workman's voice, and I went out and found the prisoner in custody.</p>

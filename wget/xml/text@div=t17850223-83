               <p>How happened it that you coming from the country should count these cards of lace? - I have lost so much goods lately out of my shop, that I always desired my wife and shop-woman to count them; I returned about six.</p>
               <p>Had you any customers or any body that gave you occasion to count the lace? - No, but I am sure I counted it; I saw the prisoner's silk handkerchief in the window, and her hand was upon it, the prisoner stood against the window, and the lace was on the counter; then the prisoner wished me a good night and went away; then the handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Did that handkerchief cover any thing? - I cannot tell whether it lay over any lace or not; the prisoner went out of the shop, and I immediately missed this card of lace, the card is marked with my shop mark at one corner, U. N. fourteen yard and a half; I sold ten yards and a half off that very piece and laid it in the window; I immediately followed her out, and clapped my hands on her, and she had it in her pocket, lapped up in this silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Was that the same handkerchief you saw in the window? - It was the same handkerchief, it was plain, it had no marks at all upon it; that was the same handkerchief I saw in the shop, as far as I can judge; I immediately laid hold of the lace and the handkerchief, and she said she did not know that she had it, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Was the lace rough or smooth? - It was in this form putting it in her pocket, and she had a large cloak on; it was upon the card that it is now, I have measured it since, it is the same piece.</p>
               <p>What is the value of it? - It is valued at a great deal less than I gave for it; I have put it at six shillings and three-pence less than it cost me; the constable came and took her away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. How long had you been in the country before you came home? - I went on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>When did this happen? - On the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you take an accurate account of all your stock when you went out of town on the Wednesday? - The lace and ribbands I did, because I lose so much.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in town before this accident happened? - I had not been at home half an hour.</p>
               <p>Is your stock pretty extensive? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>You were of course very suspicious? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any partners? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230131"></xptr>No person interested in the business but yourself? - None but my wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Has your wife any part of the profits of that business settled on her by deed? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this lace of any particular pattern? - I never had the pattern before.</p>
               <p>It is not uncommon, I suppose? - Other people may have it.</p>
               <p>Did you count it instantly as you came in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did she stand? - Close by the window.</p>
               <p>What length of time was she in the shop? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Then of course she, as any other person might, perfectly inoffensively, lean against your counter? - Not inoffensively, a person could not inoffensively take away a card of lace.</p>
               <p>Whether in the course of her wiping her face with her handkerchief, the handkerchief might not drop from her hand to that lace? - No.</p>
               <p>When you saw it there, where you say it could not be without design, why did not you immediately communicate your suspicions to her? - I did immediately after I lost the lace; the handkerchief might be the length of this book from the lace.</p>
               <p>Was it in such a position that it might naturally fall from the hand of that woman? - I cannot answer that question.</p>
               <p>Was that handkerchief in such a position as it might without design fall from the hand of that woman? - She must, by having that card of lace afterwards, do it with a design to take it away.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, whether as it appeared in that position, why you did not immediately lay hold of her, and prevent her carrying it out of the shop? - I had no suspicion of her taking the lace away, I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Was this lace so doubled up in the handkerchief as indicated any design in her to take it; were there any folds in the handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Had she not time enough to sold it up afterwards? - I followed her out immediately; I marked it myself.</p>

               <p>I attend the Rotation office in Litchfield-street, on the 5th of February, between seven and eight, I do not speak with certainty to the time, it was on Saturday, I was going through Lombard-street, Seven Dials, when I came to the corner of the street, I observed a great crowd, I came up directly and saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner, I am sure it was her; I asked what was the matter? I pushed through the crowd, and laid hold of the prosecutor and the prisoner; and the prosecutor told me in the presence of the prisoner, that she had robbed his shop; I desired him to let her go; which he did, and I took charge of her; the property was taken from her before I came up; the prosecutor had a card of lace in his hand when I came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else in the hand where he had the card of lace? - Not that I observed, I suppose there were fifty people at least; the prisoner offered me ten guineas to let her go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Whose office do you attend? - The office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Have you not been discharged from that office? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, I will, I lost the use of my limbs, and since that I have been at my own house in the country.</p>
               <p>What charge did the prosecutor give you of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>She was very obstropulous, he charged her with robbing him.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had seen her rob him? - He said he did not see her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I never touched it to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

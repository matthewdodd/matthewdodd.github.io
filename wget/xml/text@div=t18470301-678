                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker. About seven o'clock in the evening, on the 8th of Feb., I saw both the prisoners at my shop, in North-street, Chelsea—Clark offered me these four rolls of oak-grained paper for sale, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him I did not want them—he gave me no satisfac<lb></lb>tory account of them, and I had suspicion they were stolen, and would not buy them—he left my shop, and went down the street—I saw Spearing join him at the end of my window—I followed them both, and never left them till I gave them into custody—Spearing said to Clark, at the bottom of Lower North-street, "Go into the first shop, and get what you can for the paper"—Clark did not answer him—he went into a baker's shop—he came out again, and went on to Mr. Norman's shop—he then had two rolls of paper in his hand—I said to him, "Where are the other two rolls of paper, you had four when you came to me?"—he threw the paper down, and ran down the street—the constable pursued, and took him—spearing ran away, and another officer captured him.</p>

I was going along the New-road, Chelsea—I met Mr. Bowdler and the two prisoners—Mr. Bowdler told me in the prisoner's hearing that Clark had been offering him some paper for sale, and he had had this watched them into two other shops after they left his place—clark threw this paper down at my feet, and ran in one direction, and spearing in another—I pur<lb></lb>sued Clark—he was stopped by another person, and I came up and took him—I had not lost sight of him, from the time he started till I caught him—in going to the station he said the paper was given him by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Turner's clerk.</p>

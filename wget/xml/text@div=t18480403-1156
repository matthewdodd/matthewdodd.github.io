                  </hi> I am a hairdresser, at High-street, Deptford. On 1st March I went with an officer to the prisoner's house—I charged her with receiving goods from a person in my employ—she said we were welcome to search her place—I searched, and found a pair of combs, part of another pair, a bottle, a pot of castle oil, and pomatum—I believe them to be mine—I missed the combs a few days previously—I had not missed the other things.</p>

                  </hi> I was in Mr. Temple's service—I took these articles from my master's shop and gave to the prisoner—I told her I had got some things she had told me to get—she said she was very glad of them, (she had told me to get them), she was very much obliged to me, but I might as well have got the best combs out of the window—I said, I knew my master knew what he bad got in the window, and I could not get them.</p>

            . On the 27th of July I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Charles Bigsby, who gave his address at the Hummums. I have called there, but cannot see him - he was coming out of the <placeName id="t18270913-382-crimeloc2114">English Opera House</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 59, Tottemham-court-road. I am a porter, and work for any body - I was not in employ at the time- I had been in the gallery of the theatre - it happened in the Strand, near Southampton-street - the gentleman had a female with him - Roberts was present; he went and brought the gentleman to the watch-house - the Magistrate did not take Robert's evidence down - he said the gentleman had been there; we had some difficulty in getting the gentleman to go to the watch-house - several persons persuaded him not to appear; the gentleman said he could not say whether he had dropped it or not. I cannot find the gentleman - I have had another case here; I am not an officer - I was once accused of having a lamp in my possession - I was never charged with perjury.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you saw this man take the handkerchief? A. Yes - he threw it over his shoulders.</p>

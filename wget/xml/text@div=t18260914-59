            . My husband is a constable - we live near Edgware-road. On the 11th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prosecutrix - the prisoner was walking with her; I heard the prisoner say,"You are a young woman from the country, and have been taking a glass;" the prosecutrix said, "No, it is trouble;" they walked on together, and the prisoner said,"Mary, you shall go home and sleep with me;" I noticed that, as she had before said she was a stranger; I looked round at the prisoner, and said, "If you know where the poor woman lives you had better see her home;" she said"I know very well - she lives at a bad house in Molineux-street, and I have got a bad husband and two children" - I took no notice, but followed them to the Coach and Horses public-house - they walked together for half an hour, but walked very slow - they made a stop there, and the prisoner said, "Mary, have you got any money in your pocket?" she said Yes; "Then," said she, "you must give me 3d. to get a glass" - the prosecutrix put her hand into her pocket, under her shawl, to take 3d.; the prisoner then put her arms round her neck, unpinned her shawl, and took it off; the prosecutrix said, "Give me my shawl;" she said, "I have got no shawl;" I said,"You have;" she said, "I have got none at all;" I turned to a woman, and said, "She has robbed this woman of her shawl" - the prisoner called Jack, and ran away with it; they were both strangers to me. I met the prosecutrix three months after, and asked if she was not the person who was robbed; I said I saw the woman who took it almost every day. I had frequently seen her after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give her in charge? A. I did not know where the prosecutrix lived. I told my husband of it - he took her after I found the prosecutrix out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not cry Stop thief! at the time? A. There were a number of persons round, and I had a child in my arms. The prosecutrix said her shawl was gone, and ran away.</p>

I had the money in my pocket when I went out, but put it into my shawl in the street, thinking it would be safer, as I was going through St. Giles's; Mrs. Betty says she was two or three yards from me, but I did not know her; I might be a quarter of an hour in the prisoner's company - we only walked ten yards; she was talking to me, but I could not tell all she said.</p>

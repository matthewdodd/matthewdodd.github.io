               <p>On the 21st of March, between eleven and twelve, this man and Soliman was brought to my charge, and I took them in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Do not you know Soliman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he work for you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I had been at work at Black-wall, and I overtook Soliman coming with these things in a bag, he asked me if I was going to London, I said, I was, he asked me to help him, he took the sheave out of the bag, and carried it himself, and I carried the chain.</p>
               <p>Court. How came Soliman to escape.</p>
               <p>Abroll. Our watch-house is very small, and has no conveniency, and the prisoner desired to go and ease himself, I sent the watchman with him, and he returned; Soliman also asked the same favour, I thought it natural, as this man returned the other would, but he run away from the watchman.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

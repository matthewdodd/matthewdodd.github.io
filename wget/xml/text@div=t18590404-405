                  </hi>. I live in Doby-court—on the night of 26th February the prisoner came to my house to see his wife—she had not been lodging with me, she was only stopping there—she came to assist me when my sister died—he and his wife began aggravating one another—she abused him frightfully about his clothes and his work—they went on in that way for some time—we got him away at last—he went out, and returned in about three quarters of an hour—they began at it worse than ever—his wife was the worst of the two to tell the truth; she was calling him all sorts of names, and abusing him frightfully as she sat on the side of the bed; she grasped me round, and held me—the prisoner took up the poker and was trying to make a blow at her, but he hit the bedstead two or three times, and took pieces out of it—he then hit her with the poker on the head, and she fell back—I loosened myself from her, and called Mr. and Mrs. Lati<lb></lb>mer from upstairs.</p>

I was not present when the prisoner and his wife commenced quarrelling—when I went in he was not there—he came in about two minutes—his wife told me to wait there as long as I could because he would not hit her while I was there—he sat down on a chair by the side of the bed—she was standing against the fire—he began talking to her, and she began aggravating him—I tried to please them all I could—he told her he was ashamed to go to his work because she had scratched his face—she said she was ashamed of him for blacking her eye—I went up stairs and went to bed; after a short time I heard a great noise and screaming—Mrs. Cook called my husband down—he went down, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital—the prisoner's wife was brought there about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 27th—she had a cut on the scalp about an inch long, which lay bare the bone, and she had one bone broken in each fore arm, besides several minor cuts and bruises in different parts of the body—a poker might produce such wounds—I cannot say that the wound on the head was produced by the poker—the prisoner said it was caused by the bedstead—I have seen similar wounds produced either by a bedstead or a poker—a poker would produce it—she remained in the hospital nearly three weeks—the wounds were not at all dangerous—it was a clean cut—I was not in the least anxious about her at any time—the adjoining parts were not bruised—a clean cut to the bone without the bruising of the adjoining parts would be rather more likely to be done by the sharp edge of furniture than by a poker—it might have been done by the edge of the square part of the poker—the edge of the wound was quite healthy—this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has not a very sharp angle to it, but I have</p>

On the 18th of September last, on returning home between eleven and twelve o'clock, from information I went up stairs, I missed my two regimental jackets. The prisoner lodged in my house in a back room, and the room adjoining his, had been broken, the staple of the padlock was drawn. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, I found him within an hour and a half; when I took him home, he gave me this duplicate of a blue jacket; he said he had sold the red jacket for one shilling, to a man at Blackwall. The officer took the wings of my jacket from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this man. - A. He is a seafaring man; I received four pound of him, and I have a receipt that I paid it him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I ask you whether there were any other lodger in the house. - A. I had none other.</p>

On the night of the 11th of Oct., the prisoner came to the bar and asked if he could have a bed—I showed him to his room, and turned down the bed for him—there was a pair of sheets and a pillow-case on the bed—on the following morning, a little after nine, I was on the stairs when he came out of the room, and asked him to remember the chambermaid—he said he was going to return at night, and would want his bed—he wen out—I went to his room immediately, and missed the sheets—no oneoccu<lb></lb>pied that room but him—he came directly from his room, went to the bar, and asked if he could have breakfast—he said he was going down to the stables, and would return in a few minutes—he never came back.</p>

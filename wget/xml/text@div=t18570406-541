Bevington's premises; that is not a quarter of a mile from Mr. Waring's—it would take about ten minutes to go, hardly that—Tobin went with me—he saw them unloaded, and then he went into the counting house—I did not see whether they were weighed or not—they were carried into a shed—I did not go into the counting house—when I came out, I saw Vernon waiting outside—Tobin paid me for the cart, and then joined Vernon—my cart had my name and address on it, "Thomas Merryman No. 14, Spa Road."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hide and skin merchant at Bermondsey. I have had many dealings with Messrs. Bevington and Proctor, perhaps to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Tobin was in my service from Oct., and was discharged in Jan.—on 30th Jan., I missed property of this sort from my shed, and in consequence, I employed persons to watch the pre<lb></lb>mises, which led to the discovery on Saturday the 31st, and to the taking of the other four prisoners into custody—on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, I went with Inspector Mackintosh to Mr. Bevington's pre<lb></lb>mises—I saw the foreman, and he went for Mr. Bevington, I also saw Proctor—I addressed Mr. Bevington, and told him that I understood he had been receiving a quantity of hide pieces which had been stolen from my premises—he said, "Indeed"—I said, "Yes, it is a very serious affair; I should like you to show me the vouchers you received, and also to tell me the price you gave for them"—he said, "There was no note came with them, "he looked on a file and showed me two papers—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one is made out by Mr. Bevington, and the other by Mr. Neale, the traveller—I know Mr. Bevington's writing, I think I could swear to the writing—he said, "That is what we have given for them" (<hi rend="italic">Read: "28th Jan., 1857.

               <p>traveller at 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if you throw open your gates and receive goods in this way, no tradesman is safe in the hands of his servants"—no reply was made to that—then I said, "I should like to see the goods," and I said, "This is inspector Mackintosh, he must take possession of them"—he was present during the whole conversation, he was in his police dress—Mr. Bevington said, "If you will give me the money back that I have given for them"—I said, "No, not a farthing, the goods are my property, and Mackintosh will take possession of them"—as we were walking over to the warehouse, I said, "We had better have them weighed"—Mr. Bevington said, he thought there was no occasion to weigh them, as they were loose, and it was a cold morning—I acceded and said, "Well, we will load them without," but on going into the warehouse, and looking at the bulk, I said I thought it would be best for all parties that they should be weighed—they were weighed, and they weighed 8 cwt., 1 qr., 25 lbs.—I said to Mr. Bevington, it was very extraordinary that there should be such a discrepancy in what they weighed out, and what they had got in the invoices, what they had paid for—Mr. Bevington and Mr. Proctor were present a portion of the time of the weigh<lb></lb>ing; the foreman was there and took the weights down—I addressed the foreman, when I spoke of the discrepancy, and his reply was, "I weighed them all, and sent the account in, and if it is not there, it is not my fault"—we then went into the counting house, and I again expressed my wonder that there should be such a difference, and said they must try and endeavour to find the other vouchers, which they did, but could not succeed in finding anything beyond what they showed me first—I said it was a very funny way of doing things—the foreman brought in the weighing book, and turned and found an entry (<hi rend="italic">looking at the weighing book</hi>) this is the entry, it is on 23rd, "Tobin, 1. 3. 17."—I said, "That does not make up what we weighed with your man"—they referred again, and I think they found another entry of another cwt.—I do not think I saw that entry myself—the foreman turned to the book in my presence—I might have looked over the book, but whether I saw this or not, I should not like to say—it was said in my presence that on such a day, there was such a quantity—I find an entry of 1 cwt. on 27th Jan. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all these together amount to within a few pounds of what was weighed—there are four entries, one on 23rd, one on 27th, one on 28th, and one on 30th, all in the name of Tobin—I do not know the handwriting—we took the goods away to the police station—three or four days after<lb></lb>wards, I went again to Mr. Bevington's, I do not remember the day—I saw both Mr. Bevington and Mr. Proctor—I asked them if they had found any further vouchers, they said no, they had not—I said "Well, it is a strange way of doing business, taking in goods not knowing where they come from, without any vouchers—I asked who fixed the price—I understood Mr. Proctor to reply that Mr. Bevington fixed the price, and that he (Proctor) paid the cash—the price is mentioned in the invoice as 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., there is no price in the weighing book, merely the weight—(<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">produced the cash book and ledger, which</hi>

"—that, calculated according to the weight, would be 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—this is the ledger—there is an account here with Tobin, sen., that account closes on 26th April, 1856</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the fair market price of these goods at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It varied from 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>:—there was a middling quality that I could have sold at 73<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but these goods were worth 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is a fair sample here—they are not used for making common glue—they are used for making a</p>

               <p>superior size—some call them glue pieces, and some hide pieces—they are perfectly distinct from the pieces used for common glue; they go by the same name—the difference in quality is to be seen at once by persons con<lb></lb>versant with the trade—the size is used by paper makers—papers cannot be made without it—the paper makers buy the raw material, and make it themselves—seven-eighths of them make their own size—Messrs. Bevington are dealers in skins as well as glue manufacturers—they buy these things to sell again in this state.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGKR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to the premises of Messrs. Bevington and Proctor, on Saturday, 31st Jan.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not—oh yes, I went with the inspector and two detectives, and found the premises closed—it was the day of the funeral of Mr. Proctor's father, and when I found what it was, I desisted from going further that day—I think I saw Mr. Bevington, jun. on that day at the private house—we went to the private house—I think I told him for what purpose I had come, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there were any glue pieces which had been stolen from my premises—the glue pieces that were taken away by the inspector on the Monday were in a shed nearly facing the office, close to a press, for the purpose of being baled up—it is a regular shed with gates—the gates were shut when we went down on the Monday—the shed gates were closed—that is my impression—we went to another part of the yard when we first went in, but the foreman was gone for Mr. Bevington, and when we came back I certainly think the gates were closed—I should not like to swear that they were—I really can<lb></lb>not charge my memory whether there are any gates to the shed or not—there were gates, I think, certainly—it was after the 2nd Feb. that I re<lb></lb>ceived these papers—I asked Mr. Bevington to lend them to me, which he did—may I be permitted to state that I have no vindictive feeling in any way towards Messrs. Bevington and Proctor—I have known Mr. Be<lb></lb>vington I should think these twenty years—he is at present churchwarden of the parish, and a trustee of the Free Grammar School at Bermondsey—during the whole time I have known him, his character has been the most straightforward of any in the trade—I have dealt with him for many years, and never had the slightest dispute in any way.</p>

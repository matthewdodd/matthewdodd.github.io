On the 17th of May, the prisoner came to the shop and looked at a quantity of ribbons - after giving me a great deal of trouble he asked about the price, and said he wanted to ship them - when we had arranged about the price he drew my attention to the counter several different times, and his fingers were about the ribbons, and they were removed - in one instance he desired to see some goods from the window - I got them, and noticed that the ribbons were removed more than usual - I looked at him, and saw one of his pockets was a little larger than it had been before - I then said, "Before we go any further we will settle for these" - he said, "No, no, go on" - I said, "We will make an invoice of these" - I set down the lengths of the ribbon - he several times wanted to call off my attention, but I said, "No, stay where you are"- when I had made out the invoice, I said, "Now I want the money" - he said, "I shall return in my horse and chaise, and pay you, and buy some more" - he was then going out - I got between him and the door, and said, "I want to see what you have got in your pocket" - he said, "Good God! what do you think I have got?" - I sent for the officer, and as the officer was coming in, the prisoner pulled these ribbons from his pocket - they are not in the invoice at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known him before? A. No - he was a stranger to me - he had never dealt at my shop to my knowledge - these ribbons cost me rather more than 2l. - they are new ribbons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have bought of him three different times - I bought 90l. worth in Holborn, and once in the Borough, and in the Dover-road.</p>

            . I live in Middlesex-street, Whitechapel - I have known the prisoner thirty years - he has been a tradesman, but met with reverses - he now deals in jobs - I was with him when he was thrown from a chaise, eighteen months ago - he has been very little able to attend to business since that - I was with him thirteen years, and was compelled to leave him on that account - Mr. Brown knew him well - he bought 98l. worth of goods at one time of him - he then lived in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge - I remember the dealing for 98l., but that was with the witness Hart - we deal with many customers for ready money, and do not know them.(

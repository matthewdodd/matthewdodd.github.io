               <p>CHARLES MARSH PIGRAM. I am now out of a situation, but at the time in question I was <rs id="t18270712-48-viclabel276" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

On the 10th of June, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going home - I then slept at Mr. Atkinson's; as I went along <placeName id="t18270712-48-crimeloc277">Whitecross-street</placeName>

I had not seen the prisoner before - I had not walked with her in Beech-street, nor had I been in Beech-street that night - it is at the end of Whitecross-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120029"></xptr>street. I ran home as fast as I could, and told my master of it directly the door was opened; it is dangerous to run down an alley after thieves, or I should have pursued her. I saw Harrison next morning, and described her to him; she is a remarkable looking woman - her face came quite close to mine; I could see her plainly, and am certain of her; Harrison apprehended her about two hours after I gave him notice; it was a silver watch, with a ribbon and gold key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you deny walking with me in Beech-street, and going into Golden-lane, giving me 4d., and asking if that would satisfy me - I left you, and you had white trousers on? A. It is all false - I had not been in Beech-street, and have not got a pair of white trousers.</p>

            . I am an officer, and have been so two years. The prosecutor described the prisoner to me at half-past six o'clock on Monday morning - I immediately knew her, and where she lived; I went to her lodgings between seven and eight o'clock that morning - she got out of bed to open the door to me; she had been in bed with two men and her sister; she said she knew nothing about it - I said, "If you are not the woman I shall not detain you long;" the prosecutor saw her, and identified her immediately; she was only in her shift when she opened the door. I saw the prisoner make her mark to this statement (looking at the depositions) - here is the Magistrate's signature to it- (read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in her Defence, says, when I met that gentleman in Beech-street we went up Golden-lane, and in Sun-alley the prosecutor pulled out 4d.; I asked him what it was for; he asked if it would not satisfy me; I told him No, I would go and get something to drink with it: he gave me the 4d., and we parted; I went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was told I was not to be prosecuted.</p>

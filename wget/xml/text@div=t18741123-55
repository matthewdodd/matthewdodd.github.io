"has been made "under 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" an additional "0" has been added to the money—the remainder is in my own handwriting—I was sent for to the London and Westminster Bank about 3.15 the next day—I saw the prisoner there—I said the cheque was a forgery, and sent for a constable—the prisoner was taken off to the police-station at once—at the police-station he gave a rambling account that he had got the cheque. from an old man who was drunk—he said he left the old man in a public-house in Lambeth Walk, and that he could neither read nor write.</p>

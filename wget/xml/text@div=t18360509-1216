I was sent for—I went to No.6, Smith-place—they shewed me these plats, and told me a young man had left them, and was to call again—I concealed myself behind the door for nearly half an hour—the prisoner then came in—I shut the door to, and took the plates, and asked if they were his—he said yes, he had bought them in Bartholomew-lane, at the Auction Mart—I showed him his direction, and asked if it was his writing—he said, "Yes"—I said "Yes gave a false address"—I took him to the office, and then received information, and found Mr. Rhodes.</p>

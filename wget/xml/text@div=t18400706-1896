                  </hi>. I am a builder. About midnight, on the 21st of June, I was at Greenwich—I had been to Woolwich, and came with two friends to go by the railroad—two girls accosted us—they left us, and pro<lb></lb>ceeded to Greenwich, and we to London—in about a quarter of an hour a man asked me the time, and then I found I had lost my watch—I could not say that either of the prisoners were the girls, but I went across the road with some friends, and some women stood talking with me for some time.</p>

               <p>watch, seal, and ring I received from the prisoner Smith on Monday, the 22nd of June—she asked me to lend her as much as I could—I told her to name some price—she named a sovereign—I suspected that they were stolen, and requested to know whose they were—she said her brother's—I referred to our book, and found a description of the watch—I then asked her into a room, and she said that Barnett gave it to her—I detained her, and sent for Barnett, and asked if she had sent Smith—she said she had—Smith gave me every information to find Barnett.</p>

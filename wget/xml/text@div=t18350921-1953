                  </hi>. I am an earthenware-dealer, in Cornhil. The pri<lb></lb>soner came into my employ early in August as a town—traveller—It was part of his employment to receive money and acoount to me for it—he had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on Saturday, the 15th of August, I left town, and left him in charge of the business—I returned on the following Wednesday—he was not there—I did not see him till the 24th. when he was in custody—he kept a book, in which he made entries—I produce it—articles sold in the shop should be entered here—there is an entry of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Joyce—the other was received from Wildman, one of my boys, who sold the article, and banded the money over to the prisoner—the boy has entered that—I saw Wildman enter it myself—I said, "Why is it not put down?"—he put it down—the prisoner has entered the sums forward in the book, omitting three or four blank pages—the book would inform me that the prisoner had sold these articles, but it did not state the sale by Wildman—the other two are entered by the prisoner—I could not call his attention to it, as he had absconded.</p>

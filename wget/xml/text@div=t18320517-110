            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 2nd of May, I saw the two prisoners near <placeName id="t18320517-110-crimeloc651">London-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170070"></xptr>bridge</placeName>

               <p>Homer. I bought it - it is a jacket, not a coat. Witness. I had seen them not ten minutes before I took them, and I know they had not time to buy it of any body.</p>
               <p>Welch. I said he told me he had bought it, but I did not see him, Witness. Welch said Homer bought it on the other side of the bridge for 1s. 4d. - it was dirty weather, but the coat was clean.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MORTIMER. This is my coat, and handkerchief that was in the coat pocket - I cannot say when it was taken; I had unloaded in Bishopsgate-street, and just as I got on the bridge I know my coat was safe - I did not miss it till I got home.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHAMBERS. I am an officer. I saw the prisoners about ten minutes before Parish had hold of them; they were at the top of Fish-street-hill, going towards the bridge - I went with Parish and took Welch; he said Homer gave 1s. 4d. for the coat, to a man in the street, over the bridge.</p>

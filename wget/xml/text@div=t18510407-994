On 20th Dec, 1849, I checked the goods on the way-bill—it is not here, but I checked it with the goods in the truck No. 588—I suppose the train arrived between three and five o'clock in the morning of 20th Dec, 1849—I found, on checking that way-bill, that there were two trusses missing; one was for Taylor, of Staining, and another for Turner—that was the way-bill that came down with the guard—I checked it about eight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 38). On Friday, 14th Feb., I went to No. 25, Albert-street, Deptford; I saw there Enoch Pearson, Barrett, and Mary Ann Barrett—I told Enoch that his brother was in custody on a charge of stealing some books, and I understood he had been stopping there, and I must search his house—he said his brother had brought no books there, or any thing else—I searched the house, and found this unhemmed handkerchief in a clothes-box of his up-stairs, amongst some clothes which he claimed—I asked him where he got it; he said it was his own, and he bought it himself, and it had nothing to do with any<lb></lb>body</p>

               <p>pieces of linen rough-washed, and other things—I told her it was all stolen—she said, "If it is, I don't know anything about it"—I found nine pieces of muslin—I told her they were all stolen property—she said, if they were, she knew nothing about it; Mrs. Barrett brought them to her to take care of, so that they might not be found in their house if it were searched—I came down-stairs with her again, and she said she was very sorry for what she had done, and she had not told me the truth when I first came to her—I asked her where her husband was—she said he was gone to London—she made communication to Mr. Hacton, and they went into the back-garden, and I saw Mr. Hacton come in with two soldiers' coats on his arms—I said, "These are the very things that we have been looking for"—Mrs. Evans said Mrs. Barrett had thrown them over the fence to her, and when she came and asked her for the duplicates she asked her to throw them away—I found two pairs of tan-leather gloves in the pocket of a coat that Enoch Barrett had on in his bedroom—I told him they were part of another truss that had been stolen the same night—he said he had had them of his brother—I found another pair of similar gloves in a box in his bedroom—the two pairs that were in the pocket appeared to have been worn—he said he did not know where his brother got them, but he did not believe they had been stolen; that his brother had been in the habit of coming there, and he never took notice of what he brought in; he brought them in a bag, and left them there, and he did not interfere with his brother's business; that his brother was in the habit of coming there and putting his goods down in a bag in the corner—I then returned to Mrs. Barrett and her husband—I produced these two coats to him—I said, "These are the coats I was speaking about just now, when I found this cuff in the corner"—he said, "These coats have been on my brother's bed for a long time"—they were not on the bed when I searched the house on Friday, or I should have seen them—he said, "They were there when you searched the house before"—I said, "If they had been there I should have seen them, because they are the particular things that I have been looking for"—Mrs. Barrett said she had thrown them over the garden, thinking that if they were found in their house they might get them into trouble—I found these four whistles in Enoch Barrett's pocket—they are all of different notes—I found this cord in a cupboard in the back kitchen—it has been cut at one end—this is the cord used on the sheets of the trucks—it is cut at one end and it is tarred—their sheets and ropes are all tarred—all the others are just the same as this, and bound round as this is—they fix on one end of the sheet and tie down to the truck—I asked Enoch Barrett how it came there—he said he did not know—on Saturday 15th Feb. I went with Mr. Owen to New-port Pagnell—I searched George Pearson Barrett's general-shop there, and found a great many things—this bundle of shawls and three red worsted cravats hanging up in the shop—they were new, and exactly correspond with the one I have produced—I found three dozen and one pairs of braces and seven pairs of Berlin gloves, which correspond with those I found in Albert-street—I found a packet of buttons of a similar kind to those I found at Evans's, these are marked 400, some printed cotton, with 43 1/2 stamped on them, two red worsted cravats that had been worn of the same kind, four pairs of tan-leather gloves, corresponding with what I found in Albert-street, five pairs of leather gloves in the bedroom, and</p>

In Dec. 1849, Enoch Pearson Barrett was in the employ of the Company, as signal and switch-man—it was his duty to stop the goods'-train at the particular place where he was; at the Bricklayers' Arms junction with the main line, about two miles from London—it was his duty to see that the main line was clear before the other trains were admitted from the Bricklayers' Arms station</p>

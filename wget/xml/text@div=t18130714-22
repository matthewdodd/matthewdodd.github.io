               <p>Q. Where were you on the 9th of June last - A. I lodged at Mrs. Young's; she is here,</p>
               <p>Q. How many of you slept in the same room with you - A. Two more; the prisoner slept in the same room. I saw him come in about eleven o'clock at night; he went to bed The mistress took one of the children out of bed to make room for him. I slept in a bed by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning - A. About half past four, or near five, when an alarm was given that the other man got up; when that alarm was given the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search to see whether you had lost any of your own property - A. Not at that time; between seven and eight I missed a pair of shoes, and a hat. I thought nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss any thing else - A. About eight o'clock I got up. I missed the key of a trunk out of my pocket-book, and I missed a three-shilling piece out of my other pocket; then I suspected that my trunk was robbed; I went to my trunk and found it locked, then I took out my trunk, and under some old clothes behind my trunk I found my key hid; I opened my trunk and missed nine two-pound notes, a one-pound note, two shirts, a pair of stockings, a pair of trowsers; my hat, and shoes, were gone. I have seen some of my things since; they are in the officers custody. These are the things; I have not seen the notes since; the prisoner took them out of his pocket, and delivered them to the officer. The second day after I lost them I saw the prisoner in Golden lane; he was searched in my presence; all was found on him except a few shillings of the money that he had taken from me, one one-pound note, seven two-pound notes, and some silver; the silver and shirts, where found at the house where he lodged. I was present when the things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner how he got these things - A. Yes; I said, you rascal, where is the notes that you took from me; he put his hand into his pocket, took out the notes, and put them into Mettingley, the officer's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When before this, had you seen these notes in your box - A. The same evening that I was robbed; I took the money out to make a payment to a shoemaker; I put them in my trunk again. The trowsers is mine; these are my shoes, and this is my hat; I had not taken any of the numbers of the notes. I went to the bankers afterwards; they told me they did not take any numbers of notes under five-pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish him to be asked why he saw me come into the room - A. I saw him come into the room; he slept with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for following me - A. I wanted to apprehend you,</p>

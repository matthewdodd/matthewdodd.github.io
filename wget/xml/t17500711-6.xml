            . I live in the Broad-way, Westminster. I am a perriwig maker, the prisoner came to work with me the very same day, July 2. I went to shave a customer, and he was gone when I returned, and the wig too; he had not been with me above four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wig was it?</p>
               <p>Peak. It was a black bob cut wig, the property of

               <p>Q. How long had you been absent?</p>
               <p>Peak. I believe about a quarter of an hour, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Peak. Because, my Lord, he confessed the taking of it before the justice, the constable and me, where he sold it, and for what. I was with the man yesterday, he is a waggoner; he said the next return he would bring it up: it was sold for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of the wig. I had been drinking all day; his wife wanted me to fetch her half a quartern of soap, which I resented, and went out; I met a friend, who asked me if I would drink a pint of beer; I staid about three or four hours, so I thought it not worth my while to return. He is a very scandalous man in regard to his journeymen, which was the reason I would not work with him.</p>

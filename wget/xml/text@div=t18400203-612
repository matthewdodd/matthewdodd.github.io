                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, and live in Tothill-street, Westminster. About half-past three o'clock on the afternoon of the 20th of January, in consequence of information from Mr. Martin, I looked at my door, and missed a brown cloth cloak, which I bad seen safe about an hour before—Smith, my young man, brought the prisoner back to the shop directly, with it on her back—it was not outside the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live opposite Mr. King. On the afternoon of the 20th of January, about three o'clock, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner come out of the public-house, which is next door but one to the prosecutor—she took the cloak down from the door, put it on her back, and returned into the public-house again—I am sure she is the woman—I did not know her before—I directly went over and informed Mr. King—his young man fetched her out of the public-house with the cloak on, and gave her in charge—I should say it was the same cloak she took from the prosecutor's door—she had no cloak on before she took it, and it appeared the same—she was very much intoxicated at the time, and staggered very much.</p>

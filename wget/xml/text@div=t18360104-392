                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler, and live at Putney; Wig<lb></lb>gins was my carter, and carried my goods out. I could not miss any boxes, having so many—it was his business to take full boxes of candles out, and bring home empty boxes and fat—sometimes the boxes are left with the customers, and sometimes returned—I was shown some after<lb></lb>wards, which I have no doubt are mine—I have sold boxes, if a gentleman coming down the street wanted one—sometimes my customers keep them, and we charge them in the bill—I know nothing of the other two pri<lb></lb>soners.</p>

The prisoner Bagshaw has been ostler at the Three Goat's Heads, in the Wandsworth road—I was under ostler—Bagshaw was my master—I have seen Pearce—I think he is a fishmonger—he keeps a horse and cart—they were accustomed to stop at the Goats' Heads—Wiggins sometimes stopped there with his master's cart—on Tuesday, the 31st of December, Wiggins stopped there with Mr. Dallett's</p>

On the 13th of August I lost eleven pigeons, some of them were taken out of the shop, others from out-houses on my premises; the goose came from the Cape of Good-Hope; they were lost on Sunday morning; I went round the next day to people who deal in those things; I found five or six pigeons in the possession of Mrs. Martin, in Holbourn, near St. Giles's; I could swear they were mine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the goose? - Nothing but the head of it. I took up the prisoner on the Tuesday following, by the information of Mr. Martin.</p>
               <p>(The pigeons were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>- MARTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a poulterer's shop in High Holbourn. On Sunday the 13th of August, I purchased these six pigeons of the prisoner for four shillings; on the Monday morning Mr. Brooks came and claimed them as his property; the next day I saw the prisoner go by, and had him secured. At Wilmot's Office Mr. Brooks said he would shew him mercy, if he would impeach any others who were concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told him if he would discover any accomplices, that they might be brought to justice, he should have mercy shewn him; we went in quest of another person, but could not find him.</p>

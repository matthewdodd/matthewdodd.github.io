I took some money in the King's-road, and had half a sovereign of my own. I did not know I had any bad money; but people take advantage of a man who is near sighted, and give him bad money. I gave this woman a good shilling, and therefore had no occasion to hurry away, but had another pint of beer. I do not know where the pond is, I never noticed it, and never threw anything into it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of May, in consequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner in Vine-street, Chandos-street, about five or six o'clock. Hawkins pointed him out - I took him to a public house - he denied the charge. I found a purse on him containing silver - I put it on the table - he took it up, and threw it on the floor. As I was taking him to the watch-house, I told him I knew he had stolen the coat, for he had been seen carrying it from the house; and that Mahoney, who he was at work with, was in custody, until I found him. He then said</p>
               <p>"I have sold it, and the money in the purse is what I got for it" - that he had sold it in Vine-street. I went there and found such a shop as he had described - I got a coat there, which I produced.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Vine-street, and sell old china, watches, and things. On the 7th of May, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came and purchased a watch for 30 s., and told me to regulate it, and he would call in the evening for it, when he should receive some money; he had a coat under his arm; he went out - returned - and asked me to advance him a sovereign on the coat. I lent him 16 s., and gave the coat to Whales.</p>

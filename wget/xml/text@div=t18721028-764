On Sunday night, 30th June last, I was on duty in Bermondsey New Road, about 1 o'clock, close to the top of Webb Street—I saw the prisoner coming up Webb Street from the direc<lb></lb>tion of No. 12—he could not speak, he made motions to me; I then saw that he was bleeding from a wound in the throat, and from the head—he pointed in the direction of 12, Webb Street—I said, "Show me where this occurred," and he took me to 12, Webb Street, to the first-floor back room—he was very excited; I don't think it was drink—he walked with me—I had my lamp with me—I found three persons in the room: a woman, a little child, and a boy, lying insensible in different parts of the room—there was a bed against the window, on the floor, but no bedstead—there was a smaller bed opposite the door going in, on the left—the little girl was lying on the smaller bed—there was about 3 yards between the two beds—the prisoner pointed out the beds to me—on the larger bed I saw the woman Susannah Hebden, and the boy Moses Israel—the woman was lying crossways on the bed, partly on the bed and her legs on the floor, and the boy was lying on her left, close to her—she was partly dressed—she had got on two petticoats and her chemise—I think that was all—I saw, from the state of the bodies, that they were dying; they were insensible, they could not speak—about that time the police-constable Bridgman came in, and I sent him for a doctor—I asked the prisoner for a candle, and he got one—I did not see where from—he was standing against the window, and he took the candle from somewhere close to him—it was not lighted—some-one lit it; there was no candlestick—I then examined the floor of the room—there were several places bloody, also on the bed-clothes—there were smears and splashes of blood on the floor—the greater quantity of blood was on the larger bed—I waited in the room till Dr. Cuolahan came—the prisoner was very excited, he kept pointing to the bodies and then to his throat—he could not speak—when the doctor came he directed that the prisoner should be taken to the hospital, and Bridgman tried to remove him from the room—he resisted—he was afterwards taken down stairs and put into a cab—he was taken into a front room for a short time—I did not see him again till the following Thursday—I stopped with the bodies—they both died while I was in the room—the two bodies were removed to the dead-house, and the boy was removed to the workhouse—on the following Thursday I was placed as guard over the prisoner in the hospital—he was then quite calm and</p>

               <p>Sensible—I asked him how he was, but could not hear him answer; his throat was so bad he could not speak—on Wednesday, 10th July, he was able to speak a little—I could pick up words that he said then—he said he could not think he had murdered the little girl—he was very sorry for the little girl, for she was so fond of him—he said that the woman had driven him to this—he said before the Derby he bought her a new suit of clothes, and she went and pawned it, and got drunk—he said just previous to this she went away four days along with another man, on the Saturday, stopped four days, and returned on the Wednesday before this occurrence—he said he had been drinking, previous to that, for a fortnight; she drove him to it by going and stopping away—I remained with him from the Thursday, 4th July, until the 30th September, on and off—he seemed very sensible except when he had the erysepilas in his head; that was in August, then he was strapped down to the bed—he was delirious—with the exception of that he was usually calm—he conversed with me sensibly—on 30th "September he was taken away from the hospital by Inspector Walton and myself and taken before the Magistrate—he remained three months in the hospital, from 30th June to 30th September.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw that he was bleeding from the head—it was a very bad wound—he could not speak to me in the street when he first came up—he could only make gestures—I believe his throat was not dressed before he was taken to the hospital—he was taken there on the Sunday morning—I was directed by my inspector to go there on the Thursday—I believe he tore the bandages off after his throat had been dressed—I believe he did that on two or three occasions, but not in my presence—I have heard that he tore his throat open—I don't think that was before the Thursday, but I was relieved by other constables—I don't know what constable was there at that time—his violent conduct lasted about four days, I think—he was strapped to his bed during the four days—in consequence of his violence we could not have held him if he had not been strapped down, and all that time he was raving, very delirious.</p>

I am a costermonger and labourer, and live at 96, Bermondsey New Road—on Sunday morning, 30th June, I was at the corner of Webb Street, just before the clock struck one—I saw the last witness there—I saw the prisoner run out of the house in Webb Street and come towards me—I could see that his head was bleeding; the blood ran down his face and his shirt—he had nothing on but his trousers and shirt—no shoes, or stockings, or coat, or hat—he came and showed his head to the constable, and the constable said, "Come down and show me who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that," and took hold of his left arm—the prisoner went to 12, Webb Street—I followed the constable—we went up to the back-room, first floor, and I saw the three persons lying there on the ground—the prisoner got a candle out of the corner of the room, and some one lighted it—I remained there until the doctor came, and another constable—I saw a bolt and a pocket-knife found in the room—I found the knife myself at the side of the bed—it was open—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it Doctor Coulahan—it had blood on it—this bolt was found in the room at the right hand side going in—there was blood and hair on it—I weighed it—it weighs</p>

I was on duty in the Bermondsey New Road—I went on duty at 10 o'clock, and passed and repassed 12, Webb Street—I did not hear any disturbance or cries during the time I was on duty—I was at the corner of Webb Street just before 1 o'clock when I was called by a female—from what she said I went to 12, Webb Street, and listened—I heard nothing—I went into the back yard and listened, and heard nothing there—upon returning I was informed that some man had cut his throat—I went to 12, Webb Street into the back room—I saw March and the three bodies in the room—I was told to remove the prisoner to Guy's Hospital—he looked in a very wild excited state and he kept pointing up and down and to the side of his head where the injuries were—when we got to the head of the stairs to go down he resisted—he wanted to kiss the little child that was breathing just its last—we allowed him to kiss the child, and he then went quietly all the way to the hospital—when we arrived there he asked, by signs, for something to write on—he was handed a slate by the doctor and a piece of pencil—he wrote something on the slate which was afterwards rubbed off, but I took a copy of it; this is it—"A boy up stairs. I told you to go up. My two boys have not come home. I think they are stopped by the same party. They left home about 8.30: James Taylor and Alfred Taylor. Over at Mile End. Grandmother sent to Stone's End to fetch one. Uncle, March. Young Cone said he would do for me to night. He has been a soldier "—this was about half-an-hour after we got to the hospital—Stone's End mentioned there is the police-station in the borough—there are two detectives; one goes by the name of "Uncle" and another is Marsh or March—Cone, I believe, is the name of a person who lodges in the house—I did not wait with him after he wrote that on the slate—I think I was with him about three-quarters of an hour; he complained of thirst, and drank several times in the hospital—another constable took charge of him, and I came away—I went on duty there again the following Thursday morning, 4th July—I was in charge of him then for four weeks and three or four days—he was delirious the first week or ten days, and two or three days before be left the hospital he had a little swelling come in his face, from erysipelas—he was very delirious then—he told the night nurse when she came down that I threw three buckets of water over the day nurse—at other times he was sensible and right in his mind, and he could converse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He wrote down very strange things on the slate; things that he would want to make use of—I did not copy all of them—he appeared very weak and ill—I have not copied those things from the slate, only what he wrote the first night—there was nothing else besides that—I did not judge from that that he showed symptoms of insanity; chiefly from his manner—he was very strange sometimes; he would jump up in bed—he was always very strange in his manner—there was nothing else—there were a few other things written on the slate, I believe—I saw one or two which did not refer to the crime, and I did not copy them—I could not remember them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and a surgeon—I live at 9, Grange Road, Bermondsey—on Sunday morning, 30th June, a constable came to me about 1.10 or 1.15—in consequence of what he said, I went to 12, Webb Street—I went up stairs to the back room first floor—the prisoner was there, and there were three persons on the floor—the mattrass was on the floor—a woman, about forty years of age, was lying across the mattrass, her feet resting on the floor—she was partially dressed, and unconscious—there were several wounds on her head, from which blood was issuing—she died in about half-an-hour on the same spot—a little girl, about five years old, was lying on another mattrass in the corner of the room, dying—she had a wound in the head, extending from the frontal bone to the occipital, and the brain was protruding—she died about twenty minutes after my attending—the little boy, about thirteen or fourteen, was not quite unconscious, he was crying—he had wounds on the head—he was sent to the workhouse; I accompanied him there—the other bodies were removed—I examined carefully the injuries they bad sustained—on the girl there was a wound extending from the frontal bone over the skull to the back-bone, only one wound; the side bones were broken in, and fragments were embedded in the brain, and the brain protruded—this piece of iron would produce the injuries—I sponged the woman's head, and partially examined her then; on the following Tuesday more particularly—on the left side of the head were two wounds, one above and one below the external angle of the left eyelid, with a fracture of the bones of the orbit; an irregular wound over the left temple, 2 inches in a transverse direction, and one in a vertical; a smaller wound, 1 inch in diameter, over the back<lb></lb>bone of the head, on the left side, 1 inch above and a little behind the tip of the ear, and another wound a little above the junction of the left ear with the scalp—there was blood issuing from the left ear, which was an evidence of fracture of the base of the skull—on the right side there was one triangular and two straight wounds of the scalp, penetrating to the bone: over the right lateral half of the frontal bone, there was a fracture</p>

               <p>Corresponding with the straight wound, contusion of the nose, discoloura<lb></lb>tion of the left wrist and arm, 4 inches vertically and 2 transversely, apparently the result of a grasp, and contusion of the right shin bone—the body was well nourished, but very dirty—a little above the left breast there were two punctures, not of recent date; they might have been inflicted by a fork; they were very superficial; possibly they may have been inflicted within a week or so—the little boy was lying at right angles with the woman, on the right side, his head resting on her shoulder—on the right side of his head there were two scalp wounds, with fracture of the skull; on the left side were two wounds over the occipital bone, and two wounds over the parietal bone, and con<lb></lb>fusion of the left thumb—the boy was suffering from concussion of the brain as well as fracture—he was unconscious for three or four days—the wounds, both on the woman and the boy, might have been inflicted by this iron bolt—the woman and the girl died of the injuries that I have described—I saw the prisoner in the room, standing in the corner at the feet of the woman, in a very excited state, very restless, endeavoring to talk in<lb></lb>constantly, but, in consequence of the wound in his throat, he could not articulate—I could not understand what he said—the windpipe was severed, the throat was bleeding—it was a very severe wound—I did not then notice the wound on his head; I did at the hospital—it was on the right side, at the upper edge of the right parietal bone, and about 4 inches long—it was a severe wound—there was fracture of the skull—I formed an opinion, such as it is, as to how that wound had been caused—I went back to the house to ascertain by marks of blood how such a wound could have been inflicted, and I found the box of the lock of the door was covered with blood, especially the edge, and I concluded it was that—it cur<lb></lb>responded with the length of the wound, and possibly in struggling with the woman he might have fallen or been pushed back against it—that is mere conjecture—the blow must have been very severe—I did not examine the head myself, but I understood from the house-surgeon that there was fracture of the skull—the room was exceedingly dirty, these was very little furniture in it—it was a dirty mattrass across which the woman lay—the wall near the child's bed was bespattered with brains and blood—there was blood on the floor, and on this bolt, and on this knife which was handed to me by the last witness—the bolt I found myself concealed under the mattrass; it was covered with blood and some hairs—the injuries on the throat could have been inflicted with the knife—I also found a Bible on which there was blood—the boy has recovered.</p>

               <p>in the first floor; I usually slept up stairs in the top room, but I fell off to sleep by the fire with my little cousin <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi> and the baby, about 7.30, or 8 o'clock; before I fell asleep I saw my father up stairs in the back room first floor, about 6 o'clock—he told me to go down and feed the horse, and then go and fetch March and Uncle from Stone's End—I did not know at that time who March and Uncle were—he told me to tell them that there was somebody going to murder him—he said, "If you miss me, very likely you will find me 3 yards further away, dead in the shed; I heard them say they were going to put me there;" when he said this he was walking up and down the room, crying and sweating—I went over and fed the horse, and then went back and fell asleep—I did not go to Stone's End—about 1 o'clock or 1.30 I heard a noise coming down the stairs, and a gurgling in the throat, like somebody choking, and then I heard some one open the street door and go out, and afterwards the policeman came in and turned on his light, and I found what had occurred—my father used to go out with a horse and cart to buy iron, and I assisted him—I was out with him on the Thursday in that week, and he kept on saying that there were people after murdering him, and following him about in cabs, and when he saw anybody in a cab, he said "Here they come after me," and he would hit the horse and make him go quick—he went to the Mansion House, and went up to a policeman there, and told him that there were people after murdering him, and he fetched a gentleman in a round hat, who asked me if there was anybody after killing him, and I was obliged to say "Yes;" I was frightened, for I knew father was in such a state of mind—I know this piece of iron; I got it when we came home on the Thursday—father said there were people Outside going to kill him, and he could hear them calling—I could not hear them—he kept saying "Look here, outside, listen;" and he told me to pick up a piece of iron, and he said "If they touch me, you follow me up behind, and if anybody touches me, you run and fetch a policeman "—I went and fetched this piece of iron from a stack of iron that was lying on the ground in Grange Walk, and gave it to my father on the Thursday night, he held it in his hand, then he put it in his pocket, and then he put it down; my little brother <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> picked it up, and father turned round and came all over in a sweat, and began crying—I saw this piece of iron on the Friday up stairs in the bedroom—my father drank that week—he generally drank very heavily—two or three weeks before this happened he armed us all with choppers, and hammers, and knives—he went to the yard door, I had to go to the yard door, and <hi rend="italic">Moss</hi> had to go by the window, and we all had to walk about—aunt was up stairs, and father was waiting at the window saying that they were coming in to him—he continued to drink hard all that week; he used not to go to work for two or three days before this—he was always out drinking—I heard about his stabbing my aunt, but I did not see it—I was abed—I called the deceased aunt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surgeons at Guy's Hospital—in June last Mr. Southey was house-surgeon there, and attended to this case; he has left, and I believe has gone to Peru—I saw the prisoner thirty-six hours after his admission; he was suffering then from the effects of a wound on the right aide of his head, also from a severe wound in the throat; he was in a semi-conscious condition, able to answer questions; he spoke with difficulty, on account of the wound in his throat—I could just understand what he said, but owing to the windpipe being divided it was with difficulty we could make out what he uttered—there was a compound comminuted fracture of the skull; that is, the bone was broken up in several pieces—that injury could not have been caused without great violence—I should think it impossible to have been caused by falling against the lock of the door—it would be accounted for by a blow on the head—I doubt very much whether it could have been self-inflicted—somebody must have hurled him with tremendous force against a projecting body to have done it, and I doubt even that being possible—the wound in the throat was not dangerous, it was very long and severed the windpipe—he remained in the hospital, I believe, up to 30th September—I went away about the 8th—up to that time I saw him every other day, on every third day—I did not notice any appearance of <hi rend="italic">delirium firemens</hi> about him from the time I first saw him up to 8th September—he was as conscious as you or I, of sound mind I should think—from the time I removed the pieces of broken bone he became perfectly conscious, and was in a sound state of mind from that time—he was admitted on the Sunday morning at 2.30—severe symptoms of com<lb></lb>pression came on, and on the Tuesday after, at 3 o'clock, I removed the pieces—he had a slight attack of erysepilas in August; and, as many patients are with erysipelas, he was a little delirious at night; that was simply from the erysepilas—remembering his antecedents we thought it advisable to strap him down—the deceased woman had been brought to the hospital on the previous Wednesday, and was under my care—she was suffering then from two slight punctures, such as may have been made by a fork—she was there two days—I saw her on the Thursday and Friday—I told her there was nothing very serious—she discharged herself, I think.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 283). On 1st July I was put in charge of the prisoner at the hospital; he had then been in the hospital about four hours—when I first saw him he was lying very quietly in his bed; he suddenly jumped out of bed; took the weights off the clock, and stood over me with them as if he was going to throw them at me; he then turned round, and the window being a little open, he raised it and jumped out; it is about 3 feet from the ground; he ran into the female ward, seized a poker, and ran into the top floor—I attempted to follow him, and he rushed on to. the landing, swinging the poker, and attempted to throw the weights at me; I went down again, and got two ladders; I tied them together to put to the top window to get in that way, and he rushed across and threw the ladders down; I and another constable then went into the ward and tried to get the clock weights from him—he attempted to strike us with the weights and the poker—I tried to frighten him by saying I would strike him with, my staff; at last we managed to get on the landing, and the nurse promised if he would lay the weights and poker down she would give him some brandy; after some ten minutes he laid them down, and we rushed in and secured him; he was taken to the strong room and strapped down in his bed—he was wild, and I thought he was suffering from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe on the staircase he tore open the wound in his throat, and wrote on the wall with the blood with his finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see him tear the wound open; it was open already—I saw the blood on the wall; it was writing of some kind—I could not say what it was—I did not actually see him do it—it was very near the top landing, after he had got away from the ward.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a general shop at 10, Webb Street—about 1 o'clock on Sunday morning, 30th June, I heard a very shrill scream in a woman's voice—I thought it came from next door, that is, in the direction of No. 12—at the same time I heard the breaking of glass—I heard nothing more till the constables came—I got up directly—it was a shrill scream at first, and then it went off as if some one was holding her throat, or over her mouth.</p>

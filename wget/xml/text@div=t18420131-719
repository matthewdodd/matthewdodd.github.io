                  </hi>. I manage the shop of Rowland Williams, an iron<lb></lb>monger, in High Holborn. On the 27th of January I missed two tin boilers from outside the shop—these now produced are them—there was a ticket on each, but here is but one ticket found—I can identify that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 188.) On the 27th of January I saw the prisoner in Streatham-street, St. Giles's—she had these two boilers with her—I asked where she got them, and while speaking to her, this ticket for the boilers fell from her—I picked it up—she said the boilers were made a present to her by a lady in Bedford-place, she did not know the lady, but would show me the house—she then took me to No. 51, Russell-square, where she said they were presented to her at the door—the servants of the house said in her presence that they had not had any such articles there—she then said the lady told her to wait on the steps, and the lady went and fetched the boilers, but did not say where from—when I first took the prisoner she told me to wait at the corner of Streatham-street, she would go and fetch a quartern of gin, and that would make it all right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in Russell-square selling some things; a lady said to me, why did I not turn my hand to something better; I said I could not; she said, "Why not sell coffee or tea?" I said I had nothing to put it in; she said, "Here is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and if you are here when I come back, I will see what I can do for you;" but I forgot her direction where she said I was to call.</p>

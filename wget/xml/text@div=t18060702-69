               <p>Q. When you got home, give us some idea what state you were in. - A.

               <p>Q. When you were laying in this state at your lodging, how soon was it after the morning this affair happened that you saw Prescott and Bastin. - A. About two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said to any body that Prescott and Bastin were the men that struck you. - A.I had, I said it to Mrs. Dennis, and to several people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever accuse any body else than these two men. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when Prescott came to you. - A. He knocked at the door, the woman that attended me was gone out, I was in bed by myself, I told him to come up, he came up to my bedside, he told me that he had heard that I accused him of being one of the men that beat him, he swore to his d - ation that he was not the man, I told him he was the man, he said farmer Leach would prove that he was in bed with his wife; he staid with me about a quarter of an hour, I shewed him my wounds on my shoulder and arm; he told me that he and his father were about having a vessel built, and it would be all over with them if I swore to him; he asked me whether the nineteen kegs would be of any use, I told him no; he said the nineteen kegs were no object, he did not mind their loss.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the other prisoner, Bastin. - A. I think that was within five or six days, he came to my house with his brother, he said he understood I said he was one of the men that beat me, I told him he was, he said that it was only he and his brother that carried on the smuggling there; he said that he had never beat an officer in his life, and he had been taken a great many times; he asked me whether it was him or his brother, I told him I was positive it was him.</p>
               <p>Court. He denied that it was him that struck you. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing him and of seeing the serjeant at the time the blows were given. - A. I had better opportunity of seeing Bastin when I was looking over my arm.</p>

               <p>Q. You did receive from some hand or other an hundred pounds. - A. Yes, the hundred pound was received and paidback.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the reason that you knew the other, did his handkerchief come down. - A. No, I knew him from his voice; his handkerchief was on the lower part of his face, about as high as his mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. You assisted him during his indisposition. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with them on the Sunday when they attempted to take the prisoner. - A. Yes, and Bugle.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about three or four months after his happened. A. Yes, we went to East Budley, we saw the defendants; I spoke to Bastin, I told him he was a prisoner of mine, he scuffled and got off, I followed and catched hold of him by his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he escape again. - A. He did, we had a scuffle before he made his escape, he wrested a pistol out of Dowgood's hands, I struck his heels, upon which he fell upon his back; I called upon Cookstone to assist me, he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you secure Bastin. - A. We could not, owing to the people throwing stones and dirt.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Const addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner; and Mr. Attorney General replied.)</p>
               <p>- CLARKE sworn. Examined by Mr. Const. Where do you reside. - A. At East Budley in Devon.</p>
               <p>Q. What character have the defendants deserved as men of humanity. - A. A very good one, I have known them twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a surgeon there. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that attended the officer afterwards. - A. Yes, I attended him about two days, I believe he had a cut on his head, I found there was no danger.</p>
               <p>Q.You was called in the same morning. - A. Yes, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your profession was you out the evening before. - A. I was out most of the night, it was one of the darkest nights that ever I was out in, I could not distinguish my next door neighbour from a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney General.</p>
               <p>Q. You live about two miles from the sea coast. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was this. - A. It was either the 3d or 4th of December 1804, it was either Sunday evening or Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You were particular attentive to the state of this night. - A. I was particular, and made a memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always attentive to the state of the weather at night. - A. This was a remarkable dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the night before. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the night after. - A. I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. And the night after that. - A. I cannot pretend to say, I only know of this one night, I should not have made the memorandum only I did not know but I might be called upon; the exciseman told me he had been beat, I told him it was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you only attended him two days, do you happen to have your bill here. - A. I have not, my whole charge is but thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call to see him after the second day. - A. I never visited him as a patient after the two days.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was this upon the head. - A. He had a large cut on his head, no, it was a small cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Which am I to understand you. - A. It was not a very large one, it was well in two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoners. - A. Yes, I know them well enough.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they desire you to go to Cardew. - A. They neither of them did, to the best of my recollection, I never saw either of them for a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Cardew. - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer Cardew any money. - A. I offered him no money any farther than this, I said to him it was a common assault, Cardew said to me it is hard I should be beat for nothing, I replied I will rather give you twenty pounds out of my own pocket than you should go to law, I would rather you would make it up; I was not authorised by these people at all.</p>

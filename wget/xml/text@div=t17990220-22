               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200018"></xptr>Q. How do you know they were your stockings? - A. I am responsible for them; I had them in trust for the proprietor of the waggon; I am liable for all goods that are lost, that is our contract; they were damaged stockings that had been returned upon my hands for being damaged; they came up for Summerset and Company, in Oxford-street, a whole package, out of which there were three dozen damaged, which were returned to me; and I was either to have returned them into the country, or have made the best I could of them; I had paid Summerset and Company, for them; if I had sent them down to my employer, I should have debitted his account to the amount.</p>
               <p>EDWARD GOULDER sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Walworth: I saw the prisoner go down the yard, and into the accompting-house; I supposed he had some business there; he stopped there for a minute and a half or two minutes; I saw him come out of the accompting-house with a parcel under his jacket; he had an old jacket on; I said, what have you got here, my friend; he said, it was his parcel; we went up the yard ten yards or better together; then Mr. Walworth came out of the warehouse door that leads to the accompting-house; I said, master, did you give this man any parcel; no, said he; I had hold of him by the collar at the same time; my master came and took the parcel from him; the prisoner said he had a friend just by; and then afterwards, he said, he wished to speak for himself. A constable was sent for, and he was delivered to him with the stockings.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ELDIN sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner, and they delivered me the prisoner and the goods; that is all I know of it. (Produces the parcel).</p>
               <p>Mr. Walworth. These are the same goods that I lost.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I can say nothing to perfection, and therefore it would only aggravate the crime.</p>

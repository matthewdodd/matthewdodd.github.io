                  </hi>. I reside at No. 15, Hyde-park-garden On Thursday, 8th March, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking in Kensington-gardens—I had not an outer coat on—my coat was buttoned—I had my watch in my waistcoat pocket—it was not visible—I heard persons walking behind me—I did not turn round—one of them came behind me and put his arm round my neck, and put his knee in my back, and bent me back, and I was powerless—while I was in this position they pulled open my coat, tore the button a little, and took hold of my watch chain, and broke the key off in the hole in the waistcoat—the waistcoat was not torn—my watch was taken, and part of the chain, all except the key—they then left me—I could not tell whether there was more than one person—I saw two persons in front of me who were running towards the botanic walk—the robbery had taken place just by the round pond—I saw them running about twenty yards off—I know the prisoners to be the parties who ran away—I swear they are the two men that-ran from me—I saw Williams stopped by Croxford—Baker got away—I had just noticed the prisoners before I was stopped—when Williams was stopped Croxford had my watch, and Williams said now that I had got my property I might let him off—I did not see Baker taken—when I first saw him afterwards he was in custody—that was about half an hour after the occurrence—this is the watch and chain—the watch belongs to my sister, Helen Jane Sandeman—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> When you lost your watch, in what part of the park were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten yards from the round pond—the pond is about fifteen yards from the park way—when I missed my watch I did not look behind me—I saw you running, and I ran after you—I was not speaking to any one—I was not speaking to a boy—there was a person sitting down—the first thing I did was to run after you—I represented you before the Grand Jury by your size—I knew you to be the person—I told the gardener I had been robbed, and he ran after you—I can swear you took the watch from my possession.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. I live with my mother, but not my father; the prisoner has been very much neglected by his father for the last three years, and has lived with us - I had some money in a trunk in the room the prisoner slept in, on the 24th of November; he got up that morning before seven o'clock, and went away: my sister and I had been up at work till two in the morning, and we did not get up till eight - I then missed three half-crowns, four shillings, and one sixpence of mine, and a pair of shoes of my sister's; I went and found him at the top of Golden-lane, between eight and nine o'clock the same evening.</p>

             I am an officer. The witnesses sent for me, and gave the prisoner into custody; he had a new jacket on, which he said he bought in Golden-lane, and he said that he had bought a pair of trousers which he gave to another boy, and the rest of the money he had spent in a coffee shop - he said he might as well take his sisters money as any body's; he has been dreadfully neglected: the two young woman bear good characters, and one of them left her place, at Mr. Baker's, to attend to the prisoner.</p>

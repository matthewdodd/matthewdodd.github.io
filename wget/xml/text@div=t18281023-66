               <p>LEWIS EMANUEL. The prisoner Ludke was in my service and Tword used to come to the house to do jobs, but was not regularly employed. On the 20th of July, I received a paper, containing some diamonds, six rings, and six brooches, which were ordered to be put away into my bed-room: on the 25th, I missed a diamond ring, and told Ludke of it; the house was searched, and she looked for it - on the 4th of August she left my service, and on the 15th of September I was sent for by Mr. Williamson, a pawnbroker, who had detained Tword.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had she been in your service? A. Four months; she behaved well - I certainly think she has fallen into bad hands, for she has been intrusted with some hundreds of my property; I should not object to take her back myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You cannot say that Tword was in your house that day? A. No.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. - I have a diamond ring which Tword came on the 18th of September, to pawn for 1l.; I asked if she pawned it for herself - she said it was her own, and she considered it quite an impertient question, as she had worn many rings of that description; I detained her - she said it was her own property; I asked where she lived - she said in Castle-street, Whitechapel, and was a green-grocer; that her husband worked in Smithfield-market - she made a hasty step to go away; I went after her and brought her back.</p>

            . I went by Williamson's desire with Tword; she took me to Mr. Emanuel's - she pushed the door too, and said to Mr. Emanuel "Where is Mary Ann?" I said "This woman has been to pawn a diamond ring at Williamson's; he sent me to see where she lived, and she has brought me here;" he said her had lost a ring - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230043"></xptr>went to Williamson's, and claimed it; Ludke made her escape out of the back-door, and next morning was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did she come to take you to Emanuel's? A. I do not know, but she took me there; she asked for Mary Ann; she said she had given her the ring, or something to that effect, and that she had received it last night from Ludke.</p>
               <p>Ludke put in a written Defence, stating that she had frequently been urged by Tword to rob her master; that she had found this ring in the bed-room, and on calling at Tword's she shewed it to her; that she took it from her, and promised to take her to the theatre.</p>

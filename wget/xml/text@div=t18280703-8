On the 11th of June, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and said, he was sent by a person in the Strand, to look at a gold repeating watch, which was marked 120 guineas; he did not mention the gentleman's name - I did not know the prisoner before; he said he was sent by the gentleman to ask the lowest price of it; the watch lay on the counter with many others at the time; I gave it to him to look at, and he ran away with it - it had been marked 120 guineas, and hung in the window; but was not in the window when he came in - the ticket was not on it on the counter; it had the maker's name, "Westwood" on it - I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and saw him running in the street as hard as he could; he turned the corner as I got out of the door - he was stopped in the next street in two or three minutes after he ran out, by the beadle; I lost sight of him while he turned the corner, but caught sight of him again, and saw him taken; I came up directly - I am certain he is the man; I asked what he had done with the watch - he directly gave it to me from his pocket; here it is - I am quite certain of it by the name and number; there is no private mark on it; it is worth 100l.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I was at the bottom of Castle-street, near Duke's-court, and saw several persons running from the end of Hemming's-row; the prisoner was running first - I heard the cry of Stop thief! put myself in his way and stopped him; Vaughan came up and asked him where the watch was - he put his hand into his pocket, and gave it him; he offered no resistance, and declared it was real poverty caused him to do it for he had no where to go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only recollected where I was at the time I came to the watch-house; I was in that misery of mind, I did not know what occurred - it would be vain for me to attempt to address the Court as I could wish; I only wish to state, that nothing but the greatest poverty and the greatest misery of mind would ever induce me to commit so great a crime - I walked one hundred and fifty miles with only 3s. 6d. in my pocket; and within twenty miles of town I made application to the overseer of the parish - who said, it was surprising, such a creditable young man as me should ask for relief, and that I had better go on the highway; I walked all night, in order to get employ, and I thought for the first time of dishonesty - may the All-seeing Eye witness what I have related; I have friends, but they are too far off, and their knowing my being guilty of so base a transaction, would be worse than the punishment I shall receive - had I got away with the property, I do not know what I should have done with it; may the Almighty forgive what the world cannot.</p>

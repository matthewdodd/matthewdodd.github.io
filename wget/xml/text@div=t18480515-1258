                  </hi> I am a licensed victualler, at Well-street, Whitechapel. On 29th March I was at the Lass of Gowrie beer-shop at Shadwell—I saw a scuffle—my hat was knocked off—Doig was there—after I got home I missed a watch from my waistcoat pocket—I had it when I entered the beer-shop—this is it, and this chain and two seals—I also lost a small gold watch without a chain—I had just got it from the watchmaker.</p>

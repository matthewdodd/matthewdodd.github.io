I am a linen-draper, and live in High-street, Shoreditch—the prisoner was my servant of all work for about thirteen months, at 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—on looking to my stock, I missed some articles—I called in an officer, and desired that the prisoner and my other two servants should come into a private room—I said I had been robbed to a considerable amount, I was satisfied that the thief must live in the house, and asked if they had any objec<lb></lb>tion to have their boxes searched—they all consented—the prisoner pointed</p>

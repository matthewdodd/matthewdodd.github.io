               <p>Q. Do you let part of your house in lodgings? - Yes, the prisoner at the bar had a room there, she took it herself, for herself and her husband, as she said, and a nurse child, that she had then, it was as near as I can recollect a little after Christmas, she continued in it four months, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue till she was taken up in July? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay her rent regularly? - No, she owes me near three pounds for rent.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to pay you? - Three shillings a week, and she pledged a pair of sheets, she did not pay her rent, and she was very noisy and clamorous, and there was a great confusion among my neighbours, saying they would indict my house if she did not go away, and I gave her notice to quit the apartment, a week's notice; on Saturday I went to ask her whether she meant to quit, she said she would not quit it; she slept in a bureau bedstead, I went to the bed and turned down the coverlid of the bed, and missed a sheet and bolster, and I missed a steel sender, I asked her what she had done with them? her answer was, she had pawned them, and how could I help myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise? - No, she told me she had pawned them to buy gin with, and how could I help myself? - I was ashamed to mention it before, then I sent for an officer and gave charge of her, and he took her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask you the liberty to do it, and you said I might if I was distressed, if I would but replace them afterwards? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her any liberty to pawn any thing? - Never.</p>

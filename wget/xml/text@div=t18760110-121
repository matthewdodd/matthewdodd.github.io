On 21st December, about 12.40 a.m., I was in Holborn, near Chancery Lane—a cabman called my attention, and I saw McCarthy on the other side of the way on top of a man who was on his back on the ground—Sullivan had hold of his hands, holding him down—McCarthy had his right hand in the man's left trowsers pocket—Donovan was standing about 6 yards from them—I had seen the three prisoners together several times during the night in Fulwood's Rents, which is nearly opposite—I took hold of McCarthy and threw him on his back, he opened his hand and I heard something like money drop, but I could not find it, because I was shoved about—the man got up and said "You scamps, you have robbed me," and began punching them—I told him not to do that, but to follow up to the station—I had a deal of trouble to hold McCarthy; as soon as I took hold of him Donovan came up and said "You b——, you don't take him, and struck me on the chest—McCarthy went towards Ful<lb></lb>wood's Rents, but I stuck to him by the neck handkerchief, and the crowd pushed me along—when we got nearly opposite Fulwood's Rents McCarthy kicked me—a gentleman who stood fry said "I will help you, <hi rend="italic">Bobby"</hi>—some gentleman fetched two policemen, 152 <hi rend="italic">E</hi> and 104 <hi rend="italic">E</hi>—I could not find the man who was robbed, I think he must have been got away by some one; there was 100 people at least there at the close.</p>

I was with Jessop and saw McCarthy on top of a man who was on the ground, and Sullivan was assisting to hold him down; he had hold of his left hand—I saw Jessop take McCarthy off the man and heard something like money drop from McCarthy's hand on the pavement—I took hold of Sullivan by his right hand and took him off the man who was lying on the ground, who got up and said "You scoundrels" or "scamps, you have robbed me," and struck at the prisoners—I asked him not to do that but to follow us to the station Donovan then came up and tried to rescue McCarthy from Jessop's custody, saying "You b——, you shall not take him to the station"—he afterwards left McCarthy and came and tried to rescue Sullivan from my custody—a very severe struggle ensued in which Sullivan struck me two or three very severe blows in the face, and two gentlemen, who were standing by, assisted me till 152 and 104 <hi rend="italic">E</hi> came up and took Donovan in custody, I still having Sullivan, and with the gentlemen's assistance we took them to the station—I was not aware that the man was not following us there—there was a crowd and several persons, several of whom were women, attempting to rescue the prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' Statements before the Magistrates. McCarthy gays:</hi> "We had been in a public and we had some drink. When we came out we got shoving each other about; one of my mates got knocked down and I was pushed over him. As I got up the first constable said I attempted to rob the man. Eight or nine of us were all larking together ten minutes before the constable came up." <hi rend="italic">Sullivan says:</hi> "I was a little the worse for drink. Seeing a mob I went up. The constable shoved me and said he would lock me up. I said I had done nothing. The constable tore my shirt and coat." <hi rend="italic">Donovan says: "</hi> We were <hi rend="italic">sky</hi> larking altogether. I was a little in front, and turning round I saw three of our mates on the ground and the con<lb></lb>stables ran across the road, and one of them took me to the station. I told them I had done nothing. At the station I told the Inspector the man on the ground was a friend of ours, but I did not know who it was."</p>

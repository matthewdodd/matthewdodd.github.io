                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 380). On 3d June, about half-past in the morning, I was on duty at Carlton-road, Paddington—I heard a noise in the area of No. 4—I went into the garden, and saw the prisoner coming from the area, naked, except his shirt add socks—he rushed across the front garden, got over a wall, and ran away—I ran after him, and found him in custody of another constable—we took him to the station, which took us an hour, as it is three miles—I went back to No. 4, and found marks of violence, and that a coal-plate had been removed at No. 6, and the stone to which it had been fixed in front of the house was taken away—I searched the road the prisoner had run over, and found this gimlet and wax taper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this screw-driver was taken out of the prisoner's hand when I captured him—I searched him, and found a gold albert-chain, and some lucifer-matches, and this rope in his pocket—this knife was found in the front garden, where his clothes were lying under the wall.</p>

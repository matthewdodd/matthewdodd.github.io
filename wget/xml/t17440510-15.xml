            . I have been robbed for several years past of beaver and rabbet's fur, but I could never find the thief till lately. I had a great mistrust of one of my boys, who I took up with a constable with pretty full proof against him, and he impeached his fellow apprentice, the Prisoner, and the Receiver; but he is not taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never take any for your self and sell it?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes, I have acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner ever sell any for you?</p>
               <p>Price. No, I always sold it for him and myself too. - I sold it at four pence halfpeny per ounce.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the fur worth?</p>
               <p>Tredgett. It is worth between 6 d. and 7 d. or about 7 d. an ounce.</p>
               <p>Q. What opinion had you of the boy before Price told you this?</p>
               <p>Tredgett. I thought he was a very honest boy; about an hour before, I had a very good opinion of him; I had no reason to think the contrary. I had a suspicion of Price for some months, and laid a trap to catch him. I was told of it three months ago. <rs id="t17440510-15-verdict85" type="verdictDescription">

Price; but he had no business with the stables. Davis stood below to receive the hay and straw, and he carried away the trusses, one at a time. The prisoners said, what they did was by order of Mr. Bedell, who was the general superintendant of Mr. Price's affairs. Just as the last truss was carrying off, I saw Bedell go down the yard. He used to come to the yard after Davis was turned away from Mr. Price's. Davis had been turned off a few days before; and, not having a new carter, the porter took care of the cart horses till a new carter should be appointed. Bedell has absconded ever since.</p>

             and I are partners in the oil business. Davis had the care of the horses while he lived with me; but had been turned off about ten days before this happened. Merry had nothing to do with the horses; he had been with me but about four or five days. During the time Davis had been turned away, one or other of our porters drove our horses. Davis had lived with me many years before he was turned away. At this time neither Merry or Davis had any thing to do in the stable.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 29th of April Davis gave me charge of Merry. Merry asked, For what am I taken? I said, for stealing hay and straw. He was carried before the Lord Mayor. He first denied the matter: he owned he knew of the affair; and upon second examination he owned he was concerned in the affair; and the hay and straw were carried to a public-house in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>MERRY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I came into the shop, Mr. Price told me that I was to obey Bedell's orders, the same as if he had ordered it himself. Bedell had the general management of the oil business. While I was eating a bit of dinner, in Fox and Knot yard, Bedell called me out: he unlocked the door, and ordered me to throw out the hay and straw, which he said he borrowed. After the hay and straw was flung out, Bedell locked the door again; and he said, Go and help Davis carry it.</p>
               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was discharged from the care of Mr. Price's horses. I was loitering about the stable-yard; Bedell called me down, and desired I would go and carry a tru of hay, and he would give me something to drink. I was never present near the loft till the hay and straw was thrown down in the yard.</p>
               <p>(Merry called four or five witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

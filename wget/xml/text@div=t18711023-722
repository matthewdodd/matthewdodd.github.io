                  </hi>. I am a metal-broker, at Bristol—I have known the prisoner for some time—he was a dealer in sewing-machines at Bristol—on 28th August he brought me this Bill of Exchange—(<hi rend="italic">Read: It was for</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th August, drawn by the prisoner on Wilcox &amp; Gibbs, at two months, and purporting to be accepted by Powers Brothers</hi>)—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, in two payments—there was a small account open between us, and the balance was understood to be on account—he said it was a bill that he was holding from the firm, and he wanted to make use of it—I paid it away—I afterwards saw it again when the prisoner was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no understanding between us that he was to take up the bill, it was given to me as an ordinary bill, without any under<lb></lb>standing at all—he called on me about a week before it came due, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187110230017"></xptr>
               <p>asked if I still had it—I told him I had parted with it; I did not tell him to whom—when he brought it to me he did not ask what I was going to do with it—I did not say that I was going to put it in my cash-box and keep it; nothing of the kind—I have known him three or four years—I had some very small transactions with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Metcalfe &amp; Company, tea-dealers, of 74, Mark Lane—this bill was received by my masters from Mr. Plum—I presented it on 10th October, at the Union Bank, and it was refused.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now sole manager of the Wilcox &amp; Gibbs' Sewing Machine Company, of 150, Cheapside—at one time my brother was joint-manager with me—he ceased to be so subsequent to the time this bill was drawn—the prisoner was formerly a clerk in the service of the Com<lb></lb>pany; latterly he carried on business on his own account, at Bristol—the stamp on this cheque is the regular stamp of the Company; that on the bill is not a stamp of our firm—I had not given the prisoner authority to use or procure such a stamp—this "Powers Brothers" is apparently an imitation of my writing; it is not mine or my brother's—I had not given the prisoner any authority to write my name—up to 10th October I did not know of the bill being in existence—a messenger from the parties holding the bill called at our place of business after it had been presented at the bank, and on seeing it I at once pronounced it to be a forgery—we had no account at the Union Bank at that time—any genuine bill of ours would be accepted, pay<lb></lb>able at our own bankers'—the body of the bill is in the prisoner's writing; at present no one but myself has authority to accept bills; and in August, no one but myself and my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was acting as our sewing machine agent, at Bristol, and has been for some years—the stamp is not imitated cor<lb></lb>rectly—I have been informed that money was deposited at the bank to meet this bill—proceedings in bankruptcy have been initiated by me against the prisoner since this—he was served with a notice in prison by my direction—our agents had not always to pay for the sewing machines in advance; latterly the prisoner had—we have received money from him for sewing machines from time to time since the execution of this bill—I can't be specific as to the dates—I can't say that I did not, about the time the bill was put into circulation, receive from him a sum almost amounting to that, for the purpose of purchasing sewing machines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The bankruptcy proceedings were commenced before his arrest—he is indebted to us about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we hold a promissory-note for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that has been presented and not paid—we required payment in advance from him, as the account was increasing, and we wished to stop it—the promissory-note was dishonoured subsequent to the discovery of this forgery; it is on demand; it was given in the autumn of last year.</p>

               <p>said he wished to take up a bill that would be presented in the course of the day, and he would pay any commission—I told him that we did not do that sort of business—he wished to leave the money with me—I told him that he should advise it from a country banker—he said he would have done so, but it was a mistake—he told me who the drawer of the bill was, but I don't recollect now what he said; he wished to leave me particulars, but I told him it would be of no use, I could not do anything with it—he asked if I could give him the name of any banker in London—I told him I could not do anything of the sort—later in the day the bill was advised by telegram from Croydon, that was after it had been presented.</p>

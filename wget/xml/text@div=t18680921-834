                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 2, Aston Street—on the night this happened, in April, I went to drink at the Wellington—my two sisters were there, one of whom went with me to her house; her husband was in bed—there was a disturbance, and my sister went up for a light, but could not find the candle—this was about 1 o'clock—Michael Barry, the prisoner's father, said something to my sister—she came down and began to talk—I think she had had a drop too much—I was going home, when Michael Barry caught hold of me—he was very drunk—I did not know what he was doing—we both fell—I got up, and the prisoner came before me and struck at me—I said, "Oh, my God, my eye is knocked out"—that was the first I saw of her—she never spoke a word—she does not live in the house, she lives at Bromley—her father lives at the top of the house where my sister lives, and the prisoner had been drinking there—I have lost the sight of my eye, and it has entirely broken me up; I was a strong man before—I had had a drop of beer, but was as sober as I am now—I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen her before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have known her ten or twelve years, but never spoke to her—I had not seen her that night—this happened in a moment—Barry was not near me then—I think he fancied I was my sister's husband, and got hold of me by mistake—there had been a quarrel between my sister and him, but I had not been in the house two minutes—I have never said that Barry did this—my sister gave her husband in custody the same night for hitting her—his name is Hanley—I was once convicted of an assault, five years ago—I drank my share of a pot of beer at the Nag's Head, but not a drop at the Wellington.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—he and I went in there, and we had not been in many minutes when Mrs. Hanley came in with a light, and the prisoner's father refused to give her a light—they began to <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi>—she came down stairs, and my husband said, "Come on home"—as we got to the door, Michael Barry caught hold of him, and they fell—as soon as he got up, the prisoner went up and struck him—he said,</p>

               <p>"My God! my eye is out," and was taken to the hospital—I am sure she is the woman—she had a small thing in her hand, with a small hook at the end, turned at the corner, which was full of blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons were about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven or eight, or there might be a dozen—it was dark; 1 o'clock in the morning—my husband was sober—he drank his share of two pots of beer at the Wellington—I am sure of that—he was standing on the kerb—the prisoner never spoke a word—there were no words between her and my husband—he never spoke two words to her in his life—Mrs. Hanley, his sister, went up with the candle to light it—she had been with us at the Wellington, but for a very few minutes—I do not know any of the persons who were present when my husband was struck—nobody else has been in custody on this charge—the prisoner was given in custody at Arbour Square, and again when my hus<lb></lb>band came out of the hospital—I had given evidence against her, and so had Tye, and after that she was discharged—Tye is a man who will do any<lb></lb>thing for drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Labrum, in Tottennam-court-road—he has another shop in St. Martin's-court. Between five and six o'clock on the evening of the 5th of May, the prisoner came to the shop in Tottenham-court-road, and bought a pair of half-crown shoes—when she went away the boy told me she had taken this pair of shoes—I told him to follow her—he did, and in half or three-quarters of an hour he returned with a pair of patent leather shoes, which were the property of James Labrum. I took the boy and constable to 16, Devonshire-street—I had not sold them—she had taken away the shoes she bought.</p>

I was in the parlour between five and six o'clock evening, when the prisoner came into he shop—I did not see her sit down—I had my back towards her—she was fitting shoes in my pre<lb></lb>sence—I turned round and saw her take a pair of shoes off a nail on a rail of shoes that hung over her head as she sat down—she put them down as she sat, under her cloak, or on the form by her side—I gave in<lb></lb>formation when she went out, and Mr. M'Cullock directed me to go after her—I overtook her at the corner of Grafton-street—I said, "I believe you are the person who bought a pair of shoes at the Noah's Ark just now?" she said, "No, I am not"—I saw her go out of the shop, and I only knew her by her bonnet—I did not see her face in the shop—I asked her to come back—she said, "No, I can't—I am in a hurry. I followed her to 16, Devonshire-street, Portland-place—she knocked at the door—I got between her and the door, and said I thought she had a pair of shoes, and she must give them me up before she went in—she dropped one of them—it was a patent leather shoe—I will not swear it was one of these, but it was one of this kind—she then picked it up and put it under her cloak, and gave me the pair from under her cloak—I took them home to my master s—the shopman afterwards took me with him to the house, and told me to go and get a policeman—I went to her house—when I went inside I heard her say something to Mr. M'Cullock—I cannot tell you the words she said, and I would not like to say any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Church-row. The prisoner was in my employ four weeks—I gave her two shillings a-week at the end of two weeds, to get some shoes—on the 16th, I missed half a sovereign out of my desk, and two half-crowns at other times—on the 25th, I said to "What did you say your name was, Mary!" she said "Sarah Bridges," or Bridger; and I said, "You have robbed me, you wholesale thief; are you not ashamed of yourself, you wretch!" she said, "Me, Ma'am!"—I said, "What have you done with my half sovereign, and two half-crowns?"she said, "They are in my box, locked up, up-stairs; forgive me, O, forgive me!" I will forgive you, as for as the law will allow; you wretch?"—she pretended to be sick, and I said, "Go into the yard"—she went into the passage, and ran away; I ran after her—she was brought back—the officer found a half-sovereigns and two half-crowns in her box, which I believe are mine.</p>

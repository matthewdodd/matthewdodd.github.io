               <p>ROBERT SNELLIN. On the evening in question, I had been to the Elephant and Castle, and I saw a crowd in Holborn, and followed it to the watchhouse. Then the prisoner came out of the watchhouse, and asked me to come and have something to drink. I went to <placeName id="t18160918-196-crimeloc1016">Cribb's wine-vaults</placeName>

I took out my handkerchief, and put it on my knee, and she put it into her pocket, before my face; I asked her for it immediately, and she told me to hold my tongue; and after that, we came out; we then walked down Southampton-buildings; there I insisted upon having my handkerchief; she said she had not got it, and she supposed it was at Cribb's wine-vaults. I went back to see if it was, and it was not. I returned, and told her so; she had then got as far as Chancery-lane, where she turned down. I kept talking to her, and asking her for my handkerchief, and at last she put her hand into my left hand breeches pocket, and took out a one-pound note and several shillings. I called the watch, who took her into custody.</p>

I asked her to open her hand, that we might see what was in it; she would not allow me; she forced her hand from me, and pushed it under; I pulled her arm back, and found the one-pound note; she dropped it. The handkerchief we could not find.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hart-street, Covent-garden. On Sunday morning, the 22nd of January, between three and four o'clock, I was pro<lb></lb>ceeding towards home and was accosted by Hill, who wished me to ac<lb></lb>company and six company her home—I refused several times, and walked about one hundred yards towards home—she followed me, and persuaded me to go back with her—she took me down a court at the bottom of Bases-street, Whitechapel—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and before I had been in the room two minutes, she called up the prisoner Page, who demanded more money from of me, which I refused to give her—she said if I did not give it her she would call her father—I still refused, and said if they did not let me go then I should go to the window, and call a policeman—one of them followed me to the window, and said if I offered to make any alarm I should be thrown out—I refused to give them any more money on any consideration, and wished to go—they then called up East, they put their backs to the door, and refused to allow me to go down stain—they called out to somebody on the outside to hold the door, and said I should not go till I gave them more money—I took what silver 1 had out of my pocket, and kept it in my hand—it was a half-crown piece, and two shillings—the two shillings were taken out of my hand first; I cannot say by which, there was so much confu<lb></lb>sion—the half-crown was then forced out of my hand by East—I lost 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the same time, but whether I gave it them I cannot say—I was as sober as possible—they then opened the door and said I might go—I was just stooping down, and received a shove, whether it was done intentionally I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi>. He gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never used any bad language to him—I was not in the room when he was robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Page</hi>. He gave me half-a-crown to stop with him all night. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I refused to stop there all night, time after time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 60.) The prosecutor took me to Brigg's-court, Essex-street, about five o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 22nd of January, and pointed out East as the person who forcibly took half-a-crown from him—he described the other two, and I left their de<lb></lb>scription at the station-house—they were afterwards taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 150.) I went with the prosecutor to Brigg's-court on Sunday morning between six and seven o'clock—he complained to me of being robbed of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he pointed out Hill as she stood by the fire, and said she was one that had robbed him in the morning in that house—on taking her to the station-house, she told me she had not robbed the man, that he had accompanied her home and had given her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to another girl, who was not in custody—nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hill's Defence</hi>. What the prosecutor says is false—I went home with him—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went out to get something to drink, and when I returned he was gone—I heard the other prisoners were charged with robbery, and I said I would stop to see if I was charged with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 7, Pier Street, Deptford—the de<lb></lb>ceased, Timothy Shean, worked for me two days last year, and I knew him by sight—on 2nd August I was in the White Hart public-house, Deptford—the deceased came in and went to the back, and the prisoner came in and asked for two gallons of beer—the publican said "Won't one gallon be sufficient!" the deceased said "So it will be sufficient for the time"—the prisoner said "No, I have won one gallon in a wager, and another gallon we want to take to the ship's crew"—the deceased said "I will pay you that gallon in the afternoon, when we knock off work"—the prisoner said no, he should pay it then—the deceased used some foul expression, and the prisoner threatened to hit him—the deceased took off his jacket, and as he did so, the prisoner got outside, and the publican and my mate both stood up trying to keep the deceased inside, and then the prisoner came in again, and as he come in the deceased would go out—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> my mate one way, and the publican the other, and went out—I then went out, and they collared each other and both came to the ground, alongside the kerb stone—my com<lb></lb>panion lifted the deceased and the prisoner got up—they stood up in the road, and as they came at each other, the prisoner hit the deceased some<lb></lb>where underneath the jaw with his open hand—the deceased reeled about the road and fell—my companion picked him up and stood him in</p>

I live at 15, New King Street, Deptford—on 2nd August I was with Connor at the White Hart, and saw the deceased come in—while he was at the back, the prisoner came in, and asked for two gallons of beer; the landlord said that one gallon would be sufficient, and the deceased said that one gallon would be sufficient—the prisoner said "I have won one gallon of you, and you ought to pay it to me"—the deceased said "I shall pay you in the afternoon, after leaving off work"—the prisoner said "You cannot get money sitting down in a public-house; I want 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-night"—the deceased used foul language, and the prisoner said "If you use that language, I shall hit you"—the prisoner said "That was before you bought your shovel; I will fight you"—the deceased took off his coat, the prisoner went out, and the landlord and I kept the deceased in—the prisoner came in, and then the deceased went out—I attempted to keep the prisoner in, but he got out and joined the deceased—I went between them, and said "You are working mates together, do not fight, you will be sorry for it to-morrow"—they told me to stand clear, which I did—they took each other round the body, and both fell on the kerb—I picked the deceased up, and said "Don't you fight any more"—he said that he should have another round—the prisoner got up by himself, and they got in contact again, and the prisoner threw the deceased across the road—he got up again, and I said "Don't have any more"—he said "Yes, I shall have another go"—they sparred up together, and the prisoner caught him a blow here, (<hi rend="italic">on the side of his face</hi>), and the deceased reeled round—I caught hold of him, and he said, while he was reeling, "Where is my cap?"—I said "Your clothes are across the road, at the public-house"—I let him go, and he fell on his face and hands, and got scratched on his face and forehead—he could not get up—they brought some water, and washed his face, and we took him into the tap room.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Cleveland Street, Deptford—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on Timothy Shean, and found a rupture of the internal jugular vein, producing a large clot of blood, lying immediately on the commencement of the spinal marrow, and causing instantaneous death—a blow, such as I have heard described, would cause that injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was an abrasion on the tip of the nose, and the right eye was thoroughly blackened, there was no external mark under the ear, but a blow must have been struck under the ear, to produce what I saw—if he fell on a stone in the road, that would produce the same result—I saw him two days afterwards; all the vessels of the brain were then congested, and there was beer in the stomach—drink would render the vessels more liable to be injured on receiving a blow or a fall.</p>

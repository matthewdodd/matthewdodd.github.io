On the 6th of September, my shopman shewed me a number of vacant pidgeon-holes in the shop; I replied, you very likely have sold them; no, he said, he had not. He remarked there was one particular kind of hinges; almost all of them were gone. I took a strip of paper, and marked every one of the pigeon-holes, with the goods it contained on the paper. In about half an hour, I compared the paper with the pigeon-holes in the shop, and three papers were gone, each containing a gross of screws. The prisoner was my <rs id="t18140914-157-deflabel879" type="occupation">porter</rs>

I followed the prisoner when he went out, and found these goods upon him, my property. I followed the prisoner out in the evening, and found these goods upon him; here are three gross of screws, a paper of hinges, and a paper of brads; he had them at various parts of his body. In the evening when he went out, he throwed his coat over his shoulder, to avoid detection. I knew he had some of my property upon him I know them to be mine; they had the shop marks upon them, and they were the papers which I took notice of in the former part of the day.</p>

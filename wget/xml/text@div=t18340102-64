               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK PRICE. I am clerk to Francis Weedon - he has no partner - he carries on business in <placeName id="t18340102-64-crimeloc357">Wood-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had he been in the service? A. About four years to my recollection - he is married, and has three children - he occasionally receives 20s. a-week - I believe his wages were 22s. - it is customary for servants to have any goods they wish by paying for them, with permission of any person in the warehouse - he was not taken into custody before he had time to mention it to the clerk at the desk - I was concealed there three quarters of an hour - another clerk came in, and the prisoner was sent out on a short errand, while I came out of the closet - the officer was not there when he returned - the officer came about five o'clock - there was no inquiry made of him till the officer came - the warehouse was light- it was daylight - I was about ten yards from him - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020036"></xptr>could have given an account of it to me afterwards, as I had come out while he was on the errand, and was in the warehouse when he came back; and he could have given an account of it to the clerk who sent him out - it might be more than an hour after he returned that he was taken into custody - he was kept in the warehouse - I cannot say how he was employed - he was in the warehouse more than an hour- he was sent out by Mr. Weedon a second time - the officer was then outside, and took him into custody - this article is lace or bobbin quilling - they are the same thing- there is bobbin net quilling - it is all one - I don't know why it is called quilling - it is net work - bobbin net is a wider description of the same thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it not lace without any edge to it? A. Without any embroidery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it known in the trade by the name of quilling net? A. It is bobbin quilling net, and quilling net.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY. I am a constable of Worship-street - in consequence of information from Mr. Weedon, I stationed myself opposite the house on Friday, the 13th of December, and saw the prisoner come out of the door from the warehouse - I suffered him to go eight or ten steps to the corner of Goldsmith-street, and laid hold of him - he said, "What do you want?" - I said, "I take you into custody on suspicion of committing a felony" - I took him to a warehouse below Mr. Weedon's, and in one breeches pocket I found this piece of quilling wrapped in blue paper, and in the other pocket the other piece - I asked him to account how it came there - he was very agitated, and gave no answer; but as he left the warehouse he said to Mr. Weedon, "I hope you will think of my wife and three children" - he had not said before whose property it was - Mr. Weedon shook his head - I don't think he made a reply - on the way to the office in a coach, he said to Mr. Weedon, "Mr. Weedon, I hope you will forgive me."</p>
               <p>Mr. FRANCIS WEEDON. The prisoner has been in my service as <rs id="t18340102-64-deflabel358" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any other Christian name? A. No; nor any partner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the parcel from which the net was taken? A. I did, and found the quantity deficient- this piece corresponded with what was in the parcel, and makes the quantity correct - the property is mine.</p>

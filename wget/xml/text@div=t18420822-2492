                  </hi>. I am assistant to Richard Thornton Perkins, a pawnbroker, at Chelsea. On the 6th of August, about five minutes be<lb></lb>fore one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the counter—I asked what she wanted—she said, Nothing, she was only standing out of the rain—I said, "Very well, we don't charge anything for that"—I walked to the end of the shop—I returned, and missed her, and the shawl which had been hanging about three yards from the door, inside the shop—it had done raining when I first spoke to her—she was only in the shop two minutes after I spoke to her—I went after her—she went into a public-house eight or ten doors off—I followed her—she turned rather pale—I said to the bar-man, "Will you detain this woman a minute?"—she ran out of the other door—I saw the shawl concealed between herself and her child—she ran round Sloane-square—this is the shawl.</p>

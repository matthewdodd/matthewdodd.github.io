                  </hi>. I am a publican out of business, and live at Whitefriars, close to the Temple. On the night of the 17th of January, I went to the west end of the town, and looked at several houses which</p>

               <p>were to let—on my return, the prisoner accosted me at the corner of Castle-street—she said, "I believe I have the pleasure of knowing you"—I said, "You have the advantage of me"—she said, "Which way are you going?"—I said, "To the city "—we walked on—she said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "To a public-house "—she said there was a nice house opposite, where there was a pawnbroker's at one corner of a turning and a public-house at the other—she took me to it—I did not like it—we came on, and went to Great Wild-street—we went to a public-house, and called for a glass of gin-and-water—I went out to look at another house—when I came back, the glass was empty, and we had some more—we went some distance, and went into another house, where I represented her as my wife, and we had another glass of gin-and-water—we went on till we got near my home—I said, "Will you have any more before we part?"—she said, "I have no objection"—I turned to go to another house, I got to the lobby, and she was gone—I walked home, and when I was going to bed I missed my watch.</p>

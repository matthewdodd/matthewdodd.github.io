                  </hi>. I am a bell-hanger, and live at Breadth-court, Borough—between seven and eight o'clock last Saturday evening I was in Lant-street—the prisoner French spoke to me, and said, "Well, old boy"—I said, "I don't know that I have any knowledge of you"—he afterwards seized hold of my hand—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand, and he tried to get the money out of my hand—while he was doing so the prisoner Hill came and put his hand round my neck—he was at the back of me—I called out "Thieves 1" as loud as I could, and two officers, who were just on the spot, seized them as I was sinking—I dropped 28., whether it was taken out of my hand or whether it dropped in the scuffle I cannot say—I lost a hat, a cap, and a. handkerchief and a piece of paper, a specification of a job that I was work<lb></lb>ing for—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think it was in my waistcoat pocket.</p>

Last Saturday night, about a quarter to eight, I saw the two prisoners and two others follow the prosecutor from Blackman-street up Lant-street, which is a dark street—from what I saw I followed them—they went about forty yards up a street where there is a dark corner—I saw two of them press upon the prosecutor and be cried out—I saw French lay hold of his arm as if he was trying to wrench something from it—and another person, I am not sure whether it was Hill, put his arm round his neck—I at once took hold of French—he threw something away—to the best of my belief it was the piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I am not sure—the witness Brischlayer took hold of Hill at the same time—the other two ran in the direction of Mint-street—we took the prisoners to the station—I told the prosecutor to follow us—I asked him what he had lost, and told him to search carefully to see whether he</p>

               <p>had lost anything—he counted his money, and said, "I have lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Anything else?"—lie said, "Yes, a handkerchief, and my cap and hat is gone"—I then searched the prisoners and told Brischlayer to go back to the place where this occurred with a lamp, and see what he could find—he returned with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a cap, a handkerchief, and this paper, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

I was with the last witness, and saw the prosecutor turn into Lant-street, followed by the two prisoners and two others—they were running after him—I saw the struggle between the four men and the prosecutor—I ran up and caught hold of Hill by the collar, and just at that time I saw French throw away a cap and handker-chief—I picked them up and put them in my pocket—I took Hill on one side with my left hand and placed him within three or four yards from where the struggle took place, and said to him, "You ought to know better, a lot of you to assault an old man like that"—he said, "What have you got hold? of me for?"—I said, "I shall take you to the station for assaulting him"—I saw his left hand move, and I heard a jingling on the pavement—I after<lb></lb>wards went back to that place with a lantern, and found these 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. very close together, and this piece of paper by the side of them—at the time I first came up Hill had his right arm round the prosecutor's neck, and French was standing in front of him—they were very violent indeed—the prose<lb></lb>cutor could hardly speak when he first got up.</p>

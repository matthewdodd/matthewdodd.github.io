               <p>I am a noon tender of the port of London to attend two hours on the keys and take all charges, during the tide waiters and weighers absence, I was upon duty on the 1st of June, at Ralph's key, at the tobacco scale; I saw the prisoner White several times without the scale, attending that day, the prisoner Sawyer was employed at work that day as a <rs id="t17850629-8-deflabel42" type="occupation">cooper</rs>

               <p>Court. If he is not here you cannot identify the tobacco? - White weighed the tobacco by a little pair of steel-yards, then he put it down on the ground, then I said to White, hand me that tobacco.</p>
               <p>Court. You heard no conversation pass then between White and Sawyer? - No, my Lord, I saw him give it him, White threw it over the settle to me, and said damn you, if you will have it, take it; I took it up, I directly took him to the Compter, Sawyer made out of the public house, I have seen him on the keys for this year and half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sawyer. He went into the house with me, I asked him to go and drink a glass with me.</p>

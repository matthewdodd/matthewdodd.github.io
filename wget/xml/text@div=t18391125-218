               <p>what he had got—he made no reply—I took this pot from under hit arm, and asked what he was going to do—he said to get some oil in it to take to Bayswater, for a gentleman whose horse had fallen down and thrown him out of a chaise—I said it was a queer thing to get oil in a quart pot, and asked him where he was going to take it to at Bayswater—he said to No. 9, but he did not know who lived there—I took him to the station-house—in going along, he said he would give me any thing I liked if I would let him go, as it would ruin his character—at the station-house he said he had worked for a person named Tubb, a milk-man, in the New-road—I took a half-sovereign from him and a letter.</p>

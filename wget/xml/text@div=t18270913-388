Previous to the 10th of September, I had levied a distress on Mr. Hipworth, of No. 25, New-road, St. George's in the East, for 18l.; I took the prisoner to the house on the 10th of September, and left him in charge with the warrant, and ordered him not to go out or be turned out till the money was paid, which was then 9l.; I called next morning, and saw him at breakfast, and said I understood he had received the money; he said he had; I said, "Let me have it:" he said, "I'll be back in a few minutes;" he went out, and did not return; I saw him next day at the Ship and Shears public-house; he then said he had lost the money, and I must take it by instalments; he has not paid any of it - I took him two days ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You rejected his offer, and took proceedings? A. I made no reply; he lived in a tenement of mine - he is a coal-whipper - he did not say he had lost it when I went to the house.</p>

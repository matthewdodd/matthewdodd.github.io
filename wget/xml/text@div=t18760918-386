                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi> 711). On 13th July, I was in company with Kenniston, another officer, watching the prosecutors' premises—about 1.15 I saw Hopkins standing at Mr. Benjamin's shop door—Stroud went up and spoke to him—they both went into the warehouse for about two or three minutes, when Hopkins returned to the door alone, he looked up and down the street, then turned round sideways and Stroud passed him, and came out with a salmon in his right hand; he was carrying it by the head, openly exposed—Hopkins looked after him as he went up the street, and then looked up and down—Stroud crossed the street, bought a mat basket and put the salmon in—he was at that time followed by Kenniston, I was in front—Stroud came towards me and passed me, I went after him and stopped him—I said "Where did you get this salmon from"—he said "Harry Marshall, Stevenson's"—I said "Where?"—he said "Down here"—pointing in the direction from whence he had come—I said "Mr. Steven-son has no premises there, and Harry Marshall has no power to give you salmon"—he said "Come down here"—I said "No, you will go to the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I was about 30 yards from the door when I saw Hopkins come and stand at it; I was moving to and fro, it is a large warehouse, not a shop for the display of fish; there is only one entrance to the warehouse, there is a side door leading upstairs to the office—a person called <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> is employed there by Mr. Harris.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. Stroud knew me perfectly well, and knew I was a detective—I found some money in his pocket; I don't know how much, Mr. Pegg said it was his, and it was given up to him with. Stroud's consent—I have known the prisoners about six years—I was employed by Mr. Benjamin to watch this warehouse door—Mr. Pegg gives Stroud a good character—his present employer is Mr. Dearsley, a son of Mr. Dearsley, of the Court of Common Council, who was bail for him—I don't consider that he answered me readily or straightforward; I asked him three times where he got the salmon, before he answered me, and he first said Marshall gave it him, and then Hopkins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head salmon warehouseman, to Mr. George Stevenson, of Billingsgate—I did not on 13th July directly or indirectly authorise Stroud to get for me, or on my account or credit, a salmon from Messrs. Myers &amp; Co.—he did not speak to me about it—I never gave him any salmon, or any order for it—I did not see him that morning, I was at home.</p>

I have known him a good many years—he used to work under me a few years ago—I have not been in the habit of sending to Moss Benjamin's for salmon on my own account—I have not on previous occasions sent there for salmon to give to Stroud—I said at the police-court that I gave him one three years ago—I did not say "I have got salmon from Myers and others to give to Stroud and paid for them"—I said "My master would—not always sell me a single salmon, except at the retail shop"—Stroud had not been assisting me shortly before this, I might have seen him a day or two before—I have asked Mr. Benjamin to let me have three or four salmon, and paid for them before I took them away; perhaps I have done so once or twice a year—I don't believe I sent to him for a salmon on 8th July last, I can't remember, but I am pretty well sure I did not—Mr. Benjamin always refuses to let you have it unless you pay the money first.</p>

I am a fish factor at 80, Lower Thames Street—Hop<lb></lb>kins has been in our employ about tea years, his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—Osborn made a communication to me and I went back to Hopkins—there is a person calling himself <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> employed by Mr. Harris, a salesman, who has part of my warehouse—it is a very large warehouse, the entrance is nearly as large the Jury box; Mr. Harris does not sell salmon.</p>

Mr. Harris has the back part of the warehouse, he uses it for empty packages—Hopkins was my foreman, there would be two other men in the warehouse with him; they were not there at that time—I superintend the business myself—most of the fish had come in that morning, some of the salmon comes in boxes and some we buy from other salesmen—a record is kept of what is bought—the boxes contain so many, the number is not marked outside, there are invoices telling us how many there are.</p>

I have known Stroud some time and believed him to be a respectable man—some two years ago Mr. Marshall was in the habit of getting small quantities of fish at our place; he had to obtain my express permission—when he did have it, it was weighed and booked to him—if he had sent for it unknown to me I should not have allowed it—he sent for a salmon on the Saturday previous to this, and I refused t, let him have it; his son came for it—I can't say whether Hopkins was on the premises at that time—we only buy and consign wholesale, we very seldom sell a single salmon—Stroud was very frequently in the habit of coming to our warehouse, when he had to carry fish, or when he came to <hi rend="italic">Dick;</hi> there was nothing unusual in his coming.</p>

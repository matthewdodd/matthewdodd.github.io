                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Barber, wharfinger, of Brewer's-quay. On Tuesday morning, the 27th of Aug., I saw the prisoner going up the quay with two cheeses under his frock, and one, or part of one, inside—I followed him up Thames-street, stopped him, and asked him to come back to Mr. Barber's wharf—he said he would give me the I cheeses if I would let him go—Peters came up in the meantime, and he struck him with his fist, and me with a brickbat in the forehead—it was a heavy blow—a policeman came up, and secured him—I was holding him to detain him for stealing the cheeses, when he struck me with the brick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Joseph Barber, at Brewer's-quay. I saw the witness stop the prisoner, who had two cheeses with him—he struck Daniels with a brickbat on the head, which bled a good deal, but I do not think it cut very deep—the cheeses belonged to my master, and were taken from a vessel alongside.</p>

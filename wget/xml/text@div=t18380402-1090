                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Milner and Son, lead merchants, of 49, Crispin-street, Spitalfields. On Monday, the 26th of March, the female prisoner brought a quantity of lead <hi rend="italic">to</hi> my master's premises for sale—she put it down, and said she would leave it, as she had more to bring—I had bought lead of her before, and of the male prisoner, who is her hus<lb></lb>band—he keeps a marine-store shop—my master had lost about 600lbs. of lead off his flat on Sunday night, or Monday morning—about 14lbs. of the the female prisoner brought, appeared like what we had lost—there are spots of paint on it by which I can identify it—I fitted it to the flat, and found it corresponded—I gave information to the police, and Sergeant Teakle produced some other lead to me, which I also identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I got information, and went to the prosecutor's warehouse, and found the lead had been stolen—I compared the lead which they gave me with the flat, and found it cor<lb></lb>responded—in consequence of information I went with Teakle, to No. 4, Nelson-street, Bethnal-green, which is a marine-store shop, kept by the prisoner—the prisoners were both there—I asked the female whether she had been out that morning—she said, yes, she had—I asked if she had been to Crispin-street—she said she had—I asked if she had been to Mr. Milner—she said yes, that her husband sent her there, and she was going to take some more—the male prisoner said he had a book in which he was in the habit of entering every thing he bought, but in the present instance he did not make any entry of it—that he had purchased it that morning of some person, who he did not know—he handed me the book, and there was no entry of it—I searched the house, and found some lead, which Teakle has.</p>

I am a police-sergeant On Monday morning, the 26th of March, I went to search the prisoner's house, and found the lead—I went there directly after examining the premises with Power, and found sack on the counter with lead in it—I asked the male prisoner what he had there, and where he got it from—he said he bought it out that morn<lb></lb>ing—I asked him who he bought it of—he said he did not know—I asked if he kept a book to make entries—he said yes, but he had not entered that—I compared the lead found in the sack with Mr. Milner's flat, and the marks where it was cut off corresponded—I found it in the prisoner's Possession, about an hour and a half after the robbery was committed.</p>

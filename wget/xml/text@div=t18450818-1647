                  </hi>. I live in Theobald's-park, Enfield—the prisoner was in ray service as a wheelwright—on Saturday, the 12th of July, he was there, and said he wanted to go away early—I paid him one day's wages on that day, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not pay him for the half day on which he went—he had been paid in the course of that week, saying he was short of money—he went away about twelve o'clock that day—I told him I would get him to leave a note at Messrs. Reynolds and Smith's, corn dealers, Enfield, as he went home, and he said he would—I gave him a note with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in it, of which I kept the number—it was 93,631—I directed the note to Messrs. Reynolds and Smith, and sealed or wafered it up—he took it and went away—on Monday I came to Lon-don and called on Messrs. Reynolds and Smith, and in consequence of what they said to me I afterwards spoke to the prisoner and asked him why he had not delivered the note I gave him—he laid he supposed he had lost it—the police are in the habit of coming to my yard every now and then, and one of them named Hoppy came at that time into my room where the prisoner was—I told him the circumstance, and wrote to the Bank of Eng-land to stop the payment of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note—the prisoner came afterwards to my house—he said it was a bad job, he had lost the note, and asked me to let him work it out—this is the note which I gave the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it has my writing on it—it is No. 93,681.</p>

I keep the Rose and Crown at Enfield-highway—on a Saturday, about a month ago I saw the prisoner in my house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—he had some refreshment, for which he paid me—he pulled out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note from his pocket—it was in a piece of paper—he said, "A man with a ragged coat can carry a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, as well as a man with a good coat"—I had the note in my hand and looked at it—he then took it, <hi rend="italic">nipped</hi> it up in the paper, and put it into his pocket—the omnibus came up, and he got into it to go to<lb></lb>wards London.</p>

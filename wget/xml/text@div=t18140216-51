            . I live at No. 10, Adam and Eve-court, in the parish of St. Luke's. I was in the public-house in the court a little before one o'clock in the morning, a row ensured in the public-house passage between two girls of the town. I was in the bar at the time, and in consequence of the girls fighting one of them laid in the passage for dead. There were several more people there in the passage. It was a passage leading into the street. The door was shut, and no one assisted the girl that was laying on the floor. I went to assist her up. After I lifted her up the prisoner was on the left hand side of me; he was the only man that was on that side of the passage. I felt my watch go from me; I found it was gone. I looked, and I saw it in the prisoner's hand. I told him to give me the watch, or I would charge the watchman with him. He gave the watch to a female that came up to the door to him; the watchman came in; I gave him charge of the prisoner; the watchman found the watch behind the door where the female put it. The constable has the watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went into this public-house; I found the watch on the steps behind the door. I delivered it to Cleveland the constable. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch by the prisoner; he pointed him out to me. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I unfortunately had been out of a situation for eighteen weeks, in the course of that time I distressed myself and wife, I had parted with every thing except what I had on and my wife too, I was turned out of my lodgings, and with difficulty I procured for her a place with a friend; I was two or three nights out in the street, after that I was in an alone garret; I was taken for a small debt and put in Tothill-fields where I was released out by a benevolent society, I came out and was with my wife in a starving garret, in an unfortunate hour I took the desk, I am conscious of the impropriety of my conduct, I am unfeignedly sorry for it.</p>

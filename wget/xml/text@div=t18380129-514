                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and am the brother of Ann Muckleston. My sister became acquainted with the prisoner in the year 1826—my father was sub-chanter of Litchfield Cathedral—he and his family were then residing at Wellesbourne, in War<lb></lb>wickshire, but at the time the prisoner became acquainted with her, they were at Leamington—that acquaintance led to a marriage between the pri<lb></lb>soner and my sister, which I performed at the church at Wellesbourne, in Warwickshire—the parties were the prisoner and my sister Ann—I have not been living from home lately—I last saw my sister about three or three and a half years ago—she was residing with my father just before the marriage—I was not part of the family—I was living in Litchfield—I saw my sister in London—it might be about four or five weeks after the marriage—I believe they were married on the 15th of June, 1826—I saw her again about a couple of months after the marriage—she has remained under my father's roof from that time—my father has not remained in the same place from that time till now—he has been from ill health travelling from place to place, and is now in Devonshire—my sister has lived under his roof, where he has been—if any body inquired at Wellesbourne there was no difficulty in finding if she were alive—her family were perfectly well known—in consequence of circumstances after this marriage, a divorce was obtained at the instance of the family, <hi rend="italic">a mensa et toro,</hi> and we lost sight of the prisoner from that time to this—we had no certain intelligence of him since two or three months after the marriage—my sister returned home very ill.</p>

I am a police-constable attached to the Post Office—in consequence of something that had taken place, I was watching the place where the coats were hung—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to Mr. John Gardner, who is employed in the Post Office—on last Saturday even<lb></lb>ing, the 25th January, about twenty minutes to six, the prisoner came down into the passage—he loitered for a minute where the coats were hung, took this one down, and put it on—he was going away as fast as he could, when I stopped him and said, "Is that your coat you arc putting on?"—he seemed very much surprised at the moment and said, "Oh! no, I forgot; I left my coat in the cart"—I said, "What cart do you mean?"—he said, "The T cart that is standing now in the yard opposite the lobby door; I go backwards and forwards to Lombard Street"—I told him it was not the first coat that had been taken, and he said it was the first he had taken—I took him into my room, and then went to the cart—I found a coat on the driver's seat, which has since been identified as one stolen from the same place—I had procured Mr. Gardner's coat for the pur<lb></lb>pose—the prisoner seemed to come from the direction of the yard into the office—he did not go anywhere, only loitered about and took the coat.</p>

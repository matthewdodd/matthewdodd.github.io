               <p>Q. About six o'clock you had some information - A. Yes; I looked, and found it was gone. I saw the piece of cloth at

            . I live at 17, Whitecross-street. I am beadle of Cripplegate. On the 14th of January, as I was coming from Guildhall about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner carrying a large bundle in a suspicions manner; I challenged him where he was going to carry it to; he said, Drury-lane. I was sure he would never carry it to Drury-lane in the slovenly manner he had it, it was not packed up as if in the fair course of business. I asked him where he brought it from; he said the water side. I asked him whether he brought it from Mr. Maberleys. the clothier; he first said, yes, and afterwards he did not give me any direct answer, he said somebody gave it him to carry from the water side. I stopped him and took him before the sitting Alderman. This is the piece of cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Dank-street, Whitechapel—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—his mother kept a boy of mine for two or three months—I did not think they were doing right to my boy, and I took him away on Monday, 14th, about half-past 4 or 5—at 8 o'clock the same evening, I went up stairs for the boy's coat at their house—they said nothing then, but gave me the coat very civilly—no more happened until about ten minutes past 1 on the next morning, when the prisoner came to my house—he knocked at the door—I was sitting on the side of the bed, in the act of stripping myself—I said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is me"—I knew him by the voice, and I opened the door and let him in—he asked me very civilly whether I would give him Jemmy, meaning my boy—I said, "No, it is too late; come in the morning, and you shall have him"—he said no more, but walked out—his mother was on the stairs, kicking up a row while he was in the room—I went down to let the mother out, and asked her what she was kicking up this row for—she went out first into the street; I was second, and the</p>

               <p>prisoner was behind me—the moment I went into the street, I received a blow in the mouth from the prisoner—no words were used, to my recollection—I followed him, and received another blow on the side of the ear—we fell to the ground, and on the ground I received a blow on the left side, and that is all I recollect—when I recovered, two policemen were helping me up—I was standing at the time I recovered—one of the policemen turned on his lantern, and said I was stabbed—I was afterwards attended by a surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you take your boy away for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought they did not do right to him—he will be three years old on 15th July—I have asked them several times to take care of the boy, and taken him away several times—the prisoner was not at home when I took him away—I took him away at 4 o'clock, and went for the coat at 8—I had been asleep when the prisoner came to my room—I woke up and began to undress—I had somebody with me in the room—it was a female, not my wife—she is my wife now—I had been at work up to a quarter past 11, and this female had had the boy out for a walk—I do not say I was sober—I had been to a public-house next door—the female had had something to drink, but she was quite sober—I have never had a room in Whitechapel before—this man is a respectable man in my opinion—he does not keep his mother—his mother many a time keeps him—she is a tailoress, and he is a tailor—they keep each other partly—I did not use some very strong language to him when he came to the door—I did not say I would break his neck down the stairs, if he did not go away—I might have said so after I was struck—every time he struck me he ran away—I did not try to shove him out when he came to the door—I went down strairs to close the door after them—I dare say the door was open when they came in—I did not open it—it is sometimes left open all night through neglect—I did not see a knife in his hand—I heard the mother calling me—she was taken upon this charge, and discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker of 3, Dank-street, Mile-end—I heard a great noise on this occasion about 1 o'clock—I went up to it—I stood outside my door—when I came just round the corner, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor having a round, and I saw the prisoner hare a knife in his hand—both of them fell down, and the prisoner gave the prosecutor a out down his cheek—he had the knife between his fingers—I hallooed out directly that he had got a knife in his hand—he was looking at me, and I was afraid, and went away to see if I could see a policeman—I saw a policeman, and told him that the prisoner had a knife—when he saw me speak to the policeman, he went away—he dropped the knife on the cellar-flap of the Three Crowns public-house—some one else picked it up—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am a surgeon at 2, Spital-square—I ex<lb></lb>amined the prosecutor at the police-station—he had received a deep incised wound, extending four or five inches down to the muscle in front of the right ear, and another deep incised wound below the jaw—there was an incised wound opening his nose, and various punctured wounds about his arms and on his legs—he was saturated in blood, and much exhausted—this knife is a very likely weapon to inflict them, except that I should have thought that the one on the back of the neck was inflicted by a larger blade than this—this might inflict it, but I should have thought it would have been a larger one.</p>

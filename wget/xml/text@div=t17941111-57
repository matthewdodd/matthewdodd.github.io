             had taken place, I understood that a report was prevalent among the lodgers in the house, and other persons, that Pynor was a married man, and I understood of this having been mentioned to him.</p>

             and Pynor, that I should go as soon as convenient, to the public funds, in order that a transfer might be made of her property, either in whole or in part; she had remaining one hundred and fifty pounds, in the three per cent reduced.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, had you any communication with Pynor, and what did he say? - At the time I was to make the transfer, being also in possession of this suspicious circumstance, I thought it necessary to enquire about it; I traced from place to place, till at last I went to St. Martin's; I found it out by references, which had been given me; and after searching the books for four or five years back, I found the entry you have now heard; this being the case, I thought it my duty not to go with them to the funds, I had intimated that the beginning of the week would suit me to go; I had not any communication with Pynor till he came to my house in consequence of a general message.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he come? - On Monday the 27th of October, I hope I am accurate; being in possession of this certificate, which I had obtained, I went in company with my attorney, to the Lord Mayor; on our return from the Lord Mayor, Pynor and Sarah Bartlett was in my dining room, we procured an officer, and I went to Mr. Pynor, I had not seen him from the time of the marriage till then; I went to him, and I said, on my return from the country, I heard that you had married Mrs. Bartlett; I heard also that it was in common report, that you was a married man; and I also heard that you set up this as a justification of your conduct, that it was true that you had cohabited with women, but that you had never been married at all, is it so, I said, or, to that effect? his answer was, that he had never been married; I then asked him if he knew Joanna Hobbs? he said he did, but he never was married to her; I asked him if he recollected going with her to St. Martin's church? I think he replied no, but I immediately said, I will help your recollection, I read to him the certificate of the marriage I had obtained, quite through; he then said, she was an unworthy person, or he used an expression of the same import, I do not positively speak to the very expression; and that they were separated, and that she had given him leave to marry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny or acknowledge that he had been married to this

               <p>I am a constable for the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend that man? - Yes, at the house of Mr. Sowerby in Bartholomew Close.</p>
               <p>Q. It is within the liberties of the City of London? - It is a liberty place, but within the bounds of the City of London, I was sworn before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took up Pynor, did you hear him say any thing? - I heard him say a good deal; after I took him up, and took him to the Mansion House, we stopped an hour and a half before the Lord Mayor came, and there was some conversation took place between the prisoner and me, he acknowledged the former marriage, but he did not think that either his first or second wife would hurt him; after some time had past, he says, what had I best to do in such a case as this; I says to him I am not a lawyer, I am only a constable; says he, I think I will not speak a word, I said to him it will be of no service to be dumb; says he, I think I will tell all the truth, I told him the truth would hold longest on foot; he said that his wife had used him very ill, and that she had given him leave to marry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will not intrude upon your lordship's time but very little. The ill treatment of my first wife was beyond expression; also neither did I wish to obtain any money from Sarah Bartlett, or to have any money in my possession, I would not go to wrong any one, it is not my disposition, only to discharge the bills; all that I have to say now is, that I am only at your mercy, and the gentlemen of the jury; I never troubled my friends on this occasion at all.</p>

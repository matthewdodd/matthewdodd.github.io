I told him he must come back, and shew me the ship; he took me from ship to ship for about half a mile, and then I found he was wrong; then I told him to deliver himself to me as a prisoner; when I said that word, he made a blow at my head with the saucepan, and hit me in the mouth with my carbine, and then he ran away. I pursued, and overtook him, and when I got up to him, he began to ill use me again, and in about ten minutes I got some assistance, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They said as there was a very fierce dog on board this ship, and that I could not fetch anything out of the Galley: and I said come, I will lay you a wager of a gallon of beer, that I go and fetch something if the dog he ever so fierce, because I knew how to manage any dog whatever; and I went and fetdhed this jacket and sancepan, and this man stopped me. I had very good clothes on me, I wanted no old jacket like this, and is it likely I should thieve such a thing as a saucepan; no to be sure not, for it was no use to me; besides, I am a very good character, and have always bore a good reputation, never was accused of being a thief before in my life.</p>

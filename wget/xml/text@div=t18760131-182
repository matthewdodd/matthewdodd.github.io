                  </hi>. I am agent for Messrs. Thomas Andrew Walker &amp; Co., contractors, and at present engaged upon the works at Whitechapel of the East London Railway Company—the business is to contract with carmen to take away the excavations—each carman loads up a load and on passing out of the owner's gateway receives a ticket similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ticket is torn from a book printed for the purpose, and a counterfoil is left in it—it is the carman's duty to go to the owner's gate from where he is loading and under ordinary circumstances he would not be entitled to more than one ticket for one load—these are presented to the master carman for payment every week, and half a crown would be paid for the ticket—I had a man watching the prisoner—I did not see the transaction of this ticket—after he left I was spoken to by Hogben, and when he returned with his second load I asked him if he had taken two tickets for one load, and he denied it—I asked him where he had loaded and he told me the ground and I called up the two gatekeepers in the prisoner's presence, and each said "I gave him a ticket"—he denied it—they first showed him their books—he subsequently gave me this ticket and admitted he had the two—I gave him into custody—on those particular days as many as 200 carts would go out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am overlooker at the works in question—I was on the watch at 7.30 on the morning of the 29th January—I saw the prisoner loading at the ground nearest Procter, the ticket writer—he had been there several times before, daily—I followed him up to the next ground—I saw him stop at the gate and go to Shaw's box—he finished his load and then went to Procter's gate and got a ticket there—I went up to him and told him he had got two tickets for one load and he said "<hi rend="italic">No "</hi>—I followed him along the street and told him it would do him no good as I should stop it and he handed the ticket to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The ticket was no use to me. The old gentleman gave me the ticket and the witness said "Have you got two tickets. "I said "No," and he snatched it out my hand. I have always worked hard for my living since I was eight years old. I should have been dismissed for over<lb></lb>working the horses if I produced too many tickets.</p>

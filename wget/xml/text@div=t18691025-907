                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Poulterer's Arms, Cheapside—on 8th October about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of ale and gave me a bad shilling—(I recognized him as having been there about three weeks before, when he passed a bad shilling for a glass of ale)—I called my mistress, handed her the shilling, and said, "This man gave me a bad shil<lb></lb>ling before"—I then said to the prisoner, "You were here before and gave me a bad shilling, and this is a bad shilling"—he said, "Why did not you come after me if I gave you a bad shilling before"—I broke the shilling and gave one piece to Mr. Edmund, and the other piece fell on the floor—I found that the first shilling was bad, about five minutes after the prisoner had gone, and put it at the back of the till, where there were three shilling"—my master went there shortly after, and said, "Here is a bad shilling"—he put it by itself at the back of the till, and it was afterwards handed to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before these two times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he remained at the bar while I went into the lobby to speak to my master—there are two tills, and two bowls for silver in each, but I have one side of the bar to myself—Mr. Evans had cleared my till about five minutes before—I was then very busy indeed—the till was not locked—any person who happens to be serving there can go to it—the shilling was put at the back of the till the policeman had it.</p>

I am proprietor of the Poulterer's Arms—I found a bad shilling in one of the bowls, which I had recently cleared out, and left there shillings there on one side and three sixpences on the other, all good—I went to the bad again shortly afterwards and found four shillings, one of which was bad—I put it at the back of the till, but did not mark it—it remained there till the prisoner came again—no one but the barmaid and</p>

               <p>myself had access to the till—on 8th October the barmaid showed me a por<lb></lb>tion of a bad shilling—I went into the bar and found the prisoner then—I said, "The barmaid tells me you have been here before" and showed him the piece of the bad shilling—I forget what he said—I gave him in charge, with the pieces of the shilling, and took the first shilling to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there anything particular to call your attention to the time you cleared the till? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it might have been 1.45, and it might have been 2.20—I frequently clear it two or three times in an hour, and always leave three shillings there for-change—there are two bars and two tills—no one serves that bar but Miss Maria and myself at that time of day—another barmaid serves on the other side—she might come round to the other till if she was pressed for chance, but not at that time of day.</p>

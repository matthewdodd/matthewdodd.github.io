                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Great Smith-street, West<lb></lb>minster. Between one and two o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th of July I was in Finsbury-square, looking at the procession of Old Friends—I heard a struggle behind me—I turned round, and saw three or four men, and in one of their hands was a handkerchief, which looked like mine—I felt in my pocket, and found I had lost my handkerchief—I had had it safe about half an hour before—both the prisoners were together—they were taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—I followed them to the station, and saw my handkerchief produced—this is it.</p>

On this Monday I was in com<lb></lb>pany with Kemp when the Old Friends were going along—I saw the two prisoners attempting to pick several gentlemen's pockets—at last I saw Pearce take a white handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket with his right hand—I instantly seized him by the wrist, and called to Kemp to secure the other prisoner, and to assist me—Kemp caught the handkerchief from the prisoner's hand, as it was in the act of falling from his hand—the prosecutor saw it at the police-court, and identified it.</p>

               <p>Dr. REYNOLDS sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday evening the 9th of September, as I was going to Hampstead, near <placeName id="t17881022-61-crimeloc273">Chalk Farm</placeName>

               <p>What o'clock at night was it? - The moon was, I think, eight days old, and it was a clear night, but a few light clouds, but so light, that I think, if I had opportunity of attentively observing any person, I could have done it.</p>
               <p>Had you such opportunity as enables you to speak to the person? - Not with absolute certainty; but when I was told the man was in custody, the moment I saw this young person, now at the bar, it occurred to me, that he was very like the man, and so like the man, that if I had been walking any where, and had met him I should have said, he is very much like the man; I stopped the carriage at the first public-house we came to, and informed the waiter of what had happened; the man was dressed very much as the prisoner is.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, to be same dress this young man was in when you saw him? - The whole together was such, that I was very much persuaded, I should rather conceive he was in the same dress; a dark coat, and light waistcoat; it appeared to me the same kind of dress; he had a round hat, not very low over his face; when he turned his head to the coachman, I could see the hat was above his brow; the purse was such a one, as I think, I might have known again; it has not been found; but in the purse, there was, to the best of my recollection, seven guineas.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - A little before ten; allowing for my stopping at this public-house about a minute, and going to my house at Hampstead; probably that might take a quarter of an hour; and when I got to my house at Hampstead it was ten o'clock.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am coachman to Dr. Reynolds; I drove him the night he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man that robbed him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing his person? - Yes, I had very much so.</p>
               <p>Where have you seen him since? - At Mr. Read's office twice.</p>
               <p>Look at him now? - That is the gentleman there in the striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very clear of it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in your mind of it? - I am very clear he is the man that took the purse and presented the pistol to me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how he was dressed at the time? - In a brown coat, metal buttons, and striped waistcoat; I believe the waistcoat to be the same, if not the coat; it was metal buttons, and a brown coat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220066"></xptr>it was one very much like that, if not the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his face much turned to you at the time of the robbery? - He came up first sideways, but the horse turned about; and when he put his pistol into his pocket, then he turned round, and I had a full view of his face.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it he was mounted on? - I look upon it, to the best of my knowledge, it was a dark bay horse; I saw another man come up to the off side of the carriage, but my attention was to this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, he said, before the magistrate, the man that robbed his carriage rode towards town, and that they came up to the carriage, and ordered him to look towards the horses heads; accordingly he did so; and after they had robbed the carriage, they rode towards town, and he went to town; he said at the office, he never turned his head round.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. When you first saw this man at the office, did you know him immediately to be the man? - I went into a little room where there were two, and I immediately knew him.</p>
               <p>Was you as sure of his person then, as you are now? - I was.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any doubt? - No doubt in the least.</p>
               <p>Because I observe, that when examined before the magistrate, you did not swear positively to his person? - I did not, I was very unwilling to swear.</p>
               <p>Had you any doubt, that made you express, that you verily believed him to be the man? - I had no doubt at all, but that he was the man, the very first sight I had of him.</p>
               <p>Court. He says before the magistrate, that he verily believes the said

               <p>I know nothing more than apprehending the prisoner on suspicion of robbing Dr. Reynolds; I took him in Oxford-road, in the street; when I searched his lodgings, I found no purse, nor any thing.</p>
               <p>Dr. Reynolds. I was robbed on Tuesday night; and I think it was on Thursday, or Friday se'nnight following, before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the time at the New Theatre; I have witnesses to prove where I was at the time when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. If you can prove that you really was at another place at the time of the robbery, it is undoubtedly the best defence you can possibly set up; but if you attempt to bring perjured witnesses, you may depend upon it, that they will be detected, and that will render your fate more certain: we have had many instances of unfortunate men here, whose ends have been rendered certain, by attempting to impose on the court.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner's witnesses called in one at a time.)</p>
               <p>Court. If any body is in the gallery, or in the court, that means to be examined for the prisoner, they must withdraw out of the court.</p>

               <p>In what manner have you been acquainted with him? - I have seen him frequently; I have seen him at the Adam and Eve; I never had any particular acquaintance with him; I knew him perfectly well by sight; I have spoke to him, but never to be particularly acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>What drew your attention to this man, if you was not acquainted with him, to know him personally? - I have seen him frequently playing at skittles, at the Adam and Eve; I cannot say I ever was in his company, in particular, to drink with him; I have seen him at a great number of places.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him that night, at the Royalty Theatre? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not speak to him that night at all? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How came you particularly to notice then, that a man, with whom you had no acquaintance, was there? - I saw him perfectly, several times; there was a gentleman with me, and I told him that I knew him.</p>
               <p>Did you know his name, at that time? - No, I cannot say I knew his name, I had heard his name many times; but I never had any particular acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, know his name? - No, I did not, at that time.</p>
               <p>What did you say to the person, that was with you? - I told him there was a young fellow, that I knew by sight, in the next box.</p>
               <p>Who was the gentleman, that was with you? - Mr. Burne, of the Theatre Royal, Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No, Sir, he is not, he would have come, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burne was in company with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he make any answer, or take any notice? - He looked at him directly.</p>

               <p>Where does he lodge? - In Orange-street, Leicester-fields, I do not rightly know the number; I know the house; he is principal dancer at Covent-Garden; I know the house perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the names of the people? - I do not, it is a private house; I am sure it is in Orange-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Let one of the marshalmen take a coach immediately, and call at Covent-Garden

            , and enquire where Mr. Burne lives, and desire him to come here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very likely he is at Covent-Garden house, for I see he comes out in a new dance to night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stay till the play was over? - I staid till about nine o'clock, and then Mr. Burne and me went out to get some refreshment; and then we went to another part of the house; he was there when we went out.</p>
               <p>After that, you did not observe the prisoner? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>But he was in the box, when you went out, at nine o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner alone, or in company? - There were some ladies with him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him speaking to them? - I cannot say I did, they were in the same box.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing whether he was in company with any particular person, man or woman? - I cannot say whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>How are you sure it was the 9th of September? - It was the night of Mr. Keene's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220068"></xptr>benefit; I have two of the pit tickets at home.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the 9th of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then you saw no other of your acquaintance at the Theatre? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>How do you mean particularly? - I went with Mr. Burne.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else, in any other of the boxes, that you knew by sight? - I cannot recollect; I suppose he told a person that he saw me there, for they came to me; I suppose he saw me.</p>
               <p>You was in the boxes? - Yes, so was he in the next box; I was in the side boxes, on the left hand, and he was on the same side; a young man came to me, to ask me to come this morning.</p>
               <p>Who was that young man? - He was in court; he lives in Wardour-street; I do not rightly know his name.</p>
               <p>When did he apply to you? - About a week ago; I met him in Leicester-fields, and then I did not see him any more, till this morning; he said there was a young man taken up, for a highway robbery, and that he was at the Royalty Theatre, the night of Mr. Keene's benefit, and that he sat the next box to me.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I do not rightly know his name; he lives in Wardour-street; his father keeps a hair dresser's shop.</p>
               <p>Then even that young man was not in company with the prisoner? - No, he was in the box with us; he was not in our company; he was no companion of mine.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know where you lived? - I do not know, he never was at my house.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was this? - I believe it was on the Tuesday.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an attorney.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, about two years.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing him at any time, at the Royalty Theatre? - On the 9th of September last, at Mr. Keene's benefit.</p>
               <p>Who where you in company with? - Mr. Tosh, Mr. Day, Mr. Levington, and three or four more of us, in the pit; I saw the prisoner, in one of the upper boxes, on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>What drew your attention to him? - He was pointed out with two men, not of the most respectable character, by a Mr. Day; on account of those two characters that were with him, that were pointed out, not to be very respectable; there were some ladies there, that I knew.</p>
               <p>Do you know who either of these two men were? - I do not.</p>
               <p>What time did he draw your attention first? - I take it, it must be between eight and nine, near nine I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Did you see him afterwards, that night in the box, or did he go away? - No, I saw him for some considerable time after, in the box.</p>
               <p>Did you miss him at all? - I do not recollect that I did, and I kept frequently looking to that box.</p>
               <p>What time did you come away? - At the end of the performance; a few minutes after eleven; he was pointed out by Mr. Day; Mr. Day would not come here on account that he was a clerk, at the Museum; and that his master was very intimate with Dr. Reynolds, and therefore he could not obey the subpoena.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not know Dr. Reynolds, or he would not have judged so; some people judge foolishly, judging by themselves.</p>
               <p>Where is Mrs. Lewis, that was with you that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is not come.</p>
               <p>One of the Witnesses. She is very ill; she lives in Wells-street; she was at the justice's, but was very ill then.</p>
               <p>Witnesses were called to the prisoner's character, but none appeared.</p>
               <p>The marshalman returned, and brought word, that he could not find Mr. Burne.</p>

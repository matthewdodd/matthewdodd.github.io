               <p>MARIA USTONSON. The prisoner came into my shop to purchase some articles of fishing tackle, on the 6th of September; I had seen the things in question in the glass case on the counter about an hour before; I went into the kitchen as was customary at that hour of the day, and left a boy in the shop; he came down to me to ask me the price of a powder flask; I told him the price, and almost immediately afterwards, I heard him call out, halloo, young man, what are you doing there. I then ran upstairs immediately, and saw the prisoner run out of the shop.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BOLTON. I am servant to Mrs. Ustonson. I was going up stairs with a pail of water to clean the stairs, and saw the prisoner and another young man in the shop; they asked the price of something, and the boy went down to his mistress; and as I was looking through the window, I saw them lift up the lid of the glass case, and take something out; I said halloo young young man, what are you doing there, and they immediately dropped the lid of the case and ran out of the shop; the errand boy ran out, and they were soon after brought back.</p>

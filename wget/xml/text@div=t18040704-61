               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am sure of it; after he was brought back and searched, he had not the goods about him; he acknowledged he had taken them, and before the Magistrate he acknowledged the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I am told there was another person in the shop at that time; did not you make a mistake, and suppose it was another man? - A. No; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            , in Duke-street, Westminster, No. 20; I had been to see my brother, who is a coachman, in Swallow-street; his coach was at the top of the Hay-market, in Piccadilly, it was the 20th of February, I was coming down St. James's Park, about the middle part of the Park, from St. James's, what is generally called the Canal-walk; it was about half past seven as nigh as I can recollect; the prisoner met me, he put his hand on my shoulder, he was not on duty at that time, he asked me for something to drink; I told him I had nothing to give him; I did not know what he meant; he followed me down the Park, said, he had been on board a ship eating of salt meat, and he had really got no money; I thought a pot of porter was a small object, and I treated him with a pot of porter, at the sign of the Rose and Crown, in Crown-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he his regimentals on? - Yes, he had, we drank the pot of porter in the publick tap-room, I paid for it; he asked me, which way I was going; I said, I was going to the stables; I was going to meet the coachman in order to fetch the family home; not finding the coachman at the stables, I returned home to my master's, the prisoner followed me at a distance to the stables and house; he was not with me; I went into my master's house, and he went his way; I staid at the Rose and Crown, as near as I can guess, about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220093"></xptr>was following you to the stables, and to the house? - No, none at all; in about half an hour I went out again to the stables, in order to fetch my master and mistress home; the stables are the top of Delahay-street, the bottom of Duke-street, this man following me, I thought he had no good design; I went up the Park straight, I met him in the Park about three or four poles from the Park-gate, where I went to shun him, for I thought by his following me he had no good design; he met me, and said, young man, let me feel your bubbies, with that he put his hand to my bosom, and took out my shirt-pin, and my handkerchief from my neck, then he ran off; I had hold of him by the hand, but he was too powerful for me, and he ran off; I made no alarm, but went away; next night about half past 11 I was going down Duke-street on a message for my master, the prisoner met me in an undress, in a regimental jacket, with a flapt hat and his hair about his shoulders; he said he was taken up on my account, and he immediately rushed upon me, and took my watch, three guineas, two shillings, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. When he rushed upon you, you do not mean violently by force. - Yes, violently; d - n your eyes, says he, if you offer to resist, or call out for assistance, I will kill you; he held his left hand up against me, at the same time he made use of those words, I did not call out for assistance; I was frightened in the hurry of his threatening my life, I was rather confused, and did not, and he ran off immediately, I did not see any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>At the time he took your watch and money, did you make any resistance at all though you did not call out? - No, I did not make any resistance, he was too powerful for me; I had no strength against him.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle at all for your watch? - I did, I went the next morning upon the Parade, but I was not positive that I could swear to the man, because he came in different dresses to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me on the Parade? - Not to be positive, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this to any body this night? - Not that night.</p>
               <p>Did you mention the loss of your shirt-pin and handkerchief to any body before? - Yes, I did, to my own brother, to nobody else.</p>
               <p>When did you tell him? - The next day when I saw him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this robbery? - I cannot justly say, as nigh as I can guess about two days.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this robbery of this watch? - I mentioned it on the 10th of March when he was taken; this was the 20th of February; I believe it was about six days after the prisoner came to my master's door in the evening, about six or seven he knocked at the door, I answered the door; he said, he had my watch, and my property, that he had stolen from me; if I would come out of the door he would give them to me.</p>
               <p>What were the precise words that he used? - Them were the words as nigh as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Repeat them again? - He said, he had got my watch, and my property, which he had stolen from me, if I came there, meaning out of doors, he would give them to me, if I would not say any thing to his officer, to have him taken up and expose him; I went out into the street, and shut the door after me, thinking to receive my property; he then said, he was going to Bath, he had pawned my watch, and every thing he had; and, d - n his eyes, if I did not give him more money, or money's worth, he would accuse me of an unnatural crime, he would take me up, and have me hanged; he immediately rushed me against the wall, and rifled my pocket, but I had no money, and he ran off down Crown-street; I followed him down the street, but he was gone off, and there was not a person there that I could get to assist me to stop him; on the 9th of March he came, about half past seven, to my master's door, and knocked; I answered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220094"></xptr>door to him; he said then, I have taken your property, and your watch out of pawn, here it is, I will give it you; he put his hand to his breeches, as if he was going to pull the watch out; I went to him, and he immediately, as before, robbed me of one guinea in the same manner as he did before.</p>
               <p>Where was that, in the hall, or where? - In the street.</p>
               <p>How came you in the street? - I shut the door, as I did before, when I saw him put his hand to his breeches, I thought he had got my watch; when he had got the guinea, he said, d - n his eyes, if I did not fetch him more money, he would murder me; I got from him, and got into my master's house; he followed me to the door, I knocked.</p>
               <p>How did you get in, because you said you shut the door? - I knocked at the door, and was let in by the servant in the hall; my master answered the door, and asked the prisoner who he wanted.</p>
               <p>How did your master happen to answer the door? - The prisoner came after me the last time he robbed me, and knocked at the door, and my master was in the hall, he came out of the parlour at the same time, and answered the door.</p>
               <p>What, when you and the other servant were in the hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for your master to do so? - No, it was not a usual thing for my master to do.</p>
               <p>Was you making any noise or disturbance in the hall, or calling out? - No, I did not, my master asked the prisoner, who he wanted; he said, he wanted Charles; I was present in the hall at the time.</p>
               <p>Who is Charles? - He meant me; my master said, there is no Charles lives here; walk in, if you have any thing to say, with that my master let down the chain, and then the prisoner made off; my master asked me at that time, when he saw him go off, what he wanted with me? and I told my master the particulars; I had not before then told my master of the robbery; on the 16th of March I went from about half past seven o'clock 'till about one, which was the day the guns were fired off the day of the illumination; I pursued the prisoner, I watched him to the house where he went, which was the sign of the Horseshoe in Petty-France; I went, and got two constables, and took him in the street; he had left the house then.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose it was in consequence of your master's advice that you went into the Park the next day? - Yes, it was, but I should have taken him up before, if I could have sworn to the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scboen. Was any of your property found upon him? - Yes, a silk handkerchief, that was the handkerchief he took from my neck; when we took him to Justice Abbington's he was particularly engaged, he asked to go into a necessary; he went in, and he conveyed from his neck this handkerchief, which was round his neck, when he was taken, and he conveyed it down the necessary; I mentioned it to the constable in the coach; I did not think to mention it before, though I saw it round his neck when he was taken; after we had an hearing at Sir Sampson Wright's, he desired us to go back to this necessary, and in the presence of Justice Abbington, we took it out of the necessary; we took the handkerchief the next day to Justice Abbington's, and the constable took it the day he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever get your watch again? - No, Sir Sampson asked him, what he did with the watch; he said, he sold it to a Jew; I was present when he said that, and so was the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his examination taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. There is no examination of the prisoner's returned. I am for the prisoner; I ought to submit to your Lordship; here is a charge which certainly constitutes several highway robberies, and they are all consolidated in one charge in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Take any one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You lived with Mr. Esdale in Duke-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220095"></xptr>Do you live there now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your master here to day? - He is.</p>
               <p>You say the first attack was on the 20th of February? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was going to call on your brother? - I had called on him, I was going home to my master's house; my brother lives in Swallow-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>What time was your master's carriage ordered that evening? - At half past eight.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to your brother? - At about seven, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Which way did you come home? - I came in at St. James's.</p>
               <p>It was dark I take it at seven? - Yes, it was darkish.</p>
               <p>Swallow-street, if I know it, is nearer to your master's than St. James's palace? - Yes, I do not know but it is.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go the nearest way home to your master's house? - No, I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Has it never happened to you to hear that people going along the park, have been exposed to robberies after dark, and frequent complaints have been made of it? - Yes, I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Can you give us now, my friend, any good reason why you chose to go round from Swallow-street, all through St. James's palace, into the Park, that way exposing yourself in a place, where you know robberies have been committed, rather than go the straight way? - No, Sir, I do not give you any particular reasons.</p>
               <p>And you can give no good reason for it? - No, I cannot give any particular reason for it.</p>

               <p>You had no reason at the time? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Then you were first of all accosted by the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was then in regimentals? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You a perfect stranger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that the first thing that occurred to you was, his laying hold of you by the shoulders, and asking you for something to drink? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you a little alarmed at that? - Yes, I was a little alarmed, but not confused.</p>
               <p>Then you was not confused? - I was confused to be sure.</p>
               <p>Were you, or were you not confused at that address? - Yes, Sir, I was confused.</p>
               <p>Were you near any body there? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>And in the dark too? - Yes, it was in the dark.</p>
               <p>I suppose you looked upon this almost as much as forcing so much money out of your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If any watchman had been near, I take it you would have charged him with a robbery? - Yes, I dare say I should, but I am not positive; I could not call it a robbery to ask me for something to drink; I do not know whether I should have charged any watchman with him or not.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether you should not have complained of an attempt to rob you at that time, if you had had any person by, who would have rendered you substantial assistance? - Why, no, I think I should not.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now that if assistance had been near you, you should have been inclined to have complained of an attempt to rob you? - When he took his hand from my shoulder, and left me and followed me, I did not thing any thing of his going to rob me; I was confused, and I was not confused; I was alarmed to be sure; I thought by the man's making a pitiful story to me, it was out of charity I gave him part of a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Then this man being a perfect stranger to you, you at first thinking he had some bad design, he was the most unlikely man in the world, whom you should choose for a companion to go and drink with? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>How came you then to go to partake of this pot of beer, as you meant to give him as matter of charity? - I can give you no particular reason for that.</p>
               <p>How long might you stay at this public-house with the man? - Perhaps ten minutes, or not quite so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220096"></xptr>I take it the explanation took up some time in the Park, before you were prevailed on to give him a pot of beer? - I did not stop, I went on.</p>
               <p>How long might you have been going from Swallow-street to St. James's-palace, and then through the Park? - Not twenty minutes, I was not walking very fast; it was almost at the bottom of the Long-walk, pretty near Spring-garden-gate.</p>
               <p>The centry-boxes are some distance from that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And there is a wall near there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no windows that look on that part? - No; the prisoner followed me, I did not walk with him, he followed me at a distance, not at a distance, he was telling his pitiful story.</p>

               <p>Did not you desire him to follow you at some distance? - I do not mean to swear any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did he or not, follow you at your desire? - Not at my desire.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I did not go through the Horse-guard-gate, not Storey's-gate; we went through a gate by Lady Suffolk's house, which comes into Duke-street; that gate is open till ten, I found no difficulty in getting out at that gate.</p>
               <p>Then you went into the ale-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go first, or you? - I cannot justly say; I did not give him the money for the beer before we went in; I paid the landlord of the house for the pot of beer, I do not know which went first into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Had you drank at that house before? - Yes, I believe about once, the prisoner sat by the side of me, and we drank the pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Did much conversation pass between you at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you staid ten minutes at that house? - I said five minutes.</p>
               <p>Then you say he asked you where you lived? - No, he asked me where I was going, I said I am going to the stables.</p>
               <p>Did you desire he should follow you again to the stables? - No, Sir, I did not desire it.</p>
               <p>Nor forbid it? - No, I did not care whether he knew where I was going; there are other coaches stand in the stables, and there are dwellings where the coachmen sleep.</p>
               <p>Was you pleased with this man's company? - His company! No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you wish to pursue or renew the acquaintance? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not find the coachman there, nor any body you knew? - No, I did not, I did not stay at the stables a moment when I found the coachman was not there; he followed me to my master's undesired.</p>
               <p>No conversation all this time? - Yes, Sir, there was no conversation passed.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation at all passed? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me yes at first? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>You of course perceived this man following you? - Yes, I did, he followed me directly from the stables to my master's house, I went into my master's house, and he went his way.</p>
               <p>Who let you in? - One of the maid servants.</p>
               <p>Did you relate this circumstance to her? - No, I did not; I went in at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Do you remember opening the other door that evening, the back door, the servant's door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How long after the street-door did you open it? - I cannot justly say, it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was more than five minutes? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Then there was nothing improper done all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>When do you say there was any thing improper done? - There was not any thing improper done then, but when I went out again at the gate, which was about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I was robbed of my handkerchief and pin.</p>
               <p>At that time had you no threat at all,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220097"></xptr>nor any accusation from this man against you? - No, Sir, he took my pin and my handkerchief, and he immediately went off, he ran towards the barracks that was in the Park.</p>
               <p>How far was the centry off? - A great way at the top of George-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that gate at which you were, from Storey's-gate, at the top of George-street? - It is about forty or fifty poles.</p>
               <p>You made no alarm of this robbery? - No, I had hold of his hand, he was rather too strong for me, I never called out.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information to any of the servants, or to your master that evening, that you had been robbed in the Park by a soldier? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information at all of this robbery, before you was threatened to be charged with an unnatural crime? - No, not to my family.</p>
               <p>Was your brother before the magistrate? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Is that brother here to-day? - No, he is out of town at a funeral, and has been these two or three days; the second time I saw him was the next night, nothing passed only he met me in an undress, and said he had been taken up on my account.</p>
               <p>That was not true? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the man fixed himself, and you knew him then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That of course fixed his person strongly on your mind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he had robbed you on the night before? - Yes, he had, this was in the street about half past seven, it is not a public street, sometimes there is not a person for half an hour to be seen; my fellow servants were in the house.</p>
               <p>How long might you remain in conversation with him that evening? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>At that time there was no intimation from you that you meant to charge him with any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not complain of this second robbery? - No, I did not, to any person.</p>
               <p>That was done with a considerable degree of force? - Yes, it was, I took no means to apprehend him that night, but I went the next day to see if I could see him, but I was not positive then whether I knew him, because of his two different dresses.</p>
               <p>Did you describe him to any of the Serjeants in the park? - No, I did not, the third robbery was attempted four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Even then there was no threat from him? - There was a threat from me, for I followed him down the street, and I should have taken him up if there had been any body; I cried out at the top of Crown-street, and he set off and run, and I after him; I did not say stop thief, but said that man had robbed me: there was nobody by.</p>
               <p>Did not the man, when he came to your masters's, say, Sir, I want Charles; and when your master said to him, there is no Charles here; did not he point to you, and say, that is the man I want? - I did not see him point.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, before the magistrate, was not that given in evidence, and did not you yourself swear it? - No, Sir, I do not know that I did, I will not swear positive, to the best of my remembrance I did not swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. But though he did not point to you, did not he say you was the person he wanted? - Yes, my Lord, he did; he said that is the person I want.</p>
               <p>Then the man said boldly to your master, that is the man I want? - Yes, Sir, he did; and then after he was gone, I told my master.</p>
               <p>But not while he was present, and your master wondering why he called upon you, you never charged him with having robbed you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody was by when you lost your handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Your brother knows nothing of this but what you told him? - No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man was in the hall, and your master opened the door, and he said you was the person he wanted, did your master ask him what he wanted with you? - Not then, but afterwards he asked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220098"></xptr>And then it was you told the story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose your master said you must take this man up. - He said, if he has robbed you, take him up.</p>

               <p>I am a private in the same regiment with the prisoner; I have known him three years, a very good character as far as I knew; I was coming home from work about eight at night, I believe it was the 5th of February; and I was going up Charles-street, the prosecutor's master lives right opposite there, I saw a grenadier, that was the prisoner, and the prosecutor stand talking together, and I stopped, knowing him to be one belonging to the same regiment; I heard the prosecutor tell him to go round in the Park to the back door, and he would let him in, then he shut the door after him and went in, and I went and spoke to the prisoner; and asked him, what he was about? the prosecutor came and opened the door and let him in, and shut the door after him; he stopped there about a quarter of an hour, he came out again, and the prosecutor wished him a good night, and shut the door after him; I took particular notice of him; I had my working dress on; it was in Duke-street, right opposite to Charles-street; I know the house, because the door of the house is right facing the top of Charles-street, I do not know the number, nor who lives at it, but I perfectly remember the prosecutor, I never saw him before to my knowledge, I suppose I staid the value of half a minute, this was about eight on the 5th of February, there was a lamp at the door, it was very light; I am perfectly sure it was the same person.</p>
               <p>How came you to be applied to, to come forward in this business? - I do not know, I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Had you remarked this man then? - No further than I said, that I did see the man and the prisoner together; that I have said since he has been confined; I do not know the prosecutor's name; I know him by sight; I am certain sure of him; I know it is the same man.</p>

               <p>Haggett. I was subpoened the 22d.</p>
               <p>What was you subpoened to give evidence about? - Nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>But what was that truth to be? - I have told you that I was coming home from work; and I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor stand at his master's door; I did not know that he was the prosecutor, but I know it was the same man as I saw.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Court. The Jury wish to know of you, Sir, what character you give the prosecutor? - He has been a very faithful servant to me; and I am sorry for this happening, as I must part with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you think it proper, my Lord, I wish the master may relate something.</p>
               <p>Court. One is always happy, when a man is standing on his trial for his life, to hear something come out that may be of service to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. On the night that I answered the door myself; I was led to it from hearing a number of small taps at the door; the man asked for Charles; I said, there was no such man; I opened the door with the chain up; I recollected the man, I had seen him a fortnight before in the street, with my servant talking, on the pavement; I then suspected something, they ran down into the Park, I knew his face again, and seeing him I threw down the chain; he immediately said, that is the man I want; now it is given in evidence that he ran away, but that was not the case, for he would have come into the house, but he was in liquor; had he been sober he should have come in; I thought it necessary to mention it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. That is very honourable of you, Sir, indeed.</p>

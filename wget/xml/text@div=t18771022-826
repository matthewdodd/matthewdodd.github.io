                  </hi>. I keep the Antelope public-house at St. Albans—on the night of the 3rd Oct. last I closed my house at about eleven o'clock—at twenty minutes to two I was awakened by some gravel being thrown up at my chamber window—I looked out and saw a policeman standing below—he turned his bull's-eye on and I went down and opened the street door, and the policeman called my attention to the fact of the cellar shutter being lifted up about five inches, and asked me what it meant—I went down in the cellar and there I found the prisoner standing up in the corner—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand, because the light I had in my hand was very small and the cellar was dark—I said "What are you doing here?"—he made no reply, nor did he move—I then called up the cellar stairs to the policeman—he came down and said "How is it you are down here?" or something to that effect, and his reply was "I came down for a night's lodging"—he appeared to be quite sober—he is a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable at St. Albans—at about twenty minutes to two on the night in question I noticed the cellar-flap at the Antelope had been lifted a few inches since I last passed—I threw some gravel at the window and eventually I went in the cellar with the last witness—he went down first and I followed a few minutes after and found the prisoner crouched down in the corner and had his shoes in his hand—I asked him what he was doing down there—he said he came down after a rest—I took him in charge—I had seen him that evening previously about 11.15—he asked me if I could direct him to a place where he could get lodgings—I told him to go to the Goat Inn, a lodging-house, but he said he should not go without I went with him—he had had a little to drink, I think.</p>

On the night of the 3rd Oct., at about five minutes to eleven, the prisoner came to the police-office and wanted some accommodation—I told him there was no accommodation there for him, and he had better go away—he said "Well, if I walk the streets the police will interfere and take me up"—I said "The police won't interfere with you if you don't commit yourself in any way"—I saw nothing more of him until the following morning on this charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the day this happened I had walked some twenty-nine miles, and when I got to St. Albans it was late and I could not find any lodgings, and I went direct to the police-station to see if they would allow me to sleep in a cell, or find me some place so that I need not be out all night—the inspector told me he could not accommo<lb></lb>date me—I afterwards met this policeman who has been here, and he told me to go to the Goat—I told him I should not go to the Goat unless he went with me, as being after shutting-up time they would not let me in unless I went with him—on passing by this house I never noticed whether it was a public-house or not—I lifted up the flap and went in and took my shoes off, my feet being blistered—I had no intention of stealing anything—the fact of my not fastening the cellar-flap shows I had no intention of staying there to take things out of the house—I had not the slightest intention of taking anything out, as God is my judge.</p>

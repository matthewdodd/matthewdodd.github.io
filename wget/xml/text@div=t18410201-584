                  </hi>, Jun. I am the son of William Ashley, and live at Ruislip, I had a money-box in my room on the 15th of January, with seven shillings in it, six sixpences, twelve pence, and twelve halfpence—I saw them safe on Wednesday, the 13th of January—the box was locked— theprisoner was up in my father's bed-room on Friday, the 15th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, putting some bed-furniture up—he bad to pass through my room, and at night I found the lid of my box had been forced open, all the silver gone, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—no one else had been through the room that day—whenhe came down stairs that evening he asked me to lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would go and get my father in from the public-house—the prisoner came in again, and gave me the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back which I had lent him—there was a shilling in my box with a hole in it, and marked across the mouth—I believe the shilling now produced to be it—I had observed it before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 289.) In consequence of this robbery I went to the prisoner's house, in Pleasant-place, Wal worth, on the morning of the 22nd, about eight o'clock—it is about 200 or 300 yards from the prosecutor's—I saw the four pigeons, which now produce, in a corner of the front-room, on the floor, not in anything—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner whose pigeons they were—he said they were not his, they were brought there last night by a young man, who he said he did not know.—I then took him into custody, searched him at the station-house, and in his coat-pocket found some pigeon-dung quite fresh—the towel has not been found.</p>

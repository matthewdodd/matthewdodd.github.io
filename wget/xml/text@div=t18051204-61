             sworn. I am servant to Messrs. Knight and Richards, button-sellers; on the eleventh of November I was at the back part of the shop, I was alarmed by seeing the shop window open, and one of the prisoner's arms under the sash; I went and examined, and saw some goods that were laying in the window. I pursued the prisoners, and first caught Lewis, he got away; I then secured Ward and took him into my master's shop, and took one bag of buttons from him; he said that the other two boys that were gone, had two parcels more. I produce the buttons that I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your master's buttons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was down? - A. Yes, I am confident they must have thrown the sash up. I was at the window ten minutes before, it was not up then.</p>
               <p>Q. How high did they throw this sash up? - A. Just enough to put the hand in and take these parcels out.</p>

             sworn. I am a Bow-street patrole; on the 12th of November I went in company with Townshend to a chimney-sweeper's in Bow-street, Westminster, where we apprehended the prisoners Lewis and Taylor. I asked Lewis what he had done with the buttons, he said they were down in the cellar, he ran down to the cellar, and I followed him; he produced the buttons from under the soot, they were in a paper parcel. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the same we had in our shop, the private mark is defaced by being in the soot.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Gill.) You are sure you saw the three prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to their different persons? - A. Two of them were black, being chimney-sweepers, and the other was very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the one that you stopped a chimney-sweeper? - A. No, the other two were.</p>
               <p>Lewis's Defence. I was going with this lad, (Ward, he wanted to be a sweep,) to Leather-lane; I was going to take him to a sweep there, he ran away from me; he came back to me, and says, I have found this. Taylor says, I will give you one as you are going home; he told me he had found it; I says, I hope you did not take it; he said no, he found them.</p>
               <p>Ward's Defence. I did find them, Taylor saw me find them, and another gentleman saw me find them; I gave Taylor two, he gave the sweep one, and one I kept myself.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. They gave me one pack; Lewis told me to give it to him to carry home, and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Lewis called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Taylor called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

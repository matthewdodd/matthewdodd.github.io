                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. Bullen, at Cheshunt—in 1860, I was in the service of Mr. Wiltshire, of Palmer's-green, in the parish of Edmon<lb></lb>ton—on 2d September, 1860, I saw the pony in a field, on that Sunday even<lb></lb>ing, with two more horses on Monday evening I saw the two horses there, but the pony was gone—the field gate was looked, and the chain was broken—I saw that pony in Suffolk on 14th February this year—I was with two con<lb></lb>stables Boutell and Roberts—the pony was with Larter—I am certain that that was the pony belonging to Mr. Wiltshire.</p>

               <p>seven years—it was a good pony, a bay, with a few particular marks about it; a scar on the near side, a few white hairs on the forehead, good step, short action, very fast—I never tried whether he was a good jumper—he was in a gentleman's paddock with very good fences apparently—they were not much account, as the chain was broken—my idea is that the pony went out at the gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable at Horinger, in Suffolk—on 4th September, I saw the prisoner at Horinger fair, driving a pony, which has been identified by Humphreys in my presence—I have seen it lots of times since I saw it at Horinger—I am quite certain that is the pony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About how many times had you seen it between 4th September, 1860, and 14th February, 1862? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might say twenty times—the last time that I saw it before 14th February, 1862, was in September, 1861, or the latter part of August—I saw it at Horinger, a few days before Horinger fair—I did not see it between September, 1861, and February, 1862—Horinger is near Bury St. Edmunds—there were several ponies in the fair that time, and a great many people—it is a middling fair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk—on Friday, 14th February, I saw Humphrey's and went with him to Hargrave, about eight miles from Bury St. Edmunds—he identified a pony which I showed him—I took possession it and brought it up to Bury—I went to Norwich on the following day and saw the prisoner in the Cattle-market there—I asked him if he knew the county of Suffolk—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Were you at Horinger fair last year?'—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you there the year before"—he said, "No," at first, but immediately after he said, "Yes, I was"—I asked him if he knew any<lb></lb>thing about a pony that was sold there; if he was in company with a man named William Collins, or George Bambridge, and there sold a pony which was stolen—he said, "No," to my first question—I said, "Nor with William Moon, or Romford Fred," who were the same persons: Collins and Bam<lb></lb>bridge go under different names—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had sold the pony—he said he had not—I then took him to the Norwich police-station, and there repeated those questions to him again; he again denied them—I afterwards brought him to Bury and charged him there with stealing the pony—before he was locked up I asked him if he stopped at Bury the night before Horinger fair on that occasion—he said, "Yes"—on Sunday morning, 16th February, I saw him in his cell and told him that I had information that he was in company with two others, and stopped at</p>

               <p>Horkingdon Green with a pony on the night before Horinger fair, the year before—he said, "I know nothing about it"—afterwards I had the horse and cart and took him on to Horkingdon—as soon as he got into the cart, he said, "Where are you going to?"—I said, "I am going to Horkingdon to see whether you tell the truth or not"—he said, "You need not go any further; I was there with William Moon and Long George"—I do not know "Long George," I know William Moon—he said that he and the other two left the Fox beer-house at Edmonton on the Sunday night previous to the Tuesday, with a pony and cart, and drove down to Bury—he denied having anything to do with it, only that he was a servant to Moon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Moon a man who has been convicted of an offence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is now waiting his trial—he has been convicted—the prisoner did not know the names of William Moon and Romford Fred, when I put them—it was not till the following day that he admitted he was with them—they are the same persons; I have no doubt of it—all my questions put on 14th February, 1862, referred to something that occurred in September, 1860—he answered correctly that he was not at the fair in 1861—I was not dressed as a police<lb></lb>man at that time, I was when I went to Norwich—I do not think he knew I was a policeman—I was in company with a policeman.</p>

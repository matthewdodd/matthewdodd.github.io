                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live at Wood Green, Tottenham. On Wednesday, 31st Oct., the prisoner was at my house—he had been there before on several occasions—I owed 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the poor rate collector—it was a very wet day, and in the evening I said to my bar-man, "George, you must go to Edmonton, and take this money to Mr. Staines"—this was said in the prisoner's hearing, and the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately replied," I will take it for you, I only live a few doors from him"—I said, "Very well, you will save my lad the trouble of getting wet"—the</p>

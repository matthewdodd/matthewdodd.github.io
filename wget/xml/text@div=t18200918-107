I had the articles stated in the indictment, tied in a damask table-cloth. I had fetched the linen to take home to wash from Mr. Faber's, at the top of Bishopsgate-street. I live at Bethnal-green. It had not gone five o'clock. I was in Skinner-street, a little way out of Bishopsgate-street, and saw three men at the corner - I saw them very clearly, the lamps were being lit, and there was a great deal of snow on the ground - it was a clear night. All of a moment, one of them came and knocked me down, and attempted to get the bundle, but I held it fast, thinking it better to die than to loose it. The other came and dragged me till my strength was gone, and got the bundle from me. The third stood by my side, and said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, mistress, do not hollow so - can I help you?" I am sure he was one of the three, I saw them all very clearly before. The man who had my bundle was convicted. The prisoner is the man who knocked me down, I am quite sure. I have not seen the third man since. I followed them as far as I could, and went to the lodgings of the one who had my bundle, and had him apprehended next morning. I have met the prisoner once since it happened; hat was three or four months ago, I could not take him myself, but went and told the officer. He was apprehended seven weeks ago (I think) and taken to the Mansion House. I am quite sure he is one of them, and was sure when I met him. I have no doubt whatever of it.</p>

            . I live in Crown-court, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street. I know the prisoner, and I knew Lomer, who was transported for life. On the evening the prosecutrix was robbed, I was going up Skinner-street, out of Bishopsgate-street, and in a little alley which turns down to Angel-alley I met Lomer, the prisoner and another man were walking alongside of him. Lomer had the bundle. I heard the prosecutrix cry out that she had been robbed; at that time, she was about half way down the alley. I ran back - she said she had been robbed of a bundle. I said</p>
               <p>"Come with me and I will shew you the fellows who have got it." I took her to Angel-alley, and shewed her the house where Lomer lived, which was opposite mine. We did not see him. I knew him well before. I have seen the prisoner several times since, and told of his being about. He was taken up about six weeks ago. My husband is a watchman. I do not know the third man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not go and tell Cox that Carr was taken, and she asked you if it was a fair or a dark man. - A. She did, I said it was a dark man; then she said, that is the man who knocked me down. The other was a fair man.</p>

            . I am a City officer. The end of Skinner-street, near Bishopsgate-street, is in the City. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of July, and told him it was for a highway robbery on Mrs. Cox, he denied it. On the following Monday Cox saw him among five or six more. I took particular care no one should shew him to to her. I asked her to point out the person, and she pointed him out. I had been looking for him ever since the 28th of December.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I returned from sea, I went to learn the shoe-making business at Groves's, and on the night of this robbery, I was going to my brother's, and in Skinner-street I saw two men pass me with a bundle. I went on; and afterwards moved to Nichols-street, Shoreditch, and remained there till the officer took me.</p>

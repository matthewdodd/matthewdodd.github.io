                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 1st of March, I had reason to watch Mr. Campbell's house at Whetstone—I saw the kitchen window open at ten o'clock at night—I went into the washhouse, found a leaden pump and a quantity of lead pipe entirely torn down from the wall, and placed at the washhouse door ready to be carried away—I marked it, and fitted it as well as I could to the place it came from—I could ascertain that it came from there—I had seen it all safe on the Friday previous—about twelve on Wednesday night I saw the prisoner in Hawkes' custody on the premises—I said, "Johnson, is it you?"—he said, "Yes, Buey, it is, do, for God's sake, let me go"—I said, "No"—he said, "Do, for God's sake, and I will give you a sovereign"—I said, "No, Johnson, not if you give me a thousand."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday night, about eleven o'clock, I examined these premises, and saw the lead near the wash-house door, ready to be carried away—I went in and searched the house, and in about five minutes bolted the door and got out of the window—a few minutes before twelve I heard somebody get in at the window and unbolt the door—I was in a side closet—it was the prisoner—he went close by me, and came out in a few minutes with the lead in his possession—I took him into custody with it—he begged very hard to be let go, and said he would give me a sovereign, and nobody but us would know anything about it—I detained him.</p>

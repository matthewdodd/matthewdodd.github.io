            . Q. Where do you live - A. In Old Tothill-street, Westminster. On the 2d of March I was going home from Tottenham-court-road I was coming up King-street, Westminster, about five minutes past twelve at night as nigh as I could guess, I met the prisoner and another man in the street. The prisoner said what a nice morning; I knew nothing of him before; I was alone; I answered a very nice morning. We walked till we came to the corner of Great George-street, they turned back with me nothing more was said, they walked with me to Great George-street, just at the corner of King-street which leads into Great George-street, then the prisoner said can we get nothing to drink; I said I would not have any. We walked along past the ruins to the sessions house. When we went into the ruins where the houses were pulled down; the prisoner laid hold hard of me by the breast; he clapped his hand to my coat, then he took hold of the seal of my watch chain; he pulled the watch out, and broke the swivel of the watch; I took hold of him by the neck handkerchief, and by his throat; I sung out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the string or chain and seal - A. He took the ribbon and seal in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that - A. Yes; I saw the seal and ribbon in his hand. When I cried out murder the man that was along with him turned back.</p>
               <p>Q. What he had gone on a little before - A. Yes, he gave me two blows, my hat was cut with the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the other man - A. And the prisoner struck me in the side, and in the face with his fist. Mr. Hilliard came up at the time I was crying out. After Mr. Hilliard came up he struck me twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did - A. The prisoner. Mr. Hilliard called for the watch. I kept hold of the prisoner till the watch came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner's companion - A. He went away when he saw Mr. Hilliard came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner secured when the watch came - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the chain of your watch or ribbon - A. I took it out of his hand when the watchman came up, I have got it here, he had it in his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080016"></xptr> then. I had seen it in in his hand before that.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something when he laid of you - A. Yes, he tore my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was the time that he snatched your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay hold of your breast as you described at the time that he snatched your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your coat was torn by him - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you have no doubt that he had hold of you in that way when he snatched your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the swivel was broke - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take the ribbon and seal from him until the watchman came up - A. Not till after the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now produce it then - A. This is the ribbon and seal, there is no impression upon it, I bought it for gold, I gave a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was secured I suppose and taken to the watchhouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. This you say was about twelve o'clock at night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the man at the bar I think you described it to be in King-street, near to the ruins - A. Yes, in the middle of King-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And he and you walked on a considerable way - A. I met him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said you met him - A. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q.You all three walked together towards the sessions house, you had no fear on your mind - A. No, I had no notion of it whatever; it was not very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the same moment that he stopped you that he snatched at your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And till that moment that he made a snatch at your watch you were under no apprehension - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no blows untill the man had snatched the watch - A. No, he laid hold of me first.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been since you left your own home - A. I had been at a friend's house, I had some supper, and some beer; I was neither drunk nor sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in this court before in any shape - A. Yes, I have been.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever stand at that bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What was that for - A. Not for felony.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not there a scuffle between that man and you, and a quarrel, and some blows struck by you first - A. No, I never struck him at all.</p>

            . I was at that time a clerk in the Registery office, I lived at that time in Johnson's-row, Westminster. I was returning to my mother in Howland-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your way lead you through King-street - A. Yes, it had just gone twelve; I observed three men just entering on the ruins at the sessions house, I avoided the ruins because I saw three men go on there; at the same time I heard the cry of murder, it proceeded from the place in the ruins where I had seen the three men; I hastened to the spot, as I approached one of the three ran away. When I got up the prisoner was struggling with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the prisoner and Carney were two of the men - A. Yes. When I got up the prisoner was striking him, I saw him strike him two blows; I caught hold of the prisoner's skirt of his coat, and desired him to desist, he told me that Carney had accused him of robbing him; Carney answered that he had attempted to take his watch, and that he had got the seal, I saw the seal in the prisoner's hands, it had a ribbon to it. Seeing no other help at hand I left the prisoner and called the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had Carney hold of him or not - A. He had, by the neck; I called the watchman, he came, and the prisoner was secured. After the watchman came up I saw Carney take the ribbon and seal from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner struck him after you came up - A. Yes, he struck him two blows with his fist after I came up.</p>
               <p>Q.What state was Carney in after you came up - A. He had been drinking, but he was not thoroughly intoxicated.</p>
               <p>- NEALE. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time you heard the alarm - A. In King-street, close to my box I heard murder called, I hastened to the place where I heard the voice, I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner with his right hand on the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hilliard there - A. Yes, I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. You are sure of the prisoner laying hold of you by the breast of your coat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the same instance you have admitted that you had been drinking - A. I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you senses enough to take notice of every thing that happened in the the order of time in which it happened. You are very positive of your being laid hold of by your breast, and positive that your coat was torn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Do not you know that there is a forty pounds reward if this man is convicted - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I claim a few minutes of attention for the charge that that is laid against me. On the night in question I was returning home. I live in Westminster; I was returning home through King-street, Westminster, on my passing by the prosecutor he jostled against me, I thought it was an insult offered me, and I did push him again, he was near falling at the time, he recovered, and said, you villain you want to rob me; I said I am quite sure you will find me a person of quite a different description; he seized me that moment by the handkerchief, and by the throat, and held me in that situation by the handkerchief and throat, I called out and struck him three or four blows, a person passing by at the time told the prosecutor to let go my collar and I would go quietly to the watchhouse, and answer any charge preferred against me, and I immediately surrendered myself into the custody of the watchman without attempting to make any resistance. Now, my lord, and gentlemen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080017"></xptr> of the Jury, if I had been a person of that description there was only one watchman I never would have been taken in that way. I appeal to you whether I would have surrendered myself in the way I did; I shall rest myself satisfied with the judgment of the Court, and I am sure I shall get justice in this way. This prosecutor has acted with the greatest duplicity to me, and said he would not hurt me, he has persuaded my friends not to come forward, saying that he would not hurt me, that I was in no danger at all, he went to my father's house, told him I need not have my friends come forward, he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Have you used any means to keep away this man's friends - A. I have not, his father is in Court.</p>

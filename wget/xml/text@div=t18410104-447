                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the private drawing-office, at the Bank of England. On the 11th of December, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner presented the cheque now produced, for 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed, "Sundrius and Penrucker," who keep cash at the Bank—I asked him in what way he would receive it—he said he would have 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, and 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in small notes—entertaining some doubt, I compared the signature on the cheque with our signature-book, and not being satisfied, I referred the cheque to Mr. Palmer, who left, to go to the counting-house of Sundrius and Co.—I returned to my desk, and the prisoner was standing before me—I said, "I must trouble you to wait a minute or two"—I gave no reason, but the clerk standing by, knowing I had not 200 sovereigns in my drawer, said, in the prisoner's hearing, "You will want 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, I will go and get it for you"—the prisoner then turned his back to me, and remained in that position, leaning on the counter, till Mr. Palmer returned, which was within five or six minutes, with Tyrrell, an officer, and immediately gave him in charge—nothing more passed between me and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the City marshalmen. On the 11th of December I was sent for to the Bank, where I saw the prisoner—I was informed he had offered a forged cheque—I put some questions to him, which I considered leading and necessary—he said he had the cheque from a young man named Brett—I asked who he was—he said he was a young man over the water, in the Westminster-road, that he was to meet him again at the public-house with the money, if he got it—I was pro<lb></lb>ceeding to search him, and he said Brett had given him a book, to keep the cheque clean—I found a pocket-book upon him, which he said was the book—I found a canvass bag upon him, which he said he also had from Brett to carry the cash—I asked who Brett was—he said he was a young man at a public-house opposite Brett's brother, which proves to be the Fountain, and he was to meet him at that public-house—we took him over the water in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to the public-house where he was to meet Brett—we got there, I should think, about four o'clock in the afternoon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184101040030"></xptr>
               <p>I made inquiry of the publican, but did not find Brett there—I waited there a considerable time with the prisoner, then went across the way, where they said Brett's brother lived, leaving the prisoner with an officer—I then took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City officer stationed at the Mansion-house. On the 11th of December I went to the Bank, and took the prisoner in charge—he said he had received the cheque from a young man named Brett—that he was to come to the Bank of England, get the money, and take it over to the public-house—he could not tell the sign exactly, but it was somewhere near the Westminster-road, leading from the Ele<lb></lb>phant and Castle, but if the gentlemen of the Bank would allow us to go with him, he would show us the house—we got a coach, and went into St. George's-road, and drew up just before we got to the door of the Fountain public-house—the prisoner bad told the coachman which way to turn—the prisoner, Brand, I, and Tyrrell went into the bar—the landlord was there—I said in the prisoner's bearing, "Is young Brett here?"—the landlord said, "He is not in now, but I dare say he will be here pre<lb></lb>sently"—I stopped for about an hour, then took the prisoner back to the Compter—he stated, in the course of conversation, that he had known Brett a long while, and I rather think he said he went to school with him—he said he had been in the habit of using that house, that he had been there with Brett five or six times—he just nodded to the landlord while we were there, ana I believe said, "How do you do?"—he certainly knew him—after leaving the prisoner at the Compter I went over the water again, and stopped at the Fountain till near three o'clock in the morning—Brett did not come—the prisoner said he himself lived with his mother at New Feckham, that he was formerly a clerk to a gentleman on Fish-street-hill, and had been out of employ nearly twelve months—he said he was parti<lb></lb>cularly intimate with Brett, that they were together the evening before, slept at the house on the former night of the 10th, and breakfasted together that morning, the 11th—that Brett said he lived with his brother opposite—I did not find his brother there.</p>

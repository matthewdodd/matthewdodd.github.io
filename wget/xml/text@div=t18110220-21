On the 5th of February I lost some bacon, the bacon was put on some tubs at the further end of the shop; the bacon was sixty pound weight. On the 5th of February, at eleven at night, I saw the bacon there; I fastened the shop door, and saw every thing was secure; nobody could go into the shop without breaking the pannel, which was done. I have a private entrance in the passage for the lodgers, they have no business with the shop. On the 6th, about the middle of the day, I missed the bacon, and about six in the evening the pannel in the passage, at the further end of the shop, I observed had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the shop in the morning - A. About seven o'clock. I was the first person that went into the shop, I did not perceive the pannel broken then, not till the candles were lighted; the boy went out in the yard in the evening, he told me that the pannel in the passage had been broken; I took the candle and examined it, and found the bacon had gone through that pannel; the marks of the bacon was upon it. The pannel had been broken open by an axe; the axe is here, the pannel had been split and then pushed in its place again, and my knocking about the tubs in the course of the day, had moved it out of its place. It had been put in its place, and that prevented me from seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it had been broken open by that instrument - A. Mr. Baxter matched this instrument with the place, it matched with it. The patrol found the axe in the bag, with the bacon in his possession in the street. I went to the watchhouse and saw it, I knew it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your house that night - A. I do not know that he was out; he told me the next night that he was out at his club.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. I stopped the prisoner with the bacon on his back in Little Queen-street, Holborn, about a quarter past two in the night of the 5th; I asked him, where he was going; he said, home, just down here; making a motion, as if down Little Queen-street. I asked him what the bag contained, he said, meat; Bott, the watchman, asked him what meat; he replied, bacon, he had it out of the country, and had been to the Angel, St. Giles's for it, and the reason he had been out so late was, he had stopped with a friend. I told him that he and the bacon must go to the watchhouse. Bott took the bacon, and the prisoner made his escape from me. We took the bag to the watchhouse.</p>

I asked the prisoner where the bacon came from; he said, Ryegate; I took the bacon and carried it to the watchhouse, I opened the bag at the watchhouse, it contained this bacon, and this hatchet. The patrol had the prisoner in Holborn, he stopped and watched, he run off, the patrol lost him.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper. This bacon was delivered to me on the morning of the 5th, between two and three o'clock, it was brought to the watchhouse. On that morning Mr. Pugh came and claimed it. I went to Mr. Pugh's house, examined it where the pannel had been broken open in the passage; my judgement was, that it must have been done by somebody in the house; I took the prisoner in custody that same night in Mr. Pugh's house. Bott followed me to the watchhouse with the prisoner, and when he came there I asked him if he knew the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200014"></xptr>man, he made no reply; I told him to go for Branscomb; when Branscomb came he declared directly that he was the man that he stopped with the bacon.</p>

               <p>Q. If one steak was cut off, could you afterwards sell it for a loin of mutton? - A. Yes; if they did not ask me any thing about it, I should sell it for a loin of mutton. I had missed it from the place where I had laid it about a quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't know, of your own knowledge, that the mutton was taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cannot yourself swear that your wife did not sell it while you were up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a certain number of bones in a loin of mutton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if there is a bone or two less, it is not a loin of mutton? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. A part of a loin cannot be the whole loin? - A. I should call this a loin of mutton.</p>
               <p>Q.Your wife is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNES sworn. - I am a butcher: On the 23d of February, about seven in the evening, I was sitting in my own shop, I was informed Mr. Higham had been robbed, and I went in pursuit of the person; I went up an alley, and met a lad, I could not see any body else, but I heard the found of a foot before me; I pursued almost to the top of the alley, and then I perceived somebody turn down another alley, that leads into the same street, that was the prisoner at the bar; upon his seeing me, he stopped from a run to a walk; I went up to him, and caught hold of him by the right arm; I said, my lad, what have you got here, he said he had got a piece of meat; he had got the mutton in his apron; he refused to go back with me, till I insisted upon it; I took him back to Mr. Higham's shop, which was about fourscore or a hundred yards; the servant called Mr. Higham down, I asked him if that was his mutton, and he said he could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you swear that that is a loin of mutton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that a goose, with its head cut off, is a goose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing at all about its being taken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that saw it taken is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, it was a man that wore trowsers that had the mutton? - A. No, never.</p>

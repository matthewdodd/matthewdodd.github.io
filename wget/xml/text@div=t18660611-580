                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 10, Princes-street, Lambeth—I know the prisoner—I did not keep company with her—I used to speak to her very much about a twelvemonth ago, but since that I have only said "good-night" or "good-day"—sometimes I have not said it at all—on the night of 30th May, about thirty minutes past 11, I might have seen the prisoner, but I did not take any notice—I was at the Cross Keys—I left off work about 7—I was going home, and prisoner stabbed me in the arm—I thought she was going to pass me—I held down my arm, and she stabbed me again—I made my way to my house, and she followed me—on removing my coat, I found that I was wounded in my left arm—it was a bad one—these are the things I had on—Dr. Rhodes attended me—I have been at the hospital since—the wound bled very much—the police were sent for and the prisoner taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in York-wharf, Princes-street—I was standing at the top of Salamanca-street on the 30th of May—I met the prisoner, and told her she was out late, and she told me to get away from her, or she would give me something I would not rub off—I stood there a little while longer, and she asked me if I had seen <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> come home, and I said, "No"—she did not say anything further about him—I turned round and saw the prosecutor running away from her, bleeding from his arm—she ran after him, and stood with her back against the door—the constable Kenealy came up and asked her whether she had anything—she took a knife from under a shawl, and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner.</hi>) I am sixteen years old this January—before I was taken into custody I lived at my father's in Fenchurch-street, and was in the employment of Messrs. Plank and Smith—I went into their service in September last as office boy at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—in November, in consequence of losing the key of one of the cupboards, a new one was made—with that key I opened one of the drawers in a writing table in my employer's office—from that drawer I took the key of the iron safe, and out of the iron safe I took Messrs. Plank and Smith's cheque-book—I have known Nash about twelve months—he was in the service of Smith and Co. wholesale druggists, Bush-lane—I used to see him every day—I saw him the night before I opened the sale, and took the cheque-book—I knew there was a cheque-book in that safe before I opened it—I told Nash what I was going to do—I told him I was going to forge a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he said he would mind the money for me, nothing further—the next day I took this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the cheque-book—it had nothing written on it then, only the number 798 (<hi rend="italic">this cheque was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">on Messrs.</hi> Hankey's for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and purported to be signed by Plank and Smith</hi>)—I filled up that cheque, and took it to the bank—the figures 798 are not in my writing—that was written on it—I got ten sovereigns for the cheque, which I took down to Nash—he was in his employer's office in Bush-lane—I gave him the whole ten sovereigns in the cellar there—I went down with him to the cellar—I told him where I had got the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from—I told him I had forged a cheque—I saw him again after that, the next morning—we bought some meerschaum pipes with some of the money, the day after I got it—they cost</p>

Hankey for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">signed Plank and Smith</hi>)—I took that cheque to the bank, and got gold for it—Nash came up to the office for that—I told him to come the night before—I gave him the whole 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all in sovereigns—when I gave him that he asked me if I could get any more, and I told him "Yes"—I bought a magic lantern with part of that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Merritt's, in King William-street—it as to cost about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short, and I told Mr. Merritt to send it to Bush-lane, that is, where Nash was in employment—I went with the person who took it, and told him to pay the boy 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he did—the watch I bought from Nash wanted mending, and he took it to Church-lane, Whitechapel—I had not had it when it was taken to be mended—he did not tell me where he was going to take it to—I afterwards went with him to where it was—I never kid possession of it till after he said he had taken it to be mended—I went with him to 'Goldman's, the watchmaker's in Church-lane, Whitechapel—it was not finished, and Mr. Goldman asked Nash to give him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he should have another one—he banded him another, and said, "If you give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you shall have this one"—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Nash paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of it, and promised to call and pay the other five another time—I afterwards told Nash that my father was going to see about the watch, to see if he had won it at a raffle—I had told that he had won it at a raffle—Nash said, "Well, go and pay Mr. Goldman the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and tell him, if anyone comes after the watch, to say that he broke the other, and was obliged to give this one in exchange"—Nash went to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me he had paid Mr. Goldman 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Mrs. Goldman said she did not like to take it, because she thought there was something wrong, and that he gave her half-a-crown to say nothing about it—between that date and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. December, I was in the habit of seeing Nash daily—I went to Messrs. Hankeys again on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. December—before going there, Nash said to me, "Can you get any more?" and told me to get a lot next time—that was two days before—I told him I would—I took another cheque out of the cheque-book, the same way as before—with the exception of the number to pay, it is written by me (<hi rend="italic">this was dated </hi>2<hi rend="italic">d. December, 1862, to pay No. 806, 251. on Messrs. Hankey, signed Plank and Smith</hi>)—I took it to Hankey's, and got five sovereigns, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note for it—I gave all that money to Nash—he came up to my employer's office for it—the next day after that I was taken into custody—I was bailed, after being examined before the Magistrate, and on the next day Nash came up to my father's house, and told me that Mr. Gale had been down to the office, and had asked him whether he had seen me with any money, and he told him "No"—he then said he had burnt the notes, and I told him if it was ever found out, I should tell what he had done with them—he said he could not help it, he had burnt them—that was on 4th December—the next day I saw Nash again at Messrs. Smith's, in Bush-lane—I asked him there if he had burnt the notes, and he said "No"—I asked</p>

               <p>him why he told me he had, and he said he had only done it to see what I would say—the next day, the 6th, I saw him again, and asked him if he had the money at home—he said, "Yes," and told me he had not spent any of it—I did not ask him to do anything with the money—I was afterwards taken into custody, and committed for trial, and he too.</p>

COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you before you went to Plank and Smith's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Living with my father and mother—that was the first place I had been to—I had seen my employers write very often—I copied the writing myself—I had seen where they put the cheque-book—I knew where it was—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is the first cheque I ever forged—I did it by copying it from another—I knew Nash before that—I did not tell him that I was about to be employed to collect rents for a gentleman, or that somebody was going to employ me to collect their money in, and that I was to have 10 per cent—I am quite sure of that—I did not tell him that I had an allowance given me by my father—I mean to say I went to Nash at once, and told him I was going to commit a forgery—I saw him at his master's office when I first told him that—Mr. Smith came in while I was in the office—I did not speak to him, or he to me—he could not hear what was passing between us—I gave him no excuse for being there—I had a desk at my master's, which locked, and I bad the key—I carried the money all to Nash, every penny of it—I had nowhere to keep it, but in my desk, and I was afraid Plank and Smith would go to it—when I went down into the cellar Nash saw me from the window, and went down, and opened the cellar door—I know why I am called into this box—I don't know what I am likely to get by it—no promise has been made to me, if I gave evidence in this case—I only knew just now for the first time that I was to give evidence—Nash has a mother—he lives with his aunt—his father is dead—, before he died he was in difficulties—I knew that.</p>

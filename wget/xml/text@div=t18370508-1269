                  </hi>. I am a hackney-coachman, and live in Duck's-row, Whitechapel. On the 19th of April, a few minutes after eleven o'clock at a women—I knew Seager before by sight, but never saw the others before, to my knowledge—I went before them on meeting them; and when I got close to them, Seager said something to me—I do not know what it was—I turned round, and, by some means or other, my legs went from under in—something struck against my legs, but what I cannot say—I fall down, and Seager was down with me—a scuffle ensued between us—I caught hold of him by his companion—I let go of Seager, and when I got up he made off—somebody stopped him—I went and caught hold of him, till a policeman came and took him—in going to the station-house some one asked me if they had robbed me—I put my hand to my left-hand trowsers pocket, where I had three half-crowns when I left George-yard, Aldermanbury, and I found only two in my pocket then; but whether I lost one in the scuffle, or whether they took it, I am not able to say—my pocket was torn, and I felt him have hold of my trowsers by the pocket, by some means, but whether his hand was in it when he got up I cannot say—whether he had one finger or three in, or one thumb, I cannot say—whether it was torn in the scuffle, or he put his hand in intentionally to get my money out, I cannot tell—that is all I know—the policeman came up afterwards—there is no one to speak to the fact but me.</p>

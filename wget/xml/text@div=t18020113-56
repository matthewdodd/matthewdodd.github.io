               <p>Bevan. What she has said is entirely wrong; when I went in, she was in the shop with the man, stooping down to put weights in or taking them out; the copper was properly in the scale, and she was in the shop with the prisoner, and not a soul besides. <rs id="t18020113-56-verdict299" type="verdictDescription">

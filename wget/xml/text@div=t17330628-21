Her Husband said, it was worth 15 or 16 s. a Yard, and he would give us 8 s. a Yard for it, and we agreed, and he gave us 2 Guineas cown, which the Prisoner and I divided equally betwixt us. And the Prisoner went several time, afterwards and brought me 3 or 4 s. at a time, till I had receiv'd 15 or 16s for the Remainder of my Share.</p>

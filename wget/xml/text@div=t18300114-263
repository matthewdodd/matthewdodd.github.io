            . I am a shoemaker , and was in my master's shop in Wheeler-street. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor about twenty minutes before nine o'clock - I heard Stop thief ! repeated ; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner, and the prosecutor challenging him, and desiring him to give him his cap - I heard the prisoner say, "I will give you a bl - y punch in the mouth;" the prisoner was walking fast, but not running - the prosecutor was in the road by the side of the curb - I left my door when I heard the threat repeated, and said to the prisoner, "Give the boy his cap:" the prisoner said he had not the cap, and had not taken it, but as the snow had fallen the day before, I saw something like a cap , but I cannot say it was that - it was gone in a moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down the street , and saw the prosecutor and some other boys playing at snowballs; the prosecutor then came and asked me for his cap - I said I had not his cap, and had not had it; I told him I would hit him in the mouth - the witness said he saw me throw the cap down; he went away, and some other persons came up - the witness then returned , and said he did not see me throw it down.</p>

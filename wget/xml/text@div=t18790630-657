                  </hi>. I am a foreman at Hibernia Wharf, kept by Messrs. Hugh, Colin, Smith, and others—part of the premises consist of dry arches under London Bridge, used as warehouses—on 22nd May a quantity of Greenland seal-skins, called "Whitecoats, "passed through my hands, and I saw them put safely into the warehouse in one of the arches, and locked up the premises a little after 6 p.m.—on going at 8.30 a.m. next day, I missed 27 skins—I identified 25 since at the police-court, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one.</p>

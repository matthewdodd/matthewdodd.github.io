                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer, of 21, Albion Buildings. On the evening of 21st July, about half-past 8, I was passing along Aldersgate Street, and saw the two prisoners at the corner of Mr. Woolmer's shop—a man was with them—Groom and the man were standing by the side of a pile of goods, forming a sort of corner—Williams was behind them. I saw her put her hand from behind them and take a piece of goods—Groom and the man then walked arm-in-arm a short distance down Aldersgate Street, Williams followed them. I spoke to Hancock, the policeman, and saw him take the women into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 229,) On the evening of 21st July, I saw the prisoner and a man in Jewin Street; I had been following them for some yards, when the last witness came and spoke to me—I saw that Williams had something under her shawl; the man said something to the women, and they turned into Wells Street; and I saw Williams take this piece of print from under her shawl and hand it to</p>

               <p>Groom: the man walked about two doors farther up towards Red Cross Street, and stood still. Groom turned her back to me and stooped, as if in the act of hiding the print. I then ran across and took hold of them both by the arm—Groom slipped her shawl in my hand, and wrenched herself away from me, and the print dropped from underneath her clothes; she ran away—I kept hold of Williams—I saw no moro of the man—Williams was stopped in Red Cross Street, and I took her into custody there.</p>

I am a draper at 73, Aldersgate Street, in partnership with my father; this piece of print is ours; it was taken from a pile at the door on the 21st—I had seen it safe within five or ten minutes before it was taken—the pile was secured by an iron chain passed in and out of the pile to a post at the back—I can swear to this by our mark on it.</p>

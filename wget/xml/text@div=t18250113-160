               <p>MARY ANN BROWN. I am single and live with my mother, who keeps a fruiterer's shop, at No. 1, Merlin's-place, Spa-fields. On the 31st of December I went home with some tambour work to Hoxton-square, about half-past five o'clock - it was then dark; I was returning home, and got to Tabernacle-square; I was going to Tabernacle-square, to call on my brother; I turned down <placeName id="t18250113-160-crimeloc846">Short-street</placeName>

I am certain he is the person, I saw his face plainly - he and his companion then got away - a gentleman came to my assistance and advised me to go to Worship-street - the prisoner was not taken till about a week afterwards, when an officer called at my mother's - I went to the office on Saturday, the 8th of January and saw the prisoner standing, with four other persons - I pointed him out immediately - no one had pointed him out to me - the Magistrate remanded him till the Tuesday following - no one appeared on his behalf at that time - I saw him again on the Tuesday, and was quite certain he was the person - my bag had two white veils in it, worth 90 s. a white pocket handkerchief, and a purse, containing a pair of ear-rings, two half-crowns, and one crown - the property was all mine but the two veils.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Short-street, with my father, who is a packing-case maker - I was at home, about a quarter before six o'clock, on the 31st of December - it was dark - I heard the cry of murder - I ran out directly and saw two men running down Wood-street, calling out Stop thief! I followed after them and turned into North-street - I saw that the prisoner was one of them - he seems the same height - I did not see his face - he had a fustian coatee on, and a pair of corderoy or fustian trowsers - I followed him nearly to the top of North-street - he made a turn to the left, and we all lost sight of him; I saw the prosecutrix afterwards - her dress and her bonnet were muddy. I saw the prisoner next day week at the office - there were two persons brought out to me - the prisoner was one - he was dressed exactly as I saw him on the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I received information of the robbery on Friday, the 31st of December, a little after six o'clock. The prosecutrix appeared to have been knocked down, and was very muddy. The prisoner was brought down on another charge on Friday. the 7th of January - the prosecutrix attended next day and saw him - the description she had given of him exactly corresponded with his person - he had a fustian coatee on - I brought out four prisoners who were locked up, and she immediately pointed him out as the person who struck her - no person had pointed him out to her - it was entirely the result of her own observavation. Wright saw him, and by his dress recognised him.</p>

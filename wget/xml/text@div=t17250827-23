             deposed to this effect; Mrs. Holland gave me two Suits of Headcloaths to carry to my Wife to clear-starch; and as I was going home thro' Rag-Fair, this Gentlewoman at the Bar pick'd me up, and we went to drink together at the <placeName id="t17250827-23-crimeloc96">Rose and Crown Alehouse</placeName>

We staid there about two Hours: She went away before me, and presently after I mist the Goods is out of my Pocket. I was woundy vex'd to think what Account I should give to my Wife when I came home. But howsoever I came to this House again the next day, and made Enquiry after this Woman, and at last I found her.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence: I met this Man, and he told me if I'd go with him, he'd give me a Pint of Twopenny. Why then, says I, let's go to a House that I know, and so I shew'd him the Way to the Rose and Crown, and there we went up Stairs into a Room by ourselves, and both got drunk together. He bid me Half a Crown to do so and so with me; but I did not much care to let him. Why, indeed, my Dear, (says he) I han't got so much Silver about me; but I'll change a Guinea, and if you are afraid of not having the Money, you shall hold these Headcloaths the while for your own Security; and so he pull'd them out of his Pocket, and gave them me: But finding myself a little in for it, as the Saying is, I did not care for staying any longer, and so I went away without my Half-Crown. <rs id="t17250827-23-verdict97" type="verdictDescription">

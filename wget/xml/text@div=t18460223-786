                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Baker's Rents, Rotherithe, I know the prisoner—he is a tallow-chandler—he lived in the same house with me—had absented himself from home six months—he came back last Mon<lb></lb>day evening week (I and he had no quarrel before he went away—I cannot assign any reason for his going) he only came to call on us to kick up a row, and then go again—I was in the house in the lower room—his wife was in the same room with me and his son, a little boy—when I saw him come in he was intoxicated, and I said, "Now <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> what have you come about"—I spoke first—Isaid, I hoped he had not come to quarrel, he said, "No," and put out his hand and shook hands with me, and then turning to his wife said, "You b—y b—h," or "w—e, I have come to see you"—It was then proposed to send for a pot of beer, and he gave his son half-a-crown to go and fetch the pot of beer during the absence of his son for the beer he got up and began to strike his wife, and I said, "Now <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> you shan't do that"—when he went to strike his wife he went nearer to her, and I said he should not—he then put his hand in his bosom and pulled out a something—I did not know what it was then—he</p>

               <p>flung it at me with all his force, and said, "There you b—y rogue take that"—a deal table, about three quarters of a yard wide, stood between us—it took effect where you see, on my cheek—it did not stick in, but fell down—I did not know at the time what it was—the policeman when he came in picked it up, and found it was a sailor's knife, open—he did not do anything else to me—I then, find<lb></lb>ing myself hurt, picked up an iron saucepan, and menaced him out of the room—I told him to go, and gave him his hat and he went clear away from the house—I did not give him in charge—he was taken the same night—the policeman picked up the knife about the place where it had fallen, after it had taken effect on my face—I got some warm water and bathed it, it bled very much, but I did not go to a doctor for twenty-four hours after that—he told me to put a plaster on it, which I have done ever since.</p>

I came to this house on the 16th of this month, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening—I heard a woman cry, "Murder!" and ran there—I cannot say whether the door of the house was open—I met the prisoner's wife before I came to the house—she came out, crying "Murder!" and applied to me to come—I met the prisoner before I got to the house, and asked what was the matter; and he said, "Here I am, if you want me"—at that time I did not know that anything had been done—I took him back to the house—he did not go inside—hestood outside along with another constable, whom I asked to mind him while I went in—when I got into the house I saw the prosecutor—his face</p>

               <p>was bleeding—I only found him in the room—there was no child there, nor any one but himself—this was on the ground-floor—he had a cut under the left ear—I searched on the floor, and found this knife open—it is sharpish at the end, more sharp at the end than it is anywhere—it was not quite so clean as it is now—it looked as if it had been wet and dropped down on the dirt—there is a bit of gravel stuff on it—I took the knife, and went out, and asked the prisoner if it belonged to him—he said, "Yes"—I then asked the prose<lb></lb>cutor if he was going to charge him—he said, no, he was not; and I told the prisoner to go—he said, "I will not go, I will murder the b—y lot before I go; I have been longing to wash my hands in his blood, and I will murder the lot before I go"—I then took him in charge myself—he was worse for liquor—next morning, as I was taking him to the police-court, he made an observation that he would murder the lot before he went—he was solid and sober then.</p>

The prosecutor applied to me on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 18th, two days after the wound had been inflicted—I found an incision on the left cheek, cleanly cut, about an inch long, and penetrating through the skin and the fat beneath the skin—I should say the depth of the wound was about a seventh or eighth part of an inch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 21st of Jan., in consequence of information, between ten and eleven o'clock, I and Malin went to No. 11, Castle-alley, to the second-floor room, leaving some policeman below—I found</p>

               <p>the room-door closed, listened, and heard somebody inside, I opened the door, and found a table close against it, pushed it aside, and got in, and found the two prisoners, the male standing close to the fire, with his face towards it, and the woman a yard or a yard and a half from him—the man had a mould in his left hand—the moment I opened the door he threw it down—it struck the hob, and flew in pieces—we took hold of the prisoners—they were thrown on the bed, and secured—they both said, "By G—d, what shall we do?"—I looked at the fire-place, and saw a spoon on it with white metal in it, in a fluid state—I looked about, and saw a quantity of broken moulds, as I sup<lb></lb>posed, and saw Alderman find, among the pieces in the fire, a piece of metal with the head side of a sixpence on it—it was quite hot—he could not hold it—I saw some plaster-of-Paris in a paper bag on the table—at this time the man flew from the foot of the bed to the fire-place, and snatched a piece of coin off the hob where the broken mould was, which I supposed to be a six<lb></lb>pence with a get to it—he put it into his mouth—I seized him by the throat, but could not prevent his swallowing it—he said, "It is no use, it is gone"—his lips and tongue began to swell very much, as if burnt—he asked for water, which I gave him, and said, "You have burnt your mouth"—he said, "Yes, I have; you do the best you can for yourself, and I am doing the best I can for myself"—another piece of mould was found in the fire-place—nobody else was in the room.</p>

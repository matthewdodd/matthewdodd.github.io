               <p>another officer, and saw the two prisoners running after a cart; knowing them, I called Hann's attention to them, and we followed them—I saw them go to the back part of the cart, on three different occasions, going from Far<lb></lb>ringdon-street to Temple-bar—one of them lifted up a parcel which laid in the cart—I saw the parcel rise—after they got through Temple-bar, the horse went rather fast, and we lost sight of them—we returned into the city and while near Temple-bar, I saw Williams with this white bag in front of him, running behind a cab—the other prisoner had this bag rolled up under his arm—when they got to Chancery-lane, Williams left the back part of the cab, and ran up Chancery-lane with Brown—we followed them—when we overtook them, Williams had this white bag, and the canvas bag under his arm—I stopped him, told him I was a police-officer, and asked him what he had got there—he said, "My own property"—I said, "What does the bag contain?"—he said, "I don't know; I shan't tell you"—I took him to the station, where he was charged—he then said that he had picked this bag up—Brown also stated that he picked it up and gave it to him—I made in<lb></lb>quiries and found the owner of the property—the bag contained two shirts a pillow-case, a towel, and a handkerchief—Williams gave his address No. 8, Grain's-road, Bermondsey—there is such a place, but it is an empty house, and has been unoccupied for some time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 34). I was with the last witness—I have heard the account he has given; it is quite correct—I apprehended Brown; it was Brown who tried to get the parcel out of the cart—I saw him put his hand up, and lift a bag similar to this—that was as the cart was going through the Bar, towards the Strand, before we first lost sight of them—I told Brown I was a police-officer, and asked him where he got the bag of linen that his friend was carrying—he said, "That's my business, and not your's."</p>

I live at 7, Edge-terrace, Notting-hill—my wife is a laundress—I know that bag of linen quite well—I can swear to all the clothes, they all have a particular mark on each corner—I received them from Watling-street on the 25th—a lad named Newman was with me in the cart—I gave the bag to him to put in the cart—after we got through Temple-bar the lad said something to me, and I found the bag was missing—I got out to catch the men, but I could not—I saw a middling-sized man in black, very much resembling Brown when I got out of the cart.</p>

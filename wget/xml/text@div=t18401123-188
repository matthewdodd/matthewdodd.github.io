                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Mendoza—the prisoner was in our service for about nine weeks before this happened—I missed money out of my drawer for some time, and in consequence of that, I marked eight shillings and one half-crown on Thursday the 12th of November, I put them into a box in the bed-room drawer, which I had lost some sovereigns from before—I locked the drawer, came into the kitchen and sent the prisoner with the children to school—she returned from the school and said there was a customer in the shop, and I had better go and serve—I did so—I then came up again, and said I was glad she had told me—I then went to the box and missed one shilling—I took no notice of it—about twelve o'clock she told the apprentice that I was taken ill, and she was washing out a bottle to get something for me—I told the boy to watch her, which he did, and from what he said I went out and got a policeman—I went to a public-house which the boy had seen the prisoner go into—the landlord took a handful of silver from the till, and among it was a shil<lb></lb>ling I had marked—I went back and accused the prisoner of it—she said she had opened the drawer—I asked how she had done it—she said it was with the carving knife—this is the shilling (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

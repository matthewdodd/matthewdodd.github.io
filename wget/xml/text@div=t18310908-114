             (examined by an interpreter.) On the 5th of June I went up to the garret, where the prisoner was employed blocking the caps - I found him with his back towards the door, pressing something into his hat; he put his hat on his head; I desired him to show what he had in it - he refused; I took his hat off, and these two skins, which belong to Messrs. Hyman Emanuel and Co., were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Does Mr. Emanuel sell skins in this state? A. I do not interfere in the business - he makes caps of them; the prisoner was in his service last year, and came back again last May - there was no other person worked in the room; no one had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is impossible for those two skins to go into my hat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

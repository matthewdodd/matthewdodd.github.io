                  </hi>. I live at 113, Borough-road, St. George's, South-wark, and am manager of a co-operative store—on the night before 23d May I secured and locked up my premises at 11 o'clock exactly—early in the morning, about a quarter-past 4, I was called up, and found my house had been broken into—I missed 36 lbs. of tea, and a side of bacon weighing 77 lbs. value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also missed a Rack which the tea was carried away in, and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I know those things were on the premises the night before (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know this bag is mine; I cannot swear to the tea—I do not know the prisoners at all—James-street is just across the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 53, Ewer-street, Gravel-lane, St. Saviour's, Southwark—on Friday morning of 23d May I went to take a walk—I was in Warwick-lane about a quarter to 4 or 4 o'clock in a glass house, where there were some other boys that I knew—two boys named Foley and Knott were with me—we left there about twenty minutes past 4, and went into Little Surrey-street, and saw Cronin come out of a house in Little Surrey-street into James-street, with a bag like this on his back; and then he came back with no bag, and he beckoned to another man round the corner—I cannot say who that other man was, but I think it. was Travers; it was something like him—I cannot say how be was dressed, but he was in his shirt sleeves and Cronin also—I cannot tell what house Cronin went into in James-street after he had beckoned to the man; he went into the house in Little Surrey-street which he had come out of—I saw his face distinctly; his nose attracted my attention.</p>

                  </hi>. Early on Friday morning, 23d May, I was taking a walk with James Barrett to cool ourselves—we got into Surrey-street at a little glass-house with some boys—coming out of Surrey-street I saw Cronin run across the road with a bag—he went to a house—another man came out and beckoned with his hand to go back—as soon as we told the policeman of it, he ran in and <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> the two—the bag was very much like this one—I can't say who the man was that went back—we walked half-way up the street, and the man ran after us—I ran round the other way to the policeman but we did not catch him.</p>

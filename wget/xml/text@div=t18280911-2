I missed some money from my desk in the early part of this year, and took measures to discover the thief. On the 17th of July I went to my banker's, Messrs. Hankey's, and procured ten 5l. Bank notes, which were Nos. 19,259 to 19,268, inclusive, and dated June 18, 1828; I deposited them in a desk in my counting-house, from which I had previously lost money- I had seven sovereigns in the desk; I had not marked the notes, but knew they were successive numbers; I rumpled them up in my hand, and put them into the desk in that state; I locked the desk - (I had previously lost a key of that desk) I went to the desk in an hour and a half, to give the seven sovereigns and ten 5l. notes to my clerk to be marked, in case of a loss, and missed a 5l. note, No. 19,260; I did not miss any gold: I had Mr. Wood (the clerk) and the prisoner, who was my cook, apprehended, and also the housemaid. The prisoner was searched, and the 5l. note, No. 19,260, which I had lost, was found on her; the officer took it from her pocket, in my presence, in a leather purse, with a clasp to it; I also found on her a 10l. note, four sovereigns, 21s. 6d. in silver, and a master-key of the desk from which I lost the note, and also of the clerk's desk by the side of it; I had lost it some time previously - it would open both desks, but the clerk's key would only unlock his own desk. I found the duplicate of a silver snuff-box on her - I had lost that box before, but do not know when; it was afterwards shewn to me, and is mine; it has my name engraved on it - I have had it twenty years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether she is married? A. I have seen her husband; I cannot say whether he visited at Mr. Wall's</p>

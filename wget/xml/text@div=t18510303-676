                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer, of Brentford-hill, in the parish of Isleworth. The prisoner has been in my employ; he left about two months ago, or more—the shop is open to the street—previous to 9th Jan. I had missed money from the till—last Saturday-week I marked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some halfpence with a pin at the police station, and a police<lb></lb>man afterwards saw me pat it in the till—he afterwards produced 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to me, which was part of the money I had marked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On 22nd Feb. I went to Mr. Harriss's, and, by arrangement with him, I saw him place some money in the till—I placed myself on the stairs, where I could see the till—I heard a door go at about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I cannot tell what door it was, but I saw the prisoner at the till; he opened it, took something oat, and put it into his pocket three separate times; he then shut the till, and turned round to leave it; I came out, and took him with 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>-worth of halfpence in his band—I searched him, and found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper; I took him to the station, where Harriss picked out of it 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as marked—the doors were all safe when I went there, and Harriss locked me in—the prisoner was not in the shop then—be could only have got in by a false key, unless he got in by the cellar; but then was nothing disturbed—I could not see the front-door where I stood, and could not see the prisoner till he was at the till; he made very little noise—I found no key on him, and the door was still locked, but I heard somebody run from outside the door when I took the prisoner.</p>

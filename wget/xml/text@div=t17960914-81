On Sunday the 4th of September, Mr. Allen applied to me, and I went to his house and examined the drawers, and found that some instrument had been used to force the locks back; I enquired of Mr. Allen what carpenter had worked in that room; he then told me that two carpenters had been at work there, and he told me of this man; I went in search of him, and did not find him; he was afterwards brought to Bow-street by somebody; I don't know who went; we then found out his lodgings, and saw his wife, and found some duplicates; we went to the pawnbroker's, and Mr. Allen knew the property; he accompained me to No. 2, Broad-street, St. Giles's, a Mrs. Taylor's, where this bundle was, (Producing it.)</p>

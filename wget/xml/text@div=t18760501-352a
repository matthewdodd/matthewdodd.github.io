                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman RR</hi> 22). I was on duty at Blackheath near a donkey stand—I saw the prosecutrix and her friend—I saw the female prisoner help her upon a donkey, at this time the male prisoner was putting a saddle on a pony—as soon as he had done so he came across and spoke to his wife—I was standing against the park gates—I saw the male prisoner come across the road into the park, round to the urinal at the back of the lodge—in the meantime the prosecu-trix came up to me and said she had lost her purse—whilst she was speaking to me the male prisoner came out of the park—I asked the prosecutrix to wait a quarter of an hour as my suspicion was aroused—I went round, in company with the park keeper, made a search and found the urinal per<lb></lb>fectly dry—just outside there was some earth which had been raised, and on removing this I found the purse—I spoke to the prisoners but they denied having seen the purse—the prosecutrix at once identified it by a letter—at the station I found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze upon the male prisoner, and a half-crown and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found upon the female prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am park-keeper at Blackheath—I saw the female prisoner start the 'prosecutrix off on a donkey in the afternoon of the 30th April—the male prisoner was putting a saddle on a horse, and afterwards spoke to his wife for about a minute—he then crossed over the road and came through the park gate and said he was going into the urinal—I had not seen anyone go in before that—I had been standing there about a half an hour—he was gone about five minutes; when he came back he crossed over the road towards the donkey stand—I then went with the policeman to the urinal, and it was quite dry—it had not been used—when we came out I saw the earth, which we removed and the purse was produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The policeman is right in saying one entrance only was open—I was on duty; these donkey drivers do not give a great deal of trouble to the police.</p>

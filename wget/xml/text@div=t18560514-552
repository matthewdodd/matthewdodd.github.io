                  </hi>. I am the wife of William East, and keep a sweet<lb></lb>stuff shop, at Lower Sydenham. On 14th April, about 6 o'clock: in the evening, the two Reynolds and Gore came into the shop, and asked for some almond rock; I could not reach the glass, and asked one of them to take it down from the window for me—they would not do so—John Reynolds said, "Come round and get it yourself"—I went round the counter and got it; in doing so I passed the prisoners—I had the glass in my hand, and then they said they would not have any sweets, I sold them too dear—I told them it was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce—they said they would have a biscuit—John Reynolds</p>

               <p>took one out of the window, and gave his brother one—they each took one, and each gave me a farthing—they then went away in a hurried manner—before they came in I had a purse in my pocket—I know I had it safe about a minute before they came in, because I had just paid a bill, and had used it—I had about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—there was a half sovereign, three or four half crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—the half sovereign was wrapped up in a small piece of paper, a kind of newspaper, which was rather dirty—I missed my purse about a minute after the prisoners had left the shop—a customer came in immediately they had gone, and wanted change, and I found my purse was gone—I informed my husband of my loss, and he went to the station, and returned with the police, and they went in pursuit of the prisoners about ten minutes after they had left the shop—I should know the piece of paper again in which the half sovereign was wrapped—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, and this is my purse—I only know the paper from the wear—I had used it for the same purpose for perhaps three weeks or a month, and it had worn a hole.</p>

I was on duty at Sydenham, about half past 6 o'clock, on 14th April, and, in consequence of information, I apprehended William Reynolds and Gore—as I was taking them to the station, some one called out, "Policeman, mind one of these has got some<lb></lb>thing in his hand"—I found that William Reynolds had two half crowns and three shillings in his left hand—I afterwards searched him at the station, and found 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a penny on Gore—when I took the money from Willian Reynolds, I said, "What have you there?"—I laid hold of his hand, and he dropped it into my hand—he did not say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross<lb></lb>examined.

"Yes"—that was all she said—she said it was a piece of old newspaper—that was all the descrip<lb></lb>tion she gave of it—when she was at the station this piece of paper was lying on jthe desk, with several others, and she looked down, and said, "That is the piece of paper the half sovereign was wrapped up in; I have had it in my possession three or four weeks"—the other pieces were not like this, quite different—I believe all the prisoners live in one street, somewhere in Shoreditch.</p>

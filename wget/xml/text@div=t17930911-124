             came to our dwelling house, I saw him myself, he asked for a hundred and a half of eggs; I asked him what made his master send for them at that time of the day; he said that his master wanted the hundred and half to go to one house; I told him I did not know that we had any left, but I would take the key and go and see; I served him half a hundred and seventeen odd ones, and he had them all, which made seventy-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he came from his master, who did you understand his master to be? - Mr. Eames a green grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him live at Mr. Eames's? - Yes, and he used to come when his master wanted any always. He told me to be sure to save the rest to make up the hundred and a half against the next morning ten o'clock, as he would come.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Eames was a customer of your's? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of these eggs? - Two shillings and nine-pence. He came the next morning and had the remaining part, and our maid servant told them, and I stood by her with them; he had then one hundred and three.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he wanted the second for? - He spoke of it as part of them that he wanted before; he came within half an hour of the time that he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Eames's christian name? - Richard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. Eames live? - In Chichester-rents, Chancery lane.</p>

I asked him what brought him out so early, and he said it was only four o'clock, and he was going to do a job at Mr. Whitehead's shop. Mr. Whitehead is the gentleman who is building in Cadogan place. When I afterwards saw him taken up, he told me he would get clear of this job, and lay wait for me.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is situated two fields from Cadogan place; I was going to call half past four o'clock, on the morning of the 24th; and seeing a man coming across from Cadogan place, I stood still; that man was the prisoner; he was coming towards the ditch; I called to him, but he did not answer, and I went towards him, and found him in the very act of getting over the ditch; he had some squares of glass tied up in his apron; I asked him what he was going to do with them, and he said, he was going to work at Mr. Whitehead's. I took the glass from him. and taking him by the right shoulder, was conducting him to the watchhouse, when he slipped his coat off, and was attempting to run away, when he was secured. I took him to the watchhouse, together with the glass and it was afterwards discovered that the apron he had the glass in on the morning of the 24th, was stolen on the 23rd.</p>

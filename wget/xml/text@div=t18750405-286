I am a labourer, and reside at 16, High Street, Plais<lb></lb>tow Marshes—on Saturday night, the 27th March, I saw the prisoner enter the Sir Robert Peel public-house, Brunell Street, Plaistow Marshes—we were there drinking together, and had two or three words, and we agreed to go out and fight—when we came outside the prisoner kicked me—I fell on a young man's back—about 300 people were standing round—I got up and walked towards him, when he stood with his hands down by his side, and he struck me, and I hallooed "I have got a knife into me"—I saw him raise his right hand; he struck me in the left side, and I felt that I was wounded—I was taken to the doctor's, who dressed my wound—I had not struck him.</p>

I live in Market Street, Plaistow Marshes—on Satur<lb></lb>day night, the 27th March, I was standing in front of the Sir Robert Peel beer-house, and I saw the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner struck Taylor in the back with a knife—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand after he struck him, and I heard the prosecutor say "I have got a knife in me"—I can't tell what you did with the knife afterwards—nobody seized the prisoner except the policeman about ten minutes afterwards; he did not go away from the spot—there was a great crowd.</p>

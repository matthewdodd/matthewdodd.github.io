Brown and Wheeler; they said nothing to me, but pushed me against the wall; I looked in their faces, and said, gentlemen, I beg your pardon, let me pass. Northall then came; he laid hold of my watch and seals, and pulled it out with a jirk, and at the same time I received a blow under my right eye. I laid hold of Northall, and holloaed out murder, and thieves. One of them knocked me down. I think I received the first blow from Wheeler, and the second blow from Brown. They knocked me down, and pushed me about in the middle of the road; they gave me several hard blows upon my right arm, and told me to make no noise. I was obliged to let Northall go on account of the hard blows on my arm. Then Northall began to run, and I followed him; he ran into Swan-street, from there to Butcher-row; there is a place called Mountsgate-cooperage; he ran down there, there is no thoroughfare; the gates are shut up. He was there apprehended; he hid himself in a corner close to the gate he was taken by me; and

            . On the night mentioned, I was passing through Swan-street; I heard a voice call out murder, and stop thief; I heard somebody running behind me, which proved to be afterwards the prisoner Northall. Mr. Newman came up without a hat, calling out stop thief; Mr. Newman and I was partly together; we continued the pursuit. The prisoner ran up Swan-street, turned round to the right, up East Smithfield; then he ran up Mount's-gateway, and put himself close into the corner, where the gate opens. Mr. Newman, and I seized the prisoner, and conveyed him to the watchhouse. I assisted in bringing in the other two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the others - A. When Mr. Newman got into the watchhouse, and Northall secured, he then gave a description of the other two prisoners. The two patrols, Lane and Brown, assisted in taking the prisoners into the watchhouse. Brown the patrol, came into the watchhouse; he informed us, that he had seen two men pass by, and seeing them apparently to be agitated; he followed them into the Seven Stars, in Swan-street. Brown the patrol did. That is what he told us, and in consequence of information given by Mr. Newman, we went in pursuit of the other two prisoners; we went and found them in the Seven Stars; the two patrols took hold of the two men, and we conducted them to the watchhouse. The prosecutor saw them when they were brought in, and said they were the men that assisted in knocking him down. After they was were secured, we got a candle and went to where he knocked down; first we found the stick laying in the mud; his hat was brought by a woman, and on the spot where we found Northall, Lane the patrol picked up the gold seals; I saw that. I was by the side of the patrol.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a patrol. When first I heard of the robbery, I went to the spot. I saw the two prisoners, Brown and Wheeler, go into the Seven Stars public-house. I followed them in; I noticed their persons, and their dress. I then went to the watchhouse; Mr. Newman informed me, that he had been robbed by three or four persons; one he had got in the watchhouse. I then asked him whether he could describe to me any of the other parties. He told me, one was as tall as himself, the other was a shorter one. I told him I believed I could fetch them up. Accordingly Mr. Knowles, and a gentlemen, that had been hustled in Nightingale-lane, accompanied Lane and me to the Seven Stars. I asked the two gentlemen to point out any men in the room that they had any knowledge of; they pointed out Brown and Wheeler. I then with the assistance of Lane, took them to Mr. Newman, and he immediately, upon seeing them, said they were the men that assisted in robbing him. The prisoner said nothing to that.</p>

On the 25th of March, between ten and eleven in the evening, I was going my round; I heard the cry of murder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070073"></xptr>and stop thief. I directly ran to where the cry was. Mr. Newman and Knowles had just then taken Northall into the watchhouse. I followed them into the watchhouse. We searched Northall; nothing was was found on him. After that I went with Brown, and brought up Brown and Wheeler to the watch-house; and after we had secured the whole three, we went down to Mount's-gateway. I found two gold seals, a gold key, and a metal chain. I shewed them to Mr. Newman; he said they where his. I produce them.</p>

This young man came to see me; we went over the water together; we stepped into a public-house, the sign of the Spread Eagle; there we stopped together from half after eight till eleven, and then I asked him whether he was willing to go home, and on our return home we called at another public-house to have a pint of beer, there the watchman came in and took us. I am as innocent as a child unborn, so you may do as you please with me; if you hang me tomorrow, I care not.</p>
               <p>Wheeler's Defence. On Thursday I went to see this young man at Dock-head; I stopped there until he came from work. We crossed the water, and went to the Spread Eagle to have a pint of beer. We stopped there from half after eight to eleven. In our way home we called in the Seven Stars. We had not been there five minutes before the patrols took us.</p>

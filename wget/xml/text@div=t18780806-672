I live at 18, Brown's Blace, Shacklewell—I assisted Mrs. Ringrose in her confinement—the child was a nice baby born—I washed it directly it was born—there were no marks about the body then—the violet powder was put for my use in a powder-box on the table, and I used it to the baby with a rabbit's foot—I used it each time I changed the napkins, that was about twice in the course of the day—on the second day, I think, I used the powder about four times to the child, once in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and afterwards merely when I changed the napkins—I noticed on the second day the child looked very red, and on the third day it was going red, yellow, and black—I then left off using the violet powder, and used starch—the navel was turning black, and the stomach hard—Dr. Brown was sent for, and I called his attention to the state of the child—I had read in the papers about a week before that there was some inquiry about violet powder—the child got worse—I gave Dr. Brown some of the violet powder out of the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I attended Mrs. Ringrose in her confinement—her child when born was per<lb></lb>fectly healthy and full-grown—on the third day when calling at the house my attention was directed to the child's stomach—I found swelling and red<lb></lb>ness all over, more especially around the navel and about the genitals, and in every crease and fold of the body, the ribs and thighs—there was also discoloration and hardness all about the stomach, and all parts wherever the inflammation was—those appearances seemed to me to have been caused by some irritant poison—I there upon made certain inquiries, and was shown some violet powder—I had not had my attention called to anything in the newspapers, or heard anything of the matter—I took some of the violet powder away, and directed them to keep the remainder—I continued to attend the child daily until its death on the 7th June—it got worse each day—on the fourth day, the 1st June, sores appeared on the stomach, round the navel—they presented a very darkened appearance—they were about the size of the end of a pin's head, and increased in number and size down to the time of death—those sores fortified my opinion as to the appearances having been originally caused by some irritant poison—sloughs also formed along the groin, and round the navel—I reported the case to the Coroner, and about 12th June I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—a pupil from the hospital assisted me—the head and brain were perfectly healthy, also the lungs and other organs, except the liver, that was very much enlarged and congested; that confirmed my view—an irritant poison goes immediately to the liver—in my opinion the actual cause of death was exhaustion from the inflammation—an irritant poison like arsenic would cause the appearances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060015"></xptr>
               <p>and results I found—I showed the body to Professor Tidy about a month after the death—it was exhumed for that purpose—it was very much de<lb></lb>composed—the packet of violet power I received from Mrs. Branch, it was taken out of the powder-box, and I put it in paper, and gave it to the Coroner's officer at the inquest—he gave it me back, and I ultimately gave it to Professor Tidy—I also received another portion from the Coroner's officer, which I also handed to Professor Tidy; that was in a paper, not in a packet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I saw the child within half an hour of its birth; it had been washed; I did not notice whether it had been powdered—I heard no complaint of any sores until the 31st—the umbilical cord had not then dropped away—I think from the diseased condition it did not drop away at all; it was retarded in its natural progress, and resolved itself into a large ulcer—the worst sores were immediately round the navel and between the thighs—in my opinion the poison had penetrated through the navel, in the first instance through the pores of the skin; that occurred to me at the time; I should not think it penetrated through the cord itself; there is no circulation in the cord after birth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a B. M. And Fellow of the Chemical Society, professor of chemistry and medical jurisprudence at the London Hospital, and medical officer of health to the parish of Islington—I am joint editor of a work on medicine and toxicology—I have had a large experience in poisons—on 14th June I received these two packets of powder from Dr. Brown—I analysed them; they presented the same analysis: White arsenic, that is arsenious arsenic, 38.5; potato starch, 54.8; a little magnesia, with possibly a little lead and lime, very small, 6.7; making 100 parts—it was scented, but I took no cognisance of that, it was so minute—the ordinary proper violet powder ought to be made of starch, with a little orris root, and scented; the best is made of com flour—I think it is very undesirable to use <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, that is sulphate of lime—the chief use of violet powder is to prevent chafeing; it is used for children, and by ladies, and for footmen—<hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> is very often used in inferior kinds of violet powder; it is much cheaper than starch—the outward application of the powder containing 38 per cent of arsenic, or any arsenic, would have an injurious effect on children of tender years—it would be absorbed, and in dusting a child with it, no doubt a certain quantity would get into the air and be inhaled; the application of it to the genitals and the rectum would be another means by which the arsenic would find entrance into the system, and after washing, the absorption would be more rapid; if there was any cracking of the skin it would be very rapidly absorbed, and even in a sound skin—I have heard Dr. Brown's description of the state of this child, and in my opinion those appearances would be produced by the outward application of violet powder containing arsenic—on 26th June I was at the London Hospital, when the body of the child was shown to me by Dr. Brown; it was in a very advanced state of decomposi<lb></lb>tion, too far to allow me to give an opinion on the special <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—I first removed the liver, and found in that 1 1/2; grains of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060016"></xptr>
               <p>arsenic: in the stomach and intestines 1 grain, and a trace of arsenic in the kidneys; and from all the other parts I obtained 4 grains, making altogether 6 1/2; grains—that was decidedly sufficient to cause death—the eruption was one of the symptoms of arsenical poisoning—one grain of arsenic is recorded to have killed a man—I think the arsenic I found here might be produced by the outward application of the powder containing it—the relative weights of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and arsenic are 2.3 and 3.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I heard Dr. Brown say that the child died from exhaus<lb></lb>tion—I think the arsenic I found in the body might have entered through the mouth, and the vagina and rectum, apart from that absorbed into the skin; that would account for the exhaustion—the greater the quantity absorbed, the greater would be the exhaustion, and the more speedy if taken in through the apertures than if through the skin—as a ride arsenic is a preventive to decomposition, but there are exceptions where it has been hastened rather than delayed—I do not think the decomposed state of this body was inconsistent with death from arsenical poisoning—I had the prisoner's formulas for the preparation of these powders laid before me; there were two qualities—there was nothing but starch in the first—there was no apparent difference in bulk between the two; unless weighed there would be no perceptible difference to the hand; there might be to the eye—I think I could tell the difference; it is difficult to speak for others.</p>

It is a small establishment—about three or four girls were employed, and a young chap about eighteen or twenty to look after the horses—no one but the girls was employed in the manufacture; their work was filling and folding, not mixing; they had very little to do with the mixing—occasionally they did—various persons mixed the stock; I could not tell who; it was either the girl or the young man that was employed at that time—they passed it through the sieves at different times, so that it might be well mixed.</p>

These are Mr. King's printed lists, from which I took orders; some of the things are priced, and some, not most, of the things were bought from wholesale houses; some were made on the premises; the violet powder was made on the premises—the person who weighed out the materials placed them in a bag, not in a tray; they were left in separate bags till such time as the person, whoever it might be, called to mix them in the tray; they were passed through sieves till they were thoroughly mixed—I can't say that the persons who bought them would know what they were made of—no insect powder or fly paper was made on the premises, nor was any arsenic used; I was not aware that there was anything that contained arsenic—the business has been established ten or twelve years—the things that came from the wholesale houses were kept in the stock-room, and taken out as they were wanted.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>.) On 20th May I went to the prisoner's premises, and served him with two summonses—I read them to him—he made a statement to me which I took down in writing. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I make two kinds of violet powder, best and common. The best is composed of 28lb. Of starch powder, two and a half magnesia, llb. orris root, and five drops of essence of roses; the common of 14lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, 21 of potato floor, three of magnesia, one of orris root, one and a half violet perfume, and five drops of essence of roses. These I purchase of W. and J. Bush and Co., of 21 to 24, Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate. I first purchased <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> of this company on 21st February, 1878; previously of Mr. Fox, chemist and druggist, of Bethnal Green Road. The last purchased of him was on 27th October, 1877. I have Bush and Co. 's invoices, but none from Fox, as all purchases from him were for cash. I have never purchased arsenic, and do not know how it got into the powder. I do know there was arsenic in it, as Mr. Barnard analysed about six packets for me, and found arsenic in two. Directly I received the letter from the Treasury, I sent round to my customers and destroyed all the powder collected." He also said, "I have two horses and three travellers, and one man and four girls in my packing-room." He showed me over the premises—I saw girls there making up Seidlitz powders—he gave me, amongst other things, a specimen of his <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, to see whether there was</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 109, Bethnal Green Road, with my father, as wholesale and retail chemists—we are registered as such—we deal, amongst other things, in <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>, which we sell at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—we should charge that to Mr. King—and cornflour starch at about 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the cwt, and potato starch about 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—28lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we never sell a hundredweight of arsenic—we should charge about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 28lb.; it is very seldom we sell 28lb. of arsenic—I do not know Mr. King as a customer; as a ready-money customer, very likely I should not know him—if he or his daughter came and purchased <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> over the counter, there would be no entry made; he would pay for it, and carry it away—these packets produced contain 28lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and 28lb. of white arsenic; I weighed them myself—the paper is exactly the same, but the arsenic is in a smaller bag—we should deliver 28lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> in a parcel like that; a hundredweight we should deliver in a cask or bag—I also produce two bottles, one containing <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and the other white arsenic, 4 oz. in each—we deal in white arsenic—we have a poison-room, in which poisons are kept—we generally have white arsenic in stock, and no doubt we had in February, 1877—it is kept in an iron-bound cask with a head—if an order for white arsenic was to be executed, our man would line a bag like this brown paper, to make it stronger, take it into the poison-room, put in the quantity by guess as near as he could, take it downstairs and weigh it, and deliver it—if 28lb., or any quantity beyond a pound, was sold to an ordinary customer, to be paid for at the time, the man in the shop would always have to come to us to get the price, and our instructions are that it should be entered in the poison-book—that does not extend to sale by wholesale—I have the poison-book here—if a written order is brought, we should instruct the man to keep it and file it—this book contains entries of the sales of poisons from October 21, 1875, to November 30, 1877—on 22nd February, 1877, there is an entry of 20lb. to a Mr. Steele, he had had it before I believe—the next entry before that is January 28, 1877, 4lb. and 7lb.; and the next before that January 19, 14lb.—there is no entry in this book of 28lb.—if a person came for <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> the man in the same way would take a bag, I expect not lined in that case, take, it to the warehouse at the bottom of the yard, about 20 or 30 yards from the shop, fill the bag with it and give it out—the poison room is upstairs in a different building—we buy <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> of a broker in Mincing Lane; the railway sometimes deliver it, sometimes we fetch it, in 2-cwt. bags—we get the arsenic in an iron-bound keg, and it is kept in the cask in which it comes—we have never had a complaint about our <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>—it is principally used for violet powder; also for making ornaments for wedding cakes and sweetmeats, as a kind of plaster-of-paris—my partner is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. We generally weigh the goods as they come in; the <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> is generally weighed because we generally find it abort weight—the arsenic would be weighed in the same machine; it is a platform machine—I never knew an arsenic cask leak, they are always very strong—we take the arsenic out of the cask with a scoop, which is kept in the cask—all</p>

               <p>the persons employed have access to the poison room—if the man brought down 20lb., when only 14lb. was wanted, he would have to take the surplus back; if he forgot it I think someone else would see it—<hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> and arsenic are very similar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Both my father and I gave evidence at the inquest—the respective values of white arsenic and <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi> are 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I do not say that all our poisons are kept in one room—the liquid poisons are kept in the cellar; none of the solids to my knowledge—I should certainly say they could not be carried there by accident—I have interfered with the storing in the cellar ever since I have been in the business, about 17 years—the last time I went there to store anything would be about six months ago—I am there every day; I superintend the entire place and take a very active part in the business—we have two shops, and in the shop where these large poisons would be likely to be sold there are two men, and a man would be sent in to help if required—we should not sell a large parcel of arsenic or any other large parcel of poisons in our retail shop—I am certain not 28lb. of arsenic—the arsenic when sold would be brought down and put in the scale, and if too much, it would be scooped out of the bag and taken back upstairs in the scoop—it is a large scoop with sides—it would be taken up before the customer left and restored to the cask—to my knowledge arsenic is never sold without a written order—I cannot swear that it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I can undertake to say that 14lb. would not be sold without a written order.</p>

I don't think it possible that two customers would be in the shop at the same time, one for 28lb. of arsenic and the other for 28lb. of <hi rend="italic">terra alba</hi>—there is no entry of it in the poison book; it is possible, such a thing might happen; but in that case I should expect to find it in the poison book—we do not balance the quantities of poisons; we take stock, but we cannot tell day by day what quantity goes out, or what money there is in the till for it—we do not enter every separate thing we sell <hi rend="smallCaps">

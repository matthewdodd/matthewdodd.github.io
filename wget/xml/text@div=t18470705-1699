                  </hi> I am a labourer. On the 9th of June, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing by St. Andrew's-terrace, Waterloo-road—I saw the prisoner—she asked me whether I would go home with her—I went with her to No. 5, St. Andrew's-terrace—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was her demand, and some gin—when I had been there about twenty minutes, she put her hand into my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and took half-a-crown out—I had my frock on—I wanted the half-crown from her—I saw it in her hand, and asked her for it, and tried to get it back—I did not get it—she said she would not give it me—she went up stairs—I followed her to the front room on the first-floor—there was another female in that room, laying on the bed—I asked for the money again—the prisoner would not give it me—she came down stairs—I followed her, and asked for the money—she wanted</p>

               <p>to turn me out, and would not give me the money—she called out for the other girl, who was up stairs, who came, and a young man also—the prisoner struck me over the legs with a pair of tongs, and the other woman struck me over the head with a poker—they knocked me about so that I did not know where I was—when I came to my senses, I was outside the house—I did not have my half-crown—I was taken to the hospital, and had my head dressed.</p>

On Wednesday, the 9th of June, I was called to No. 5, St. Andrew's-terrace, Waterloo-road—I found the prosecutor lying outside the door on the footpath, with his head bleeding very much—I saw a wound—I tried to raise him—he was not able to stand—I sent for a surgeon—he came, and washed his head, and strapped it up—another constable came, and we raised him up in a chair—the other constable rapped nine or ten times at the door of No. 5—he went in, and brought out the prisoner, and four other persons—by that time the prosecutor had come to his senses, and he pointed out the prisoner as the one that struck him with the tongs—I took her to the station—the other constable took Trussell to the hospital—he appeared as if he had been drinking—I cannot say whether his insensibility was from drink or not.</p>

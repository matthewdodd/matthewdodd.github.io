                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, and live at 51, Green-street, Stepney—on Saturday, 3d March, I was at King's Cross, opposite the Great Northern Railway, at the corner of the triangle—the street there is about 36 feet broad—I saw the deceased on my left as you come from the railway—she touched my left arm—she was coming from the railway side, and stepped into the gutter to cross the road—she had an umbrella in her right hand and a tin can in her left, and was walking at a moderate pace for an old lady—I looked right and left, but saw nothing coming—when she had got about 15 feet, or nearly half-way across, a cart came along very fast, which the prisoner was driving—the horse was running at much the same pace as those steam fire<lb></lb>engines go to a fire; that is the only thing I can compare it to—I am not a judge of miles—it was a very fast pace—I live close to the Wellclose<lb></lb>square fire<lb></lb>engine station, and have an opportunity of judging—the horse was running—I understand it must either be a gallop</p>

               <p>or a trot, I cannot decide which it was, so I give it in favour of the prisoner, and say that it was a trot—when the old lady was half-way across the road the horse knocked her down, and the off wheel went over her head and crushed it—I ran up, expecting to see her alive, but she was dead to my belief—it was a common two-wheeled cart, drawn by one horse, and I understand from the prisoner that there were two cases of rabbits in it—the prisoner stopped about 27 yards in front, and I went up to him—I did not know him before—I said, "Tom, you have run over this poor woman, and the best thing you can do is to get down and go back"—he said, "Have I? I could not help it; I tried to pull up," or words to that effect—it is two months since the accident—the prisoner was partially drunk—I went to the station, and then to the hospital.</p>

I am a traveller of 55, Platt-street, Camden<lb></lb>town—I was in the Euston-road about half-past two, just in the act of crossing the Caledonian-road, and heard a vehicle coming at a furious rate—I turned round and saw the prisoner driving the cart at the rate of twelve miles an hour, a lad was in the cart with him—I am a judge of the pace of a horse—I was walking at the rate of five miles an hour and I commenced running, which increased my pace to eight, but I could not get anywhere near the cart, which convinced me that the man was going at twelve miles an hour—I followed it because I anticipated that an accident would occur from the furious way he was driving, and also because he was on the off-side in<lb></lb>stead of the near-side—I heard a crash, followed on and saw something in the road, which, as soon as I got up, the off wheel was in the act of passing over; it was the poor woman's head—I saw that her blood and brains were gone—her face was completely smashed, and I saw part of the blood and brains on the wheel—the prisoner got out of the cart and left the lad in it; he got out to see what had occurred—I sent for a policeman, one he had passed and one came from the palings opposite the station—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Butler's-buildings, East Smithfield—on Saturday, 3d February, I was in St. Katharine's-docks with Wright—I left in the cart with him; he was quite sober—he stopped at the Woolpack in the Minories, where we had a pot of beer between four of us, and in Wel<lb></lb>lington-square, where we had a pint between two of us—from there we went up Bagnigge-wells-road—when we ran over the woman we were going at seven or eight miles an hour, not more than eight miles—I saw the woman as far in front of us as from the clock to here—I called out and so did Wright, but she took no notice—Wright tried to pull up all he could, but was not able; he pulled up about six feet afterwards, and stopped the cart of his own accord after the accident—he drove the cart to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, of 21, Montpellier-terrace, Notting-hill—I saw the cart coming along Euston-road, and when it got within eight yards of the deceased, the driver called to her to stop, and pulled the horse up at the same time, but she was knocked down and the cart passed over her—I was about twenty yards off—the cart was going six or seven miles an hour—I am a cab driver and accustomed to horses—when he called out the woman seemed to take no notice, and then she seemed to wake up sud<lb></lb>denly when the horse was upon her, as if she was deaf or deeply in thought—I saw Wright; he was perfectly sober—I believe he stopped the horse as soon as ever he could—I gave evidence before the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Sutton-street, and am a watchman in the employ of the Midland Railway Company—I was so near to the cart, that I saw the shaft catch the woman, and knock her down, and the wheel went over her—the man in the cart called out several times, and he seemed to be holding the reins in his hands as hard as he could, trying to stop the horse—she had ample time to get out of the way, if she had heard him—I did not see him till he was in the act of pulling up—the pace was very slow then, because it was partly stopped—he pulled up directly after the accident, and drew up at the side, it may be as far off as from you to me—I pro-nounced</p>

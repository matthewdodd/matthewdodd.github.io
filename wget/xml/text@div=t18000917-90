             sworn. - Drewee lodged with me, he is a Switzerland man; the prisoner lodged with me two or three months before Drewee, I always found him a very honest man; on Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop; about twelve o'clock, he had not slept at home on the Saturday night; I had several times given him leave to wear my shoes and boots; on Sunday morning, I saw him with a large pair of shoes on, and a pair of stockings; I asked him how he came by those shoes; he said Drewee had lent them to him, and he went out; when Drewee came back, he missed the property in the indictment; I saw no more of him till Drewee brought him into my house, about ten or eleven o'clock on Monday morning; I don't think he would have done it, but he was in liquor, and he wanted to go to see his sweetheart on Sunday, which made him put these things on; he was so very much in liquor, that he could not tell what he had done with the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor on the Saturday night, and I asked Drewee to lend me some clean things to go out with; he said, he would; I went up into the room, but could not find him, and I took them; I went out, and spent the day with my friend that I had got intoxicated with, and, as I was coming home on the Sunday evening, I met with a girl that asked me to go home and sleep with her, which I did, and when I got up in the morning, I had got nothing left but the shoes; I told Drewee that I would make him any recompence in my power. (The shoes were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

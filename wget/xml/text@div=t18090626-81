            's butter shop; he took down a shutter; the shop is enclosed by shutters only. I followed him, and found him try the lock of Mrs. Taylor's, another butter shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he perceive you, so as to leave this shop of Mr. Cullom's - A. He never saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take down the shutter entirely - A. Yes, he never attempted to get in; he went to Mr. Jones's, there he attempted to pick the locks, they were all in Newgate market, and butter shops; having seen him at these three, I thought it my duty to take him in custody. I was forced to have a great deal of assistance, he drew a knife upon me. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you took him, had you any reason to suppose that the man had not his senses about him - A. I had not the least reason at all; I have taken him backwards and forwards four times. I had no reason to suspect that he was out of his senses.</p>
               <p>MR. HODSON. You are a medical professor - you attend the Compter - A. Yes; I saw this man on Tuesday morning, I saw him again with Peppercorn; I thought he was in a state of insanity, but I wished for another day to be more satisfied of his conduct; I had that opportunity. I reported to Mr. Alderman Smith, that he was under the influence of insanity. I asked Mr. Tegg, the keeper of the Compter; he informed me this man had been there on former occasions, as an insane man. I had him remanded for one day, because I would make up my mind.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are of opinion, that he was insane at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260063"></xptr>time he committed the offence.</p>

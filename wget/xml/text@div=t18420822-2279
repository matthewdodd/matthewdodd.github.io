On the 15th of August, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I was passing New Broad-street, and heard a noise like a lock being forced inside No. 19, which is the Peace Society's Office—I stopped listening a little time—I then called for Thomas, another policeman, and sent for the sergeant—we continued listening about twenty minutes—I went round to the back of the building, in Bell-square, and in about five or ten minutes heard a noise as though some one was coming over the roofs of the out-buildings—I stood at the corner of the square, and distinctly saw the two prisoners drop into the square—I immediately took Palmer into custody—the place where they</p>

I was with Blay on the night of the 15th of August—I heard very distinctly the forcing of locks, while listening at the door, I fetched the sergeant, and then we all three listened—Blay then went round the square, by order of the sergeant, and I placed another policeman in Broad-street—I and the sergeant remained at the door, we knocked and all was then quiet—we then heard a jumbling noise, like getting on the roof of the premises—I ran round directly to the London Missionary Society house, thinking they might go through their pre<lb></lb>mises, because they are unoccupied at night—I heard Blay call for assist<lb></lb>ance, in Bell-square—I ran to his assistance, and Brown, who is a most no<lb></lb>torious thief, ran away from me—I attempted to seize him by the chest—</p>

               <p>he got away from me—I followed him through Finsbury-circus, and took him in Little Moorfields, about a quarter of a mile from Bell-square—I did not lose sight of him at all—a private watchman tried to stop him, but he knocked him down, and ran away—I laid hold of him, and took him into custody—I afterwards went back to the house—I found no person inside who could have made the noise—I, the sergeant, and the other policeman got in by means of the lamplighter's ladder, at the time he was putting the gas out—a ladder was afterwards found inside.</p>

On the night of the 15th I was at these premises, in company with the two other officers—after the prisoners were in custody I got into the premises, by borrowing two short ladders of Mr. Jay, the builder—we joined them together by our belts, and got on the roof of the premises, and into the inner office—I found the place in confusion—the lock of the door had been broken open, and the door which leads from the back-warehouse to the front was partly broken from the panel—the lock had been forced, but being a mortice lock, they could not open it—I found a rope lying on the floor, directly under the skylight—it had a large weight attached to it, but they had taken that off—I have not got the weight here, I have only brought the rope—it is evi<lb></lb>dently what the parties were let down by to cut the cornice of the skylight, and it fits—I showed the inspector that it was possible for a man to get through, by getting through myself—I did not get in by the rope—by one person getting down, and putting the ladder on the table, the other could easily get down—he could assist the other down—these are the articles I found.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of October I came to town with the Newbury waggon, with a load to Mr. Pengree's, on Snow-hill. The prisoner, who was <rs id="t17811017-51-deflabel254" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

I bought five guineas-worth of them, and carried them to Newbury. The parcel contained 7 l. 10 s. worth of halfpence: while I was putting them off at Newbury, there was a noise in the town, and I was sent for to the mayor. I told him where I got them, upon which an officer was sent with me from Newbury to London, to find out the man. I was taken to the Solicitor of the Mint; he directed me to go and buy five guineas-worth more, and that Mr. Clarke, and some officers, should be in waiting to take the man. Accordingly I went to Mr. Pengree's: I saw Jones, and desired that he and Holder would bring five guineas-worth of halfpence to the Three Tuns, in Fleet-market: at six o'clock Holder came, with a parcel of halfpence under his arm, and was secured by the Bow-street officers. Jones came when Holder was in custody, and was likewise secured.</p>

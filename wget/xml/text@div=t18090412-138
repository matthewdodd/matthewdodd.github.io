               <p>MR. HINKSMAN. Q. I believe you are a <rs id="t18090412-138-viclabel835" type="occupation">ribbon manufacturer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18090412-138-victim1185 t18090412-138-viclabel835"></join>, in Wood-street - A. I am. On the 17th of February I left my house about a quarter before six; at the time I got into Lawrence-lane the day light was gone. As I turned up Lawrence-lane, I noticed the two prisoners, and four more, in the act, as I considered them, to rob the warehouse of the prosecutors. Nightingale was at the window, and particularly active; and Lawrence was watching at the door; I stood opposite about eight minutes; I could see them from the reflection of the light within. It was evident they were attempting to make an entry. Nightingale was trying to make a hole in the shutter; I afterwards found a hole there, and the pin out. I saw them active; and from their motions, I concluded the job was done. I went over to Mr. Hixon, he and I went towards the warehouse; at the very instant as we came out of door, we walked towards the prosecutor's. Lawrence left the door of the prosecutor's and walked over the away; and when I had come to the door, a clerk of the house had opened the door; I said to him, are you robbed; I pointed out the prisoner Lawrence, I said that is one, we both collared him. I told the clerk to hold fast, as I saw there was going to be a rescue attempted. Three of them from the corner of Cateaton-street were coming up in a menacing posture, I let go Lawrence to take hold of Nightingale, he was one of the three that came; he put himself in a position for fighting, I said you are one, I will have you; he went by me to rescue Lawrence, he struck the witness who had hold of Lawrence, I closed with him; in the scuffle he fell, and I rather went over him; another of the party came up to rescue Nightingale; I then said I would have them both; the short one ran up Castle-court; I followed Nightingale into King-street, there I lost sight of him; he was brought back in four or five minutes to the warehouse. I have not the least doubt that he was the man that I had the conflict with. Lawrence never escaped at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Nightingale came back did you examine the state of his clothes - A. Before I looked I said his knee is dirty, as a corresponding proof of it. I am positive he is the man without that circumstance; I have seen his face before many times; and I am positive that Lawrence is the man that watched the door; when I went into the warehouse I found the window open, and I saw it open in the street. They had made a hole in the window frame; the pin had fell on the counter.</p>
               <p>MR. HARKER. Q. You are clerk to the prosecutor's - A. I am, On the evening spoken of I heard an unusual noise at the window; at first I thought it was our private door; I sent my friend first, and then I came to the door, Mr. Hinckesman pointed out Lawrence to me, I went over and collared him, and brought him into the warehouse; he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What species of goods were in the window that might be taken away -

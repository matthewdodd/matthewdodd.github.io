                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Grogin-street, Stan<lb></lb>gate. On the 2nd of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop for half-an-ounce weight of tobacco—I served him—he laid me down a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he went out—after he was gone I found it was a bad shilling—I went out, and could not find him—I gave the shilling to my wife, who put it on the shelf—on the following Tuesday (the 7th) between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came again for the same article—my wife served him—I knew him—he gave a shilling—my wife took it, bent it, and said, "It is a bad one, and you are the person that was here last Thursday; I know you',—I secured the door, shut it, and went outside, but did not leave the door—he got out of the shop—I caught him by the collar, and gave him to a policeman—my wife gave the officer the second shilling directly.</p>

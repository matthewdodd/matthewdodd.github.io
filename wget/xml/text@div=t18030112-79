I heard him say also, that one of the casks was concealed in a ditch, near the Plough, covered with needs, or nettles; I then took them into custody, and the cask was searched for, and found.</p>

             sworn. - I was at plough in Bow-Common-field, and about nine o'clock in the morning of the 4th of December, I saw the prisoner, Wright, with something under his coat; as we had lost a great number of turnips, I asked him what he had got there; he said it was something good to drink, and asked me to drink; I tasted, and found it to be bitters; when I had been one round with my plough, I returned, and saw the two prisoners bury a cask in the ground. Davis was my fellow-servant, and worked in the field; I went up to him, and saw him sitting on the cask of bitters, and the cask of anniseed was buried in the ground; my master came into the field, and I related it to him; we went to the ground and found the cask of anniseed as I had told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the men were gone before he came? - A. Yes; I carried the cask to Mr. Horn, and after that, Davis came and fetched another cask out of the ditch, which he wrapped up in his smock frock, and carried to the Plough public-house.(Three casks produced, and identified).</p>
               <p>Wright's defence. I was looking for work as a labourer, and found two casks in a ditch; I did not know what was in them, but took them into the field where that man was at work; we drank of them, and Davis came up, and said he would get me some breakfast at a public-house, I went there with him, and was taken.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. I was at work, and Wright came by me; I saw him and the ploughman drinking, I went up and asked the man where he got it; he said he found it in a ditch.</p>

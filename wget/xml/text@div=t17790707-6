               <p>I lived servant with a Mrs. Panton, at No. 6, King-street. The prisoner used to bring bread to my mistress; he asked my mistress, on the 9th of February, to let me go and pledge this watch for him. I pledged it for 15 s. and brought him the duplicate of it; he redeemed it himself, I believe, he brought a watch to me again to pledge in March; he said it was the same, I pledged it for 18 s. he was arrested at the time. He gave it me before the bailiff, and desired me to get a guinea upon it; I could get but 18 s.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to his Majesty's Palace Court. I arrested the prisoner on the 15th of March; he took this watch out of his pocket and gave it to the last witness to pawn, who brought 18 s. upon it.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was this watch? - I do not know the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a watchmaker owed me some money; he said business was very bad, and asked me to have a watch of him. I gave the prisoner authority to bespeak a watch of him; I suppose that was the watch he pawned first.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner any liberty to wear your watch? - No; it was sometimes in the bakehouse to shew the time of day, to draw bread by.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Worship-street: I attended the search of the prisoner's lodgings on Monday the 22d of February; I found a black cloak in a cubboard next the fire-place; I then searched the drawers, and found a pair of gloves and this half-handkerchief, and a duplicate in a tea-chest, which she had the key of; she produced the key to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson. These are my gloves; they were in the pocket of the coat when I left it.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, (produces a shift); this duplicate corresponds with the one on the shift.</p>
               <p>Miss Williams. This is my mother's; it was lost on the 3d of December, at the same time that the cloak was.</p>
               <p>Reeve. I can't tell who the person was that brought it; it was a woman, and it is in the name of Hannet Hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Sunday night I had two acquaintances come to tea and supper; and at ten o'clock my acquaintances were going home; this cloak was on the stairs, I said, I know who it belongs to; I thought they had company, and I did not open the door, but hung it over a washing-tub, at the top of the stairs; being in a hurry, on Monday morning, I thought nothing about the cloak, and when Mr. Atkinson and the officer came it surprised me; and I did not think of the cloak, I had forgot it.(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character).</p>

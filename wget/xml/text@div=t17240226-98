The Prosecutor depos'd, The Prisoner using to come frequently to his Shop, and there read Books, he had miss'd Books, was inform'd by his Servant that no Body had been there but the Prisoner, and that he had seen him once put a Book in his Pocket, and carry'd it away without saying any Thing to him. That he gave Orders to watch the Prisoner narrowly; and he coming to his Shop the Day mentioned in the Indictment; he went out, leaving only the Maid to look after the Shop, and plac'd himself so that he could see the Prisoner, and the Prisoner sent the Maid out to fetch him some Brandy; while she was gone he put the Books into his Pocket, and after the Maid was come back, and he had drank the Brandy, he went away, as in a Hurry; that he follow'd him, and taxed him with having the Books, but the Prisoner deny'd it, till he took one or two of them out of his Pocket, but afterwards pull'd out the rest, and offer'd him 5 Guineas not to take any further Notice of it. The Prisoner did not deny his taking the Books, but alledg'd, it was his common Method, when he saw Books, that he had a Mind to read, to take them in his Pocket, and if he lik'd them, to come afterwards and pay for them, or to return them: and said, that when he was going out, he told the Maid he had the Books, but she deny'd it. Mr. Mayham, a Bookseller testified, That he had taken Books as clandestinely in his Shop, and came afterwards and paid honestly for them, tho' he knew nothing of his having had them; and added, that the Books which the Prosecutor valued at 15 s. were scarcely worth above 5 s. A great many persons of Character appeared to his Reputation, who gave him a very good Character; but of late he was a little disorder'd in his Head, and sometimes did Actions through Incogitancy, which were irregular. They also produced Evidences, that the Prosecutor demanded 50 Guineas to drop the Prosecution: then 20, and then came down to, and insisted on 15.

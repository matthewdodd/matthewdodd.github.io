                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CATHERINE CRAWFURD</hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Crawfurd, who keeps the Hutchinson Arms, Davenport-street, Ratcliffe. On the 6th of June, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was in the bar (my hus<lb></lb>band was not at home, he always goes to the counting-house in Crown-court, on a Tuesday)—my servant, Mary Coleman, was at home—I saw the prisoners come in together with another female—they looked into the tap<lb></lb>room, the parlour, and skittle ground, and walked out again—there was nobody in any of those places—they did not take any thing—about five minutes afterwards, the male prisoner entered and called for a pint of beer, which he paid for—hethen asked me if I was Mrs. Crawfurd—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I demand of you £10"—I said, "My good man, what for?"—he said, "If you do not give it to me, it will be the worst day's work you ever did, for 1 will serve you as Greenacre served Mr. Brown"—I am quite sure he used that expression—he repeated several times about Greenacre, and I was very much alarmed—I said I was not to be frightened out of £10, or ten pence, and he then left the house—I sent for Mrs. Richardson, a neighbour, who came—she went into the bar parlour, and I was telling her the circumstance, when the female prisoner entered the house—I had seen her once before, about six or eight week ago, and my servant Coleman and myself had our fortunes told by her then—(she could not see Mrs. Richardson)—she then asked me for a glass of gin and peppermint—I gave her gin only, which she paid for—she then said, "You had better give me that teji sovereigns which if demanded of you,"—I said I was not to be frightened out of ten pounds or ten pence—I am sure I said that to her—she said if I did not, she would 11 Greenacre" me; she would serve me as Greenacre served Mrs. Brown; but if I would give it to her she would makeit all right; that Mr. Crawfurd had set her to watch my actions; that Crawfurd had another wife, and that I should be turned into the street—with that Mr. Richardson whom I had sent for came in, and Mrs. Richardson came out of the parlour and said to the prisoner. "Are vou not ashamed to stand and abuse a respect<lb></lb>able female?"—Mr. Richardson said it was only an attempt to extort money, and he would kick her out if she did not get out—she made use of a very dreadful expression, which I cannot repeat—she said Mr. Richardson was one of our confederates, meaning of me and the girl—the servant girl heard the whole of it—the psisoner then left, and on the step she took a very dreadful oath, and said I had better give her the money, or it would be the worse for me—she did not say any thine else that I remember.</p>

               <p>what she wanted me to do to her husband, because he was an old man, and she wanted to have the clerk—they have turned the pot-boy away who could prove it—his name is Jack—here are Mr. Crawford's drawers, which she gave me out of the bar one day—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—she told me he wore them all the winter.</p>

My father keeps a linen-draper's shop at 96, Lambeth Road—on Saturday, 4th January, I served the prisoner with a reel of black cotton; she gave me a bad shilling—I said "Give me back my cotton, this is a bad shilling"—she gave me a half-crown, and said "That is good"—my mother came into the shop and called a neighbour, who said "This is the girl who gave me a bad two-shilling piece a fortnight ago"—my mother gave her in charge.</p>

On 4th January my daughter said something—I went into the shop and she gave me a bad shilling, saying the prisoner gave it to her—I looked at the plaintiff, and fetched a woman from next door, and I said she was the person who gave me a bad florin a fortnight before—that was on 22nd December, between 8 and 9 o'clock, when I served her with a pair of garters—she gave me a florin, and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I kept the florin in a little box, and afterwards gave it to my son with three shillings to pay for something—my son returned with the florin, which was cut, and said that it was bad—I gave the florin and shilling to the constable—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who was there a fortnight before.</p>

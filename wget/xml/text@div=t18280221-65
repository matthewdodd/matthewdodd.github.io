               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it his general duty to take out goods, and receive money for them? A. He has done so frequently since, and I believe before, and paid it in - it was certainly his duty; he was sent home with goods, with a bill and receipt; he was not to enter what he received, but to bring it to Peach, who entered it; when I changed his employ, it was because he was unfit for a groom.</p>

            . In January last, I managed Mr. Evans' business in Finsbury-place; the prisoner was the out-door porter. On the 11th of January I sent him with a lamp-shade, and iron-heater, to Mr. Kingdon; they came to 12s.; I saw him on his return - he brought back some candlesticks to be repaired; they were returned on the 15th, by him, and a bill of the whole, (which was 13s. 6d.) made out, as he had not paid me the 12s.; and, on his return, he said Mr. Kingdon would want some other things; that he would send, and look them out, and pay altogether - he has never brought this money to account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after this did he stay in Mr. Evans' service? A. Till the 30th of January - he was then taken in charge; I do not know what wages he had; our premises are in the City, in Finsbury-place South - he was paid at Fish-street-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he took money this in advance, intending to allow it when he was paid? A. That I cannot say; I believe he was paid every Saturday night; the 11th of January was on a Friday; I saw him take out the lampshade.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Sear, who keeps a shop in Bedford bury. He does not live in the house—I live there—on Sunday morning, the 27th of May, I left the house—I fastened the shop and the other doors—we have only the shop, parlour, and cellar—I do not know how many rooms there are in the house—you can go from our part of the house to the rest of it—every thing was safe when I went away—I returned about half-past ten o'clock at night—I had bolted the back door in<lb></lb>side—I went in at the street-door, and then into the parlour—I observed that a box in the parlour was forced open, and missed from it a shawl, a cloak, a fan, three yards of calico, a work-box, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers of mine—I had left a silk handkerchief on the table when I went out, and that was gone—two squares of glass were broken in the side window to attempt to throw it up—it was unscrewed, but could not be opened as it was nailed down—they had got over a fence which parts our yard from another, and taken a square of glass out of the folding doors, which sepa<lb></lb>rates our part of the house from the other, and that would enable them to get in.</p>

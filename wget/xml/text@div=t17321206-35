            . On Tuesday last, between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon, as I was going from Hackney to Newington, the Prisoner stopt me, and swore I should deliver. For God's Sake! Says I, save my Life, and I'll give you what I have, and with that I gave 3 d. Farthing. That won't do, says he, you must give me something else. Then he pull'd out a Shoemaker's Knife, struck me in the Face, threw me down, took my Bundle, and run away; but Assistance coming in time, he was taken.</p>

I jump'd over a Bank, and saw the Prisoner come from the Prosecutor with a Bundle in his Hand. He saw me coming, he threw the Bundle towards her and run. I proceeded after him for about a Mile, and he was not once out of my Sight till I laid hold on him. I took this Shoemaker's Knife from him. He begg'd me not to bring him to Justice, and said, he would do so no more.</p>

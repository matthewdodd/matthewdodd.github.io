I presently recovered myself, and turned round upon him, and took hold of his Collar. I asked him who he was and what he wanted? He made me no Answer, but kept cursing me in an inward Manner; at last I got hold of his Stick, and then he struggled and got from me. I pursued him crying Stop Thief! as loud as I could, and he ran down Ivy-Lane, and about 5 or 6 Doors down the Lane, was stopped by a Watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says after I struck him I took him by his Collar and by his Waist; ask him if I offered to touch him?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you tell him by word of mouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I refused it, certainly—he wished to have the power of indorsing any draft, and I refused—he said, "Give me authority to indorse drafts and cheques to order"—I refused that authority—I said, "No; I will not give that privilege to any person—I came up to Loudon in June last, to take posses<lb></lb>sion of the stock books, and see what was going on—I was then in better health, and I came to attend to my business—I told Josslyn that I had come to look into my business—he said nothing particular; I just came to the place, and attended to the business—we had conversations subsequently—when I Had looked at the books I found entries in the "Accounts received book," which are falsely made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Each day is headed, and the receipt for that day are put down in that book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—I called Josslyn's attention to the entries of 4th July, 1861, and demanded an explanation—they are entries from various country customers, and they are supposed to be amounts received by Hitchman, the traveller—he had been that ground in April and May, and he had another journey subsequently; that is entered before this—it would be Josslyn's duty to see that Hitchman gave in an account when ha came from a journey—I asked, Josslyn how that was, and he referred me to Hitchman for an explanation; after that answer we parted—there are some entries here that give false dates—the post-marks are by Woollard; that is, the postings of the ledger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean merely that the references at the side are in Woollard's handwriting, or the posting itself if in Woollard's handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The postings themselves, I apprehend, are in Woollard's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it comes under the head of 4th July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) "Parsons, Colchester, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>" over it are the figures "26," and above that is "April"—on looking at that I understand it to mean that the money was received on 26th April—I had an explanation also from Woollard about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186111250062"></xptr>
               <p>order things by letter, and sometimes otherwise; sometimes through the traveller, and sometimes by calling—I do not call it a quarrel that we had—I had two travellers out in the country at the time Mr. Josslyn left my service—we have had two out constantly between 1858 and 1861—he has given commissions to other people who are not strictly travellers; commis<lb></lb>sion travellers; I suppose about four or perhaps five, besides my regular travellers—the commission travellers transmitted orders as well as money—it was the duty of the travellers in the country to write letters from day to day as to what orders they had received, as well as what money they had received—it was the duty of Mr. Josslyn to open all the letters that came to my warehouse at Gresham-street, to see what orders were in them, and to see what monies were paid and transmitted—it is quite possible that he would find an order in one letter for so many different sorts of needles—it would be his duty to give the order out to be put up by other persons—at one time it would have been Miss Cawthorue's duty, at another time Miss Hill's duty—it would have been his duty to see that the orders were executed—I cannot say how many petty orders might come on an average in a day from the country for him to look to their being executed—if the traveller transmitted monies or cheques, the prisoner would have to account for them in his book—the travellers would send up what sums they had in hand, and he would credit them—they would send it up by cheque, or notes, or any way that would be convenient to them—the traveller might send up a bill of exchange sometimes if he chose; there would be no reason why he should not—if he had a bill sent by the customer he would, send it up—credit would be given to our customers—if they accept bills they come into the ordinary cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing one of your customers could not pay, and he said, "I will accept a bill for, we will say, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months or so on," would that be sent up to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The proper course would be for it to be drawn at the warehouse; it would not be sent up—it would be drawn at the ware-house, sent down for acceptance, and then returned to the warehouse—that was also the manager's duty; it was a very light one, probably two or three hills a week to draw—they would not average two or three a week—when 1 say two or three a week I put it at the utmost limit—it would be his duty also to exercise his judgment as to whether he could give that credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say sometimes the traveller would write and say, "I will have a cheque for you at Thompson and Company's," or something of that sort; "Miss Tomkins has directed her banker, Barclay's, to pay you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you will find a cheque there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That might occur, but it would be a very rare thing—I gave him no power to indorse cheques—I have given a power of a limited character, which I can explain—the power is this; he is to sign cheques by procuration to pay in, but not to indorse—I wrote to my banker, in all probability, at the early part of the engagement, when he came in—my bankers are Puget, Bainbridge's, and Company—one of their clerks is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is a clerk who knows how often he has signed your name by pro<lb></lb>curation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The clerk has come for another purpose—unless this clerk knows how often from 1858 to 1861 he signed my name by procuration, I cannot tell you—the cheques to which I allow him to sign my name by pro<lb></lb>curation are cheques to be paid in, country cheques—the course of business is this: a country customer writes to Gresham-street and says, "Call at Barclay's," or some other house, "for so much money;" a person is sent to Barclay's country office, and inquires for a cheque, the name of H. Walker,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186111250063"></xptr>
               <p>of the amount stated, from the town the party writes from; that is the first step; then the cheque comes back to the warehouse, and the thing is signed by procuration for H. Walker, by Josslyn—his duty, on receiving such a letter from a country customer, was to send for the cheque, not to go for it—I do not know that over and over again he went and signed the cheque by procuration—I am not certain about it—he would send some person, and that person would get a cheque from Barclay's, filled all but the signature, and then he would have to sign it—post-office orders used to come up some<lb></lb>times—he would sign them, and pay them in to my bankers—sometimes country bank notes used to come up—there were commission travellers, regular travellers, and private customers writing from the country every day, with reference to orders and to payments; that is the ordinary course of business—I have no London travellers out at the present time—between 1858 and 1861 there were probably four.</p>

               <p>in that book—he would not enter that again—he counts up the day's monies and the cash accounts received, and then that day's money is carried to this book; each day is carried in—I had in the warehouse during the time, from 1859 to 1861, two females, Miss Hill and Miss Cawthorne—there would also be Woollard, Thorpe, Greenway, Jones a boy, and I believe there was another name, but I cannot recollect—they would not be there all at one time—there would be five in my employ at one time—it would be the two young ladies who would have the privilege of selling packets of needles, and receiving the money for them—if Woollard was out, at the banker's, they would be obliged to take the monies, and also receive debts that were due—Woollard would also do the same—it would be their duty to hand the money over to Josslyn—he would depend on the integrity of the others for what they gave him being all right—I do not recollect any other duties that he had to do, besides those I have enumerated—he did not come in the morning at half past 8 and open the establishment—he came at a quarter to 9—his time for leaving varied from half-past 6 to 7, and on Saturday earlier—3 o'clock is our time on Saturday—I really cannot tell how long that has existed—as soon as he had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had to pay the money into my banker's—that was the rule laid down; and another instruction was, that he should never pass a week without a balancing—he was at all times to balance the entire receipts on the Saturday—as he sent money to the bankers, he sent one of these slips of paper—they make their own investigation of that paper, and send it back—if he sent in a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country note I cannot tell at all whether the bankers would know that he did so—I cannot tell whether the bankers would be able to tell whether that entry of "notes 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on 22d September, applied to country or town notes—there is a banker's clerk here—I cannot tell whether there is to anybody here who can tell you what amounts made up the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and what kind of monies made up the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the slip of paper would be sent with the money—when that had got the initial of the banker's clerk, the prisoner transmitted it to me—how often he sent them to me would depend upon circumstances; for instance, how often he got them—when he had paid monies in, he sent me these down, and I kept them down at Alcester—I have a great many of them—the prisoner was suspended on 15th July, and discharged on the 16th, which was Tuesday, I think—it was in consequence of something in the account of Hitchman—I do not know what has become of Hitchman—he was in my service up to 20th June, or thereabouts—he was country traveller—I did not discharge him—he has gone away—I had him in my service about eighteen months, I think—I can give you the exact date.</p>

W. bill," is a bill sent to me—that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is a bill with another name—accounts received are on the left-hand side; paid to bank, on the right-hand—I cannot tell how long I discovered Halford's case before I gave the prisoner into custody—I should say six weeks after he had left—I had to go down in the country two or three times—I had to go through the books two or three times before I found it out, and made it plain to myself—I think in Miss Pfeil's case, there were two half notes sent up—her letters are in Court—my impression is, that she sent up the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two halves—I did take the trouble to investigate—it would not follow that two half notes would be paid into the bank, because we received two half notes—they may or they may not have been</p>

               <p>I think it was by me or in my presence—I did not, at the time I told Bull to take him in custody, tell him that he had nothing to do but to go and inquire of his attorney in Dean's-court to find him—I did not tell Bull that the best way would be to go to Mr. Clark's, and that Mr. Clark would give the prisoner's address—we knew where he lived, Queen's-road or King's-road, Chelsea—I do not know the number—I knew he lived with his father-in-law—to the best of my knowledge, he had lived with him all the time he had been in my service—I told Bull once to take him in custody, and then we stopped it—I wished to find some information—Woollard absconded about a fortnight after Josslyn went—I have tried to find him but cannot—another man absconded, not Hitchman; he has gone through the insolvent court—he is behind you now—I did not bring him here as a witness—I do not know where Hitchman lives—I have never inquired—the alleged cause for dismissing the prisoner was, that there had been some tampering with Hitch man’s accounts—I have asked Hitchman for information—I am not going to call him as a witness—he is going through the insolvent court a second time—I have not been up there as a witness—they have cheated me between them, without a doubt.</p>

Josslyn Dear sir, I in close herewith the returns which I think you will find by the day-book are correct. I am sorry to find the sum is much deficient of what I expected to reach; my undertaking, therefore, if strictly carried out, falls to the ground. There are, however, with diminished sales, some indications of better prospects. The returns are made at no greater relative expenses and I am inclined to believe there are less bad debts in the last six months trading, than in the corresponding period. The greater of course the returns, the less relative expense there ought to be; and the fewer bad debts, the less there is to be added to expenses in the shape of loss. Viewing all things, I am still inclined to do in part what I weald have preferred doing entire, if the trade had come up to the amount I therefore inclose herein a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be disposed of thus:—of the amount, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for yourself, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Miss Cawthorne, and the same for Miss Hill. There are many matters in the stock-books that will need great attention, more particularly all the larger articles in muslin; these are, or have been, helps to the amount of returns, but your trade for them is gone; the reason must be found out. If it can be altered here or by you, so much the better; but if not, we shall want something to make up for what will be future deficiency if not considered at once. The older articles, and in fact, every article in needles must be considered. The fancy box-trade is lost; the ridged eyes will be or should be extras. I have a heavy stock yet of all other goods, from six to eight millions of drilled eyed sharps; they are nothing in the needle trade. Sixteen millions were ordered one day recently in one order, I am told, at Redditch. Large orders produce quick cask returns; small orders the contrary. In the one case many profits are made in a year with the same capital; bat with me I only turn capital once a year This is the old style of trading and wants your greatest consideration with a view to alter it I have some articles you sell regularly which can be only made about once in five years, you sell so few; yet they are sold regu<lb></lb>larly, tons weight at a time. Hoping you will all feel satisfied with this inclosure, and wishing we may succeed better in the next six months, I remain, Yours very truly, H. Walker.

Miss Cawthorne and self beg to offer our best thanks for cheque inclosed, and which folly satisfies us. I could hardly have expected under all circumstances to have equalled the amount of last year, considering when I came we had no travellers, and the first five weeks we did not average more than 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week.

                  </hi>. I live at Abingdon, and keep &amp; fancy repository there—I sent up to Mr. Walker a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in two halves—I got a receipt for it—I sent one half up about 9th April, and the other about 15th—these are the receipts that I got back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the second half as early as the 13th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> cannot say; I think it was very probably the 14th—I am confident I did not send it on the 12th—I do not think I sent it as early as the 13th—I cannot be quite certain—I did not send the second half as early as the 13 th—I am under the impression that I sent the remaining half on the Sunday evening; Sunday or Monday—it was a Bank of England note—I have not got the number—I could not get the number—I received a letter from Mr. Walker about the note, but was not able to trace it in any way.</p>

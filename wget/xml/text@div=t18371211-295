                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Isaac Hemsworth, and another—they live in St. Martin's-lane, and are curriers. At a quarter to seven o'clock on the 9th of December last I was in Maiden-lane, Wood-street, with my cart—I had a parcel in it containing six skins of japanned leather—some one gave me information and I found it was gone—this is it—it was dropped in the mud.</p>

I was standing in the street selling fruit, and saw two men—one put his hand in the back of the cart, and took out a long parcel, and gave it to the other man—I should not know either of them—they seemed like two gentlemen—it was dark—I could not see the size of the men.</p>

At half past six o'clock in the morning a woman came into my shop and gave me information—I looked about, went to the door, and saw two decent-looking young men—a baker pointed one out with a parcel under his arm, which I have every reason to believe was the prisoner—as soon as they saw me coming they ran away, turned up Gutter-lane, and the prisoner was taken directly afterwards and brought back to my shop—I am perfectly satisfied that was the man I saw before, and that it was the prisoner.</p>

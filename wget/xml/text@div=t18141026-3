            Where were you - A. I was going home; the prisoner was conducting me home to the barracks, as I was a stranger. He took me to a bye place, knocked me down two different times; he knocked me about till I was insensible. I was quite insensible when he robbed me. When I came to myself, I saw the prisoner with my tin box; he kept my tin box, the fifteen shillings, and the discharge, that were in it; in the tin box were three three-shilling pieces, one eighteen-penny piece, four shillings, and one sixpence. I went home to my barrack; the prisoner was not to be found. I was all over mud, and my face was cut. When I heard he had came home, I went forward, and took him by the collar; I said, this is the man that robbed me. On the night when I came home, I could not get any instructions of any body where to find the prisoner. I heard he came home late at night. The next morning I got up early. The prisoner got over the back wall, and the next morning to that, the serjeant took the prisoner. I told the adjacent he prisoner was the man that had robbed me. I told him the particulars. I went afterwards and shewed the serjeant and the police officer the spot where he robbed me. The prisoner saw at the bar is the man that robbed me.</p>

            . I know the prisoner and the prosecutor. On the evening of the 6th of October, the prosecutor came into the house with his face scratched and black, and his legs had been kicked. He told me he had been knocked down by the prisoner, and robbed of his tin box, fifteen shillings, and his discharge. The prisoner belongs to the 27th regiment of foot. I saw nothing of the prisoner until the morning of the 7th, I seized him by the collar at the York barracks; he did not seem surprized at my taking him. He denied taking any money from

            . I confined the prisoner. I reported it to the Commanding officer; the Commanding officer told me to give him over to the Civil Power.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. to Weit. Did not you lose the tin box the night before that - A. No. I had it about me when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bailey. Was the prisoner drunk or sober - A. He had got a drop to be sure; he was not drunk. This is the piece of paper that was dropped in the necessary. The prisoner took part of this paper to wipe his backside with; the prosecutor's name is on it; here is Weit, drummer, upon it; it is part of his discharge; he has not passed the board.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day before, I saw the prosecutor laying down in the necessary, I picked him up; the next morning, he said, he would treat me for behaving so civil to him. I was conducting him home to the barracks, I could not get him along; he fell down a great many times; he dropped the tin box; we went back several times to look for it. I went home. He fell down a great many times, and when he got home, he made this complaint that I cut him; he cut himself by falling down.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. I am an officer. The prisoner is one of the men that knocked the man down in the Five fields; he bears a bad character in the regiment.</p>

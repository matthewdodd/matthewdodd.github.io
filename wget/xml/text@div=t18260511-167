            (a blind man). I am a broker, and live in Mitchell-street, Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's. I heard the two prisoners come to me on the 21st of April, and ask if I would buy a flock bed and bolster, and two chairs- I asked if my son should go and look at them, but they brought them in about three quarters of an hour - they wanted 10s. for them, but I said I would give them 8s. 6d. for them, which they took - they said the young man they lived with was in trouble, and they wanted to raise money to get him out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoners together, on the day after the robbery - they said they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Harris put in a written defence, stating that she had lived with the prosecutrix, and paid her share for the furniture - that they quarrelled, and agreed to sell them and divide the money, and accusing the prosecutrix of having been the cause of her seduction, for which she received 13l.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR HARTNELL re-examined. Q. In what service was Harris? A. She was about the street, and I took her in - she did not advance money to buy these goods - I knew her - I have never paid her any wages; I bought the six chairs since I knew her, for which I paid a sovereign; I will swear she did not pay any part of that; I will swear I never received any money from any gentleman for her; I have been imprisoned for robbing a man I met in the street, but I was acquitted - there is a charge against me now for disorderly conduct - I never turned Harris out into the street - she was not in the habit of sharing her money with me - I never had any money of her - I charged her nothing for the lodging - I never saw any of her money - I had known her before, and she said she would come and clean about the place if I would let her be with me - I gave her lodging and board for that - she never had any share in my property.</p>

I have the scar still, and shall carry it to my grave. Immediately on receiving the blow, the man in front cried out</p>
               <p>"Halloo! where are you pushing to?" and at the same instant my watch was snatched from my fob - it was a gold horizontal watch, capped and jewelled; the dial plate, instead of the usual figures, had my name and the date, 1808, in Roman characters; a ribbon, two seals, and a key were fixed to the watch. On my receiving the blow, and the snatch at my watch, I was staggered for a moment, then made a plunge at the man who took the watch, and he endeavoured to lay hold of me, but I fell with the effect of the blow with my hand down on the pavement, and my back against the house. I immediately jumped up to pursue the man whom I saw with the watch in his hand. I believe the man who cried halloo to be the man who took it, but am not certain; he ran up Charles-street, I immediately got up and attempted to pursue him, but had not got above three or four steps before some person in the street made a blow at me, which I warded off. I got into Drury-lane, some persons came round, and said</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, you are all over blood?" I went into a shop, found myself covered with blood, which streamed down all over my face. I enquired for a surgeon, a boy came into the shop, and gave me information. I went home, was confined to my house fourteen days, and was under a medical man's hands for three weeks. The effects of the blow raised the scalp, and injured one of my arteries - the surgeon feared I should have had a locked jaw. When I recovered, I went and found the boy out, and went with him to the Coach and Horses, Belton-street, St. Giles's - I did not go into the house - the officers brought the prisoners out. The boy was waiting in a coach in Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoners were taken into a public-house in Holborn, the boy was sent in and came out again. I stood in the passage, and saw there were about thirty persons there. This was about half-past ten o'clock on Saturday evening. In consequence of what the boy said we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sent your watch to be repaired - A. Yes; in April, 1819, I sent it by my clerk to Mr. Fowinkle; I had let it fall, and the works were broken - I received it back repaired. In October I broke the glass, and it was repaired again by Mr. Vanburin. When I broke the glass I was all day on horseback, and the motion of the horse bent the hour hand. I received it back from Vanburin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was the state of the night - A. It was a dark foggy night - the gas was lit. I think it was about ten minutes past five o'clock. I saw several women of the town about, but not the boy; there were gas lights in the shop on the opposite side. The boy came to me immediately after, but I did not ask his address, he is the same boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Bullock say at Bow-street that he bought the watch - A. On his first examination he declined saying anything, but when he was fully committed he said he bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Was there sufficient light to distinguish one person from another - A. Yes; but from the effect of the blow, I will not speak to either of them.</p>

            . I am near sixteen years old. I have known the prisoners perfectly well for nearly a year, and have often seen them in company with each other. I remember Mr. Hall being knocked down. I saw the prisoners come out of the Coach and Horses, Charles-street, they went towards Drury-lane - a third man stood in the road, in Drury-lane, facing the end of Charles-street - one of them whistled, I cannot say which; the man in Drury-lane shoved Mr. Hall into Charles-street as he crossed, then the prisoners pulled him in - they pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100004"></xptr>him down, and struck him with a little ash-stick as well as I could see; another man came up and said, halloo! and something else. Wootten pushed his hand up, and at that time the watch was taken; I did not see the watch, but saw the seals in his hand as he pulled his hand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hall struck before he was pulled down - A. He was pulled down first as far as I could see; I am sure Bullock struck him, he had the stick, I have seen him carrying that ash-stick about often before. When they ran away Mr. Hall got up, and went into an eating-house, I went to see how he was hurt, and he went to a surgeon's with the waiter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. I work at Mr. Bryanston's, wheelwright's shop, in Charles-street. I was going to fetch a candle for one of the men, and was coming up Charles-street into Drury-lane, when this happened, I was on the opposite side to Mr. Hall. I was afraid to speak, but I saw what was done, and heard the man say, Halloo! Bullock had a top coat and top boots on. Wootten was close by when Bullock struck Mr. Hall, he had a black or dark blue coat on, brown pantaloons, shoes and stockings, they both had copper buttons; I took a deal of notice of their dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not notice their dress, because you could not see their faces - A. I knew them perfectly well. I noticed their dress for fear I should be asked about it. I knew them without their clothes. I noticed their dress to make myself more certain, as I had not an opportunity of seeing their faces. I do not remember speaking to Mr. Hall in the shop, I spoke to the waiter; I told my parents and the men what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not say, that you did not know the men, and noticed their dress that you might describe them as you did not see their faces - A. No, I knew their faces well. My sister lives at the eating-house, I went in one night, and the master of the house asked if I was the boy who saw the gentleman knocked down? it was a week or a fortnight after. I did not give information at the office, being afraid they would injure me; my father did not tell me to go till I saw Mr. Hall. I have often seen the prisoners in the Coach and Horses public-house, my father uses the house, and whenever I saw them in the street after, I said to my father</p>
               <p>"There are the men." I was brought up in Clerkenwell charity-school, and go to St. Giles's church. I pointed the prisoners out when they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been living since Mr. Hall found you out - A. In the Commercial-road, I was taken there for fear any of the party should catch hold of me.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. When Mr. Hall found you, did you describe the prisoners to the officers - A. Yes, I saw them in the day-time at the public-house in Charles-street, and fetched the officer, but when we went they were gone, and were taken at night. When the officers brought them out I was in a coach waiting to see them, they brought them past the coach, and I knew them. I afterwards went into a public-house to see them, and pointed them out standing up with a great many people, who were drinking spirits. When I spoke to the waiter of the eating-house, I said</p>
               <p>"I saw this done, and know who did it."</p>

            . I am an officer. From the description of the boy, I went and apprehended the prisoners at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street. The boy was in a coach; we took them to the Spread Eagle, public-house, Broad-street, we did not take them by the coach, it was on the other side of the way. The boy saw them at the Spread Eagle, with three or four others and some other officers; he said the prisoners were the two - they were taken away directly - this was Saturday evening the 2d of December. I searched Bullock, and found this watch on him, which I produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are well known about St. Giles's - A. I have lived in the neighbourhood eight years, and have known the prisoners by sight a good while, and saw them at different times after the robbery; two or three women and three or four of our officers were with them when the boy pointed them out. I never heard anything of this sort of them before. The boy's description led me to look for them. I apprehended them ten minutes after I had received it.</p>
               <p>MARTENUS VANBURIN. Mr. Hall sent me a watch to repair in October last. I straitened the hour-hand, and put a new lunet-glass to it, the dial plate had, John Hall. 1808, or 1818, in Roman characters, instead of the figures, The watch now produced has now quite a different dial, but I know it by the hour-hand, which has a dent where it was straitened, and where I burnished it over; the centre wheel arbor was raised, but on account of the glass being low I filed it at the top to keep it from the glass.

            . In 1819, I was servant to Mr. Gantony, a watch-maker, in Cheapside. I received a watch from the last witness, which was Mr. Hall's; it was repaired and returned to him. We always enter the number of the watches we receive. I produce the entry of this, - (reads) -</p>
               <p>"Gold watch, name Chater, No. 8,348." It had had a fall, which broke the cylinder; we put a new one and a new wheel. The name Chater is not on it now, the name piece is now thinned, the screws are as they originally were. The name appears to be filed out, and another put on; it is newly gilt. I do not find the number on it now, but on the cap I think the No. 8,348, has been filed, and an attempt made to scratch it out; I can trace those figures now. It is usual for the manufacturers to scratch the number on the cap. I find it has the same wheel and cylinder which I put in it; the index-piece I can speak to, it being very remarkable, and to the best of my belief it is the index-piece of Mr. Hall's watch. I do not know Anthony, a watch-maker. I remember the case was much bruised, and was not repaired so well as I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100005"></xptr>wish - they hung rather on the hinges, which they do now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know you repaired that watch - A. Yes, and know it was for Mr. Hall. The alterations could possibly be made in twelve hours.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL re-examined. I know the watch by the hour-hand, the dent remains in it, which I observed on receiving it from Mr. Vanburin, and on the cap the old number appears to be obliterated. The No. 4,276, is put on, and the old No. 8,348, appears under it; I also know the string and key now affixed to it, to be mine.</p>

            . I live at No. 33, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials. I hardly ever miss passing a night at the Coach and horses, public-house, Belton-street. I know the prisoners, they frequented there very often; on the night after the fire in Drury-lane, in particular, I remember seeing them there. Two persons came in and mentioned the robbery, one came in about a quarter of an hour after the other; when they came in I saw Bullock sitting by the left side of the fire, and Wootten sat facing me. Bullock was playing at dominoes. A person came in, and said a gentleman had been knocked down at the corner of Charles-street, was cut in the face, and taken to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. I left work about a quarter past four o'clock, and I think I got there about half-past four o'clock; I had been there about a quarter or half an hour when the man came in and stated about the robbery. I suppose it was about half-past five o'clock, but will not speak to a quarter of an hour. Bullock was not out of the house for more than five minutes - they could not be out of my sight long enough to commit a robbery in Charles-street and return. I can almost swear they were not out at all till the men came in.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Why frequent a house so far off - A. It is not far. I work for the landlord and several who come there - there were fourteen or fifteen people there, one Ingram was there; I do not recollect any others by name, I may know their persons. I was present when Maidment took them out of the house - they were both playing at dominoes together; they asked what was the matter? he said he did not know. Next day I saw Maidment, and asked what it was for? he said for a highway robbery on such a day in Drury-lane; I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, the men were in my company at the very time." I did not ask where I could go to state this.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not five o'clock when you got to the house - A. Yes, I left work when it was getting dark, cleaned myself, and went there; it was not very dark when I got there. I believe the lamps were lit. Bullock might leave the room for a moment for a particular purpose. When they were taken all the company in the room said they were not out of the room - eight or ten said so - they said so the night after they were apprehended. I came here to day of my own accord, nobody asked me to come. I asked Maidment when the trial would be - I told nobody what I was going to state here.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the misfortune to be here before - A, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on this side of the bar or the other - A. The other, I was charged three or four years ago with receiving two sheets.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you convicted - A. I had twelve months imprisonment. I think the latest time I got to the public-house was half-past four o'clock. I suppose it was an hour afterwards that I heard of the robbery; one of them must have passed me to go out. Vickers was sitting in the room under the clock.</p>

            . I am a printer. The last place I worked at was for Russell, at Guilford. I live at No. 38, George-street, Bloomsbury. I frequent the Coach and Horses, public-house, and perfectly well remember one night somebody coming in and saying a gentleman had been robbed in Drury-lane. I got to the public-house that day between three and four o'clock - the information was given after five o'clock; the prisoners were in the room at the time, Bullock sat in the box when I went into the room, and Wootten was in another part of the room.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Where did Farthing sit - A. At the opposite end of the box facing the fire in the corner-seat; Bullock sat about the middle of the table between Farthing and me, on the left of Farthing; Wootten sat opposite to Farthing by the fire side. I was there when they were taken. The robbery was talked of in the course of the next day. Wootten was smoking his pipe, and joining in conversation; Bullock and I were talking together. I do not remember their playing at any game. I first saw them there between three and four o'clock. I was there all the evening with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since Russell employed you - A. Three years, I have been out of employ ever since. I receive money from my son, who works for Mr. Davey, a printer. I have no money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention this - A. It was the general conversation. Pritchard, the landlord, knew the prisoners very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in trouble yourself - A. I have, I do not know that I am bound to say what for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with a robbery - A. Yes, only once. I was tried here for house-breaking two years ago. I have had no conversation with the prisoners since they were taken; their friends told me they were to be tried to-day. One Brandon told me it was necessary to prove, if possible, that they were there, and asked if I objected to come and state the truth. I have worked on the Sun, Statesman, and Examiner newspapers, some years ago. I kept a public-house at Westminster some years back.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night the prisoners were taken, are you sure it was said that the prisoners were at the house at the time of the robbery - A. Yes, I am confident it was mentioned the night they were taken, directly after they were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you derive the information that they were charged with a robbery that night - A. Directly after they were taken it was said they were charged with this robbery - I do not know who mentioned the charge. I recollected their being in the house, and said so; Farthing was there - I remember it because it was the day after Lord Mayor's day, and in the course of the following Sunday or Monday I ascertained the gentleman's name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182101100006"></xptr>who was robbed. I heard the prisoners were to be tried last Session, but I did not come.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did the officer say what they were charged with - A. I do not know. I have lived in George-street at different times for twelve months, Mr. Ennes is my landlord.</p>

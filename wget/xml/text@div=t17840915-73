               <p>I was called on Wednesday morning at three o'clock, to know whether I had lost any thing, and the warehouse door was unhasped, or at least the staple drawn, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150140"></xptr> door open, which had been shut the night before; when we came to go up stairs, we found another door open, and the lock drawn, we missed some things, but we could not tell the exact quantity.</p>
               <p>What sort of goods did you miss? - Black gauze: I saw the gauze before five in the morning, in the constable's possession, the constable is not here; I have no doubt of their being mine, the shop marks are on them, they have been in my possession ever since; here is one hundred yards which has never been out of my possession, the rest went to be redressed.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Bishopsgate-street; about one in the morning this man and another was coming along, and I asked him what he had got there tied up, he had a bundle, he muttered something, I could not tell what; says I, I insist on knowing, and will know, and he run away, I cried stop thief! he was stopped before he got out of my sight; I delivered the bundle to the constable.</p>

               <p>What was his name? - Mr. Grimes; we asked the prisoner how he came by it, he said he found it at the corner of a place where he had just been, and saw nobody; I observed there was a paper marked upon it, but what it was I cannot say, as I cannot write, the other man made his escape; this is about two hundred yards from Mr. Preston's warehouse.</p>

               <p>My brother watchman called out stop thief! and I pursued and saw the prisoner run down the passage, and I took him at the end of the passage, which is no thoroughfare, but he was totally out of breath.</p>
               <p>- SHILLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>He went to breakfast with me on Sunday, and then to dinner, and then I went up into my master's warehouse to do a little job, he was up in the warehouse with me, he locked the warehouse, and gave my master both the keys to carry home.</p>

               <p>I had been down with a young man, I saw this bundle lay, and picked it up; that young man called to me, and I insisted on seeing it, he never offered to take hold of me, but called stop thief! I saw the watchman run, he ran immediately, which was near a quarter of a mile from the place where he first asked to look at the property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The handkerchief in which the gauzes were belonged to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. What particular mark have you to the handkerchief, that you can swear to it? - I am sure it is the same handkerchief.</p>

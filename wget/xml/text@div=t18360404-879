                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Huntley Bacon, Esquire. of Bounds-green in the parish of Tottenham. I remember in March last, some sheep having been worried—James Scoot is a shepherd, in Mr. Bacon's employ—on Sunday morning, the 20th of March, I went out about eleven o'clock and went into a field called the Hilly Field—I observed five men at a short distance from Dampford Wood, as I stood in the Hilly Field—I did not know all the men at that time—I knew Page—I cannot say I knew any other exactly at that time, I did not see them distinctly enough—I made my way down to the wood, and saw two men run down the wood—as they were running away I said, "It is no use for you to attempt to run away, I am determined to have you"—I know Page was one of the two men—I could not see exactly who the other was, for the boughs, and one thing to the other—I had a gun with me—there are hares and rabbits is that wood, and I have seen them—it is a part of my employment to look after the preservation of those things—I noticed a dog running towards me, and I shot it directly after that I saw another dog, my gun was not loaded then, I could not shoot that—I said, "Look out, shepherd, and shoot that dog"—Scott</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040012"></xptr>
               <p>was in the same field with me—in consequence of what I said he shot the dog directly—the dogs were what are called <hi rend="italic">lurchers</hi>, not grey-hounds exactly—the shepherd and I then went down the bottom of the field, over the hedge, towards Mr. Rhodes's ground, and there we saw the five men—I suppose they were all the same five men that I had first seen when I got into the field—Page was one of them, Charles Kitley was another—I cannot say exactly to be positive that I can swear to any other—when we saw these five men they began to <hi rend="italic">let out</hi> in a most violent manner, saying, "Shoot the b—b—"—they were standing towards me as I got to the end of the wood—they were on Mr. Rhodes's land then)—they went before me, face to my face—they stood at the bottom of Mr. Bacon's land, in Mr. Rhodes's fields—I should think I was about sixty or eighty yards from them when they used those expressions—Scoot was with me at that time—they then followed us—we turned back—seeing five against two. I said, "We must go back", and I went back with Scott, in a direction for home—I ran up the field, and they followed us—they ran for the space of, I suppose, four-score yards—I had reloaded my gun then, and the shepherd as well—went hey had pursued us for the space of about eighty yards, Kitley got over Mr. Rhodes's hedge, and ran towards us—there is no gate in that field—there are some bars—it is not a proper stile—they are bars to keep the stock asunder, because the quick of the hedge is bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the place where the prisoner got over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether he got over the bars or the hedge—I was running away from fear, and my back was towards him—it was not a great distance from that place that he got over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he ran towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—he pointed a gun a time or two—it appeared to me to be more at the shep<lb></lb>hered than me at that time—them, shortly after, he pointed it at me, and fired immediately—he fired at me—he had not pointed the gun at us more than two or three times—I thing not more that twice—I turned round to look at him at times—my face was towards this face when he fired—I did not see that Kitely had a gun when he first pursued us—I never pursued them—I think he was as near as fifty yards when he fired—I am quite certain that he gained upon me after he first ran after me, before he fired the gun, for I had to run up hill—when he fired, I heard the contents of the piece rattle over my head more like a hail storm than anything—the contents struck is the boughs at a considerable distance from where I stood at that time, being me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you afterwards see the makes where the contents struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never looked.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you Standing in the open ground, or among tress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was standing in open ground between trees—the tress were from ten to twelve, or not above fifteen yards from me—from ten to fifteen yards—at that distance I could hear the shots striking the tress above my head—If I had looked at the tress, I might possibly have ascertained how high above my head the shots had struck—I think it might he ascertained if there had been marks suffi<lb></lb>cient so that we could have seen them—there were no leaves on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040013"></xptr>
               <p>tress—a shot coming at the distance of fifteen yards with such force as to be heard, might possibly make a mark on the bark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that shot scatters very considerably out of a gun at the distance of fifteen yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the piece a great deal—the musket I had would lay marks into a tree above fifteen yards off—shot scatters more at a long distance than a short one—I am not a game<lb></lb>keeper—I am connected with sporting—fifty or sixty. yards is a good dis<lb></lb>tance for a gun to kill, but it will do it—shot keeps compact for some dis<lb></lb>tance when discharged from a gun, and then it scatters—many shots are carried round a good distance before they scatter—it is a bad piece that will not carry forty yards, and then keep round—it is not for the advan<lb></lb>tage of the sportsman to scatter the shot—a sportsman would have a much better chance of killing a bird by the shot scattering, but he would not kill a hare in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now it the shot scatters at fifty or sixty yards, would not the boughs be struck as well as the trunk of the tree? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the tallness of the tress—these were large elm tress—they have branches or boughs—I will swear the shot did not go twenty yards above my head—I never ex<lb></lb>amined the tree—I was standing when the man fired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had the least notion of striking you, would he not have a much better chance of doing so by running up closer to you and then firing than at a distance of fifty or sixty yards, if he intended to hit you instead of frightening you by firing over your head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The reason he ran was to get near—he ran the distance of about fifty yards—he would not have had a better chance of hitting me if he had come within twenty yards—I should not have stood still—I made no indication to prevent his coming near me—the five men had one gun among them—I and the shepherd had a gun each—the shepherd was within three or five yards of me when the shot was fired—I thing he went to examined the trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure you heard the shots rattle against the trees at your back, when the man fired at you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain of it—a gun loaded with shot will wound seriously at fifty yards—many guns will kill at sixty, and some few at seventy yards—I heard the shots pass—if he was nearer to me he might have killed me—he gained on me by pursuing me through the field, before he level led the gun the third time, and shot at me—it was after the other man called out, "Shoot the man" that he shot—the shepherd did shoot directly after Kitley fired at me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you cannot say how high the trees were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can<lb></lb>not—they were very large elms—bigger round than my body some of them—the boughs were above my head—I do not suppose they were two yards above my head—some were lower and some higher—I suppose some of them were but a short distance off my head—some of them were in less than my hand's reach—the prisoner were standing on Mr. Rhodes's land when I first saw them—they were coming towards the wood, which is Mr. Bacon's property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you seek among the boughs for marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were little boughs opposite the trees which were not upon the tress—hedge boughs—I thought it useless to look among those little boughs for such things as that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shepherd to Mr. Bacon On Sunday, the 20th of March, early in the morning I was out looking after the sheep—I found that some dogs had been worrying them, and that one of them was dead—it was about six o'clock—I observed footsteps of two persons—at eleven</p>

               <p>o'clock that morning I was out with French in the neighbourhood of Damp ford-wood—I was about two hundred yards from French—when I got to the wood I heard him call out to me, and I directly went in the direction in which he was—a lurcher passed me, and I shot him—I did not see any men at the time—I went to the corner of the wood directly, and saw five men in Mr. Rhodes's filed, adjoining the wood—I knew page at the time, I saw him among the five—Kitley is anther of them—Kitley had a gun with him—on observing that there were five, French and I turned round, and they all made directly towards us—Mr. Bacon's field joins Mr. Rhodes's—we were in Mr. Bacon's field—we had not been in Mr. Rhodes's field—we were in Mr. Bacon's field when we saw the men—we turned round to go towards home, and all the five men followed us—they got over the hedge into Mr. Bacon's field—we ran a little, and they ran a little—they gained upon us—when they got into Mr. Bacon's field, they all cried out, "Shoot the b—b—s," and various words of that de<lb></lb>scription, and Kitley followed us up with the gun, running—he was nearer to us at last—he had run faster than his companions—he got within about fifty yards of us before he fired—I stopped to look round, and he pointed his piece at me twice—when he got within fifty yards of us he fired his piece at French by the sound of the shot—French was from three to five yards from me at the time—it was hilly ground—French had stopped be<lb></lb>fore he was shot at—there were elm trees before us as we ran—French turned round, before he was shot at, towards the men who were pursuing us—I distinctly heard something strike the trees—that satisfied me that the gun was loaded with missiles of some description—after Kitley shot, he turned round and ran away; and the I discharged my gun at him—I was not particular about the direction I shot in—it was more merely to frighten them—he might have got about ten yards when I shot at him—when he level led his gun at meat first, I; levelled my gun at him—I did not do so before he levelled his gun at me—my object in doing it was merely to deter him from coming near—I saw Kitley and Page in custody that even<lb></lb>ing—I do not know what Kitley is—I believe him to be a labourer—I know Benjamin Skinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. In consequence of what I heard, I went to Mr. Bacon's house at three o'clock on Sunday, and from what I learnt from French there I went in pursuit of Charles Kitley, in company with Fowler and another constable—I went after the whole of them, in fact—I found Kitley at eleven o'clock at night near the Green Man public-house, at Muswell-hill, in the parish of Hornsey—he was in the road, coming from the Green Man, and Page was in the path—I took Kitley into custody—I did not know him at that time—I asked his name, and he gave me the name of King)—I heard Fowler ask Page his name, and he also gave the name of King—I afterwards knew where Page's father lived, but did not know at that time—I took Cartwright into custody about one o'clock in the morning of the following day, at page's house, in a shed adjoining the dwellling-house, sleeping with his clothes on.</p>

I was crossing Mr. Rhodes's field on Sunday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock—I saw Page, and went up to him—he told me somebody had shot his dog, and he asked me if I would help him to take it away—while I was talking to him, I saw Skinner and two more come out of Dampford-wood, with two dogs and sticks—they came up to us and said, "What have they shot your dog?"—we an<lb></lb>swered them, "Yes, "—then these three men returned towards Wood-green—that is all I know of it.</p>

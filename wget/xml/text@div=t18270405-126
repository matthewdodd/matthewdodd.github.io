            . I am the wife of Patrick Burke. On the 27th of January, about twelve o'clock, I put out my gown to dry in the court, and missed it between four and five o'clock in the evening; I saw it on one of the witnesses on the 23d of March. The prisoner lives in the same court with me, and sells fish at the end of it; I went to her, and said, "I have lost my gown;" she said,"Bless my soul! it was here five minutes ago."</p>

            . On the 29th of January the prisoner brought me this gown, and wished me to buy it of her, which I did - she said she had bought it that morning, for 3s., but it was too large for her, and I might have it for half-a-crown, and she would lose 6d. by it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner - Mrs. Allen was there, and said she had bought the gown of her; I took them both up. Mr. Twyford committed the prisoner, and bound Mrs. Allen over as a witness.</p>

I was going through Petticoat-lane, and met a woman whom I have known some years, and bought things of; she asked me to buy this gown of her, which I did, for 3s.; I found it was too large for me; I then sold it for half-a-crown; the prosecutrix lives in Adam and Eve-court, and I live there also.</p>

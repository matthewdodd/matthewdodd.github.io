                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 3, Arthur-street, North Wool<lb></lb>wich-road—on Monday morning, 10th March, I was employed on the roof of a stable, close to Bow-creek, and, between 7 and 8 o'clock, saw a cart drive up over the footpath, which is an unusual thing where there is a road—the driver got out of it and took it up to the side of the wall as close to the bank as he could get, and two men came from a barge alongside the creek, with a sack; one held the bottom, and the other the mouth, and they carried it—one of them ran up the bank, and the prisoner Turnbull assisted in put<lb></lb>ing it into the cart—the other man was Crow—they then fetched another sack; there were four sacks altogether, and two bales, which were covered with matting, something like this—they resembled bales of tobacco which I have seen in the docks—I cannot say whether the four sacks would contain a bale if it was split up, but they were three-bushel sacks—I saw a little bit of tobacco hanging out of the mouth of one of the sacks—besides the pri<lb></lb>soners, there were three men in the barge and one at the cart—having put them into the cart, they covered them up with some sacks, and Turnbull drove away—Crow remained about there a short time, and I went in to get my break<lb></lb>fast—when I came back he was gone—I did not look then to see where the barge was—Crow were a brown coat like he has now, and a blue, Navy cap, cloth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Gray, a lighterman, of Water-lane, Tower-street—on Monday morning, 10th March, about 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoners together; one was crossing over a fence to get down into Canning-town, and the others were close to him—from the entrance of that place, Bow-creek may be a quarter of a mile—Canning-town is close to the railway; that would be a ahort cut to it—I saw several carts, but not with them—the <hi rend="italic">chay</hi> carts that I saw were empty—about six or seven days after<lb></lb>wards Crow challenged me about seeing him with some tobacco—I said that I never saw him with any—he said, "Did not you see me?"—I said, "I know I did."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Orchard-lane, Blackwall, and am apprentice to Mr. Lucas, a waterman—I found the Mary Ann barge adrift in Bow-creek; my mate made her fast, and she stopped there till Wednesday—I went on board and found a small portion of leaf tobacco in her.</p>

I received Crow from the last witness—on the way to the station he said he was not at the Victoria Docks either on the Sunday night or Monday morning; he was at home in bed—on Saturday, 5th April, I took Turnbull at his house, 65, Richard-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road—a female answered the door, and I inquired in what room Mr. Turnbull lived—she said, "The first-floor front room"—I went up, knocked at the door, and received no answer—I put my little finger in the key-hole and found the key inside—I asked them to admit me, but received no answer—I said that I should force the door open if they did not—I shoved against it, looked through the top part of it, and saw a fire alight and Turn<lb></lb>bull's cap on the table—after waiting some considerable time, Mrs. Turnbull asked me what I wanted—I said. "I want your husband"—she said, "I have not seen him for these three days"—I said, "Well, open the door, and let me see"—she said, "Well, wait till I am dressed, and I will open the door"—during the time she was dressing, Turnbull asid, "What is it you want me for?"—I said, "Well, open, the door and I will tell you"—the wife then opened the door, and I told him the charge—he said that he knew nothing about it.</p>

            . On the 21st of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner called on me; I asked her to go up stairs and make my beds; I delivered the key of the room to her; she went up and made three beds; the door was locked when she went up, and she locked it when she came down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she up stairs - A. About a quarter of an hour, then she came down and went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money up stairs - A. I had a box containing a ten pound note; I put it between the bed and the sacking; my marriage lines were in the box; I had seen the money the night before, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300019"></xptr>d being made, I did not miss it till the next morning; I en looked for my box; it was gone, with the ten pound note, four duplicates and my marriage lines.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. Q. Either this good woman or her husband applied to you - A. The husband did. On the 24th, we saw the prisoner in the street; she took me home to her lodgings, I searched the lodgings but found nothing; I then searched her pockets, and found some silver and some halfpence. Conway told her to give him the note, he wanted nothing more of her; she positively declared she knew nothing of it: I saw the prisoner very uneasy, she wanted to put her hand into her bosom; I told Conway he had better go out of the room, I would search her; she put her hand into her left bosom; Mrs. Stevens was in the room; she pulled her hand out and put it behind her; I pushed her hand backwards to open it; in her hand I found two one pound notes twisted up in this piece of rag; I asked her what had become of the rest; she said she did not know; she was in liquor, she might have lost them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews to Mrs. Conway. You are sure it was a ten pound note you put in your box - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called four witnesses to her character.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to me - she had formerly lodged with me for two months, and said she had called to pay the rent she had left due; she did not pay me. I gave her leave to sleep with my servant - she remained with us till Wednesday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, when I went out, leaving her at home; my wife went out soon after. On the Monday night I had seen 16 s. and a sovereign in the drawer in a table which was in the room where she slept with the servant. I gave my wife four sovereigns to put there. I returned at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon - she was still in the house, but the money was missing. I said it must be her or the servant - she said she had taken none. I sent for a constable, who found a sovereign in her pocket, and a half-crown in her left pocket. I locked the drawer on Monday, and took no money out myself.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Sunday morning, I lent the prisoner 1 s.; she said she would pay me on Monday, when she fetched her box from the Flower Pot, which she did, and paid me. I received four sovereigns from my husband on Monday, which I put, with 20 s., in silver, into a little box, in a table drawer of the room where she slept. I locked the drawer and took the key; there was a sovereign and some silver there before. I went to the drawer on Wednesday at two o'clock, and found it unlocked; it appeared to have been forced by a knife. I found only three sovereigns and 11 s. 6 d. I got the officer, and charged her with it; she denied it, and said all her money was in her box - none was found in her box; but a sovereign, a sixpence, and some half-pence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100027"></xptr>were found in her pocket; she said it was her own. She was intoxicated every day, and did not pay us what she owed, which was 2 s. 6 d. The servant was not searched. The bed-room is on the ground-floor - the street door is kept open in the day-time. She was left alone in the room every morning after four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is there not a mangle in the bed-room - A. Yes. Nobody but me and my servant work at it.</p>

            . I am servant to Hooper - there is no other servant. The prisoner came to the house on Saturday night, and slept with me. A boy named Ned lived in the house - he went into the room as well as us, but did not sleep there. I saw that the drawer was a little broken on Wednesday. I did not look at it till two o'clock, when my mistress came home. I never saw the prisoner do anything to it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had resolved to leave the house, in consequence of improper proceedings occurring there, and as she refused to stop she was charged with this robbery.</p>

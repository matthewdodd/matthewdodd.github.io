               <p>JAMES DUNKLEY. On the 16th of December, near eight o'clock in the morning, I went into the Magpie, Fetter lane, I called for half a pint of beer; after I had been an hour, I asked the landlord's son, to take care of the bundle while I went to look after some work in the stables; I told him to be sure not to deliver it to any body but me, and I would call for it in an hour or two. The prisoner at the bar was sitting in the room all the time. I returned at eleven o'clock, and asked for my bundle, the landlord said he had delivered it to a man that described the handkerchief. The landlord and a young man in the tap went out in pursuit of the prisoner; he was brought back by the young man, but the bundle was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he was the man that was there in the morning when you left the bundle. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Your father keeps the Magpie in Fetter lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Dunkley coming into your house on the 16th of December. - A. Yes, between seven and eight in the morning, he gave me a bundle in a dark handkerchief; he told me to keep it till he came for it, he was going out for work.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in with the bundle was any body else there. - A. Yes, the prisoner sat in the same box opposite of the prosecutor, he heard what he said, and he saw the bundle. At ten o'clock I went out with a message, and then the bundle was delivered in my absence.</p>

            , SENIOR. You keep the Magpie. - A. Yes; my son left a bundle in the bar. The prisoner at the bar was sitting in the taproom when I got up a little before eight; the boy did not say any thing to me that he had taken in a bundle of any body; some time after, I do not know whether the clock had gone ten, the prisoner came up to the bar and said I shall thank you for the bundle I left with your boy. He described it to be a dark handkerchief with a hole in the bottom; I looked for the parcel, I found an handkerchief of that description, containing a bundle, I takes up the parcel, I called the young man that was in the house, I asked him if he had seen that man deliver the parcel to my son, he said he had not. I delivered the parcel to him, he said that was his stable jacket at the bottom, he had been over the way to get work.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you could see the stable waistcoat at the bottom. - A. Yes, through the hole. I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140021"></xptr> the prisoner is the man whom I delivered it to.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did the prosecutor come. A. About twenty minutes afterwards the prosecutor came and asked for the bundle, and then I called the young man that was in the tap to go and look after the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN CRANK. I am a porter to the White Horse, Fetter lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember to whom the parcel was delivered. - A. Yes, to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came and gave information you went in search of him. - A. Yes. I met with the prisoner at a public house in the Strand, he was smoking his pipe. He asked me to drink, I told him no; I asked him whether he had not been in Fetter lane that morning, he said he had not; I told him he had, and he was the person that took the bundle out of the landlord's hand. I asked him to come back along with me, he said he would; he came along with me to Mr. Pearch's, and I fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the bundle. - A. No, he had nothing with him when I took him. They said at the house they did not see him bring in any thing with him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the man. - A. He was the man that took the bundle from the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Dunkley, what did your handkerchief contain. - A. One shirt, two white handkerchiefs, two pair of stockings, two jackets, and a pair of shoes. The handkerchief had a hole at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge brought against me. I was not on the spot that morning, I was at Lambeth.</p>

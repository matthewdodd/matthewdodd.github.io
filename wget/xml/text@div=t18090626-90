            . Q. Did this lad at the bar lodge at your house - A. Yes. He worked at Day and Martin's manufactory I missed a number of things, in my house. On the Sunday morning, I said I would search his box, he said I was welcome to search his box, he had nothing but what was his own. He ran up first, he opened his box and took out articles of linen, and said is this yours, and when he came to the bottom of the box there happened to be a drinking glass, a looking glass, and the clothes brush; they belonged to me; the looking glass was in his own room, but the last time I saw the clothes brush was in the bar. He never asked me for the clothes brush; the drinking glass I did not miss, I had so many.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lost a whole suit of clothes of my own out of the house; I put the things in my box for my own use, to take care of them, that they might not be lost.</p>

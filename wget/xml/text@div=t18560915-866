                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Victoria public house, No, 5, Pro<lb></lb>vidence-row, limehouse. On Sunday, 7th Sept., the prisoner came to my house—he had a glass of ale, it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he gave me a shilling—I gave him 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and pat the shilling into the till, there was no other there—he went to the door, and spoke to some one—he returned, and asked for a bottle of soda water to take away—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he was just going away, and was caught and brought back—after he gave me the crown, I dropped it into the till where the shilling was, and there was no other crown there—a gentleman spoke to me, I took the crown out of the till, and went after the prisoner, and brought him back—he gave me a good crown, and said he did not know the crown was bad—he wished very much to be let off, said he did not know it was bad, and that he took it at Deptford—I gave the bad crown to the policeman, and the shilling also—when the prisoner was going down the road, he said he gave me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the glass of ale, he did not give me shilling.</p>

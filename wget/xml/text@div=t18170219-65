            . I live with my father and mother at Hoxton. On the 30th of January last, I left my father's house to go to Laurence Pountney-lane-it was on a Thursday. I went into the <placeName id="t18170219-65-crimeloc356">Curtain-road</placeName>

On receiving the blow, I fell, and was quite senseless. I did not recover until the next day. When I left my father's house, I had a watch in my pocket, with three gold seals, two gold keys, and a gold ring attached to the ribbon. When I came to my senses the next day, I found myself in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I found that I had got my watch, but not my gold seals, key, or ring; the ribbon was also gone. I am sure that they were all in my possession up to the time that I was knocked down. I was deprived of my senses. I also received several cuts on my face-it was about twenty minutes after seven o'clock. My seals hung out quite visible; I had no great coat on. The cuts appear to have been done with some sharp instrument-one of my teeth was also broken. I remained in the hospital until the Sunday following. I saw my seals afterwards, in the custody of the pawnbroker's man; there was an officer with him-it was either Gleed or Armstrong. I cannot say whether the prisoners were with the persons who rushed against me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Alabaster, who lives at No. 6, North-green, Chapel-street, near the Curtain-road. On the 30th of January, I was in the Curtain-road; I saw Mr. Jones there, by Holywell-lane - He was on the same side of the way that I was - I was following him. We were both going in a direction from Holland-street. When he came to the pent-house there, three men rushed out and knocked him down. I am sure that one of the three men knocked him down. I was too frightened to raise an alarm; I was close to Mr. Jones at the time. I believe the prisoner, Clarke, is the man that knocked him down, by his features, but I cannot swear to him - He was dressed in a long blue great coat, trowsers and shoes - I mean the man that knocked Mr. Jones down - He appeared similar in size to Clarke. After they had struck Mr. 
               <persName id="t18170219-65-person565">Jones</persName>
             a second time, they ran away. I will not swear to Clarke's features, but he is, to all appearance, the same man. There was no light but that of the moon-Mr. Jones was in the shade; the moon enabled me to see their persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARKE, Q. Did you not say, at Worship-street, that the man had a blue jacket on. - A. No; I said, a long blue great coat. I cannot swear to his features-to the best of my knowledge, the prisoner, Clarke, is the man, by his bulk and dress; I will not swear positively to him.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Killingworth, who is a pawnbroker, in Brick-lane, which is about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour's walk, from the Curtain-road. On Thursday, the 30th of January, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Clarke, came to my master's shop - I never saw him before that time - He came to sell the two seals and a key, with a ring attached to them; my master looked at them - He asked 16s. for them. Mr. Killingworth asked him who they belonged to - He said they were his own, and that he had won them, at a raffle, the evening before. My master said he did not care to buy them, but if 8s. was worth his acceptance, he would give that for them. The prisoner immediately took up the seals, and went to the door, as if he declained taking the money; he then returned and took the 8s. As soon as he went out, I went to the door to shut up; it was about eight o'clock-the prisoner, Clarke, immediately crossed over the way-there was a man and a lad waiting for him; they all walked away together. I do not know the other two; there were three in company together. I was present the whole of the time that Clarke was talking to my master, and am quite sure that Clarke is the man who produced the seals for sale. I am quite positive that he is the man. There was no ribbon attached to the seals. I do not know whether Wall is, or is not one of the other men. Clarke had a blue jacket and trowsers on-my master did not suspect him. The seals and key were worth about 15s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARKE. Q. Neither of the other men, who were in the shop, can swear to me, but this man. - A. The person who was in the shop at the time is here, her name is Susanna Swinbourn. Killingworth's son was present - He is not here - He was at the further end of the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not sworn that I was not the same man. - A. He was examined before the magistrate; his examination was taken in writing. I do not know why it was not signed. I heard what he said, and saw his writing, but should not know it again. I was examined, and signed my examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he not swear that he was not the same that he was stouter, and he did not believe he was the same person. - A. He did. Killingworth, jun. was employed at the further end of the shop - I was nearer to the prisoner than he was.</p>

            . I live in Gulston-place, Whitechapel. On the 30th of January, I went to get some articles out of pledge-it was between seven and eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner, Clarke. there; I am positive that it was him; he brought some seals in his hand. Killingworth, sen. asked him what he wanted; he said he did not want to pledge, but to sell them. I heard Killingworth ask him what he wanted for them. I had never seen him before, but am quite sure the prisoner, Clarke, is the man that produced the seals. I heard him say, he had won them at a rafile, the overnight. I saw Killingworth pay him for them. I stopped in the shop for something that I wanted - I saw him go out at the door. I am sure that the man that I saw produce the seals, and go out, was the prisoner, Clarke. There was one lamp and three candles in the shop.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in the Curtain-road. I saw Mr. Jones there on the 30th of January ast - He was laying on his back, under a shed, or penthouse-he was very much hurt. I heard the cry of murder; he could not speak - He was struggling - I took him up; he was completely insensible. I followed him to the surgeon's, and took him to the hospital, and left him there, after seeing his wounds dressed. He came too a little in the cock, and kept getting a little better every yard that we went. Before we got to the hospital, he said he lived at Ivy-place - He said he had lost his watch.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, In consequence of information that I received, I went to make inquiry about the seals, the day after the robbery, I went with Armstrong, sen. to Killingworth's - He shewed us some gold seals and a gold ring. I afterwards assisted Armstrong and his son in taking the prisoners into custody. From the description I received from the pawnbroker's man, I went and apprehended the two prisoners, at the Bull, in Kingsland-road. When we had put them in the watch-house, I went back for a boy, who had been described to us, but he was gone. The boy was in the house when we took the two prisoners, but we were not certain that he was the right one. He was in the tap-room, but I do not know whether he was in company with the prisoners. I told them what we took them for - They said they knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner into custody. I took Peto, the pawnbroker's man, to Mr. Jones, with the seals - He claimed them. The prisoners went with us directly. The prosecutor was very much hurt when I searched him at the doctor's - He could not speak. I did not find the watch on him. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

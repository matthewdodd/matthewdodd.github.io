On 4th October, at 2.20 a.m., I was on duty at River Street, Greenwich, and noticed a light suddenly extinguished in Mr. Chaney's front parlour, and I saw the prisoner come out of the window and turn towards the river—I was about 6 yards from the window—I said, "Halloa, what are you doing there?"—he stopped and said to me, pointing to the window, "That's him," and as I turned to look he struck me a blow on the head with some heavy instrument, and I became partly stunned—I then saw another man come out of the same window and strike me violently across the front of the helmet, knocking it off, and they both ran away—in about half a minute, as soon as I could recover myself, I gave chase after them, and the witness Robinson, the lighterman, came out of a hut and caught the prisoner at Angerstein's bank—I was about 20 yards behind him—when I cot up to them the prisoner paid, "What are you going to do with me?"—Robinson said, "What have you done?" and he replied, "I have done nothing"—I said, "What did you run away for?"—he said, "What would you do, if you were in trouble?"—with the assistance of another man from the river, we took him to the police-station, where I saw him searched, and some silent lucifer matches similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found upon him, corresponding with tome we found in the room—the first blow struck me between the ear and the left eye—I have suffered very much since, and have been treated by a doctor, and have been off duty ever since in consequence—I never lost sight of him, but he dropped down in the mangold field about 40 yards in front of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Ever Place, East Greenwich—at 11 p.m. on 3rd October my house was secured, and the parlour window fastened—I was knocked up about 2.30 a.m., and on going into the parlour I saw the house had been entered by the window, and the fastening broken—some flower-pots which were inside the window had been removed and thrown into my front garden—I found this empty matchbox and some lucifer matches which had been struck lying about the parlour carpet—I know the matches as "Tanstickers," and they strike only on the box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 3rd October I was looking for work, at about 9.30, and going towards Northfield, when I met a man who gave me liquor and. took me for a night's lodging, but when I woke up I found myself opposite this house. I was a little sobered, and the man said, "Come indoors and have a rest; it will do you good." He was getting through the window, and said. "Get in." I said, "This is not the way to get in," and he said, "I have not the key, and don't want to wake the people." I saw the constable coming, and when about 20 yards from me I deliberately walked up to him. He said, "What's the matter?" I said, "There's a man leading me astrav." He said, "Where?" I said, "There he goes through the window," and the policeman struck me, I would not stay to be abused, and ran away and was stopped. I never touched the constable with fist or instrument, and there is no one to say so but himself. I have never seen the instrument that has been found. It was a public path and 250 yards distant. I was going into the place, but had not the slightest idea of committing a burglary. I walked about from district to district to get employment, but there is nothing to do now. I am a tinsmith and coppersmith. I am innocent."</p>

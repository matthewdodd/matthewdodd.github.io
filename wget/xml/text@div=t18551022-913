                  </hi>. I am waiter at at the Adelaide Hotel. The prisoner came on 8th Sept. to engage a room for a lady whom he called his sister—the last witness came with him afterwards to the hotel—he came to see her every day while she stopped at the hotel—on Friday morning, 14th Sept., he came about 8 o'clock in the morning—the lady was in the ladies coffee room at breakfast—the prisoner came about half past 10 o'clock to me and said, that somebody had stolen from the lady's room a red shawl, and a green mantle, and if I could find the thief he would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not come afterwards to the hotel.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 593). I received information, and went on Tuesday, 18th Sept, to Tottenham Court-road—I saw the prisoner there—I told him I was a police officer, and charged him with stealing a gold bracelet, a gold chain, a mantle, a shawl, and two handkerchiefs from a lady, staying at an hotel near London Bridge—he said in English, "Oh! take me to the lady"—I said to him, "Do you perfectly understand all that I have said to you?"—he said, "Yes, yes, take me to the lady; I can make it all right; she is my sweetheart; I am going to marry her"—I took him to the station in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and searched him—I found on him this address, "No. 78, Gloucester-terrace, Kentish-town"—he gave this address at the station house, and said he was a married man, and had two children—I went to the address, and found a female, who represented herself to be his wife, and two children—I searched the house, and in a room on the ground floor 1 found this shawl and mantle—this pocket handkerchief was brought to me by the servant—I showed this shawl and mantle to the prosecutrix, and she claimed them—when I was bringing the prisoner to the Mansion House the next day, he said, "Did the lady say she had lost a golden bracelet?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That was wrong, it was not gold."</p>

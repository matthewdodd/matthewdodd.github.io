            . I live in Bride lane. I was at Finchley on the 14th of July; there were two post-chaises, my husband and a gentleman were in one, and my daughter and I in the other. As we were coming over <placeName id="t17711204-21-crimeloc98">Finchley-common</placeName>

I said I had none; then they demanded my money, and I gave them what is mentioned in the indictment, a paper ear-ring case, with a pair of gold wires in it for the ears, a little pen-knife, a breast buckle set in silver, and eighteen-pence in money. I believe the prisoner is one of them, but I cannot swear to him; he was dressed in dark coloured clothes; I could not discern the colour. I have never found any of my things.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I was in the country then, and cannot say. I saw him about three weeks or a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Bulford. No; I thought he was one.</p>
               <p>- Bulford. I am daughter to Mrs. Bulford.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say what sort of men they were that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Bulford. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the prisoner is one?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes, I can; because he was close to me all the while; he was on that side of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040013"></xptr> chaise on which I fat; It was light enough, I could tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he about the chaise?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I believe about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you frightened?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And could you make such particular observation of his person?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Yes, he was so close to me, and had hold of my hand, and I looked at him all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Just light enough that I could distinguish his face.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What did you know me b?</p>
               <p>Bulford. By his face.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he?</p>
               <p>Bulford. A darkish great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What colour was the horse?</p>
               <p>Bulford. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to take notice of the colour of the horse?</p>
               <p>Bulford. Because I looked so much at him, I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I was at Finchley on July last. I came a few yards before my wife and daughter. I was in another chaise; we were stopped and robbed; the other chaise was stopped before us; they came behind and robbed the hindermost chaise first, in which my wife was.</p>

On the 28th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was writing at the counter, and heard a violent crash at the window. I found the window broken, and saw something had been taken out - I ran to the door, and heard the call of Stop thief!. The prisoner was almost immediately brought from over the way, in the custody of Yapp - I did not see him taken. Yapp produced six silver forks, which were mine. I was writing by the window just before it was broken, and opposite the pane that was broken - the pane was broken large enough for a man to put his hand in. I saw no hand put in - they could not have been taken without putting his hand in - they were taken off the wire where they hung, and are worth 5 l.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live near the prosecutor's. On the 28th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Exeter-street, which is about five doors from the prosecutor's, on the opposite side of the way. I heard glass break, and saw the prisoner run-across the road, from the spot, with something white in his hand - I endeavoured to stop him, but did not succeed till he got into Exeter-street, I then caught hold of his coat; he fell down, and I fell over him. I took six forks from under him, and gave them to Mr. Debney immediately before I got up - it was quite dark, with assistance I took him back to Mr. Needham - Debney went with us, and took the forks - I did not see the prisoner break the glass, but he ran from where it was broken.</p>

            . A little before seven o'clock in the evening, I heard the window break, turned round, and saw a man running in the road, calling, Stop thief!.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020004"></xptr>I turned round, and pursued the man, who was running very fast in the middle of the road, from where I heard the crash. Yapp overtook him first, the prisoner slipped and he fell over him - I came up and Yapp said, here are the spoons, they were forks, as he thought they were spoons - the prisoner was laying on them. Yapp took the forks, and gave them to me - we took the prisoner to the prosecutor, and he claimed them.</p>

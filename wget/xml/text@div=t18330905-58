On the morning of the 31st of August, I had on my shop counter, a great coat, a frock coat, and a shooting jacket; I had occasion to go into my parlour, which is separated from the shop by a passage; my daughter alarmed me, and I ran into the shop, and turned into Heath-cock-court, by her direction, and saw the two prisoners as close as they could stand together, having my property between them; the skirts of my coats hung down from them; I called, "stop thief," and they threw them down; I told them to stop, and Randall struck me, and I laid hold of him; Wilks ran away; Randall struggled to get away; Mellish the policeman came to my assistance, and I gave him in charge; my daughter picked up the property and took it into the shop; I delivered the great coat to Rice; I have not got the other things; I was to return them that week as they belonged to a customer; the great coat, and frock coat were worth 5l., and more. The shooting jacket was worth 1l., and more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. Are you positive you saw the property in possession of the two prisoners? A. I am; it was between them; I saw the skirts of the great coat hanging down so that it touched both; I cannot say which of them threw it down; they were so close together; I saw it hang down between them; they stood as close together as could be; I never saw Wilks before; I am positive he is the man; I saw Wilks run away when I caught hold of Randall; I went to Bow-street with Randall, and while he was under examination, the magistrate sent for my daughter; and as I returned to Bow-street with my daughter I saw Wilks in Bow-street; he was not in custody then; the first time I saw Wilks after he left the court was in Bow-street; it was a few minutes more than an hour after I saw him in the court; I knew him by his face; they did not separate till Randall struck me; I ran between them in the court, and looked them in the face; when I saw Wilks in the street, I told two officers that he was Randall's companion, and then two men turned him back, and I said, "He is the man;" I did not know then that he was in custody.</p>

            , I am fourteen years old. There is a passage between the back parlour and the shop; I was standing there on the 31st of August, and I saw Wilks come in and take the clothes off the counter; two of them had passed the door before that; that was him and Randall; Randall did not come into the shop; he was passing the door when Wilks took the clothes; after taking the clothes they joined company, and went up Heath-cock-court together, Wilks was carrying the property; Randall would have an opportunity of seeing what Wilks was doing in the shop, when he took the clothes; they joined company between the door and the court, three or four yards from the shop; I gave an alarm and my father came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you positive Wilks took the property? A. Yes; I never said Randall took it; Wilks had the property after leaving the shop; I saw him pass the door before, and observed him, because they looked into the shop; they stopped and looked in; I am positive Wilks is the man who entered the shop; I said so, at the office; I swear to Wilks.</p>

            . There was no curtain in the shop - as soon as I got to Bow-street I saw this young woman there weeping; she was there at the very moment Wilks was shoved into the office, and she wrung her hands; I can swear to her, I wondered why she cried.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the office very crowded when you went there? A. This was outside the office - she cried all on a sudden, and burst into tears - I noticed only her and Wilks; they were outside the office.</p>

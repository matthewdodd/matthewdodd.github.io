                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Herbert Clarke, coal merchant—on 20th June, 1874, the prisoner came to our office at the Great Northern Coal Station, King's Cross, and gave an order to the order clerk for five tons of-house coal and one of smill coal—he said he was foreman to Mr. Kingwell, a wheelwright and carriage builder, in St. Martin's Lane—he said the carman was to inquire for the foreman to Mr. Kingwell—I did not see the prisoner after that, till I saw him at Bow Street, in custody—the coals have not been paid for—we don't do business at all with coal agents.</p>

I was order clerk in the employ of Herbert Clarke, at the Great Northern Coal Depot—in June, 1874, a person called who said that his name was Briscoe, and that he was foreman to Mr. Kingwell, whose address he gave, and that I was to send some coals there—I ordered the coals to be sent because I understood they were for Mr. Kingwell—I knew Mr. Kingwell's house, and I also referred to the Directory—we don't profess to sell coals on credit or to sell to an agent, but we might do so if we knew</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't remember the words used, it is twelve months ago, and my attention was not called to this until I heard the man was in custody—if we considered that a person who came and ordered coal was respectable, and we found him in the Directory, and knew nothing of him before, we should not say that the carman must not leave it without the money, because that offends the customer—there is a good deal of competi<lb></lb>tion in the coal trade—the date of the first invoice is the 20th June, and the second the 23rd and 24th—he gave the order for the 6 tons, all at once, but they were sent in in two lots—he wished 2 tons to be delivered first—the 4 tons were to be delivered at the same place—this was treated as a cash transaction, it says on the invoice "cash on delivery"—if we find a person is respectable we don't ask for the money—no cash was sent for the first 2 tons—I find in the carman's book Kingwell's name scratched out and Briscoe's put in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lancaster Villas, Lower Norwood, and am manager at 22, Pall Mall, of the coal business of William Lee, trading as the Pall Mall Coal Co.—on 21st April the prisoner came and wanted some coal—I said "Have we supplied you before?"—he said "No, but you have supplied some of. my friends," "friend," he might have said—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "I am Mr. Henry White, manager to Mr. Kingwell, of 7, Upper St. Martin's Lane, and I want some coal to be sent there"—he mentioned that he was a wheelwright, and I said "Do you use our coal for wheelwrights' purposes; I thought you used small coal"—he said "But we must have the best also"—I then said "How much will you have?"—he said he would take 2 tons; I said "Will-you prepay the order or pay on delivery"—he said "I will pay on delivery"—I asked him what time they should be delivered, and he said at 8 o'clock on Friday morning—I said "You will understand the coal will not be left unless it is paid for at the time"—he said. "Yes, but let it be delivered at 8 o'clock on Friday morning"—the ticket was made out in due course and sent to our Camden Road depot for <hi rend="italic">delivery</hi>—these are the tickets; one is a counterpart of the other—if the coal was paid for at the time the carman would receipt the whole of that and leave it with the party who purchased the coal, and in this instance that ought to have been done, because the carman was not to deliver unless he was paid on delivery—the counterpart was brought back by the carman signed—the 2 tons of coal came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went round to Mr. Kingwell's, I think the same afternoon, but I could not see him—I saw his brother, but he could not inform me if any coal had been delivered—I went the following morning and saw Mr. Kingwell and he gave me the address of Mr. White.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Pall Mall Coal Company is a private company; it belongs to Messrs. Lee &amp; Jerdein, of Lancaster Place, Strand—the coals would be their property—I did not see the prisoner after 21st April till I saw him at Bow Street; to the best of my belief he is the man—I fully believe him to be—I only saw him once; if it were a matter of life and death I should give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt—I saw him in the dock at Bow Street directly I went in and I thought that he was the man; he made</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of the Pall Mall Coal Co.—on a Thursday morning about six weeks ago I took 2 tons of coals to 7, Upper St. Martin's Lane—I saw the prisoner at the shop—I asked him whether he paid on delivery, and he said he had ordered 4 tons—I shot the coals down the hole—he told me to bring 2 tons the next morning and he would pay me—I brought back the ticket to my master—the prisoner signed my book.</p>

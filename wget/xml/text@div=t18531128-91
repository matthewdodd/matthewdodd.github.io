                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Pattison, of No. 28, Hoxton-square, Shoreditch On Wednesday, 23rd Nov., about half past 10 o'clock in the evening, I and my husband were sitting in the parlour, and I heard a scratching at the door, which I thought was the cat—I lit a chamber candle, put it on the end of the table just by the door, and opened the door to let in the cat—I saw the prisoner in the passage, rather behind the street door—I called out to my husband," Here is a man; "and said to the prisoner," What do you want?"—he instantly got round to the other side of the door, sprung down the stairs, and ran away—I went down the steps after him; I saw him turn the corner, and heard a cry of something—I cried," Stop thief! and he was brought back not more than five minutes afterwards—I recognized him instantly, only he had dropped his hat—I found a skeleton key left in the lock—the door had been fastened with a strong lock; I saw it safe half an-hour before—the prisoner had a hat on when I saw him in the passage; I had a light, and I was close enough to him to put my hand on his shoulder—I had time to observe his features, and I have no doubt he is the man.</p>

               <p>key out, and the light from the parlour door shone on him sideways—there was also a large candle burning on the table, and a strong fire—there was no lamp in the hall; they are very small passages in Hoxton-square; the front parlour opens near to the street door—the prisoner turned to the left from our house—there were no servants living in the house; but my daughter and grand-daughter were up stairs going to bed—I am confident they had not been to the door, because they must have passed the parlour door—the parlour door was not open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 107). On 23rd Nov. I was on duty in Hoxton-square, and saw the door of No. 28 standing open about twelve inches; it was about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I heard Mrs. Pattison say, "Who is that at the door?" there was no reply—she again said, "Who is that?"—presently the prisoner darted from the door into the square; I am sure he is the man—he had his hat on, and ran in the direction of Old-street road—I ran after him, crying" Stop thief!"—he was six or not exceeding nine yards before me—he did not pass me—there was a dense fog at the time, but I could see him as distinctly as I can now at the distance he was from me—he was taken by another constable—I lost sight of him for about a second, not more, as he turned the corner—there was nobody between me and the person who apprehended him—I found this skeleton key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the lock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The nearest you were to him was six or nine yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nine yards was the farthest; I may have been five yards and a half from him—I had never seen him before to my knowledge, but I could see him as distinctly as I can now, in that dense fog—I swear that; the reflection of a lamp was by—the fog was not so bad in Hoxton that you could scarcely see the lamps.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 90). I was on duty in Murray-street, Hoxton, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I met several persons running, the prisoner was rather before them; he came close to me—I took him into custody, searched his pockets, and found this skeleton key and gimlet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this key will pick the lock, the other will not—he struggled, j and O'Brien came to me, and said that he was the man he had been following—after taking him to the station I went back to the spot where I took him, and found these other three skeleton keys—I had seen his hand in his pocket there, and heard something drop that sounded like keys; it was then that I put my hand in his pocket, and found one key and the gimlet—when I took him, his hat fell off in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Could you see far before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not far; it was rather foggy at the time—I think it was about the worst foggy night we have had—I heard that the omnibuses and <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> were obliged to cease running—I could see more than nine yards away, so as to recognise a person—the prisoner was the first person I met running; he was three or four yards before the others—four or five persons came up before the police—three or four seconds, or a minute, elapsed before O'Brien came up—I think he came up at the time I got the key—it was twenty minutes or half an hour before I came back to the spot.</p>

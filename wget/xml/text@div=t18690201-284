                  </hi>. On 12th January, about 12.30, I saw Whitley in Milford Lane, Strand, with a lady's reticule in one hand, and a silk umbrella in the other—I followed him—he went into a lodging-house at the bottom, stopped there about ten minutes, came out again with the umbrella, but no reticule—Smith and two others were with him—they came into the Strand, got on top of an omnibus, and rode to the corner of Ludgate Hill, by the railway arch, where they got off, and went through Fleet Lane till they got to Cloth Fair, where they went into a public-house, came out almost directly, and went to a coffee-shop—I spoke to policeman Bradner, went with him to the coffee-shop, and pointed the four men out—Whitley had the umbrella behind him, on the seat—I left them in the hands of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I was on duty, went with Payne to this coffee-house, and saw the prisoners and two others sitting all together in the stalls—this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was at Whitley's back—I took it up, and said, "Who claims this?"—they each of them shook their heads, and said, "Not me"—I said, "I suppose it is the joint property of the four of you; I shall take you all to the station"—Smith then said to Whitley, looking under the table, "Here is a pretty mess you have put us all into"—on looking down, I saw what appeared to be the contents of a lady's bag, and several of the articles were at the feet of the two prisoners—Smith repeatedly said to Whitley, "Why do you not speak out and clear us?"—I took them to the station, and on Smith I found this bottle of lavender water—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I found on the floor—they all gave false addresses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, and live in Hertfordshire—on 12th January I was with Lady Dacre, in a brougham, in Holborn—we got out at Marks' shop, No. 129, and walked from there to 139, the brougham following, with a bag and an umbrella in it—they were gone when we got in again—I did not see what was in the bag, but I noticed that the umbrella had a partridge cane handle.</p>

I sell fruit in the street—I know a lodging-house down Milford Lane; I do not live there, but I was there on 12th January, about the middle of the day, and saw Whitley, Smith, and Jones there—we four went on an omnibus to Ludgate Hill, and then to the coffee shop where the policeman came—Whitley took this bottle of scent out of his pocket there, and said to Smith, "This is mine, you can have it!" and gave it to him—Smith put it in his pocket—I was speaking of the things that were there; and Whitley said he picked them up in Queen Street—he afterwards said that they were stolen, but did not say by whom—I was not in the lodging-house when Whitley came in, but I came out with him, as he asked us to go to Cloth Fair with him—I saw this umbrella at the lodging-house—Whitley had something showing to the others there, but I do not remember seeing the inkstand—when he had done with the things he shoved them in his pockets—I was standing with the group, there were more than four—part of the time I was not close to them—I had been in the hospital a fortnight, and had nothing to do—I think Whitley suggested to take the omnibus; we took it half way between St. Clement's Lane and Temple Bar.</p>

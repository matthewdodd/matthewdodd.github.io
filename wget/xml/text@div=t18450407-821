                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 304.) I was on duty Friday, the 21st of Feb., near Hampstead—I saw Mr. Hilton about ten minutes or a quarter past seven o'clock—in consequence of what he told me, I proceeded up Haverstock-terrace to the field at the end of it—I went across the field to the first point of the wall—I did not proceed further that way then—I saw and heard nothing—I then went down the narrow passage, which brought me into Bellsize-lane, and then turning to the right, I got into the Hampstead-road again, opposite the George—near the George I met Sergeant Fletcher—he and I went together up Haverstock-terrace again, and into the same field—we went across the field, then to the end of the wall, and then came down the wall, and in the bottom corner of the wall found a dead body—I looked at no watch—I think about half an hour elapsed, from the time Hilton made the communication to me, till I got to the place where the dead body was found—the body was afterwards removed to the Yorkshire Grey—that was the body on which the inquest was held—when I first found the deceased he laid flat on his back—he had on a great coat as well as a close coat, and they were both wide open—his right-hand glove was off, and was lying to<lb></lb>wards his feet, with some blood on it—I also found a hat, lying at some little distance, with a pocket handkerchief in it—the body was warm when I got up, but quite dead—the injuries appeared to be on the head—there was a pool of blood at his feet and one at his head—I did not search the body before it was removed, I did afterwards—the bosom of his shirt was covered with blood, and his two coats unbuttoned—with that exception, his dress was as persons ordinarily wear it—there</p>

               <p>was no watch on his person when I saw him in the fields, nor when I searched him afterwards, or any money—I found a letter in his coat pocket—I handed it over to the inspector, Mr. Gray—after the discovery of the body, Fletcher went away to get assistance, leaving me there alone—he went away about three or four minutes after we got up to the body as soon as we had ascertained it was the dead body of a man—he was gone about half an hour—about a quarter of an hour after he was gone, a person joined me—he came in a direction from Primrose-hill—he came in a direction from the Avenue-road—there are footpaths across these fields in many directions about there, by which persons can go into the Avenue-road, or come out of it—my attention was called to him before he came up to me, by his whistling and singing—when he came up, I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Halloo, Sir"—he said, "Halloo, policeman"—I said, "I have a serioua case here before me"—he said, "What is it?"—I said, "A dead man, who I think has cut his throat"—he said, "Are you sure he is quite dead?"—I said he was quite dead, for I had felt his pulse, and it did not beat at all—he stooped down and felt the pulse of the dead man—he did not kneel, he merely stooped down—he said, "You have a nasty job here alone, policeman"—I said they were gone for the stretcher, and I dare say they would soon be back—he then said he bad been in the habit of travelling that way for the last two years, from town, that he transacted business in town, and he generally had a great deal of property about him when he came that way of a night, such as a watch and a gold ring, which he said he generally wore on his ringer—he said he never saw any danger in coming that way, but that he had been cautioned by his parents not to come that way home of a night—he then asked me if I would have some brandy—I said I would rather not—he said, "You have a cold job here, and I am sure you will want something to drink after it"—he then took a shilling from his pocket, and offered me it to get something to drink after I had done—I refused it two or three times, but being pressed, I took it—soon after that, persons came with the stretcher—I had no light with me while I was waiting there—one was brought with the stretcher—it was an ordinary lantern, carried by a policeman—it was turned on the body, and on the face of the deceased—the man I have been speaking of was standing by at that time—the body was then placed on the stretcher, and taken away to Hampstead—we went down the passage, and into Bellsize-lane—the person of whom I have spoken, followed as far as that—I then lost sight of him—he had on a cloak or macintosh, I could not say which—I cannot say who that man was—he was muffled up a great deal, and it was very dark, and I could not identify him again—he was a young man, about five feet eight in height, or thereabout.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hampstead, I handed this letter to Gray, the officer—it was taken from the great-coat pocket of the deceased—I was called to see the deceased about a quarter to nine o'clock on Friday evening, the 21st of Feb.—I found him lying at the dead-house attached to the Yorkshire Grey, Hampstead—I found a large wound, about four inches long, on the upper and back part of the head, on the left side there was a smaller one, immediately in front of it; a bruise on the left temple; and a wound on the right eye-brow, from which blood had been oozing—that was all I discovered at that time—I after<lb></lb>wards examined the body, by the Coroner's order—after the head was shaved I discovered two or three more wounds—they were all scalp woonds—the skull was not fractured—on examining the under surface of the scalp, there was a good deal of blood effused, corresponding to the wound I dis<lb></lb>sovered on the outside—the chief wound was, I should think, about row inches and a half in extent, so that I could introduce three or four fingers—I attribute the death to concussion of the brain, as the consequence of the violence externally to the head—I should imagine, from my exanima<lb></lb>tion of the wounds after the head was haved, that they were inflicted by some heavy instrument, such as a large stick, or a life-preserver, or any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070045"></xptr>
               <p>heavy weapon of a blunt kind—the wounds I observed undoubtedly pro<lb></lb>ceeded from more blows than one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other surgeon here to speak as to the result of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I passed my examination as a surgeon four years since—I have been practising at Hampstead—I attribute the death to concussion of the brain—the brain itself did not present any diseased or unhealthy ap<lb></lb>pearances, but that is by no means uncommon—I saw quite sufficient symptoms to account for the concussion, by the repeated blows on the scalp—there was no fracture of the skull—there was no appearanoe in the brain itself denoting concussion—concussion of the brain, as far as the brain is concerned, very often leaves no appearance of concussion on examination—that was the case here—apart from the injuries on the head, there was no appearance of any disease or derangement of the brain—there was no congestion of the vessels, or anything of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I right in drawing this conclusion as yours, that finding there were injuries on the head, and that the brain presented a healthy appearance, you concluded that the concussion must have followed from those injuries on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the repeated injuries on the head un<lb></lb>doubtedly—it is very frequently the case that there are no appearances on the brain to warrant that conclusion—it is very commonly the case—the wounds on the head denoted blows from a heavy instrument, used with very considerable violence undoubtedly—any heavy instrument might do so—I do not think a hammer is a likely weapon to do it—a poker might do it—a heavy club would do it undoubtedly, or a heavy knotted stick—the appearances presented led me to conclude there must have been a great many blows—it need not have taken some time—they might have been repeated very quickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But did not the body present appearances from whence you would draw the deduction, that great struggling and resistance had taken place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should say not—there did not appear that appearance, of strug<lb></lb>gling—the clothes were not much disordered, or anything of that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you think the blows had been inflicted with some instru<lb></lb>ment? if, hard, of no violent character, or, if soft, repeated, inasmuch as there was no fracture of the skull, or anything to denote any injury to the skull itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that did not follow by any means—I did not find my<lb></lb>self very much puzzled to account for the death—I concluded at once on a careful examination of the scalp, seeing the repeated wounds that had been inflicted, quite sufficient to account for death—I should attribute the con<lb></lb>cussion to no individual wound, but to the whole wounds taken collectively—I gather concussion must have followed, from the evidence of numeyom blows that had been given, and finding the man was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known concussion follow from the self-struggling and re<lb></lb>sistance of a man who was engaged in a fight, either with a stick, or any<lb></lb>thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, without either a fall or a blow—con<lb></lb>sussion is not likely to follow from any cause but direct violence that I am aware of—I do not believe it would follow from shakes—I have seen three sticks—the largest stick that was shown me might have produced the wounds—it is a large yellow stick—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this now produced is it—this is a stick likely to have caused it—it is a heavy stick—when asked my opinion, I said it was a very likely weapon to have caused it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070046"></xptr>
               <p>I have not seen any other likely to have done it—the skull was not beaten in—it was perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that repeated blows, violently inflicted on the bare skull of a man with such a stick as that, could have been so inflicted without fracturing the skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do think so, because it was just on the ridge of the skull—had it been immediately on the top. I think the skull must have been fractured—the blows seemed to have been given in a slant<lb></lb>ing direction—I think such blows might have been inflicted with such a stick, and produce the appearances I found, without fracturing the skull—I consulted a gentleman of more experience than myself on the subject, a Mr. Davis—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That part of the human skull that you have described as the ridge, is, I believe, of great strength? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is—the deceased appeared to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any appearance at all about the body not consistent with health, except those appearances about the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only examined the brain—there was a slight mark on the finger, but nothing at all to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not open the body at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. On the 21st of Feb. I lived with my father, who is a ladies' shoemaker, at No. 17, Charles-street, Portland-town—at that time I used to sleep at No. 11, Victoria-terrace, Portland-town, with the prisoner—he was at my father's house on the 21st of Feb., and went out about a quarter-past seven in the evening—Charles-street is about twenty minutes' walk from Haverstock-terrace—in the course of that afternoon my brother bad told me he was going in the evening to Bath-place, to receive ten or twelve sovereigns which he had ex<lb></lb>pected for about five weeks before, from Mrs. Edwards—it was to be lent him—he returned to No. 11, Victoria-terrace, to sleep about one in the morning—I had been in bed some time, and imagine it was about that time—his coming into the room awoke me—he showed me twelve sovereigns, and said be bad got rather more than he expected, and then he showed me the right arm of his shirt, the wristband of which was torn, off—he told me, without my asking a question, that he had been at Sarah Cox's, and in company with her brother had got it torn off in romping—I never saw Sarah Cox—I knew he corresponded with her, from what be told me, and seeing letters lying about addressed to her—after mentioning this he came into bed—nothing occurred in the night—I got up next morning to my work as usual—I got to my father's, which is only across the road, within a hundred yards, about half-past seven or eight, and in about two hours the prisoner came over to my father's to breakfast, according to his usual habit—he produced the money, and gave my father a sovereign, my mother a sovereign, and paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, which he had owed me four or five months—I expected he would pay me as soon as he got a situation—he was out of employ then—the last regular situation he had was about seven months previous to that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect, on the Saturday night, being with your brother at Watson's, your father's landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Watson alluded to the mur<lb></lb>der at Hampstead, and said it was a very awful thing—I had been out to</p>

               <p>purchase a small quantity of spirits—I came in, and said I had heard several people talking about it—when Mr. Watson alluded to it, my brother said it was rather a dreary subject to talk of, as we had met to enjoy our<lb></lb>selves, and I very readily joined in the <hi rend="italic">assertion</hi>, and the conversation dropped—on the Sunday I went to chapel, and returned to my father's—I was in the habit of going away directly after dinner—the prisoner desired me to stay a little while with him, and drink a little porter, which had been purchased at dinner—he sent for something else—I read an account of the murder in the newspaper that afternoon at a friend's house, and saw that a letter was found in the deceased's pocket addressed to James Cooper, Esq.—I knew before that, from the prisoner, that he knew De la Rue in the name of Cooper—I have seen him address letters to him by the name of Junes Cooper—I forget the name of the street, but it was in Hampstead-road—I went home at ten o'clock on Sunday evening to supper at my father's—the prisoner had not returned home then—he came home to our sleeping-place about eleven—I said nothing to him about Cooper or De la Rue that night, for fear it should disturb him—about half-past seven next morning I awoke him, and asked if he knew who was murdered at Hamp<lb></lb>stead—he said he did not—I told him it was poor De la Rue—he seemed very agitated, and exclaimed, "Poor De la Rue I"—he seemed very much affected by the news—he sent me over to his father's for his boots, and when I returned, I had reason to believe, from his eyes, he had been cry<lb></lb>ing—I said nothing, but gave him bis boots, and went away—he came to breakfast at my father's in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—my father said to him, "It is a sad thing about De la Rue; I consider it is your duty to go and own him, as you were so intimate with him"—he said he would go and own him, but while he was putting on his out-door things to go, my mother returned from an errand, and said the body was already owned—he expressed his joy at its being owned, and said it would very much have hurt his feelings at going to own the body, so much that he thought he should almost have fainted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the Saturday night after you left Charles-street, and went to your sleeping-place, did your brother show you anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He showed me a silver watch that night, after we left Charles-street—about four months before that he had a watch to sell for Mr. De la Rue, which I saw—I knew he pledged it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which be told me was the money Mr. De la Rue wanted for it—when he showed me the watch on the Saturday night he gave me to understand that he had redeemed the watch he had pledged before, the watch he spoke of, and I took it to be the watch—he said he had been himself to redeem it—the watch was going at the time he showed it to me—he made a remark on that—I knew the other one would not go, as it was out of repair—he said, "I have got the watch, and it is going."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the watch now produced, resemble the one he showed you that Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should most positively say that is the watch, by the seconds' hands being broken off—he broke them off on the Monday, I believe, by accident—on the Wednesday morning, about one o'clock, Scot<lb></lb>ney, the officer, came to our room in Victoria-terrace—my brother went down and let him in—on Scotney coming up, he first asked me if I had a watch—I said I had not—he turned to my brother, and said, "You have"—my brother showed that he was confused I thought—he attempted to make a reply, but stammered—I said, "Well, don't deceive the police<lb></lb>man,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, tell him all about it"—meaning, tell him it is the watch you have redeemed—I thought he did not like to tell him, because of the exposure—I thought he was too proud—he took the watch from under his pillow, and gave it to the policeman—he then went to the sideboard, and took from it a morocco case, intended to keep a watch in, which contained three duplicates, the one for the watch, which really was in pledge, one for a ring, and one for a silver chain—I expressed my surprize at seeing the duplicate of the watch, expecting the pawnbroker had got it—I said, "I thought you had got this watch out of pledge?"—he said, "No, it is still in pledge, and this watch De la Rue gave me on Friday morning"—I had seen the prisoner on Friday morning, before he went out—he breakfasted at my father's, and went out about eleven in the morning—I did not see him with any watch then, nor in the evening—the one he pledged was the last I know of his having—I am quite sure of that—I imagine that my brother and De la Rue were on intimate terms, from my brother going out, some<lb></lb>times perhaps twice a day, four days in a week on an average, in summer time, intending to meet him, and walk with him in the fields, my brother's time being unoccupied—from conversations I have had with my brother, I believe they were on very intimate terms—I recollect last summer my brother bringing home some money—I think I said on a former statement, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I think it was not quite so much—I might more properly have said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said Mr. De la Rue had proved a friend to him by giving that to him—my brother had no regular situation—he has been a schoolmaster—he was brought up to that—he can write very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter, does it appear to be his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him forge a female hand—I take it to be a female's hand—I never saw him write like this—he used to write a bold hand, but I do not consider it impossible for him to write like this—I know he can write two or three hands—he had no situation in the City on the 21st of Feb.</p>

I wonder who has done it"—the father said, had I heard how it had been committed, or something to that effect—I said there were three soldiers seen coming from the neighbourhood of Hampstead that night, and suspicion fell on them; they generally carried heavy sticks, and it was supposed to be done with a stick; that the head was smashed, and the brain coming though the skull—the father said, "Oh, cold-blooded rascals!

In consequence of information I went on the Tuesday night after the murder to Victoria-terrace—I left Farnham-grren between seven and eight o'clock, and got there about aquarter past one, on Wednesday morning—the prisoner himself came down to the door—I asked him if a person lodged there named Thomas Hocker—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Can I speak to him, if you please?"—he said, "I am the person"—I was in my uniform, but had a macintosh over it—I walked inside—he shut the door after me—I said, "I suppose you have</p>

On the 25th of Feb., Scotney brought the prisoner to me—I went with him to his father'a house—I there told him he was apprehended on suspicion of causing the death of Mr. De la Rue—he made no reply—I afterwards went back with him to the room, No. 11, Victoria-terrace—I found some clothes on the outer part of the bed, down at the feet, and found outside the bed an old coat—I found a pair of trowsers between the bed and sacking—there was nothing particular about them, and they remained there—on the 26th of Feb. I went again with Haynes and Shackell, and in the cup-board I found a shirt wristband, in the prisoner's room in Victoria-place—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—there is a portion of the shirt-sleeve attached to it—it appears to have been torn off—there are marks of blood on it—I got a pair of trowsers and waistcoat at the father's house, No. 17, Charles-street, Purt-land-town—they have been produced—there was a small mark of blood on the waistcoat when I produced it before the Coroner; he tried it, and it was blood—it is worn out now—there is a large stain of blood on the left knee of the trowaera—it has soaked through—there are marks of spots of blood on the bottom of the leg of the trowsers—I found a bottle containing blue ink at the father's house on the 27th of Feb., also some note-pnper, and wafers with the letter Fon them—when I first saw the note produced, the wafer was more perfect than it is now—I compared it with the wafers found at the prisoner's father's—they appeared to correspond, and have the letter F on them—I took the note out of the envelope, and compared it with the note-paper which I found—it appeared to be a half-sheet, of the same size and appear<lb></lb>ance</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I wish to read to your lordship two statements, which I pre<lb></lb>pared for my counsel—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"I have very carefully perused and con<lb></lb>sidered the depositions against me, and I find nothing in them of a serious or weighty nature, to the truth of which I object. I wish to communicate to you all I have to say as calmly and dispassionately as it is possible, and to that and I shall not attempt the least apology or defence.—I will state to you every circumstance connected with the depositions, leaving it to you whether they be consequential or otherwise. The two grand questions are—how came my clothes to be so saturated with blood? and, how did I come into possession of the property of the deceased? The former I can answer satisfactorily to my own conscience; but nothing on earth shall cause me to divulge it, at least on this side of my trial. It were an easy matter for me to fabricate—to make a lie; but I will not do it; and to prove to you that I am so far con<lb></lb>scientious, I have, amongst some private letters, which I have had con<lb></lb>veyed to me since I came hither, a letter in which a desire is expressed to account for the manner in which my clothes were so besmeared; and the person in his devotedness to me, offers to forswear himself; but I would rather have this mysterious part of the affair remain as it is, by leaving it in the hands of my counsel. I know while doing so I endanger my own safety, but I have urgent reasons for doing so. If this gloomy affair ter<lb></lb>minate adversely, I die a martyr; if otherwise, by my taking a defensive coarse, I live a traitor. This sounds paradoxical, probably, to your ears, hut such is the fact, of which I excuse and pardon your disbelief until it be further evidenced to you. I will therefore quit this part of the subject with this remark—After such a painful and ignominious exposure of every<lb></lb>thing connected with my present and former circumstances, together with every vile and contumelious insult and misrepresentation, I can have no desire to survive the issue, be it ever so favourable to my innocence. I am ruined inevitably and irrevocably, and I am too much the Englishman to fear death, whatever form it may assume. But more to the matter. The deceased De la Rue had frequently offered his services to me in the way of pecuniary assistance. (I ought, perhaps, to have told you that I had known the deceased for nearly two years.)—It was about six months after our acquaintance that he made the first friendly overture of the kind, and it was something like two months following that I accepted it; he at that time gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the whole of the contents of his purse, accompanied hy the words, 'Hocker, never see me again if you once ven<lb></lb>ture</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070060"></xptr>
               <p>to return me this trifle; I am no friend of yours in your estimation if you view it as a loan merely.' Last August I kept away from him for a month or five weeks, on account of the shabhy condition of my apparel; he took it unconfidingly on my part, that I did not acquaint him with my embarrassed circumstances, and then goodheartedly insisted on my turning to the best advantage 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he threw at me, wishing he could 'punish me' in the same way right on for a whole day; such was the nature of our intimacy; I have had property belonging to deceased of con<lb></lb>siderable value; a large telescope—I should say worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also a smaller one, and an opera-glass, microscope, &amp;c.; all of which he lent me at different times, and which I believe are to be found at his apartments now; my parents, and several others, remember to have seen them. The deceased also intrusted me with a silver watch, a silver watch-guard, and part of a diamond ring; the part which contained the diamond only re<lb></lb>mained. I had to dispose of them for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The deceased was anxious to make up a certain sum of money by a given time, and I un<lb></lb>derstood the request as a delicate wish for me to pledge the articles for him. I got them pawned at a Mr. Richardson's, Henry-street, Portland-town, for the required amount; the deceased gave me the duplicates, which I handed over to the officers when they searched my apartment. How I came with the watch and ring, which the brother of deceased identified, was in the following way:—In our engage<lb></lb>ments of late deceased had often been half an hour behindhand; his watch, for some time past, had performed irregularly; he frequently struck it with his walking-cane, in a momentary ill humour, which ac<lb></lb>counts for the seconds-pointer being gone; he gave it to me to be cleaned and repaired for him; at the same time producing his ring, which had always been too large for his little finger, to be loosened, and for the brilliant to be reset, which it needed, in consequence of an attempt to prove its genuineness, which he effected by removing the brilliant from its setting, and striking it with a hammer, having first placed it on a stone for that purpose. He had used all his influence towards putting me into a comfortable situation, but had failed until the morning of the day on which he was murdered. I forgot to state that it was on this morning that the deceased gave the watch and ring to me. On that morning he saluted me in a pleasant air, and said he brought me good news, he hoped; he then led me to think I should be a little better to do in a few days, but that he would acquaint me with more anon; he provided me at the same time with (what indeed I had for some time expected) 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold. The deceased had so often lent me money that I was ashamed to mention his name again to my parents; I therefore forged a falsehood, and repre<lb></lb>sented Mrs. Edwards as the donor. I was in possession of the money in the morning, and that accounts for my positively assuring my parents that I might have it by calling on Mrs. Edwards in the evening. At seven o'clock in the evening of the Friday in question I went to the Swiss Tavern, and called for rum and water. I staid there nearly three quarters of an hoar; There was another man, apparently a gentleman, in the room during the whole of the time, to whom I read portions of the day's newspaper; a candle was on the table close by me while I was reading; it was a bitterly cold night, and the fire was burning cheerfully. I stood in the front of it for some time. Had my clothes at that time been disordered and bloody, the gentleman or the waiter must hare seen it. The waiter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070061"></xptr>
               <p>remarked at the inquest, after failing to identify me, that the person who ordered the rum and water had white hands; he meant at least that they were not bloody. If I went anywhere to wash them, why suffer my clothes to remain as they were, and have the temerity to enter a lighted public-house so near the spot? But it is not my place to write in this manner. I will proceed further. After I left the tavern I directed my path across the fields, in a line with the spot where the deed was com<lb></lb>mitted, for it lay in my way to the Hampstead-road, whither I was going. As I approached the Haverstock-field, singing a merry tune, a policeman ran out from the hedge, and accosted me with the words, 'Young gentle<lb></lb>man, sad work here, here's a dead man.' I immediately scaled the fence with him, and asked him if he was sure the man was dead? The police<lb></lb>man (Baldock) said there was no doubt of it. I felt the pulse of the de<lb></lb>ceased. It was still. He remarked that the deceased was a young man. It was an awful spectacle, and we both wept. I felt quite sick and chilly, and told the policeman I should shortly take some brandy. I proposed to him to do the same. I continued with him and the deceased, without offering to withdraw, for twenty minutes. I told Baldock that some months back I had been in the habit of crossing the adjacent field from Hampstead several times in a week at a late hour in the evening, and that I usually carried a pocket stiletto as a life-preserver, which I showed him, asking him whether the possession of such an instrument was illegal or not. He said he thought not. He remarked that the blade was bright. Bal<lb></lb>dock asked the time of the night. I looked at the watch which has since been produced, and told him. Sergeant Fletcher, and some four or five other policemen, then arrived with a stretcher. Almost all of them addressed me on seeing me on the spot with Baldock. I accompanied the policemen, four of whom carried the eoxpse. I asked one of them if it was necessary for me still to attend them; he said if I could give no information it would be useless. I had made an appointment to be at Portland-place that evening. I found that I had already exceeded my time through remaining so long with Baldock. I left them with the corpse when I had got as far as Church-row, Hampatead, and hastened towards my destination."</p>
               <p>I subsequently made another statement, which I will read:—</p>
               <p>"I wish to explain to you, as nearly as my feelings will suffer me, the nature of my present trial, and to show you, that to attempt an extrication out of my misery, by a full disclosure of everything connected with this sad affair, would be futile and fiendish. About a year ago I courted a young lady at Hampstead, whose parents were highly genteel and respectable. I felt a great attachment to her; we met and loved in secret. I introduced myself to her parents shortly after my acquaintance with her. She was a beautiful girl, and I felt that I should be proud to introduce her to the man whom I looked upon as my very best friend. At length I found an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of doing so. The parents of the girl, hearing that I had such a friend as De la Rue, invited us both to see them. I had represented De la Rue as a man of property, and in every sense of the word a gentleman. We fre<lb></lb>quently afterwards visited the family together. What he lacked in manner and address was compensated for by his condition in life, which was so much more favourable than mine. De la Rue betrayed me, and at length, after a long interview with the father, he refused me as a suitor to his daughter. Henceforth De la Rue was the acknowledged lover, though discouraged by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070062"></xptr>
               <p>the girl's indifference towards him. But time and assiduity accomplish everything; he won her affections at last, and proved the genuineness of his heart to me and the girl by seducing her! Yes, such a villain was the man who, though dead, I abhor; and now comes the catastrophe. A short period elapsed, and the parents suspected, by the girl's tears and De la Rue's rude withdrawal, that all was not right, and subsequently the secret was divulged. Oh, picture to yourself the distraction of the parents of an only daughter in such a condition, and the thirst tor revenge of an only brother who had been married honourably but five weeks. Revenge was the only thing that had any charms for him, and we all determined to have it, for I was dishonoured with the rest. They knew I could forge a lady's hand<lb></lb>writing. I penned the note which was found on deceased's person, and sent it by a young woman whom De la Rue knew. He attended to the as<lb></lb>signation, and was on the spot where he had effected the ruin of an innocent creature, and where he met his fate. I and the brother accompanied each other till we came to Haverstock-field, when we separated, he to the fatal spot and I to the Swiss Tavern, which we appointed our rendezvous, but not until I had waited for some time. I myself distinctly heard the cry of'Murder.' I then knew the scene had commenced, but neither the brother nor I had any presage or thought of the issue. After waiting some time for him at the tavern, I hastened to Haverstock-field. This is the explanation of my anxiety to feel the pulse of the deceased, and my shedding tears when I witnessed the result of that revenge which had not death for its object, but serious mutilation. I hurried to the house of the perpetrator, who had flown there for refuge. I then took the whole upon myself, as I had been the principal cause of the tragedy. I immediately rushed from the house and sought a slaughter-house in Hampstead, and disfigured my clothes in a pool of blood which I found handy. You see, sir, I cannot account for the bloody state of my clothes without giving a reason for making them so—here is the difficulty. O God! I could pass through the impending ordeal in unison with my wishes. I have mentioned no names to you; and oh, did you but see the state of my mind! I cannot prove that I was not on the spot at the time of action, unless I, to save myself who am innocent, bring to justice those who, as far as intention was concerned, are equally so. Am I sure that by such a course I should be free from imputation! And if they should turn their backs upon me—which it is in their power to do—what then would become of me? See how I am surrounded by dif<lb></lb>ficulties! I will not say anything more to acquit myself—that is at the best only dubious, and calculated to involve others in addition to myself—I can<lb></lb>not say more—my mind is almost bewildered."</p>

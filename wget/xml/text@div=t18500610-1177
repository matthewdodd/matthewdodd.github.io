                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Grimshaw, of 33 1/2, Pear-tree-court, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. My husband rents the house—we let the upper part, and live in the lower—the prisoner lived in the next house, and removed from there on the last day of May—on 1st of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went up-stairs to my lodgers on the first floor with some needle-work—before I went up I locked my parlour-door—the parlour window which is on the side of the street was fastened—when I went up the prisoner was in the lodger's room—when I had been there about a quarter of an hour, the prisoner said, "Good morning," and went down—she had only an empty basket in her hand—in ten minutes after I was called down by a child—I found the parlour door wide open—the win<lb></lb>dow was as I left it—I went into the room and missed a coat, a waistcoat, a pair of trowsers, three shirts, a pair of gloves, two silk handkerchiefs, and a tea-pot containing 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some other things—I had seen them safe when I left the room—the prisoner was gone—it was then about twenty-five minutes past ten o'clock, and the prisoner came back about five in the after<lb></lb>noon, and was taken into custody—I have not seen any of the things since—I had two sheets of brown paper, and I missed one of them—this basket is similar to the one the prisoner had in her hand.</p>

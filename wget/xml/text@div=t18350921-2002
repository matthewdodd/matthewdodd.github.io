On the 28th of August, I was passing Mr. Crank's door, and saw a great number of people there—he is a miller and flour-dealer—a person stopped me, and said I was wanted—I went in and saw Mrs. Jelf, the last prisoner, they gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave instructions to Grimley to stop there—I got information; and pro<lb></lb>ceeded to Tanners-and—I went to the house that the last prisoner had describded—I Knocked at the door, it was opened, I stepped in—I saw the two prisoners in the house, the son and father together—I asked Richard Jelf to give me leave to look over his house; he said yes, he had no objec<lb></lb>tion</p>

"—he said some<lb></lb>thing which I could not understand—another officer came up stairs with Richard Jelf—I told that officer to go down stairs, which he did—I then took the candle, and in the garden, under the window from whence William Jelf had thrown something I found a bag with six bad shillings in it, and one good one—the father was standing near the back window—I did not see him do any thing—I turned round, and said to the two prisoners, "This is what I was looking for", showing the shillings—I put them into the bag, and took them both into custody—Richard Jelf then asked me if I knew where his wife was—I said, "Yes, in custody at Mr. Crank's"—I took them in my cart to the watch-house—I went next day to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, and saw Canning who gave me another counterfeit shil<lb></lb>ling, which I have here—I went to the watch-house that afternoon, and asked Jelf how he was—he said he was pretty well, but not very com<lb></lb>fortable, being in such a place—he said he was pretty well, but not very any thing about that being bad money, for I found it last Monday morning, 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in a paper, near stamford-hill gate, "and he did not know but that it was all good.</p>

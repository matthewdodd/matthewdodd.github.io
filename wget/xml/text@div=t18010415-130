I heard a scuffle behind me, I turned round, and saw a man seized, and charged with having picked a gentleman's pocket, but who it was I do not know, I cannot say that it was the prisoner, I only had a glimpse of him; he was taken into custody, and a man held up a book in the crowd, which I thought looked like mine; I knew it to be my property; I was desired by a man to give him my address, which I did; a few days afterwards I received a summons to attend the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never was guilty of the least offence in my life to any fellow-creature: On the 6th of April, Backrow came up to me, d - d my eyes, and said, you are reputed thief and pick-pocket, you know I have had you before; I told him I would satisfy him to the contrary; I said, go with me to Mr. Chadwick's, and mentioned several other names; he would not, but said, no, and at that moment an officer came up; I said, I throw myself under your protection, these men have used me exceedingly ill; he searched me, and said, that young man has nothing about him, let him go, or take him over to Mr. Chadwick's; that boy, I solemnly declare never interfered, nor did I ever see him, till I saw him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a dealer in glass, in Coppice-row, Clerkenwell: I have seen the two Backrows since I have been attending here; I asked one of them when he thought the trial would come on, he said, the next day, perhaps; he said it was a great pity the matter should ever have been brought here, for it might have been settled for a very little expence at first; I did not make him any reply.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was that gentleman with his own hair that said that to you? - A. Yes; the other Backrow was standing by his side, and they both said it, upon my oath; I have known the prisoner from a child, he was in the plated line in Coppice-row; he has been my neighbour about two years; I have lived in the parish eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150079"></xptr>Q. Is he in partnership with his father? - A. I believe his father's name is to the bills.</p>
               <p>Waterman. He called at my uncle's house, and said, he wished it was all over; he said I was not to take any notice of what the Jews said; my uncle said, he has no right to take any notice of what they said, only to say the truth; I was on the stairs, and heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Pattenden). Q. When was this conversation which the Backrows? - A. On Monday evening, about half past seven o'clock, in the Sessions-house yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew they were witnesses in this cause? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were one of the bail, and had heard them examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes; I asked them if they knew when the trail would come on; they said they could not tell, they thought it would the next day; to the best of my recollection, I said it was a great pity a person of character and respectability should be in such a predicament; the reply the short one, Lyon, made, to whom I was speaking, was, that Mr. Lawton acted very foolish, in suffering it to be brought here to this Court, for it might have been settled at first for a little trifle, or a mere trifle; the other was close to him, and he said it might have been settled for a trifle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him how it might be settled? - A. I did not; it struck me at the moment that there could be but one meaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to this young man's uncle, did you or not go to him? - A. On Friday last, I went with Mr. Gilliard, a schoolmaster in Islington-road, in his chaise, to enquire the character of the lad of his master, who, I suppose, is his uncle; but as to the conversation that he has stated, I deny it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy? - A. No; I went purely to ask the character of the lad; the gentleman that went with me, was to be the spokesman, and he did speak; we found he was a lad of good character; Mr. Gilliard said we did not come to stop any thing from going on, but to ask his character, and that he might not be dictated to by people of bad character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I keep an academy at Islington: I have known Mr. Lawton five or six years; I never heard any thing to impeach his character.</p>


               <p>Court. Q. Had you any conversation with either of the two Backrows? - A. Not till about half an hour ago; they were taking the boy on one side, and I told them it was very improper; I had no other conversation with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Waterman? - A. Yes; he lives with Ball and Brewen in Leadenhall-street; I went there last Thursday, or Friday, with Mr. Pattenden, I saw the master of the shop; I told him, the person that had been charged with taking the book, was a person of respectability, and wished him to caution the boy to speak nothing but the truth, and that the two men, who were the prosecutors, I had heard, were persons of very indifferent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is a boy of character or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Messrs. Abbott and Newbury, and eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010415-130-verdict732" type="verdictDescription">

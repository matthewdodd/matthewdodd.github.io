                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Ashton, a licensed victualler, of Bride-lane. On 2nd Nov. a tall young man came to the bar and called for a pint of beer—he gave me half a sovereign—I tested it on my finger; it was good—the prisoners came in at the other door—Howard asked for a glass of port wine and a glass of porter—she threw me down a sove<lb></lb>reign—I gave her the half-sovereign I took from the man, and said, "I will give you 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the till"—she said, "Oh dear me, how light this is!"—I said, "It is a good one"—she said, "I would rather have silver a great deal"—I said, "Nonsense, it is good"—Mr. Mitchell said, "Here is silver," and gave her four half-crowns—I rung the half-sovereign on the counter, and am prepared to say it was a good one—Mr. Mitchell had not examined the half-sovereign before he gave her the silver—the moment Howard had re<lb></lb>ceived the four half-crowns the prisoners left—as soon as Mr. Mitchell took the half-sovereign he pronounced it to be bad—he showed it to me—I wrapped it in paper, put it on a shelf, and afterwards gave it to the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Rose and Crown in Torrington-street, Surrey. On 2nd Nov., about five o'clock, a tall man came in and asked for a glass of gin—before I could serve him the prisoners came in—the man put down a half-sovereign in their presence—Howard asked for a glass of shrub and a glass of porter—before I served her I took the half-sovereign of the man, and knowing they had been there before, I looked at it very particularly, and am able to swear it was a goof one—I put it down in the receas, expecting Howard was going to ask for change for a sovereign—the prisoners then asked for change for a sovereign—I took the half-sovereign, looked at it parti<lb></lb>cularly again, and gave it them with the rest of the change—as soon as I had turned my back Howard said, "This half-sovereign feels very light; I will thank you to change it"—Page said, "Oh my dear! I think it is good; do not give the gentleman the trouble to change it"—Howard said, "I think it is light; I would rather have silver"—I took the half-sovereign, went to the station, got a policeman, and gave the prisoners in charge—Howard wanted to take the half-sovereign out of my hand—she said, "Let me look at it"—I said, "No, you have seen it before"—I had know the man who came in before, and I should know him again.</p>

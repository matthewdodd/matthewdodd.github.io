            , Wife of the said Isaac Symbole, and her two Sisters were Tried the last Sessions, but acquitted. He was likewise indicted upon the Statute of Stabbing.</p>
               <p>The Indictment against Mr. Regnier set forth:</p>
               <p>That he, not having the Fear of God before his Eyes, but being instigated and seduced by the Devil, on the <rs id="t16950403-18-cd74" type="crimeDate">30th day of January</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t16950403-18-off73 t16950403-18-cd74"></join> last past, in and upon Isaac Symbole did make an Assault, and with a Rapier value 5 s. did give him one Mortal Wound in and upon the Right Pap, of the Breadth of One Inch, and of the Depth of Six Inches, of which he instantly died.</p>
               <p>The Sum of the Depositions against him, was in manner and form agreeable to what was declared against the three Women the last Sessions in the General, but as to the Particulars, the Reader may please to take it thus:</p>
               <p>On the day above said Mr. Regnier, with the two Sisters, came to Mr. Symbole's house, and there brought Wine to drink with him, according to a former Appointment, and afterwards they fell to playing at Cards. Mr. Symbole being at an adjacent Alehouse was sent for, and being come home, they complimented each other very civilly; then Mr. Symbole ordered a Supper to be drest, and after it was eat, they play'd at Cards, the Game being Bone-Ace. The Prisoner and Mr. Symbole hapning to turn up two Sevens, they fell out about it, Mr. Symbole saying, that he would have the Cards dealt again: which Mr. Regnier refused; Mr Symbole having won upon the same Lay before. So Mr. Symbole and the Prisoner had some hot words; Mr. Symbole telling Mr. Regnier, That he was a Rogue, and had been in the Crown Office?</p>
               <p>Why if I have, Says the Prisoner, yes I was never in the Pillory: Or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>From that they fell to Blows, but Mr. Regnier had a Sword all bloody; which he was seen to wipe. The Maid of the house coming up Stairs, found her Master almost dead, but the Prisoner got away, so did the two Sisters, Mr. Symbole immediately dying. The Surgeon declared, that upon search of his Body, he found no less than Eighteen Wounds about him, Five of which was supposed Mortal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Regnier upon his Defence, proved that Mr. Symbole was a person of an evil temper, and passionate disposition, given to quarrelling, and called the two Sisters aforesaid, who were present, to give an account of the matter of Fact, who did both declare, That Mr. Symbole fell upon Mr. Regnier in a very violent manner and gave him a Blow on the Face with his Fist; upon which, Mr. Regnier said he could not take that though it was in his own house: So Mr. Symbole persisted, and said, Let me come at him, I'll knock his Brains out. But they could not part them, and being thus affrighted, they went away, and left them fighting, but did not see Mr. Regnier's Sword drawn.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called several other Witnesses, who gave account further, that the deceased Symbole was a very quarrelsom Man, and given to fighting; particularly, that he had wounded one Mr. Lane in the head with a Tankard, he bruising the Tankard with the Blow: And that he used to abuse several persons that came to him for money, insomuch that Lane said he durst not ask him for the money he ow'd him. And being once in the King's-Bench, he abused the Prisoners, insomuch that he was forced to be turned over to the Common-side, to keep him from doing further mischief; being Iron'd and kept close, till he had humbled himself to the Master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Regnier further alledged, That Mr. Symbole was too strong for him, and struck him several Blows; taking a Fire-fork that was in the Room, and came to knock his Brains out: so he was forced to defend his Life with his Sword, and could not avoid what was done; the Fire fork being found lying near Mr. Symbole when he lay dead.</p>
               <p>He also called several Persons of Quality, who declared on his behalf, That he was a very civil and sober temper'd Man, never given to any quarrelling, but of a fair Reputation, and never given to take offence, nor give any; that he was a Gentleman that came of a good and very worthy Family, and a <rs id="t16950403-18-deflabel75" type="occupation">Barister at Law</rs>

               <p>Then he proceeded further, That there was no Evidence of Malice, and the Room was so little, that he could no ways give back, or get from Mr. Symbole, to avoid his wrath; and therefore he was very sorry for so great a misfortune yet hoped that by what account he had given of the Disposition of the deceased, and of the Reputation of himself, the Court would consider so maturely of the Fact, as that he should be accounted innocent.</p>
               <p>Then the Court summ'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Gentlemen of the Jury very distinctly, and upon the whole matter, the Jury having well consider'd the matter of Fact, they returned this Verdict, That Mr. Regnier was <rs id="t16950403-18-verdict76" type="verdictDescription">

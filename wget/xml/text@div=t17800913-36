               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish her? - Yes, I pursued her immediately, and came up with her on the other side Temple-bar.</p>

               <p>Was any person with her? - No, not at that time; when I came up with her, I said she had taken my purse; she said it was no such a thing; then I called out for the watch; the watch came, and some people came and asked what was the matter? I said the woman had taken my purse out of my pocket with so much money in it; the watchman came, and the other prisoner came too, and made herself very busy, and said they should let that woman alone; as she was so busy, the people said I should search both; they were both secured, and taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Before you met with Johnson, are you sure you had the money? - Yes, I felt it just when I was with her, walking in the street.</p>

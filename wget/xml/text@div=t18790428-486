                  </hi>. I am one of the warders of H.M. Prison, the House of Correction, Coldbath Fields—the prisoner was undergoing a sen<lb></lb>tence of imprisonment there—he was under my charge on the morning of 22nd March; I saw him about a quarter-past 6—I had no conversation with him—he was given over to my charge by the infirmary officer, and I passed him on to his cell—I saw him again about 7.30; he was let out of his cell—I saw him later, about 10.15, when he saw Mr. Gilbert, the assistant-surgeon—he examined the prisoner in my presence; he put nothing down in the book—the prisoner complained of toothache—the doctor examined his mouth—if he found that he was suffering from illness he ought to have put something down—it was my duty to bring the matter before the governor for disturbing the prison at night without cause—I took him before the governor about 10.30—I told the governor in the prisoner's presence what had occurred; I said, "The prisoner went up to the infirmary last evening; he was brought down this morning; he has seen the surgeon, and there is nothing the matter with him"—the prisoner made no reply to that that I am aware of, not to me—the governor directed me to get a certificate from the chief surgeon, and I with one of the principal warders, Reynolds, went to the infirmary and saw Dr. Smiles, the surgeon, and Mr. Gilbert, the assistant-surgeon, was with him—Dr. Smiles examined the prisoner, and gave a certificate that there was nothing the matter with him—I took the prisoner back to the office and reported what the surgeon said, and handed the certificate in—the governor said, "Let it stand over till to-morrow," but that being Sunday I said, "You mean Monday, sir," and he said "Yes"—I then took the prisoner back to his cell—about 11.30 I was sitting in the warders' room in the D ward, writing; I was sitting sideways to the door—a prisoner named Montrose was cleaning the room; while I was there I received a severe blow on the side of the head, or rather over the eye, which knocked me off the stool on which I was sitting, into the fireplace; I did not see where the blow came from, but I heard the words, "Take that, you, b—;" I knew it was the prisoner by his voice—he then seized the tongs from the fireplace and struck at my head with all his force, standing over me; I was lying on the ground; I put up my hands and warded off the blows; he did touch my head, but not severely to injure me much—I wrenched the tongs from him; he pulled me up by raising the tongs, and I struck at him with the tongs in self-defence—at that time blood was flowing freely from the wound over my eye—the prisoner then seized the poker from the fireplace, and was about to strike me, when assistance arrived; Dyer came to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured with the assistance I could give; he was very violent indeed—when he was secured he said he wished he had killed the b——.</p>

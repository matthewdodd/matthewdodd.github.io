                  </hi> I am a sailor. On 9th May I had just left the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel, and met two girls about a hundred yards from it, who asked where I was going; I said, "Aboard"—they asked if I wanted a night's lodging—I said, "Yes;" as it was getting very dark, and I should not find my way aboard—it was about twelve o'clock then—they took me to a house, I went in, and they told me to go up-stairs to bed—there was a light on the table just by the door—the prisoners and another man stood at the door, and <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me by the throat, and took my money from my pocket—there was a knife and a key there—they did not take them—I called "Police!"—two policemen came in private clothes—I was very much hurt, and could not speak for a good <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>—I am sure of the prisoners—the police<lb></lb>man asked me, before he took them, what they had on, and I told him—I had counted my money as I went into the house—it is about a quarter of a mile from the Pavilion—the girls walked with me all the way, not arm in arm—one girl went into the house and fetched the three men—they did not come till I was inside—I gave the girls a half-crown for the lodging, and then had a half-crown 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—the men then went to a corner house, about twenty yards off, I followed, and stood at the door till a policeman came—they came out just as the police came, and I gave them in charge.</p>

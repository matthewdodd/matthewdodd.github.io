The hogshead struck the child on the back; then sir this child was killed.</p>

            . Q. Were you one of the boys that were playing with the deceased. - A. I was about the sugar casks before the man came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all that happened. - A. Yes. I was picking one of the sugar casks; and when I saw the man come I run away, and some more, and then there was a child on one side of the cask that the man could see; he drove it away with his hat. Then the man shoved the cask, but he could not see the child of the other side, for it was quite the other side of the tub; then I cried out, Mr. Arnaut there is a child, but the tub was too much gone, he could not save it; it hit the child, the tub rolled off the child; the man and me run to take the tub further from the child; the man took the child in his arms, and his wife took it; there was some women took the child into Wellcose-square to the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Then the poor man did what he could, he had his wife to his assistance. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The child was of the other side of the cask, it was quite impossible for him to see it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you called out he endeavoured to stop it from going on the child. - A. He could not save it, it was too far gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was against his will. - A. Yes. I had often seen the man there, he used to bring tubs there, and after that they were put in the yard a little way from the square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 18th of May I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160024"></xptr>four hogsheads of a grocer in Broad-street, St. Giles; he sent them me in Cartwright-square. The man laid them two by two, the tierce he laid in one of the hogsheads, which came higher up than the hogshead; I came to take them into a yard that I had; there was a number of children about the hogsheads; I warned them to get out of the way. I laid hold of the bottom of the hogshead to bring it towards me, unfortunately it went, and unfortunately the child came out of the yard right facing, and the hogshead rolled upon it; I took the child up in my arms, and enquired who it belonged to; I gave it to my wife, and desired her to take care of the child; I went to Dr. Warner, and told him of the accident; I entreated him to come to the child, and any thing it come to I would give to him; he told me it was of no use; before I came back, the child was taken by the parents (I was told) to the hospital; I went to the hospital, I met the father of the child, he told me the child was dead; I said I was very sorry for the accident.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

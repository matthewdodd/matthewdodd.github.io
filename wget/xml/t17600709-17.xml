            . I live in Mount street, just by my Lord Pomfret.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176007090011"></xptr>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Tebay. I am a stable keeper, and I am a constable; I think it was about the beginning of June I was desired by my Lord Pomfret to take the prisoner into custody; I went to my Lord's house, and took him up; he was a servant there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>
               <p>Tebay. I do not know; my Lord said the prisoner had taken a purse of money out of his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was my Lord present when you took the prisoner in custody?</p>
               <p>Tebay. He was; my Lord mention'd what the sum was, but that I cannot be certain to.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tebay. He denied it at first; I told him he had better own it; then he went along with me to where he had conceal'd it; I followed him to a little place where my Lord's horses stand; he went up into a lost, and upon an old ceiling he look'd about, and put his hand up to within 2 or 3 tyles of the ridge tyle into a little hole, and pull'd out a purse of gold, and gave it to me; I took and brought it to my Lord; my Lord told the money, as near as I can guess there were 29 or 30 guineas. I believe 30.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he took them out of the tyling?</p>
               <p>Tebay. I asked him how he came by it, and where; he said he took it, in order to take care of it, till my Lord came home, and that he took it out of my Lord's room from off a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what day it was?</p>
               <p>Tebay. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long he had had it in his possession?</p>
               <p>Tebay. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether my Lord had been out of town at that time?</p>
               <p>Tebay. No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the boy with you when you delivered it to my Lord?</p>
               <p>Tebay. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did my Lord ask him any questions?</p>
               <p>Tebay. I believe he did, but I can't repeat the words.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say?</p>
               <p>Tebay. Then he said he was sorry that he had done it, but he did intend to give it my Lord again, or to that purpose.</p>

               <p>Barnes. I am groom.</p>

               <p>Barnes. He went on errands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been there?</p>
               <p>Barnes. About 3 months.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be suspected?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I do not know. I think it was because all the other servants had been examined, and he was the last; he was not in the way when they were examined, and he was the first that went into the room, after my Lord was gone, to take the things away, between 11 and 12.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it?</p>
               <p>Barnes. It was my Lord's dressing room; I saw him come down again with the constable.</p>

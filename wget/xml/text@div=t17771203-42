               <p>What are you? - I was clerk to a gentleman in St. Martin's Lane a month or two ago; I am out of employment at present: I know the prisoner. On Saturday the 18th of October, about eight or nine in the morning, I was at a stable in Green-street, Grosvenor-Square, near where the prisoner lived, and where he puts up his horse at bringing home the mail. The hostler told me that the prisoner's wife wanted to speak to me. I saw her about twelve that day; she said she wanted to speak with me; I went home with her. The prisoner came in in a minute or two; he lived at the back of the Three Compasses in Green-street, in a little alley. There were ten notes shewed me before he came in. When he came in, he said he found them. I asked him where he found them; he said, in the necessary at the Post-Office, and that he did not know what they were; he wanted me to tell him what they were, and he asked me to advise him what was best to do with them, for that his wife told him they were lottery tickets. I saw them, and explained to him what they were. He said he found them rolled up like waste paper. He said there was a letter and seal to it, but that the seal was broke, and the bill rolled up in the letter. I asked him what became of the letter; he said he had used part of it at the necessary in the Post-Office; that he went out with his mail; and the next morning, when he returned to the stable, he made use of the other part in the stable. I asked him how long he had had them; he said, on the Tuesday or Wednesday se'nnight before that: this was on Saturday the 18th. He asked me what I could direct him to do with them; I told him he should have carried them to the office: He said he could not do that, for he knew they were so strict and severe at the Office, that they would imagine that he had taken the latter himself, and would not believe that he found it. I said, as he had kept it so long, they certainly would now, and I did not know how to advise him in it. I asked him if I should take them myself for him; he objected to that, because he had had them so long by him, and said, he wished it had happened at first. He said he could neither write nor read, and begged I would look in the Papers, and see if they had been advertised during the time he had had them. I searched the Papers, but found nothing advertised concerning the notes. I returned, and told him they had not been advertised. I asked him if he had constantly attended his duty; he said, Yes, and drove the mail every night, and had paid great attention to see if there was any enquiry concerning such notes at the Post-Office, but had heard of none there. That was the whole of the conversation at that time. This was on the 18th.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. How came he, if he thought they were lottery tickets, to say he paid great attention to touching these notes; it seems as if he knew as well as you that they were notes? - That I cannot tell; that was what he said, if there was any enquiry touching the letter or the things he had. On the Wednesday or Thursday he came down to me a mile out of town, and said he was very uneasy concerning the notes, and desired to consult with me what was best to be done.</p>

               <p>Where did he come to you? - To Westmore-Green, just beyond Paddington; he said, he was very uneasy while they were in his possession. I told him I would do the best for him when I was at leisure, for I was very busy then, but the day following I told him I would call upon him in a day or two. I saw him again on the Monday; he wanted to have something done with these notes; he said he was uneasy while they were in his possession; and he said, if they did him no good they should do him no hurt, and talked of making away with them. I proposed finding out the parties to whom they belonged, as I thought it not so proper to go then to the office. I thought him a very honest man; I could think of no way of finding out the parties but by advertising them, for which purpose I had drawn out an advertisement; this was Monday the 27th of October. I had drawn it up some days<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030031"></xptr> before; I read it to him, he approved of it, but was not willing to deliver the notes to me on those conditions, without I would take it upon myself.</p>
               <p>Take what upon yourself? - Take the charge upon myself, and say I found them; I said I would immediately go and advertise them, and find out the parties to whom they belonged if I could; he would not agree to that, unless I would say that I found them myself. He said, Could I, if put upon my oath, swear I found them? I said I did not suppose I should be put upon my oath; he then took them from me, and proposed dropping them for me to find them; then he proposed burning them rather than he should receive any hurt; he took them, and went into Hyde-Park, and I followed him, and he dropped them, and I picked them up and went immediately to Portland-Street, and told

I put them into Davis's hand, and desired him not to deliver them to any body unless I was present, and then I went to advertise them in the Daily Advertiser; the advertisement came out on Wednesday the 29th of October; I attended Davis on the 29th, but nobody came to enquire about them; as they were not enquired after I thought it would be proper to apply to the parties named in the bodies of the notes; I had heard of Admiral

On the Wednesday they were advertised, and nobody came after them.

               <p>I am comptroller of the Inland-office at the Post-Office.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - I have seen him constantly attending his duty. On the 3d of November when he came in with the mail, he was taken into custody by the porter, and kept till I came; on his examination by me and the solicitor, he said, he found the letter in the passage leading into the back yard.</p>
               <p>What letter? - This letter addressed to Lady

               <p>That is remote from the necessary? - A great way from the necessary, there is a yard between the passage and it, that is a common<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030032"></xptr> thoroughfare from the Post-Office into Abchurch-Yard till twelve o'clock at night; he said, he was very sorry for ever having had the letter in his possession, and wished to God he had burnt it; he said he had opened the letter and made use of the cover, and that he delivered the notes into the hands of Mr. Nocke.</p>
               <p>It does not often happen in the Post-Office to have letters dropped in the passage? - Letters may be dropped by persons that bring them, but never any that have been in the office, or brought by any of the receivers in bags.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Knight Brothers, cigar importers, 7, Lawrence, Pountney Lane—on Friday, 23rd June, a case of cigars worth 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., marked K 459, was placed in the passage of the warehouse—at 4.40 I went into Cannon Street, and saw the case on a truck, and on my looking pointly at it the prisoner Brown dropped the handle of the truck and ran away—I recognised the case by the mark, and a carman came and took it-back for me—I gave a description of the man who was drawing the truck, and that same evening I went to the station and picked out Brown from nine or ten other men to the best of my belief.</p>

The policeman told me he thought he had got the man, from the description I gave—I described him as a youngish man—the nine or ten men were all ages, but older than Brown—I said "I believe that is the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, but I would rather not swear to him"—I was 30 or 40 yards from the truck when I first saw it, I saw the man for about half a minute; I can't say whether another man was following it, my attention was drawn to the man drawing the truck—I never said that I believed the other man had a wooden leg—when I first saw Brown it was at night by gaslight, and I said I could not then swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I identified him directly in the morning—I have not the slightest doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Honeysuckle Square, Moor Lane—on 23rd June, Wilshire hired a truck from me, which he had been in the habit of doing—a man in a light suit, who I have not seen since, assisted him in pulling it—I afterwards saw Brown join Wilshire, at the top of the court, there were three men altogether; I afterwards saw the two prisoners at the station standing with nine or ten other men, and I picked them out directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The other men were about the same age as the prisoners; I should know the third man.</p>

From information I received, about 12 o'clock, on 23rd June, I went to the Tap public-house, and there found the two prisoners—I told them I apprehended them for stealing a chest of cigars—Brown said he knew nothing about it, and that he had only been with the other prisoner ten minutes before—Wilshire said "That is quite true, I have only seen him about ten minutes"—they were charged at the station and made no reply.</p>

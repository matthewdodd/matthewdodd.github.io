                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 22, Dover-street, Piccadilly, in the parish of St. George. The prisoner was my foot-boy between four and five months—I discharged him on the 28th of March—on the night of the 1st of April, I retired to bed a little after eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock—the doors and windows were reported to me by the cook to be secure—I was awoke a little after three o'clock in the morning before daylight, by somebody turning the handle of my bed-room door, which was locked—I listened and heard it a second time—I immediately got out of bed, and perceived a light in the next room, which it a dressing-room, but there is a bed in it—I perceived the light under the crack of the door—I exclaimed, "There is a thief or thieves in the room, and a light also"—I immediately rung the up-stairs bell for the maid—I threw up the sash window, and sprung a rattle which brought the police—I called out of the window that there were thieves in the house, and to take hold of any body they met with—I went down stairs in ten or fifteen minutes, and found the prisoner in the kitchen, in custody—the police had got into the house—they had called out, "It is all right, it is your servant—I observed the sash of the kitchen window up—and the bars had been loosened to enable him to enter—a skylight was broken all to pieces, which would enable him to enter the house—it was the skylight of the passage between the area and the kitchen—a person getting through the kitchen window would still be stopped—the kitchen door was bolted out<lb></lb>side, and he could have got no further, if he had not broken the skylight which gives light to the kitchen and passage—he might have gone lack, but he could not get into the rest of the house without breaking that—it is over the dresser—I saw a great coat in the hands of the police—it had been left in a back pantry—I had seen it there the day before—I value it at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a little servant boy who occupied the pantry where the coat was taken from.</p>

I was on duty in Dower<lb></lb>street, on the 1st of April, in the night, and heard a noise, about three o'clock, proceeding from the area of No. 22, Dover-street—I went to the area, looked over and saw the prisoner standing in the area underneath the steps, which are a wooden ladder—the area gate was shut, but unlocked—I called to him and said, "Is it all right there?"—he said, "It is all right, I have been on a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> to night"—I knew him before, and supposed he was still in the prosecutrix's service—I walked a short distance away, listened, and heard somebody striking a light—I thought all was right then, and went round my beat; and when I returned, I went to the area again, and heard another noise—I found the area gate still locked and somebody came out of the kitchen, or out of the coal celler, I could not say which—I said to him, "Is it all right down there?</p>

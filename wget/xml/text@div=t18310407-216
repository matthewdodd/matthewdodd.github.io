               <p>JAMES CHAMBERS. I am a Policeman. On the Friday Davy came to the station-house, and said he had found this property over night - I went to his house, and brought it from there; he is since deceased - his body was found on Saturday, previous to the Grand Jury sitting, and an inquest have returned a verdict of wilful murder against some persons unknown.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SCOTCHMER. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 11th of March; he said he knew what it was about, for he had heard about it, and that the night before he was coming from the doctor's, and met a man, who asked if he knew where Davy lived - that he took him there, and told him he had brought the man who owned the turpentine, but that he had had nothing more to do with it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What the witness has said last is entirely false.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are an auctioneer? A. Yes - I do not know of any such phrase in our trade as a knock out; there is among the brokers - it means when an article has been bought at a low price it is put up among themselves, and the advance is divided among them; there never was a knock out on my premises, to my knowledge - I do not remember any wine, or two bottles, which came to my share; I have had no quarrel with the prisoner - there was a carpet sold to Mr. Beckford, but there was no quarrel about that; I am so particular about the Excise duty, that I always leave it to be made out by the clerk; the prisoner has never threatened to lay an information against me for any sale- he has never threatened me with an Exchequer process; he has gone into another person's employ - I never had a sale through his means; I believe he has brought some bidders - he made himself very useful; while he was with me the sales increased - he was in Mr. Foster's employ before he came to me; I know an auctioneer named Parnell - I recollect a gentleman here present did send me some sales of wine; I believe it was in consequence of the prisoner being with me, but this was an addenda to the sale; there might be thirty dozen - there were not sixty dozen sold; the prisoner was a very industrious servant - I do not know that I have lost his interest since he left me; the parties he solicited come to me, I think, as many as before he left me - I did not send my son to the prisoner's brother-in-law, and do not know of his going.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner left your service, and gone to another auctioneer, before you made your charge? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN RITCHIE. I am a porter. I was standing at Mr. Cox's door, and the prisoner said he should have a job for me bye and bye; I cannot say when - it was three weeks before I was before the Magistrate; the prisoner said it was to take this glass to Mr. Fairchild's, in Portland-street - I took it, and he overtook me; he went with me to the house, and asked permission to leave it there till the evening - it was wrapped up in some bedfurniture; he said he wanted to get it away on the sly, as it did not suit him to pay for it on the Saturday night, and if he got it away he should not have to pay for it till Saturday week - he gave it to me in the little room at Mr. Cox's, about half-past two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not think there was any thing wrong in it? A. No - the foreman at a sale takes directions to send goods home to gentlemen, and what I thought he meant by the sly, was, that he was not prepared to pay for it - he wrapped it up.</p>
               <p>HENRY ROBERTS. I am a carver and gilder. I made this glass, and took it to Mr. Cox's on the 11th of October.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BALLARD. I am an officer. Mr. Cox's son gave charge of the prisoner - I asked if he knew any thing of a looking-glass; he said No, at first, and then said he had told Mr. Hollands all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing about an Exchequer process? A. Yes - something was said to Mr. Cox, Jun., but the prosecutor was not there then; I replied, "If you had not said that, perhaps he would not have been so severe about this."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say? A. He said he would bring Mr. Cox to book for some duty not being paid on some sale - he said this after he was in my custody; he did not say he had threatened that before - he said he would do it.</p>

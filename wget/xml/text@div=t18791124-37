                  </hi>. My firm were solicitors for Mr. Leatherdale the trustee—down to the oriminal proceedings we wore solicitors for the petitioning creditor, Mr. Bangs—we were seeking to make Appleby a bank<lb></lb>rupt for avoiding his creditors, and we summoned Budgett to tie Bankruptcy Court to give evidence on that point—I have the original draft affidavit—I had only seen Budgett in the Bankruptcy Court before that, when I ex<lb></lb>amined him; he came to me once, I believe, 19th January, 1875, after the adjudication—this is the draft of the arrangement made before he gave me</p>

               <p>any information—a day or two after 29th January the trustees' managing clerk, Mr. Humphrey, who has since died, came to me, and after that com<lb></lb>munication I saw Budgett—this draft was, I believe, drawn up on the 28th, and presented to Mr. Budgett on the 29th—I drew it upon the instructions of Mr. Humphrey, who was Mr. Leatherdale's managing clerk—the engross<lb></lb>ment of that was put before Budgett; he approved of it, and Mr. Leather<lb></lb>dale signed it; he came to my office on the same day, and the affidavit was taken down by my clerk—I read it to Budgett—I did not see him sign it; it was afterwards filed.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practise in South wart Bridge; Road, and have known the defendant ever since he was a boy—about the middle of April, 1875, I attended him for an accident to his right hand; erysipelas had set in, and he was getting in a somewhat critical con<lb></lb>dition—I felt somewhat anxious about him, as he was in a State which would soon become dangerous, and by my advice he Went into St. Bar<lb></lb>tholomew's Hospital, where he remained, I dare say, three months—I saw him there several times, and I saw Mr. Morant make I think it was 26 incisions in his arm at one time—he must have suffered very acute pain, and was in that critical condition that Mr. Morant consulted, me about writing to his friends, as he was very likely to sink—I after<lb></lb>wards advised him to go to the sea-side for change of air—his arm swelled to such a size that I can quite imagine he had to wear these splints (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he has quite lost the use of his middle finger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am' a registered medical practitiomer—I saw the state in which he was at this time, and I corroborate Mr. Preston's statement; I was of opinion for some days that he would never recover, and that opinion was shared by the medical officer—this is the splint which he wore when he got better—he required change of air and scene when he came out, and we advised him to get away—he has now been in London two years and a half.</p>

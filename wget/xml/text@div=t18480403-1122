                  </hi> I am clerk to the justices of the police-court, Clerkenwell. ON 22nd Jan. the defendant appeared there on a charge of libel—a notice had been issued—the prisoner attended with a bill like this, having reference to the death of George Erry, on which he wrote "Mr. William Mason, 21, Clerkenwell-green," as his employers, to print them—they were then returned to him—one of them was a bill like this—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was an address to the rate payers, purporting to give an account of the death of George Erry, who was literally boiled alive in the soup copper, and the su<lb></lb>picious means used for suppressing the evidence; also the quilly connivance of the Guardians of Clerkenwell, founded on communications received from Mr. William Mason, a guardian of the poor, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> After my name was called by the Magistrates, did not you and Mr. Boulton, the solicitor for the prosecution, take me into the Magistrates private room to propose a compromise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. you appeared in the public court—I was informed you were in court—I went to the Magistrate, and intimated that you were present—Mr. Boulton was sitting at the table, you appeared in front of that table—I said, "Is your name Edward Hancock? "—you said, "Yes"—I then took up the notice, and read from it that you were summoned to appear. to produce two papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You took me into a private room, on the left-hand side, and said, "Are you disposed to give any information?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was what took place in the public court, before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you the means of taking him into any private room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—some intimation was given me that he was present I was in the clerk's office—I walked into the court, and asked if his name was Edward Hancock—he said, "Yes," and produced the papers—he put them in as the printer—I then asked him the name of the person who em<lb></lb>ployed him to print them—he took a pen from the table and wrote "William Mason"—I asked if he put that name down as the printer—he said, "Yes"</p>

                  </hi> I am solicitor to the board of Guardians of Clerkenwell. I took out a summons against the prisoner, as printer of this bill, to produce the name of the person who employed him—I attended—he was in the clerk''s office with me—I said, if he chose then to tell me who if was employed him, we need not give him or the Magistrate any further trouble—he refused, and we went into the public room—he there stated be was the printer and publisher, and wrote down "William Mason, 21, Cler<lb></lb>kenwell-green," as the person who employed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I caused a notice to be sent to you to this effect, "Take notice that I require you to produce the book of minutes used by the Court of Guardians relative to the death of George Erry;" have you got the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have heard there was a boy named George Erry sent to Norwood—I have no doubt it was so—I do not know that he fell head foremost into a copper—they were giving the boys some treat, and he had an accident.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that anything happened to this coach-house - A. On the night of the 9th of February the coach-house was broken open, and a box coat taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What connection has the coach-house with the dwelling-house - A. It is attached to the dwelling-house; there is a door way from the coach-house to the stable, and another door way from the stable to the dwelling-house; it is part of the dwelling-house. At seven o'clock in the night I was in the coach-house; when I came out I left nobody there; I locked the door; I brought the key away with me. I was alarmed at half past eleven at night by 
               <persName id="t18140420-59-person591">

            , a coachman. I had the key with me then; I got up, and went to the coach-house immediately. I found the coach-house door thrown wide open; the stable door lock had been picked apparently. We go through the stable door into the coach-house; that was the door I had locked the same night before I went into the coach-house to see what was the matter. I observed my box coat was gone. I had worn the box coat about two months. It was my master's property. I have seen the coat since in Mr. Foy's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any day light remaining when you locked up the stable -

            . Q. Do you know Butcher, the prisoner - A. Yes; I was in the habit of dealing with him. I cannot tell what day it was when he came to me, it was between twelve and one o'clock; he told me to go to his wife, he had left a great coat with her for me to buy; I was to give two-pounds for it; he had one box coat to dispose off. I saw his wife; I gave her two pounds for it. I brought the coat away with me. I parted with it to Mr. Foy. I was in custody. I told my children to take it to Mr. Foy. I come here to day from the house of correction.</p>

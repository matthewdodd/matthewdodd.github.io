                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Kerry, linendrapers, of Bishopsgate-street—on 6th November, about 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner entered the shop—she first asked for a reel of cotton, which I got—she then asked for some quilling—I brought her what I had—she said it did not suit, but she would buy some ribbon, and quill it herself—I them showed her some ribbon, and she asked me to cut off two yards, which I</p>

               <p>did—she then picked out another width, and asked for two yards of that—I was in the act of measuring it when I saw her take from the drawer a piece of black ribbon and conceal it under her shawl—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of it is 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it has got our private mark on it—Mr. Grinstead was standing by my side the whole time, and saw it all—he said to her, "Let me look at that piece of ribbon you have under your shawl"—she said, "You're mad"—he then lifted up her shawl, and the piece of ribbon dropped on the counter—Mr. Grinstead said to me, "You see it all," and I said, "Yes"—I went for a constable myself—I had not cut the last ribbon—the four yards of ribbon and the cotton would have come to 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not see any money in the prisoner's hand, nor did I see her drop any—I did not look in the shop near the spot where she was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Kerry and Grinstead, carrying on business in Bishopsgate-street—I remember the prisoner coming to my shop on the evening of 6th November—I was present when she asked for some cotton and ribbon—whilst the shopman was serving her I saw her looking at the ribbons, and she took hold of a narrow piece of ribbon; that excited my suspicions, it struck me that was not the colour she wanted, or the width—she took it up a second time, and put it down, and took up the wide piece with her finger, and put it under her arm—this is it—it is my property—I leant over the counter and said, "You have got a piece of my ribbon"—she said, "Oh, my God! I have not," and she stepped back and put it down—that was all that took place between us, no further conver<lb></lb>sation—I sent for a policeman and gave her into custody—I did not see her drop any money—I looked in the shop for some time afterwards.</p>

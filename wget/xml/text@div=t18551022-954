                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hutton, as wholesale stationers, at Budge-row, City. Miller and Wake have been in our employment, the one ten or eleven, and the other five or six years—Miller was a porter in the warehouse, and was well acquainted with all its departments, and where all the different kinds of goods were kept—Nash</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220078"></xptr>
               <p>was a carman in our employ—it was his duty to drive the cart for the town delivery—it was Miller's duty to select the goods from Mr. Gregory's list—in the course of business, a list of the goods required each day was delivered to him—it was his duty to see the cart loaded, and to check it by the invoices—if there were any papers besides those that were invoiced, he would be able to detect it—it was not the course of business to deliver any paper without an invoice—I know of no customer in Webber-street—Moss is not a customer of ours, and never has been—nor was Lewis, or any person in Mitre-street—Neale, the porter, helps to load the cart—Moss was apprehended on 15th Sept, and on the following Saturday, the 22nd, I took Miller and Wake up into a private room, and said I wished to speak to them separately—I said to both, "Now, what can you tell about this robbery business?"—they both said distinctly, "Nothing"—I said, "Yes, you do; you know Moss and Lewis, and especially Moss"—they distinctly stated that they knew nothing whatever of Moss and Lewis—a policeman was there, and I gave them into custody.</p>

TALFOURD SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Miller been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten years—during that time I have always had a good opinion of him—he was superior porter, not a porter to carry out goods—it was part of his duty to superintend the placing the papers in such a way as to be carried away afterwards, also to load the cart—he would have an assistant, but he was the responsible party—sometimes an order for paper is given over night, but I do not think the paper is got up over night, except as an exception—the whole establishment would have access to the place where the paper is sorted out—Miller would have a list of the goods from his superior, Mr. Gregory—he might be called Mr. Gregory's man—Mr. Gregory overlooks the arrangements, and gives him instructions—Miller sees nothing of the cart after it leaves the establish<lb></lb>ment—he was not taken till about seven days after Moss—he has denied all knowledge of the robbery from the first.</p>

On 15th Sept I took Moss into custody—I said, "I am a police officer; I wish to know how you got the paper you sold to Mr. Smaile, the printer, of Gibraltar-row, as it has been stolen?"—he said, "I bought it at a sale at Camden-town"—I said, "What part of Camden-town?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "What is the name of the person you bought it of?"—he said that he could not tell—I asked him whether he had any document referring to the sale; he said that he did have a catalogue, and if it was not burnt it would be at home—I asked him where he lived; he said, "6, Wootton-street, Cornwall-road, in the back parlour"—Wootton-street runs from the New Cut by the Victoria-theatre—I took him to Bow-lane station—we passed Union-street, Borough, and I said, "You sold some paper to Mr. Foster, in Union-street"—he replied, "Yes"—I said, "Did you buy that in Camden-town also?"—he said, "Certainly not"—I said, "Where then?"—he said, "Oh, many places"—I asked him the names of the parties of whom he had bought it—he said, "Oh, different people"—after I had stated the charge against him at the police station, I said, "Can you name one person of whom you bought the paper you sold to Mr. Foster?"—he said, "Not without implicating others; I cannot do that, I must not get other people into trouble"—I went to Wootton-street and searched the room, but found no invoices—I produce ten reams of paper which I received from James Smale, and ten reams from Mr. Harding.</p>

               <p>this is the departure stamp—I believe it is the duty of the finisher to put on the label—all double crown of this weight would be marked like this—there is a special Excise mark for each particular mill, so that I know that this came from mill No. 70—that is not one of our mills, but I have a letter from the mill—we buy of the owner of that mill, and I know that we had this lot of fifty-one reams—mill No. 70 supplies other houses—we had a certain quantity, and are deficient in that quantity—here are several kinds of tissue paper—there is no particular mark on them, only the mill numbers and the dates—I know that these two reams of large blue post were made specially for us—we had the whole of the parcel that was made, and I have the foreman and the finisher here—they are dated 17th July—if other mills made exactly the same paper, and sent it out, they would not put the same mill number on—I took these two wrappers off two reams of paper in our stock, they being the nearest to the missing numbers which we have left; but we have sold a great part.</p>

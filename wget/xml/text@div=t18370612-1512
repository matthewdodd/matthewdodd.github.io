                  </hi>. I am a poulterer, and live in Holborn-bridge. The prisoner was in my employ from the 24th of October—he managed a shop which I had in Red Lion-street, and received money on my account, which he accounted to me for nearly every evening—he has never account<lb></lb>ed to me for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.<hi rend="largeCaps">Q</hi>.</hi> Do you keep any books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have his books in Court, which will show he did not account for this sum—he accounted to me in writing every evening—the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is put in the book, but it was never handed over to me—he has entered the things as sold, and he ought to have put paid against it, and entered the money also in this other book—by looking at this book I should conclude the things were not paid for—he ought to have entered it on the 18th as cash received—he has entered other money as received that day, but the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is not entered at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Sometimes I am without the cash-book for three or four days, and I sometimes put the day's account on a sheet of paper. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He sometimes neglected to take the book to the shop—it may have been left a day or two—he has paid me money without entering it in the book—I can swear he has never paid me this 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and never told me of the receipt of it—he sometimes accounted for money on sheets of paper, but we always entered it from them, and then destroyed the paper—I have never destroyed a loose paper before the entry was made in the cash-book, to my knowledge—he might have paid me money on one or two occasions without entering it in the book, or on paper, but I will swear he did not on this occasion—he left me on the 24th of April, ill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the service of Mr. Reynolds, in Guildford-street, Russell-square. On the 18th of April I paid the pri<lb></lb>soner 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the bill was delivered on the 17th—he wrote the receipt in my presence.</p>

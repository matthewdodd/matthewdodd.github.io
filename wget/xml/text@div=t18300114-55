               <p>THOMAS MICKLEFIELD. I am shopman to a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. On the 30th of November the prisoner pawned this watch, in the name of Charles Romsey - I had never seen him before, but am certain of him; I value it at 3l. 10s.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a constable, and live in King-street, Westminster. On the 4th of December the prisoner gave himself up to me, and said he had stolen a watch from Scarle's coffee-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUCKNELL. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought there; I had been informed of this robbery, and said to him, "Whatever you say you must be careful, as it will be given in evidence against you;" he said he went into the room, took the watch from over the waiter's head, and pawned it at Woolwich for 2l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been unfortunately out of place for twelve months; I was there ten or twelve days, when Mr. Lawrence told me I did not suit him - that preyed on my mind, having suffered so much, being two or three days at a time without victuals; I made up my mind to enlist as a soldier - having no money I took the watch and intended to redeem it when I had enlisted, and send it back.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. He had applied to enlist at Woolwich.</p>
               <p>GUILTY of stealing to the value of 99s. only.</p>

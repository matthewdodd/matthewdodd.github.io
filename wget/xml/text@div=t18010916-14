             called. - Q. How old are you? - A.Going of thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes; if I tell lies, I shall not go to God, (sworn). I live near Mr. Henley, in Whitecross-street; I saw the prisoner chuck this tick up Cooper's-court as I was looking out at the window; I did not see where he took it from; I saw him run past the court, and chuck it up the court; I came down stairs directly; Mr. Henley had then got him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q.What window were you looking from? - A. The second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. The same side of the street, or the opposite side? - A. The same side of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear the prisoner is the same person? - A. Yes, because I saw a speck upon his cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. Go and look at him? (the witness went towards the bar) - A. It is not there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the person at the bar is the person that Mr. Henley took, or do you mean that he is the person that chucked the check up the gateway? - A. He is the same person that Mr. Henley took.</p>
               <p>MARY WYCOMBE sworn. - I was coming up Whitecross-street about five o'clock in the afternoon; there were two lads standing near Mr. Henley's shop-door, and just before I got to the shopdoor, one of them took a piece of check from the door; I went in, and gave an alarm; one of them ran into a court that went into Bunhill-row; I cannot say which of them had the tick.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. That is the lad that Mr. Henley brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that that is one of the two lads that were standing at the door? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q.Had you ever seen either of these lads before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All this was done in a very short time? - A. Yes, it was all done in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you could not swear he was one of the boys? - A. No; I have said I could not swear he was the person that took the check; I said, I was sure he was one of the two lads that were standing about the door.</p>

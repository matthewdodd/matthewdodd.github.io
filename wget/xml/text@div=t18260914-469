            . I am a printer. I was at the end of Salisbury-square - the procession was going by - I saw the prisoner and another man forcing the prosecutor towards the curb-stone; I saw the prisoner with a silver watch in his hand, but did not see him take it; the officer came up, and tried to grasp him and the other man - he pushed them towards the houses - the prisoner was secured on the spot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Might there not be a mistake as to who took it, in the crowd? A. I was so near, I am certain he had it.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I was on the opposite side, near Shoe-lane, and saw this old gentleman stagger off the curb - I crossed, and saw three men with their hands joined together; I suspected them, and spread out my arms - they went against the windows, and broke the glass, and the watch fell from one of them; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; the prosecutor claimed the watch which I picked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say it was in the prisoner's hand? A. No.</p>

            . I am a printer, and was walking in the procession. I saw the prosecutor stagger - I saw the officer run over, and fall through the window with the prisoner - I think the prisoner dropped the watch, but I am near sighted, and cannot swear to him - it dropped near his feet; I told the Alderman I saw him drop it, but on consideration, I cannot be positive - four persons were between us; I think he was the man.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

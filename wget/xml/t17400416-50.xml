            , (13 Years of Age, the 21st of July next,) after having been asked some Questions about the Nature of an Oath, was admonish'd to speak nothing but what was Truth. The substance of the Account she gave was, that about Midsummer last she went to live with a Gentlewoman who then lodged in the House of Mr Henry in Mumford's-Court in Milk-Street. That one Morning her Mistress being gone to Market, and no one being left in the House but her, and the Prisoner, who was a Servant to Mr Henry; He came up Stairs, and would have tempted her to have gone down Stairs into the cellar with him, but she refusing, he took hold of her, and forcibly carried her thither, tho' she scratched his Face, and clung to the Bannisters of the Stairs. That when he had got her into the cellar he laid her down on the Ground; and held her down by keeping one of his Hands on her Forehead. [The Witness proceeded in her Account of the Prisoner's abusing her, and of his Behaviour to her, but our Regard to Decency obliges us to veil it.] She said, she cried out, Murder! but he kept her down, and almost stifled her. That after this, she was very ill, and could hardly walk; but was fearful to discover the Injury the Prisoner had done her left her Father and Mother should be at her. She was asked a Question, which in such unhappy cases the Law makes necessary, and she answered in the Negative. She farther deposed, that her Mother at last discovered her Illness, by her Linnen, and that upon her being examined by her Father, she told what the Prisoner had done,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174004160044"></xptr>and that no one else but he had abused her: after which she was carried to the Hospital, where she continued three Weeks, in Order to be cured of the Foul Disease.</p>
               <p>Rochael Moreton, the Child's Mother, deposed, that she had observed her for some Time to walk comically, but she thought her Shoes might hurt her Feet. At last she [being frighted by the Appearance of her Linnen] got her Husband to examine her; and she then gave the same Account of the Cause of her Disorder, as she had now done. She added, that about a Fortnight before this Injury was found out, her youngest Child having been taken ill in the same Manner, she got Mr Markland, a Surgeon, to examine them both, and found they had got the Foul Disease upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr Markland depos'd that he examin'd the Children, and found the first Witness miserably clapp'd. His Answers to some Questions did not amount to a Proof of the Fact, as charged in the Indictment; but it was his Opinion, that a venereal Taint might be communicated by meer Contact, &amp;c. which would produce the Disorder the Witness laboured under, without infecting the Blood.</p>

            , the Prisoner's Master, depos'd, that the cellar where the Child pretended the Fact was done, was an open cellar, with a Window next the Court; that the Prisoner had behaved well with him, and that no Maid who had lived with him, had complained of his Behaviour. It was his Opinion, that the Prisoner had not been disordered, as to his Health; and that if the Girl had cry'd out, she must have been heard, because the Court was a publick Thorough-fare.</p>

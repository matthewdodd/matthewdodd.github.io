On the 17th of July, about two o'clock, I was at dinner in my parlour which commands a view of the shop - I heard a noise of feet in the shop - I looked out and ran to the door and saw Levyson with the prisoner in custody-the gingham laid on the prisoner's feet, part of it was on his legs as if he had dropped it - I had seen this gingham safe on a pile of goods which stood in my shop, about four or five yards from the door, a few minutes before. I picked it up; it is worth 2l.6s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had left nobody in the shop-my parlour has a glass by which I can see into the shop - I did not see anybody; there were other persons in the parlour, they could not see into the shop. I sat opposite the glass.</p>

               <p>MONTAGUE LEVYSON. I live opposite to Mr. Pearson. On the 17th of July,about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of his shop with the gingham under his arm, trying to conceal it under his apron; I crossed over and secured him at the next door, several persons called out,"Stop Thief!" he immediately dropped the parcel; Mr. Pearson came out and took the gingham up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see him in the shop.</p>

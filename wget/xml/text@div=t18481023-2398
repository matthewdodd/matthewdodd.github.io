                  </hi>. In consequence of a letter that was found I went to No. 1, North Audley-street, and found the three prisoners—I asked them if they had any articles, describing them—they denied having anything of the kind—I asked the younger Mary if she had a brown velvet bonnet—she denied it—I asked her to show me the contents of the drawers in her bed-room—she said her mistress had locked them, and was in Germany—she was in charge of the house; not the mother—on the Tuesday evening a key was given me by Mrs. Barrows, and on the Wednesday I went and opened a cupboard in which these things were found—they are mine—I have pieces to match this alpaca and velvet—the key opened a dressing-room door, which Mary told me her mistress had locked—I got that key from Bentley, who was in possession of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barrows, of Oak Farm, Shepherd's Bush. The elder prisoner and her son came to me on a Tuesday, about dinner-time—she asked me to take care of her keys till her daughter Mary was liberated, which she thought would be the next week—I said she had better take them herself, as they might give me some trouble—she said, "I know nothing about them, they are my daughter's keys"—I pressed</p>

On the Monday evening, I saw William at the smoke-jack in the kitchen, trying to get a key out of it—I asked him what key it was—he said it belonged to a cupboard he had got things, in which he wished to make away with—I said I thought he could not get it out—his mother, who was present, said it was of no consequence—they left the house together—next day I bent a wire, got it out, and gave it to Mr. Swain—I was put in possession of the house after the prisoners were turned out.</p>

               <p>I had these shoe-buckles of the prisoner at the bar, he came to me to pledge them for four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor at the time I had this plate to clean, and I put these spoons and these buckles in my pocket, I came up with the other things, and put them out of my hand, I took up the shoes to carry them into another room, and a friend came by and called me out, I went to a publick house, and then I went to another, and spent all my money, I was very much in liquor, and when the reckoning came to be paid, I had no money, I asked him if he had any, he said, no, I told him I had a pair of my master's buckles in my pocket, and he bid me go and pawn them, and I went and pawned them, I intended to have brought them again; my friends do not know that my trial came on to day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is very true that he was very much in liquor before, he might have taken two hundred pounds worth of plate, I had no suspicion of his taking any thing of this sort; as to his story of his bringing them back again, it may be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think from his behaviour that he did not mean to steal them? - I do my Lord, he was very drunk, I do not think he was sensible.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Would you be kind enough to take him into your service again, if he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very proper question, he seems to be very sensible of having done wrong, it may save the young man from destruction.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I should not wish to take him again as he has done this.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you think he did not mean to steal them, and it was a mere act of drunkenness; it is a bad mind which constitutes the offence; and as you have behaved on this prosecution with the utmost lenity in the world, much to your honor, for the hands may be guilty, though the heart may be free, and have gone so far with respect to saving the bad from a punishment which you think he does not deserve, you would act mighty well to try to save him for the future; if you can employ him or recommend him to employment, do think of it Mr. Wilder on the recommendation of the Jury and myself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I will try him for a week or two, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a thing you will reflect on with pleasure.</p>

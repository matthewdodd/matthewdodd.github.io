                  </hi>. I am a printer. On the 6th of July I was on board a steam-boat returning to town—this occurred at Woolwich—there were a great many people on board, and a great pressure—the prisoner was close to me—I had a gold breast-pin in my shirt, set with pearls and hair inside—it was fastened in my shirt—it was an old pin, and had a worm round it that held it in tightly—I felt a twitch and missed it from my shirt—I turned and told the prisoner I did not wish to say that he had robbed me, but I believed he had my pin—I collared him at the time, but I left him for two or three minutes, while I went to the gangway to see for an officer—I could not find an officer, and when I returned, the prisoner offered to be</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Yardley-street, Wilmington-square. I was on board the steam-vessel—I saw the prisoner put his hand to the prosecutor's breast, he had his handkerchief in his hand at the same time—the prosecutor said, "I have lost my pin"—the prisoner said, "I hope you don't mean to say that I have it"—the prisoner then went, and put his hand down by the side-table, while the prosecutor went for an officer; and when he came back the prisoner said he was willing to be searched.</p>

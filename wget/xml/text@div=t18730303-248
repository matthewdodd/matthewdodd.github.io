                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 16th February last I saw the two prisoners in Petticoat Lane, about 10. 45—I watched them for about an hour—I saw Clove first put his hand in a gentleman's pocket, and after-wards Keen put his hand in, but did not get anything—I saw them after-wards both go up to a young man; Clove put his hand in his right-hand pocket, took his handkerchief out, wiped his face with it, and shoved it down the sleeve of his coat—I spoke to the gentleman, and told him, and he gave me the name of Duke, and said he worked for the East India Company—I went after the prisoners, and caught Clove—I told him I was a police officer, and should take him for stealing a handkerchief from a young man—he became very violent, and it took three of us to carry him to the station—I found the handkerchief in his sleeve—I saw Keen the next morning, opposite the Bishopsgate Street Station—I told him I should take him for being concerned with Clove, now in custody, for stealing a handkerchief from a, person in White Street—I took him to the station; the charge was read over to him, and he made no reply—I could not find the gentleman who lost his pocket-hankerchief; I made every possible inquiry, and could not find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Clove's Defence.</hi> I took my handkerchief out to wipe my nose, and the officer came and laid hold of me by the collar, and asked me what I had there. I said I had nothing belonging to him, and I gave the handkerchief to him. It belonged to me; it has been washed about eight times, and there was a small hole in it about the size of a sixpence. I am the owner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">recalled</hi>). The Inspector on duty asked me if there were any marks about the handkerchief; I held it out, and the prisoner was present when I showed him there was a hole—after the prisoner was com-mitted for trial, he said to me "if I had tore that handkerchief you would not have found an owner for it"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Keen's Defence.</hi> I went with Clove down Petticoat Lane. I saw him wipe his nose, and the officer laid hold of him. I had no idea what he was took for, and the next morning I went to the police-station with his break-fast, and the policeman said he should take me for being concerned with Clove.</p>

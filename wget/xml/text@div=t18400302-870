                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at No. 52, Cable-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On the evening of the 7th of February, at half-past Four o'clock, the two Keatons, and a younger one who is discharged, came to my shop, and asked for a halfpenny-worth of treacle—I gave the cup to a boy to get it, and give it to them—I had four or five customers in the shop at the time, and when the two Keatons were gone I missed a parcel of sugar, that I had done up on the counter—a witness came and said something, and my boy went and brought them back—I said I would give them in charge—the prisoner Ann cried, and said, if the officer would go with her, she would show him an apple-woman, to whom she gave it—the officer went and got it, and took them all to the station-house—I went and saw it, in the same paper that I had done it up in—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">examining it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Cable-street. I remember these two Keatons going out of the shop—the prisoner Charles was stand<lb></lb>ing on the threshold of the door—the girl was inside—the younger one, who is not in custody, came out, and I saw something in its pinafore, and they went off with it—about ten doors down, Charles Keaton took it out of the child's lap, and went up Church-lane—I went and gave information to the prosecutor.</p>

I received information, and took the Keatons in the prosecutor's shop—I went with them up Back-church-lane, and there saw Fitzgerald—I asked her where the sugar was—she asked, "What sugar?"—Charles Keaton said, "Give up the sugar you gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for"—she stooped down under her stall, took it out of a sack, and said she thought there was no harm in buying it—there was nothing in the sack besides this—there is 2 1/2 lbs. weight of sugar, at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> I sell fruit in the street. On Friday evening the boy came, and asked me whether I would buy a pound and a half of sugar. I asked where he got it, he said he picked it up in the street. I asked where he lived, he said, in White Lion-street. He asked me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the sugar, which I gave him; I did not know of its being stolen.</p>

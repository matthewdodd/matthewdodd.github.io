                  </hi>. I am a cigar maker—On 29th July last about 11 o'clock at night I was near the Beehive public-house, North-street, near the Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, St. George's-in-the-East—Charles Shrewsbury was with me—we afterwards returned to the Beehive, but did not go in—we had been at the Red Lion—when we got back to the Beehive, I spoke to ft female who was with the two female prisoners—I touched her and said, "How are you, Polly?"—upon that the male prisoner came up to me, and two others followed directly after—being hard of hearing I could not hear what he said, but he muttered something—the two female prisoners were close to me when he came up; they may have been two or three yards away—I turned round and he muttered something—both the female prisoners directly said "The b—a want the knives put into them; put your b—knives into them"—they were speaking to the male prisoner—I was turning round telling the other witnesses to go away quietly; when I was caught hold of by the back of the head and thrown right off the kerb—I could not say who did that—I was thrown down, and the prisoner atop of me; there were two or three standing round at the time—I was pulled down, and when I fell down I saw the prisoner on me, and then I was stabbed—I saw the male prisoner do it—it appeared to be with a knife or dagger—the first stab he made at me with the dagger went through my coat—I was on the flat of my back and I had a good view of him; he thrust it right through my chest—there was no one else near then—when it went through my coat it did not wound me—there were two stabs made at me—I saw them both made, but I did not feel the knife go in until he had got off me, and I found then that my breath was short, that I could not breathe—no one else was near enough to me at that time to do anything—there were others there, two of them were apparently foreigners—I have not been able to use my hand since, from the effect of the wound—it was not hurt in any other way—there was a lamp burning close to where</p>

               <p>I then crossed over the road to go home—there were two girls opposite—West was with me, and his brother, and another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, Charles Austin—we met two females—Jane Booty was one of them, the other was another one that was with them—West spoke to Polly—there were only the two girls there then—he said, "How are you, Polly?"—I could not exactly say what answer she made, for I was standing on the kerb, and <hi rend="italic">up</hi> came the foreigner—the woman that he spoke to was not in company with any man at that moment—the foreigner came running up round the corner when she was spoken to—that man is not here; he is gone to sea, I believe—he said to West, "What are you doing with my girl?"—West said, "I don't want your girl, I am doing nothing with her," and that caused the disturbance—then West's brother ran up, and he and the foreigner had a fight—then up ran a lot more; the male prisoner was one amongst them—there was a general fight, four of them and four of us, or it might have been five—while the fight was going on both the female prisoners said, "Use your b—y knives"—they were all together—they did not speak to me; they were speaking to the foreigners, of whom Nicholls was one—Nicholls and West were on the ground then, I saw them fall—at that time I was not engaged in the conflict, I was standing looking on—I saw those two men down and then I heard West say he was stabbed—there was only Nicholls and West together then—I ran up to them to give assistance, and I was stabbed by the man that has gone to sea, Emanuel I think his name is—there was no one near West but Nicholls at the time he called out that he was stabbed—they were on the ground together—there were two gas-lights—I think the public-houses were just closing—there are two gas-lights almost on the spot—I was stabbed on the left side, through the jacket—it was a serious wound—I was in the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper at 8, Back-church-lane—On Sunday night, 29th July, I was at the Beehive about 11 o'clock—I heard a noise, and went out—when I got out I heard Charles Shrewsbury sing out that he was stabbed—I went over to him, and laid hold of him, and pulled this dagger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his side—there were a lot of people there—directly I set him down I ran away to get a cab—immediately after I took hold of him I saw the backs of one or two running away—they appeared to be foreigners—I gave the dagger to the policeman at the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on Sunday, 29th July, West and Shrewsbury were brought there, about half-past 11 o'clock—West was wounded in the chest—it was about an inch long, aud it appeared to penetrate to the sternum, but by passing my finger, it passed obliquely into the muscle, severing the cartilage at the fifth, or sixth rib—that wound was very dangerous indeed to life—I could not ascertain whether the lungs were wouuded, but I have no doubt they were—with caution he is out of danger—I saw only one stab on West—this knife is just the very thing I should think that would inflict such a wound.</p>

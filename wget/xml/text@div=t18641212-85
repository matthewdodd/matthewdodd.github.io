                  </hi>. I am shopman in the service of Mr. Charles Hibberd, of Ludgate-hill—Latham was a printer in his service, and had permission to occupy a room at the top of the house—Neville was an errand boy in the same service—two or three months ago a patent-lock was put on the shop door—it was my duty to lock up the premises, and take the key—on 22d November, just previous to closing, about five or ten minutes to 8, I noticed Neville take a box up stairs—there seemed to be something in it and that made me suspicious—I believe Latham followed the boy up—the shop was closed about twenty minutes after 8—I left the pre<lb></lb>mises in company with Neville, and parted with him at Farringdon-street—he had nothing with him then—from seven to ten minutes afterwards, I re<lb></lb>turned to Ludgate-hill, and saw Neville come out of the premises with a</p>

               <p>parcel on his shoulder—Latham came out directly afterwards—the boy Neville crossed over to the right-hand side, and Latham walked on the same side as the shop—I followed Neville about 150 yards, and then asked him what he had in the parcel—he said it belonged to the printer—I asked him what it contained—he said he did not know; he was going to meet the printer with it—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said he did not know, but I could call the printer across, and speak to him, as he was on the opposite of the road—I said I bad no wish to do that; if it was the printer's property, I had no wish to interfere with it—after that I saw Latham cross the road, and touch Neville on the shoulder—they spoke to each other—Neville went down Creed-lane with the parcel—Latham stood at the corner of Creed-lane with his hands in his pockets—I said to him as I passed, "Good night, printer," and he said, "Oh, good night!"—he then crossed over, and went down Ave Maria-lane—I went down Creed-lane after the boy, and asked him again what he had got in the parcel—he said he did not know; it belonged to the printer, and the printer had promised to meet him—I said, "That will not do for me; I must see what is in it"—I tore the side of the parcel, and saw it was paper—I told him to bring it back again to the shop; not being able to get into the shop, on account of the printer having the key of the outside door, I left the paper opposite—I communicated with Mr. Hibberd that night—I let the boy go then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer and printer at 41, Ludgate-hill—neither of the prisoners had any authority to carry off any paper from my premises without permission—I had a communication from the last witness on the evening of 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and on the following morning I saw the prisoners—I also saw this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is about 35 lbs. weight of paper; it is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and is my property—I asked Latham what explanation he had to make in reference to this matter—he said, "I must plead guilty to it. I am very sorry I have done it, and I hope you will have mercy upon me for the sake of my wife and children"—I afterwards called in a policeman, and then asked him where he took the paper from—he said, "I will show you," and he led me and the policeman back to the warehouse, pointed out a shelf, and said, "I have taken a lot of remnants from there"—I gave him into custody, went to the police-station, and found Neville in custody—I had a very good character with Neville when he came into my employ.</p>

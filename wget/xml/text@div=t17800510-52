On Monday the 24th of April the prisoner came into our house; she went through the tap-room into a back-room; she sat down in the first box and called for a pint of beer; she seemed a decent sort of woman. I thought she might be waiting for a waggoner; there were a number of parcels which we received for waggoners in that box; they were removed by my order; my coat and waistcoat were in the same box; soon after I went to a barber's shop in the yard. A gentleman came into the shop to me and said that woman (meaning the prisoner) will bilk you of your reckoning I fancy, for she seems to be moving off. I came in directly and she was then sitting down in the box, and seemed to have something in her apron. I desired her to get up that I might look for my coat and waistcoat; she got up; my daughter said, I have put your coat in the bar, but I could not find your waistcoat; I had not pulled it off above a quarter of an hour. I said what have you got in your apron? She said nothing that belongs to you. I pulled her apron down and saw my waistcoat folded up in her apron; I took her to the counter.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did she appear to be in liquor? - No; but when I charged her with it she seemed to be confused.</p>

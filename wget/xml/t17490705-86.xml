            . I live at Hoxton; I had been to receive some money at the other end of the town, but it was too late when I set out for home to bring my money with me, so I left it behind me. I set out from Charing-cross about twelve o'clock at night. I made the best of my way home, and coming down <placeName id="t17490705-86-crimeloc401">Fleet-street</placeName>

I went down the New-market, they follow'd me, and seem'd to be going up ow-hill, so I went Chick-lane way, and stopping to make water at the upper end of the lane I observed a lusty man among them, and the rest were boys: this man came and struck me a blow on the side of my head with his fist, then they all fell upon me: the biggest of these prisoners struck me across the face with a stick, and would have pull'd off my hat and wig; finding them going, I got fast hold of my wig: I told them I had no money and turn'd about and saw my hat in the biggest of the prisoner's hand: the lusty man and the women run down the alley, and these two prisoners run towards Smithfield, and I followed them. I cry'd out, stoy thief! and run after them, and at the corner of Cow-lane the biggest was stop'd by a watchman, and another watchman took the other in Hosier-lane. The two prisoners were brought to me, and I said to the constable I knew them both; he saw what a sad condition they had made me in; they were sent to the Counter directly.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Hosier-lane, between the hours of one and two the 14th of last month, I heard the cry; stop thief, and heard somebody running up the lane; I put my lanthorn on the ground, and said, if he did not stop I'd knock him down; he said he liv'd on the other side of the water; then I took him back to where I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174907050023"></xptr> the noise, and found the prosecutor in a sad condition: said I, do you know any thing of this lad, I found him running? yes, said he, that is one of those who robbed me, and desir'd I'd not let him go.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. Coming down the New-market, said the prosecutor to the young woman, will you drink any thing? where are you going? saying, you shall go along with me: she run into an entry, and he after her; she run down the alley: said he to a young man follow her and fetch her out; he took him by the collar and they both fell a fighting, and I stood on the other side of the way.</p>

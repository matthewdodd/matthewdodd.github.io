We went up to Marybone; we were fetched away from Marybone at half past five by Bray, who informed me that my house was robbed; it had been robbed of the things in the indictment, they were in a drawer, part of a chest of drawers which was in the one pair of stairs front room; they had been locked, and had been opened by a chissel, or something of that kind; the room door had been locked, that was opened too; I did not find that it had been opened by violence. When I came home, I saw Mr. Johnson; the moment I saw him, I was so aggravated, that I said something to Mr. Johnson, I very much offendad him; somebody had told me something. I said Mr. Johnson, how could you be so bad a man, as to let the poor young fellow go up again; then he said that he came down empty, and his coming down empty was to no purpose to me, and he said when he came down with a load, I soon took him. I said no more to Johnson. The young man was taken to the office, and committed, and tried here; this property was afterwards produced by Johnson, as taken from Baxter.</p>

I fastened the first floor door, and pulled the street door to; it had a spring bolt, and I put the key in my pocket.

             the prisoner; I saw him in the course of that day, it was the afternoon of the 31st of July, 1814; I saw him in Gray's-inn-lane, opposite to the house that was being robbed. I have known him this twenty years. I did not know him to be an officer of the City at that time. As I was passing along, he called to me, I was walking on Snowsill's side, and he called to me before I observed him; he said Tom, stop here, they are cracking a crib on the opposite side; I did not at that time understand what that was, but I now understand it to be breaking a house open. I asked him his meaning; he said the curtain is down, pointing to the curtain of the house; go and take your station at the end of the lane, and if I give you a signal, you come up to me; he did not add anything more. I went down, and stood at the end of the lane, that gave me a command of that side of the lane where he was standing; I could see Snowsill's door, and Johnson who stood opposite to it. In a few minutes, about five or six, a man came out of Snowsill's house; he crossed over towards Johnson, and spoke to him; they conversed together and walked down Gray's-inn-lane; they were the space of five or six minutes talking at the end of Charlotte Buildings; then they parted, and the man went back again into Mr. Snowsill's house, and Johnson took his station as before; I still remained in my station for seven or eight minutes after that. After he had gone in the second time, I saw the man come out of the house, I did not observe any difference in his appearance as to bulk; I was not near enough for that, and I had no idea that he was the person whom Johnson was watching. Johnson made me a signal, a beckon, and then I got up to them both, close to a public-house, called the

We went in, and Johnson asked him what he would have to drink, and he said a pint of porter; Johnson said, sit down, sit down; the man sit down and Johnson put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and said, now I am an officer, and if you make any resistance, I will blow your brains out; he took the handcuffs out of his pocket, when he put his hand in, and handcuffed the man. He then proceeded to search him. He asked me to go to Snowsill's, to see that nobody went in, I did so. I was absent about seven or eight minutes; then Johnson came and beckoned me back again; I went back and helped Johnson to count out the money that was taken from the man, and it amounted to sixteen pounds, sixteen shillings in silver, and some trifle in gold; I took an invertory of the silver myself, in Johnson's pocket-book; there was a bill of exchange and a promisory note. Johnson asked me to sit down by the prisoner while he went over to inform them that they were robbed; he went out accordingly to do so; he was gone for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then returned with a man of the name of Bray; it turned out to be another officer, as I understood since. Both Johnson and Bray took the man to Eagle-street watchhouse. I since know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180046"></xptr>that it was William Baxter who was then taken into custody, and to him all my evidence relates when I have been speaking of this man. I was not present when he was tried. Johnson, Bray and I went over to Mr. Snowsill's and he had not come from chapel. When he had come home Johnson told him the house had been broken open, and it was agreed that Bray should go to the other end of the town to fetch Mrs. Snowsill.</p>

               <p>RICHARD HATTON. I am a watchhouse-keeper in St. Andrew's parish, and was so in July, 1814; that watchhouse is in Eagle-street. I remember on Sunday, the 31st of July, 1814, the prisoner Johnson and another man brought Baxter to the watchhouse, near about three o'clock in the afternoon; Johnson desired me to take care of the prisoner he brought. I asked him for what? he told me for house-breaking in our parish. I asked him where? and he told me at the patten-maker's, in Gray's-inn-lane. I asked him if he had known any thing of the prisoner? he told me when I put him back in the lock-up room, that he would tell me all about it. Accordingly he went with me and this other man that was with him to see the prisoner locked up. That being done, he came back to the watchhouse alongwith me. I asked him what officers they were? and he said, they belonged to the City Police. I asked him if he knew any thing of the prisoner before? his answer was that he was introduced to him as a cracksman, and he had been with him all that morning. He himself had been introduced, and he, Baxter, did not know but he, Johnson, was one of the same sort. That he was in some where about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and Baxter was coming out at the door to come for the street again, and Johnson said he saw he had got nothing about him then. Johnson asked Baxter if all was right? and he said, no. Johnson said, damme, go back again, and do it, for all is right here. He went back again, and was in about ten minutes; Baxter then came out again; Johnson said he saw all was right then by the bulk of his pocket. He asked him if he would have any thing to drink; and he said yes, and he took him over the way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I live at No. 10, Russel-place, Little Coram-street. I am the father of the young man who was convicted of a robbery in Gray's-inn-lane. When my son was apprehended. I went to see him; I went on the morning following, between five and six o'clock; on my going to the watchhouse, I saw the present prisoner Johnson soon after; he asked me my name; I told him. To that he said, are you the father of the prisoner, and I said, I was. I told him I could see very plainly that it was a planned thing to trap him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson say to that - A. He said if he were to give a pistol into his hand to shoot another, is that enough that he should do the action. I asked him what office he meant to take him to, and he said to Marlborough-street. I said the proper office was Hatton Garden. I said he had no right to take him there; he said he should take him to no place but Marlborough-street. Johnson was then securing my son, and band-cuffing him; my son said Johnson, what you are now doing to me, will be done to you very soon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the Friday before the Sunday, two years ago last July, a man of the name of Golding, who is in the Calendar, came to me at the Mansion House, and gave me information. Accordingly I went to see this man of the name of Golding. According to appointment, I met him at the top of Brooks-street, Holborn, and went into a public-house, and had a pint of half and half. Then it was about the time that I was to be at the top of Gray's-inn-lane; but when the man that is convicted,(Golding) was paying for the half and half we met with this Baxter, and then Golding spoke to him, and I supposed by the description that he was the man who was to commit the burglary; they said, they would go back, and have half a quartern of gin; whilst the two were drinking, Baxter then pulled out a key, signifying that all was right; according to my information it then was done, and my plan was totally defeated; and on coming to the door, Baxter saw what he had done, and what he was going to do. Under these circumstances, being in company with him, I found I could not being him to a Public Court of Justice, and I found it was then two late, and he was then to meet Golding again in the afternoon; but I was not to be there, because the person suspected I was not one; little did he think I was an officer. In the afternoon, they met again in Gray's-inn-lane, and Baxter touched me on the shoulder; he said, Golding was drunk. I did not know what to do; when I met with a man of the name of Bray; I acquainted him with it, and the young man Bingley; I never knew a more false evidence; he stated, that I kept him. He saw every transaction; so did Bray. But the young man says, he saw the young man let down the curtain, and that is a total falsehood.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, here interrupted the prisoner, to correct this misunderstanding of h1s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, in Continuance. - He came out, and was not in one minute; I was then momentarily going to take him, and he said, d-n my eyes, my hand itches for it, here goes, and he went in, and I do not know what he did. But when he came out the second time, I acquainted Bray with it. I was then going to take him into custody; on account of his being such a notorious character, and his having committed such a number of robberies. I let him go in again, and he had said, the first officer that offered to take him, he would put a knife into his liver, and no doubt if I am found guilty I shall suffer. Moreover after that, I took him to the watchhouse, and took him in company with Bray; Bray was present, and that young man. Bingley has sworn entirely false, Directly as I got him into the house, and as he began to count the money. I took Baxter off to the watchhouse. There was a man at the watchhouse, and he said, that the watchhouse-keeper was up stairs a-bed, and he called him down, and when he came, I told him I had a man for burglary; I told him where it was. I left him there, and that is all I spoke to him, so help me God. At<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180047"></xptr>the time that man, Hatton, was an evidence on the trial of Baxter, he was going to be indicted for perjury, and he was ordered out of Court by the counsel; there was not a word mentioned of what has been said to day; it is made up altogether; if it was not made up, why did they not come forward to save the young man's life on the trial, and why did not Mrs. Snowsill state what she said to day as she should do. I am here to be tried for my life, and I must leave it totally to your Lordship and the Jury. It is hard that all these things should be brought up against me now, and I hope God will save her soul, if he don't save mine. As for the father he is as bad as Baxter was; he was turned away from Messrs. Cannon and Cole's, in Thames-street, for a robbery.</p>
               <p>-BRAY. I was a City officer; I am not so now. I went to fetch the mother and daughter; I did fetch them. Johnson did not say any thing to them to my knowledge about his sending the young man into the house the second time. If he had said it in the coach coming, I should have heard it. I only came home with Mrs. and Miss Snowsill in a hackney coach, and there I left them. Whether Johnson was with them or not, I don't know. I went into the one pair of stairs, and I believe Mrs. Snowsill sent something up there to drink. Neither in the coach nor in the house, did I hear Johnson say any thing to her about sending the man in a second time. She was looking over the things in the house, and I naturally looked with her to see if they were safe. I was at the watchhouse; I did not hear Johnson say that he had been with Baxter, Mr. Hatton when he came down opened a door, and went in with Johnson. I staid outside, and Johnson gave his own charge. I had not the least to do with the charge. The only communication I heard was that Mr. Hatton asked me to go backwards to assist in locking the prisoner up, and Johnson said, let him have some beer and bread and cheese to the amount of two or three shillings, That was going up to the lock up place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I do not mean it to be understood that no other conversation could have taken place. There might be a great deal that I did not hear, because I did not go into the little place. I naturally staid out because I had nothing to do with the charge. I was here on the trial of Baxter; I can't recollect whether I was or was not examined; it is two years ago; I don't think I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined after Mr. Hatton was examined, as to the fact of whether Johnson said to him what he had said, he did say on his examination - A. I heard after the trial was over.</p>
               <p>Q. But before the Judge summed up, were you or were you not examined as to the fact of the conversation I have spoken of - A. That question was put to me by Mr. Adolphus whether those things were said by Johnson in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been examined, and told your whole story - A. I never was examined at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined as a witness to confirm the testimony of Johnson - A.Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the question was put to you by these things, now what things - A. It was about some things that Johnson was named to have said at the watchhouse. I say now that certainly much might pass which I did not her. On the Sunday in question I might be in company with Johnson three or four hours; it might be about twenty minutes before three when I first came into his company; we did not then keep together. Johnson desired me to go into a public-house, and wait there until he beckoned to me; that was a little before three; I was not in company with him alone. That was a little before three, he met with Lee, the street-keeper of Holborn; we were going to the park-fair. The public-house commanded a view of Mr. Snowsill's house. I saw the man that Johnson shewed me, go in; he shewed me him through the window; that man at that time was on the opposite side of the way. He came out, and Johnson ran out of the wine-vaults, and ran down Gray's-inn-lane, and he was gone for about five minutes, and just as he got in, he shewed me a bit of a a sign that the man was coming up; he said, that is the thief, and he went on, and was in about ten minutes. Johnson was in and out with me four or five times. The man was in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and when he came out Johnson directly caught hold of him, and he waved his finger for me to get up; I had not lost sight of him at all until he had laid hold of the man; I ran very quickly. Johnson did not say any thing to me. We went into the public-house with the man. I recollect being examined on the 21st of July, 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say had passed between Johnson and the prisoner Baxter on his apprehending him - A.I can hardly answer that question; it is such a question as I am sure I do not understand.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether Johnson said any thing to you as to what passed in his attempt to secure the prisoner Baxter - A. I could not answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand it - A. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will make you. Did Mr. Johnson tell you that any thing had passed between him and the prisoner Baxter when he attempted to secure him?</p>
               <p>Q.When you came up to Baxter, did Johnson tell you of any thing that had happened in taking him into custody, any thing that he had done to Baxter - A. I don't recollect any thing that he did to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not my question; this is what I want to come at; have you not represented that Johnson said he had a struggle with Baxter, and was obliged to knock him down - A. The question I said was, that Johnson said that Baxter was a resolute fellow, and that he was obligated to knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnson tell you so - A. I believe he did. I stated it to Mr. Nares there might have been a strong tustle in the passage; Johnson told me so in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you sir, one question, and then I have done with you; what share of the reward did you receive for the conviction of Baxter-A. The Recorder gave me ten pounds; I have received it, and part of my ten pounds was given to Johnson to pay for the counsel and lawyer, for carrying on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180048"></xptr>prosecution. After all the expences were paid, I believe I had no more than four or five shillings in my pocket.</p>

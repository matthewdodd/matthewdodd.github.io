I was knocked down in the mud, and said, "Oh Lord! spare my life, and take my money;" I can swear to Wheeler - he is the person who kept his hands over my eyes and mouth, while the others robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the others doing while he held his hands over your eyes and mouth? A. I was robbed of 12s.; I felt my money taken out of my left-hand pocket - I cannot say who did it, but I am certain of Wheeler: I got up, and a private watchman came and asked me what was the matter; I said I had been knocked down and robbed by three persons - he said, "Which way are they gone?" he ran, and I cried Stop thief! as loud as I could: in five minutes I saw Wheeler in custody - he was taken to the watch-house and detained; as soon as I saw him, I knew him to be the man who had his hands over my eyes and mouth - I am quite sure he is the person; I saw the other two prisoners in custody on the afternoon of the next day - I cannot speak to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. It was dark? A. Yes; I was not far from a gas lamp - about twenty yards;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250010"></xptr>it is neither a field nor a street - it is a new road forming: I had been to Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes, comfortable; I do not exactly know what I had drank; I do not have a regular dinner - I eat some of my stock - I cannot say how many public-houses I went into, or how many I drank at.</p>
               <p>Q. After Wheeler was taken, did you not say there was another man whom you should know? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you call at different public-houses to sell your goods? A. No, I sell them at shops</p>

            . I am an excavator, and live at No. 1, Conduit-place, Bayswater. I was going home about half-past eleven o'clock on this night, and at the top of Prague-street is a new street, called London-street - I heard a running; I suspected something, and stepped behind a stack of bricks, and in a minute or two I heard a cry of Stop thief! and Murder! the three prisoners instantly came along by me; I rushed out, and made a catch at Haines with my right hand; he slipped by me, to the right; Wheeler stopped, as if to hit me - I said, "What, will you hit me?" he said he was not going to hit me: up came a watchman, and I gave him to him - they were all three running in a direction from where I heard the sound of running and the cry of Stop thief! and Murder! they were together - I should think a good large handkerchief would cover the three; they were as close together as they could be to run: I have seen them before, in the neighbourhood, and have seen two of them in company; I am certain of them all three; Haines and Barlow were running with Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always been as certain? A. Yes - I was close under a gas lamp. I attended before the Magistrate; I said when Harrison came up that his face was all over blood and mud; they call him Brandyball Dick - he is known about there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. - In consequence of information I apprehended Barlow and Haines in Richmond-street, in Mary-le-bone parish: they were in a front parlour, in company with a person who keeps the house, and her daughter. I said I had a charge of robbery against them - they asked what for - I said for robbing Dick, the pieman; they made no answer, but said they would go with me.</p>

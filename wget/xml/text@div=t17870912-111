               <p>Tell us the whole that passed? - When he came to the office, he came for administration to the deceased's effects; the instructions were taken by my clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is not the jurata in writing at the time he swore? - No, it is a verbal oath, administered by the Surrogate, and not reduced into writing; it is a regular form of oath.</p>
               <p>Is there no instrument reduced into writing, and signed by the party swearing? - No.</p>
               <p>When he came, was Reilly with him? - Yes; the instructions were taken, he was afterwards sworn, and after he was sworn, I sent my clerk, in order for Mac-Daniel and one Rickhus to enter into the usual bond at the Prerogative-office; the instructions were not taken by me, but by Mr. Mellor; that instrument was drawn from those instructions; I afterwards saw him take the oath, my attestation is to the warrant; when Reilly came to the office, he said he came from Mr. Davis, and that Mr. Davis would be there presently; Davis came into the office, I think it was while I was drawing the jurata; I know it was before the party was sworn, because I know when I returned from getting the party sworn, he was gone.</p>
               <p>When Davis came, what did he say? - I see you are about the business that the parties have come to me as that morning.</p>
               <p>Repeat what he said? - As near as I can recollect he said, I see you are about the business that the parties had just come from him about.</p>

               <p>However, after you were heard, Davis was discharged? - Yes; Mr. Garrow was present.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - On the 13th of June; the 12th M'Daniel was examined, the next day Davis was examined, and Reilly was re-examined the same day; Reilly was committed, Davis was discharged, and Rickhus was bound over to give evidence against M'Daniel that day, and was bound over to give evidence against Reilly the next day.</p>

            ? - On Friday the 8th of June, I think it was; Mr. Davis brought me three names, I cannot recollect them; he told me to search the caveat-book, and enter caveats against those which were not done; one of the names was

             I am positive.</p>
               <p>What further passed between you and Mr. Davis? - I went and searched, and found two of them done, but Lewis's was clear; it was then near six o'clock, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120175"></xptr>desired me to go back and enter a caveat, which was done; and he told me he would send the relations or the parties to-morrow.</p>
               <p>What was the purpose of the caveat? - That no business should be done without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did he come on the next day? - No, Sir; he did not, it was a holiday Monday; being a holiday, the Tuesday following, M'Daniel and Reilly came together, and Reilly brought a paper with the name of

             upon it.</p>
               <p>What is become of that paper? - I don't know; it was not of that sort, which I thought necessary to be preserved; Reilly said he came from Mr. Davis, and asked if he was not there on the Saturday; I said, yes; and he said I must get the business forward as fast as possible, in order that it might be compleated against Mr. Davis came; in about half an hour after, Mr. Davis came.</p>
               <p>Did any thing more pass between Reilly and you? - Not at that time, not till Davis came again.</p>
               <p>Then when Davis came, he asked if the parties had been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What parties? - Reilly and M'Daniel.</p>
               <p>Did he name them? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were they? - They were waiting over the way; I told him they had been there, and where they were then; he desired them to be sent for, and they came, and I took the instructions immediately.</p>
               <p>They were all in the office together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between them? - Not as I took notice of.</p>
               <p>Who gave the instructions? - We generally ask the administrator; but Reilly answered for him, and I told him to hold his tongue; he still kept on telling him, and said, it was, because the man did not know much of the nature of such business, and he was better acquainted with it, and that he had known him about five years; then I finished taking the instructions, and the warrant was drawn.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it Reilly or M'Danie that gave the instructions? - Both answered the questions; then M'Daniel was sworn, and I went with them to see them execute the bond at the Publick-office.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him sworn? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any memory of the questions you asked M'Daniel? - I asked him if he had any father or mother, and several other questions, which Reilly sometimes answered for him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him as to the situation in life, in which the intestate was? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him for any description of

               <p>Was your questions directed to M'Daniel? - Yes; and I told Reilly to hold his tongue two or three times, and let the man answer for himself; when I had prepared every thing, they went into the Office to execute the bond.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Reilly go in? - No, Sir, he waited at the Office, but as we came back from executing the bond, I met him in the passage.</p>

               <p>After the bond was taken you were coming away, and you were called back? - Yes, and he told me he was doing wrong, and that his name was not

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120176"></xptr>After you was called back to be a witness to this transaction, what did you do yourself? - The clerk was sent to inform the register, and the people were ordered to be taken into custody, and we went back to our Office; we met Reilly in the passage; we had got both M'Daniel and Rickhus into custody and Reilly seeing me speak to the clerk, ran off immediately; then I took them to the Office, and they staid there till the officer came and took them into custody; Davis was to come again in the afternoon, when I told him it should be ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time was this? - - About twelve or one.</p>
               <p>What time did you see Davis in the afternoon? - About four.</p>
               <p>You was present before Mr. Alderman Crosby, afterwards? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was you there when he first came in? - Yes, he came to me in a great hurry, and asked me if the business was ready, and I told him that there had been some dispute about it; but I did not tell him the real fact.</p>
               <p>Did you go to fetch Mr. Clarkson? - Yes; and he told me to detain him, and Davis said he was ready to go any where wherever we chose to take him.</p>
               <p>Who did you leave in the Office while you went to fetch Mr. Clarkson? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>When he came back, he expressed great readiness to go with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have a good deal of business to do with navy agents? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing in all that you have described Mr. Davis to have done, that is not done by the most respectable navy agents in this town? - They often come and desire business to be done.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarkson. What is the substance of the oath? - That the deceased died intestate.</p>
               <p>Did you know Davis? - I have seen him several times as a navy agent.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of M'Daniel? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Sweetenburg? - He is a clerk in the Prerogative-office.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what passed between M'Daniel and Sweetenburg, with respect to his having been there before? - Mr. Sweetenburg said, he knew his face, and said to him, I think you have been here before; he said no, and persisted in the business he was about; Mr. Sweetenburg said to him, do you know the consequence of what you are doing?</p>
               <p>This was before the bond was executed? - Yes; I don't know that he said he knew the consequence, but he persisted in the business.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by persisting? - He insisted he had never been there before, then he executed the bond, and did not say any thing further about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. You had seen Davis there before doing business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For himself? - He did it for other people.</p>
               <p>Did he act as agent for other people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is nothing so common, I believe, as doing business for other people? - Nothing.</p>

               <p>How long has he been acquainted with M'Daniel? - Between two and three years, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Court. Is he any relation of your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him call him by his name? - Yes; I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Why Mr. Reilly, you make a very different figure to what you did when I saw you before the Lord Mayor? - I was ill of a fever and ague; I have been in the Poultry Compter ever since; I knew no more of it than what I tell you now.</p>
               <p>These clothes were enough to cure you of an ague, compared to those you had; do you remember talking to any body after being examined before Mr. Crosby? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where did they pick you up? - The prisoner M'Daniel told them, that I could prove that his name was M'Daniel.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing before the Alderman, of having said, that you heard Reilly say his name was John M'Daniel? - I said that to the Alderman.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing to any body after you went out of the room, that you was sorry for what you had said, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120178"></xptr>you did not know that name; but he had been called by that Christian name in the cause? - No, Sir, I never said that I was sorry for what I had said; I have been a marine, and served on board the Resolution; I have been a porter to the water-side, on the keys.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that you did not? - I never said so; I never knew him go by the name of John M'Daniel.</p>

               <p>Who was M'Daniel? - The man that went by the name of Lewis; he said in the Commons, his name was M'Daniel, I never saw him before; he sat some time, and he asked for Reilly; he said he knew Reilly; Reilly came in, and said, he would have another pot of beer; he called for it; he sat a little time, and Davis came and tapped at the window, and called Reilly, and Reilly went out; he came in again, and asked us to go; we went to Mr. Clarkson's Office; there he wrote something, but what it was I cannot say; they asked M'Daniel something what his brother was, and he hesitated, and Reilly said, a marine; then Reilly said, we had better stop the business till Davis comes down.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about who was to be bondsman? - When Reilly went in, he said, I would be bondsman; I went home, and Reilly came after me; he asked me if I knew M'Daniel; I said, no; I came to oblige Reilly, who was a lodger in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Rickbus. You was taken before the Alderman at Guildhall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been in the Compter ever since? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you there on the second day as well as the first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at Mr. Davis, and tell us whether you saw him before the Alderman; did not you say you had never seen him before in the whole course of your life? - I did not say so; I am almost sure of Davis, but not quite positive.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord. My learned friend, Mr. Silvester,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120179"></xptr>in answer to an objection, has produced a pardon; I submit, that pardon by no means removes the disability under which that man stands from the conviction, nor affects it at all; it seems to me, that the effects of this pardon cannot operate; my friends have used it as a plea, in suspension of the execution of that judgment, which the man would be liable to without it; it seems to me that that circumstance, coupled with the terms of this pardon, is the strongest that can be, to shew that the man is not to be subject to the pains and penalties, under which he now labours; yet it is only taking from him any pains and penalties which were to be the consequence of that conviction; but the King's pardon to him, under that situation, certainly cannot operate to prejudice third persons; the pardon of the King goes only to prevent an infliction of punishment to the party who is convicted; I am not aware of any case, if the gentlemen are furnished with any, they will state them; but I argue before your Lordship, that if any question can be decided on principles of policy, of reason, and of expediency, this is one of the clearest; tho' the laws of competency and incompetency are certainly direct and positive, yet, when not specifically laid down, as in the case before us, or when we do not find judicial principles, they must be tried by the principles of reason: the witness is a man who has been charged with taking a false oath; which, in this particular case, amounts to a felony; therefore, he is a man at this instant convicted of perjury; in that very transaction, which he now comes to give evidence about; in that very transact on having once sworn that, which he now comes positively, and upon his oath to contradict; he is a man convicted of an offence; to free himself from the consequences of which, he is now set up as a witness; and tho' it states, that from some favourable circumstances, that pardon is granted; I am sure that I shall not be contradicted, when I say, that the very condition of his being pardoned, was, to give evidence in this cause: if the rules of competency, or incompetency, have any power at all; there can be no case so strong, in which a man is affected by those rules, as that case which now appears before your Lordship; because the man who is called as a witness, is to prove a fact, not only directly contrary to that which he has sworn, but directly contrary to that for the swearing of which he has been convicted of perjury; therefore he comes here to comply with the conditions of that pardon, by giving evidence, contrary to his former oath. My Lord, I do not mean to make a speech to the Jury; but I remember in the case of Mr. Underwood, when he was brought to the bar here, and when we took this objection, that he was come to contradict his own oath; in that case, you, who did not try the cause, but sat in Court, at the trial of the Goodridge's, you gave this as your opinion, tho' he may be entitled to no credit, tho' he comes now directly and deliberately, to swear that to be false, which he before swore to be true; yet, inasmuch as the law has not said, that a man, if he is not convicted, may not be a competent witness, and as he cannot be convicted, he must be received, tho' he has no credit here. My Lord, I think you will not expect us to shew, that that pardon ought not to operate to remove the disability; here I shew the man stands in such a situation, he not only cannot be believed, but he cannot be received; and I think I ought to call on my friends, to shew why this pardon is to remove this disability; why the King has any right by any instrument of his, to affect the lives of third persons; why, tho' he has a right to say, I do not chuse to execute this man, (because he has the prerogative of mercy) he has also a right to say, I will remove a disability which is to operate against the lives of all my other subjects, tho' a jury of the country have put him in such a situation, that he cannot be believed, tho' he cannot be heard in a Court of Justice; yet I have a right to say he shall affect third persons, and I will restore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120180"></xptr>him to the degree of ability, that shall affect third persons; I am yet entitled to that prerogative in the Crown, which can put men in peril of their lives, by the testimony and evidence of a witness, who has been legally convicted of a crime that must destroy all belief; for the man being put in such a situation, that is a situation of incompetency in a witness, and we cannot dispute the verdict which has been passed against him, he is entitled to no credit; in short, it is a fact found by a Jury, and cannot be removed; now, how is this man to be set in a situation to affect the lives of third persons; tho' certainly the King has a right not to execute the judgment of this man; he has the right of not doing it because he, has the right to do it; it is from that, that the right of pardon arises; because, he in whom the execution of a law is vested, certainly has it in his power to execute it or not; but it is not because he is supposed the Judge, who are, or are not more peculiarly the objects of the law; if we come to the terms of the pardon itself, there is not a syllable in it of removing a disability; it frees him from all punishment which may be executed by the Sheriffs or the Judges, not from any impeachment that may be thrown upon his credit, nor from any impeachment of his veracity; I say it stands simply thus; I will not execute the law upon you, and that the sentence may not operate as perpetual imprisonment, I will give you an instrument, declaring, that I do not mean to execute the law; perhaps it may be said, this would operate against all forfeitures; and that, because, the King has a right to relinquish all his own right, it does affect the rights of third persons: My Lord, the rights of every man in this country can only be guarded by the rules of evidence; and therefore, by breaking down those rules of evidence by any exercise of the prerogative, the rights of third persons are not to be affected, which cannot be affected by any prerogative of the crown; I shall leave it to Mr. Garrow, who will aid my remark with many of his own, and at the same time, call upon my friends to shew how it stands; they produce an instrument, in which, not a syllable is started, that removes that disability; I think I may defy them to produce any case in which it has removed that disability; he produces a pardon, in that very transaction, in that very case, in that very point, in which he now comes to give evidence; I will venture to say, tho' I do not know any cases, but I almost challenge them to produce me a parallel instance, in which a man convicted of felony involving a perjury, is to set up a pardon to operate on the conviction of a third person; I think there never will be an instance, in which the Court will hold that a man so pardoned, can be set up as a witness; now coming to say that which he swore was false, and setting up against it a pardon, which only goes to remove any inconvenience which can happen to himself; but not to be put in a situation to affect the rights of third persons.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, as you are called on to-day to adjudge a point, I think, of more importance to the whole public than any that has ever come before the Court, I shall make no apology for troubling your Lordship with a few words. I take it, that nothing can be so clear, in any way in which this subject is considered, as that this is by no means that which they contend; they contend this is a charter of restoration to all legal rights which he had before; I contend it is a charter of remission and pardon; and of remission and pardon only, not a charter of restoration. In considering it in that way, I shall endeavour to prove it, first, by looking at the deed itself, seeing what it bears on the face of it, what must have been the King's intention; the King cannot, by any charter which he can grant to the subject, do that which my friends contend he has done by the present pardon, the thing itself states a remission of that which the King had a right to inflict, and I think nothing can be so clear that the King has gone to the full extent of his authority: You know all offences are construed in the law to be against the State, they are all in breach of the public peace; and the laws which are made are against all offenders: but, as the sword of justice must be lodged in some hand, as the power of pardoning must be somewhere; so in this country it rests in the King, the punishment of death and its consequences he may remit: Therefore these are properly and technically called pardons; they are not restorations, they merely go this length, for his offence aforesaid he shall be acquitted, of all indictments and impeachments; from that offence, he shall be freed from all impeachment; impeachment of his credit does the King venture to say, impeachment of his credit or his competency? of his ability or disability to be a witness? Nothing like it; but pursuing that context, you will find what it means; it means prosecutions, legal prosecutions for any offence he has committed; but has the King said that this man shall be, to all the purposes of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120183"></xptr>society, the same as if he had never offended? Shall he be received into society as a man competent to give evidence? Mr. Shepherd says, the rules of competency proceed on the same ground as those of credit, for the protection of innocence: the King cannot break down, or infringe, or invade any one of the rules of evidence; he has no prerogative to say that innocence shall not be protected; he has no prerogative to say he will make an exception of any one of those, whom the wisdom of the law has said shall be incompetent: Look a little whether the reason of the thing would bear out that prerogative; is it consistent with the preservation of innocence that the King should have the power of restoring such persons to their competency? It may be said, why there is no harm done, it may conduce to purposes of justice to let a bad man give evidence: My Lord, Judges will be cautious; or, as you said in the case of Underwood, if we are called upon to hear him, I have no difficulty in stating, before he is heard, the Jury are to turn a deaf ear to what he says: I know you would say that in the present case; for all that was wanting in his case was that conviction; Underwood stood here as infamous as M'Daniel does; Underwood stood here as perjured; Underwood stood here everything but convicted of perjury; he stood here every thing but convicted of felony, but there was that, and that only difference between the witness of the day and

                  John

            , that Underwood had not been convicted, and this man has: I argue so to satisfy your Lordship that the King does not possess any prerogative inconsistent with the safety and innocence of his subjects; is it consistent with that to turn out this wild beast again on the public; to say that this man shall be received as a competent witness to charge other men with crimes? My Lord, when this prerogative was winked at, when this prerogative was established in the Crown, the King exercised it as he does all the other prerogatives, for the vindication of innocence which had been oppressed, for the setting those free that had been convicted, but not to involve the whole of his innocent subjects, at the peril of having such men as this M'Daniel to be witness. Mr. Shepherd has stated the situation of this man, supposing that there had been judgment, and I know it will be endeavoured to distinguish between the case, as it stands at present, where there has been no judgment, and where there has; how does this pardon come here? I say again, in remission of that crime and the punishment; this man may be laid hold of by any man who has got the conviction; if I had brought him in here yesterday to receive judgment of death, what should hinder your Lordship from pronouncing judgment: The King has discharged him from any personal consequences; consider this as if it has been in another stage of the business, I think it makes no difference, suppose there had been a judgment, before you could have awarded judgment, you must have asked him what he had to say; if he had pleaded the pardon, it is a charter of remission, and operates in stay of execution: now, to satisfy you that the judgment having or not having been pronounced, makes no sort of difference in this case; I state a case which has happened very lately, from a respectable authority, bearing some analogy to it, and your Lordship knows the very persons, Priddle, Holloway and Steevens were convicted of a conspiracy; subsequent to this, a person of the name of Crossley was tried at the Court of King's Bench for perjury, Priddle was produced as a witness, it was objected to by Mr. Silvester, that he was not a competent witness, and they produced the record of conviction for conspiracy; it was contended there, that in that case of Priddle, as there had been no infamous judgment; it did not go to his disability; Mr. Justice Buller declared he was of opinion, after great consideration, that he had looked into the books, that he had considered the subject and he said, that it was not the infamy of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120184"></xptr>the punishment, but of the crime which occasioned the incompetency of the witness; then I say you need not produce any authorities to prove this; we all know that the Court of Quarter-Sessions have inflicted inflicted infamous punishments for a crime not infamous; therefore we may infer it is the infamy of the crime, not the punishment: I was mentioning to you the case of Priddle, and what Mr. Justice Buller said upon it, and Priddle was rejected as incompetent: I am at present arguing only to satisfy you that the fact of the judgement having been given or not, makes no difference; suppose that upon Priddle's case you had postponed the judgement, and in the mean time the trial had come on, Priddle would have been rejected, he had been convicted of an infamous offence, and then the law has said he has shewn himself so little attentive to truth, so little attentive to honor and honesty, that it is dangerous to society that that man should longer continue in such a situation ever to be a witness, and nothing shall restore him to that competency.</p>
               <p>In treason, the king may grant his pardon, a charter of remission, a charter of pardon, a charter remitting all the personal penalties attaching on the person convicted of treason, but the King cannot grant a charter of restoration to a traitor; your Lordship knows, that in order to partake of any of the advantages of society, there must be the consent of the whole society to receive him; the head of the society cannot say I will run my innocent subjects into danger; there must be the consent of the whole society, testified by act of parliament: nothing can restore a traitor, but an act of parliament; just upon the same principles. I contend it is here; and I contend nothing can restore the witness M'Daniel to the state of being a competent witness, but the consent of all the public testified by an act of the legislature; the King cannot do it, if he can, he possesses a prerogative infinitely more dangerous than those against which our ancestors struggled; a prerogative to lay snares for innocence; a prerogative to send back with a halter about his neck, a man into society against whom they would shut the door, as if he were too dangerous to be permitted to enter: he comes here pleading this pardon, not for any good reasons, but to transfer the load of guilt from himself, to pull it on another, to say that other man has been guilty; and all that is to be brought about by the magic of this pardon; I believe it possesses no such magic; three minutes ago he was kneeling at that bar, with a halter about his neck, ready to be fastened to some strong beam: Now is there any thing in this pardon that shews why that man, whom they was just now asking why the Court should not give him judgement to die, shall be admitted a witness to affect a third person? I ask them to point it out, to shew me any thing in which the King by any terms of pardon, by any charter of restoration, by any instrument that he can order the great seal of England to be put to, that he can convey that to this man; and if there was a way of doing it, the King's grant is not to be taken largely against the King, or against his subjects; the boon is to be extended to this man as far as the King intended it should go; but not largely against the King, and against the King's subjects: if it were not a new case, certainly one does not care a farthing, because I know your Lordship will tell the Jury that this man has purchased this pardon at the price of the lives of these two men; the prosecutor has bought his testimony; I mean no reflection on the prosecution, or any body concerned in it; but as to this man, as far as it relates to his testimony, it is the price of the purchase money, in order to enable this man to give testimony against these two men; I contend it is against all the law of this country, therefore I sit down content, unless my learned friends can produce something written in some authoritative book on the subject, proving the King has this right; I do contend with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120185"></xptr>great submission, but great confidence, that this witness cannot be received.</p>

               <p>Court. I own the inclination of my opinion is at present strongly against the general line of argument that has been very ingeniously, and very forcibly put by the counsel for the prisoners; but can you, or Mr. Fielding, state distinctly to me, any case in which it is clearly settled and adjudged, that upon a conviction for perjury in particular, the competency of the witness is restored by the King's pardon. I have some imperfect recollection; I have heard mention that some such case has lately come under the consideration of the Judges, but I am not furnished with a note of it, and my recollection of it is not distinct enough to induce me to act so decidedly upon it, as to deprive the prisoner of the benefit of this objection, which has never yet been settled; for the question is certainly more important than I should wish peremptorily to decide, so as to bind the prisoner: my inclination therefore at present is this, I shall shortly state my reasons, that some parts of the argument that have been so ingeniously put, by by-standers may not be taken to be law; therefore I shall give some reasons, why I shall at all events receive the witness; but unless you give me some precise case, I shall receive his evidence subject to the opinion of the the Judges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is as clear as the noon day sun; there is no doubt of the general operation of a pardon in the case of felony, and Judge Hale says in his Pleas of the Crown, that the Royal pardon not only respects the punishment, but restores to the culprit his plenam et liberam legem.</p>
               <p>Court. The safest line for a single Judge to take, where it has not been a case clearly, unequivocally, and authoritatively decided, is to receive the evidence, and to take care that if he does wrong in doing so, the prisoner shall not be prejudiced by his error: The argument in support of the objection has been so ingeniously and so forcibly put upon specious principles, which yet appear to me to be, speaking legally, false principles; but I think it right to say a word or two on that subject, and on the prerogative of the Crown to pardon: It is certainly true that the prerogative of the Crown in general, extends only to the interest of the Crown, and the direct interest of the public, of all which the Crown is the guardian; and therefore I hold that the Crown cannot release the vested right of any private individual; if therefore, a right becomes absolutely vested in a third person, any act which the Crown chuses to remit, the Crown may remit that penalty as far as relates to itself, and the public; but it cannot remit that interest which relates to the individual; the same principle is applied in the case of appeals, which are prosecutions allowed by the antient law of the country, upon principles which certainly would not have been received at this day; they are a species of prosecution, and were indulged to private revenge; but it is carrying that principle too far a great deal to say that the prerogative of the Crown should never operate in any case which may in it's consequences indirectly affect individuals, and it is impossible to illustrate it plainer than in the very subject which is the ground of the present argument; for the argument has gone all the length of saying that the Crown cannot by this pardon make a person whom the law says is incapable of being a witness, a witness against any individual subject; now it is perfectly within the knowledge of the two learned gentlemen, (perhaps some little speciousness may captivate the audience,) but it is perfectly known to them as well as to every other gentleman of learning, that that in this extent is by no means true: for that in cases of all felonies without exception, which are as clear legal disabilities; it is perfectly clear that in that case the pardon of the Crown restores the competency; it therefore is not true as a general proposition that the Crown has not the power to restore the competency of a witness; in convictions for felony it is perfectly clear that it is otherwise: then I am a little inclined to see this case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120186"></xptr>in a light that it has not yet been stated in; I have already said a little, but as much as is necessary, where I do not mean to give a decided opinion: With respect to convictions of perjury, that probably the opinions arose from the confounding his competency with the credit, because there the offence in its own nature, independent of any infliction of punishment of any sentence, independent of any consequences of the law, as soon as it comes beyond a doubt, and decisively ascertained that a person has once been found guilty of swearing what is not true, it is in common sense that the credit of that person can never be restored; that is the natural and philosophical consequence of the commission of the crime; the destruction of the competence; and the consequence of the law there, seems as much a part of the actual punishment of perjury, that that person shall be legally disabled from giving judgment on the rights of any subject; and if it is a part of the punishment, I have no doubt of the prerogative of the Crown to remit it, let who will be affected by it: this is not an indictment for perjury, but for felony, and though that felony is committed through the medium of perjury, though perjury is the species of felony, which the act of parliament has thought proper to make a felony, yet it may very well be doubted whether the act of parliament in changing the nature of that offence, has not changed the legal consequence, as well as the nature of punishment: Perjury is not punished with death, this is; the perjury is therefore merged in the felony completely; it is this, whether in strict legal consideration, the Court can take any cognizance of the legal consequences of perjury at all, and whether this does not stand a conviction generally of felony without benefit of clergy; if that should be the case, the other question will never arise: I think it by no means impossible that that opinion must be entertained; then the only consequence thus considered is, that a person in stating to the Jury the credit of such a witness, will certainly forget the nature of the felony, and that though it is made by act of parliament a felony, and can have no other consequence, yet common sense, and common understanding and acceptation, will say that the effect on the credit remains the same; an act of parliament may alter the circumstances, but cannot alter the nature of things. My present opinion is, that the King may restore the competency after the conviction, or at least before judgment, but that this is to be considered as conviction for a felony, and not as a conviction for perjury; I shall therefore receive the evidence, but I shall certainly communicate the subject to the Judges, in consequence of a verdict; if the Jury should be of opinion that a verdict ought to be given against the prisoner, I will take care their verdict shall have no consequence as against the prisoner, till I am satisfied their verdict should be allowed.</p>

               <p>Did he make any application to you in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120187"></xptr>the month of June last? - He came down to Billingsgate to me, he told me he would get me half a guinea to earn; I asked where I was to go, or what was I to do, and he told me to come up to a Jew, one Davis, and he would get me the half guinea.</p>
               <p>When was this? - The same day that I was taken, in the morning early.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time that he applied to you upon this business? - No, he told me a fortnight before this.</p>
               <p>Tell us what he said to you a fortnight before? - He told me he had half a guinea for me to earn, but it was not time yet; he did not say at that time who the Jew was; then he brought me to the Spread Eagle in Grace-church-street, and then he brought me to Mr.

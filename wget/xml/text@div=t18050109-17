             sworn. - I am a butcher, I live in Paternoster-row, Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner carry the sheep out of the shop, I did not see him take it; it was a carcase of mutton, and as he carried it out of the shop, he dropped the cloth from off his shoulder; he took it out of one butcher's shop, and went into the next shop with it, and when he came out of that shop, I gave him the cloth; he said it was his; I told Mr. Scales what I had seen; we then went across the way, and fetched him back, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of this carcase of mutton that was in this shop? - A. Mr. Scales had it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this man who went into that shop with the carcase of mutton was the same man who took it out of Mr. Scales' shop? - A. I am sure, I never lost sight of him; it was about seven o'clock in the evening last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Scales.) You had an information against this man by the witness - you went across the road, and took him? - A. Yes; I took him back into my shop; I went into the shop where the sheep was, I knew it to be my sheep; he said he knew nothing about it, he did not take it; I then asked him his name; he told me,

               <p>Q. You are sure it was your sheep? - A. I am certain of that; the next butcher does not kill mutton, and that was the only sheep there was in the shop.</p>

I know myself very innocent of the crime alledged against me; I was going over the way; this gentleman took me on the shoulder, and shoved me along, and said, you have stole a sheep of mine, will you come to the shop along with me; I said, by all means I will; they overhauled my cloaths to see if I had any grease about me; I had no grease whatever about my clothes; that man said I had it on my back; I am a hardworking man, I have been with Lord Nelson at Egypt; I belonged last summer to Alderman Curtis's pleasure boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where, here or at Ramsgate? - A. If I was at home I could tell; it was at Ramsgate.</p>

               <p>Shoreditch. On Friday afternoon, the 24th of January, I was passing in a private road, near the New North-road, at Hoxton—my attention was called to a ditch, and on looking into it, I saw the head of a child lying, with its face upwards—there was very little water in the ditch—it was muddy—the face was partly exposed, and partly covered—it laid sideways—about two or three feet from the head, I saw a newspaper, containing the body of a child—the left arm was off the body, and the head was off also—Mr. Preedy, a medical man, came up, and the head and body were taken to the station-house, by his order—about nine o'clock the evening before I had been near that same spot, and saw <hi rend="italic">a</hi> person two hundred or three hun<lb></lb>dred yards from the spot—she was going from there, towards the canal—she saw me, and altered her direction, and went towards the spot where the body was afterwards found—she had something in a basket in one hand, and something in a blue bundle in the other—I could not see her face exactly, for her hair was over her face—she appeared in a distressed state—I could not swear to her—the basket she had was just such a one as this <hi rend="italic">—(looking at one</hi>)—it was very dark then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old. I am no relation to the prisoner—I was in the service of Jones and Chatfield, in January, as housemaid—the prisoner was cook—I had been there two months, within two or three days—I slept in the same bed with the prisoner—nobody else slept in the same room—one evening, I do not know the day of the month, my master had a party to tea and supper—I had noticed something par<lb></lb>ticular about the prisoner before that—we all noticed it—I spoke to her about it about a week before the party—I told her she looked very large, and that she was in the family way—she strongly denied it—on the night of the party she went to bed, about half-past nine or ten o'clock—I went between eleven and twelve o'clock—she was in bed when I went in—a few minutes after I had been in bed, she got out, and exclaimed, "Good God, I cannot lay"—she said nothing else—I did not speak to her—she seemed to be in pain, and very ill—I did not ask her what was the matter, or speak to her at all—I do not know what she did after she got out of bed, but the bed shook very much, and she went out of the room several times—I went to sleep after she went out of the room—she did not go out directly she got out of bed—she stopped near the foot of the bed some time, and then went out—she went out of the room two or three times before I went to sleep—that occupied, I should think, ten minutes, or it might be a little longer—I heard somebody cry, as it sounded to me, like a child—it was similar to a child crying—I have said that I could not tell whether it was the cry of the mother, or the child, exactly, as I would not be positive—I heard this cry, similar to a child—I should say it appeared the cry of the child, more than of the mother—I did not hear her get into bed at all that night again—she was not in bed when I heard the cry—I did not find her in bed when I awoke the following morning—she called me up at our usual time, seven o'clock—she was then up and dressed to the best of my recollection—I believe she did not come into bed at all that night again—there was a frock of mine hanging at the foot of the bed that night—I had occasion to put it on that afternoon—I did not find any thing on it when I put it on, but I went into the shop, and a strange woman called my attention to it—I then found there was a good deal of blood about the back of the frock—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and said it must have been her, as no one else could have done it—she said it was</p>

On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 30th of January, I was in the waiting-room at Worship-street, where the prisoners are placed previous to going before the Magistrate—the prisoner, and the witness Reeve, were there with a policeman—I said to the policeman, "Are these the two parties charged with murder, that Mr. Robinson has in custody?"—he said, "I don't know"—that induced me to say to the two prisoners, "Are you the parties charged with this horrible murder, where the child was found in the ditch?"—the witness Reeve said, in a low tone, but sit<lb></lb>ting so close, the prisoner must have heard it, "Not me, but" (pointing to the prisoner on the left side) "this one"—the prisoner immediately said, "The policeman charges me with murder, but I am not guilty, for the child was still-born"—she then added, "I put it in the ditch, but its head was not off then"—on the following day I searched her box at Jones and Chatfield's, and found some linen and articles, which appeared to have been recently washed—I found no preparation for the birth of a child—there were several aprons, which appeared to have been recently washed, they—were rolled up, and put away quite wet, there was no baby-linen whatever—in the prisoner's bed-room there appeared to be a stain of blood on the wall of the chimney, which is close to a little sideboard—the bed had been taken down when I was there, but the foot of the bed must have come towards that part where the blood was—I think Mr. Chatfield staled to me where the bed had been—the stain was, I suppose, two feet eight, or three feet from the ground—it was not done by a bloody hand—it appeared to have run down from a small sideboard in the recess, as if something bloody had been put on the sideboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Pentonville. On the 24th of January I was passing by the New North-road, Hoxton—my attention was called to part of the body of a child found in a ditch—I delivered it to the policeman No. 121—it was the trunk, with the exception of the left arm, and the head, which was detached—I desired it to be taken to the station-house, but it was taken to the house of Mr. Coward, a surgeon, in the neighbourhood—I afterwards saw an arm fitted to the body, and the head, and am decidedly of opinion it all formed one body—I have no doubt at all of it—it was perfectly fresh—it might have been dead a few days—I think decomposition does not go on so rapidly with new-born children as others—my impression is that the arm was taken off by a sharp instrument—the tearing an arm of a child off would be attended with some difficulty, but would not be very difficult after decapitation—I am certain that both the head and arm were separated by a sharp instrument—there was a divi<lb></lb>sion of the cartilage by a sharp instrument—the decapitation took place after death decidedly—both had evidently been severed after death—I noticed a contusion on both sides of the head, on the parietal bone, and on the temporal or frontal bone on the left side—I was enabled to make a more minute examination afterwards at Mr. Coward's—I have no doubt those contusions were inflicted during the life of the child—that is my opinion as to all the contusions I observed about the head—there were dark blue and black appearances externally, ecchymosis—I thought I could feel extravasation—that is, it was given during the circulation of the blood—there was also a bruise on both sides of the body, and slight ecchymosis spots on different parts—I confined my observation more particularly to the head—on the following day the body was opened by Mr. Coward and myself, and on a subsequent day Mr. Leeson was present—I opened the head, and found very great extravasation between the scalp and the bone, and a further extravasation on the brain—I examined the bones of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040129"></xptr>
               <p>head, and found both the parietal bones, the temporal right side, and the frontal bone on the left side fractured—that appeared to have been produced by the external violence the child had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I dare say you have known instances of children delivered without assistance being given to the woman, and the child falling on a hard substance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A child might receive a fracture of the skull from something of that sort very possibly, presuming the woman to be standing in an erect position—assuming the prisoner to have been delivered of the child, and it having fallen on the hearth-stone or boards, the skull might possibly be fractured in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think such an occurrence would satisfactorily account for all the appearances of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I do not think that would fracture the several bones that were fractured—it is pos<lb></lb>sible, but not probable—I think it possible if she had dropped the child twice it might account for the fractured bones, but it is pot probable—I proceeded to open the chest—the lungs were not at all decomposed—I took them out and put them in water, and they floated—I should imagine from the general appearance of the lungs that they had been properly inflated—I have heard of children living two or three days and not having their lungs thoroughly inflated, but never knew of such a case—these appeared thoroughly inflated—there have been cases where the child has respired, and yet died before it left the mother—that is very common—it might be from the pressure on the umbilical cord, the weakness of the child, and other causes—I should rather doubt the circumstance of the lungs being inflated being a certain test that the child was born alive—the hydrostatic test may have been a good deal blown upon, but I still have a great opinion of it, not that I should like to stake the life of a fellow-creature on it—I do not think I should rely on that alone—children frequently receive inju<lb></lb>ries on the head during delivery—I do not think I could refer the injuries I saw to that—it appeared to have arrived at the proper period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might not the mother, having no assistance, by compres<lb></lb>sion of her own hands very innocently destroy the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might produce external marks—I imagine that putting her hand round the child's neck during labour, would produce external marks—if it occasioned death, I think the marks of the fingers would be plain—I think if there had been, pressure on the skull at that time, the bones would lap over, but they would resume their position immediately—by the shape of the head I think no extensive pressure was used—I think it rather doubtful whether a fracture would be produced by the woman endeavouring to assist herself by com<lb></lb>pression of the hand on the skull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say it would be possible for a woman taken suddenly in labour, without assistance, in her struggles to deliver herself, to cause the fractures found in this child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by endeavouring to deliver herself—I attribute death to external violence, producing the extravasation of blood on the head—the appearances could not be produced by compression of the hands of the mother—I have not the slightest doubt that the child was born alive—it was decidedly born alive, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean it had undoubtedly respired—the lungs were fully inflated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you shown the placenta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040130"></xptr>
               <p>rather in a decomposed state, but it assisted our inquiry, because I imagine that the circulation had been kept up between the mother and child to the time of birth, but that is conjecture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you have had opportunities of witness<lb></lb>ing a great many deliveries <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I have known instances of self-delivery before assistance could be got, where the parties have been in good circumstances—I have seen cases where the act of parturition has been at<lb></lb>tended by total absence of mind, but they are not numerous—I have, on one occasion, had under my own notice a mother, in perfectly good circum<lb></lb>stances, manifesting an eagerness to destroy her child—the mother, in that case, was at times, not in a condition to know what she was about at the time—I had delivered that person myself—I gave the nurse instruction to take the child from her, to prevent the possibility of a repeti<lb></lb>tion—these things would be just as likely with medical assistance as in self-delivery—the effect of fear and shame, the woman not being married, would, no doubt, have additional effect on the mind, I have HO doubt it might produce almost insanity—the head of the child was not at all decom<lb></lb>posed when I first saw it—it exhibited slight signs of decomposition externally, when we commenced the internal examination—that was about the face—it was merely discoloration—a child falling down would be one of the means of producing ecchymosis—ecchymosis is a strong proof of vitality, it shows that, at the time of receiving the injury, there was cir<lb></lb>culation of the blood—it does not show the means by which the violence was inflicted—I do not know that it has been the result of experiment in France, that a new-born child falling from the mother, not more than eight inches, on a hard floor, has almost invaribly fractured the skull, but it is possible—in this case the umbilical cord would be quite long enough to admit of the child falling to the ground—it was unusually long—I should say it was a yard long—supposing the mother to have got out of bed, and stood in a posture to deliver herself, and the child to have fallen on the ground, it would certainly not be unlikely to produce a fracture—it is by no means impossible—if she had stamped her foot on the head in her agony it would have been likely to produce such a result—I do not say it is probable—if she had her shoe on it would be more likely—I think it possible, but not probable—the umbilical cord was not secured in this instance—there is a chance, under those circumstances, of the child bleed<lb></lb>ing to death, but it is not certain—if left any length of time, the blood is attracted into another channel often—it was broken, I should think, about eight inches from the placenta.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the appearances have been what they were, supposing the child to have died from loss of blood from the umbilical cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing her to have gone in and out of the room, being delivered on the stairs, and the child having rolled down the stairs, do you suppose that would at all account for the fracture on both sides of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is barely possible—I believe the child to have been born alive, and that death was occasioned by external violence, but the mode in which it was received is matter of conjecture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police. I was sent for to the station-house by the Inspector, on the 30th of January, and saw the prisoner there—I made an examination of her person—she did not object to it—I ascertained that she had been recently delivered of a child—I asked her if it was not so?—she said "Yes"—I had seen the arm of the child at the station-house—I asked her if the arm of the child I had seen was any portion of the child of which she was delivered—she said "Yes".—I asked her where the other remains of the child were to be found—she said, "where the arm must have been found"—she said the child was still-born—she said she suffered for a considerable time preparatory pains, but that ultimately she was delivered in a short time—I assisted the other gentlemen in the examination of the body—I have heard their evidence, and concur in it to a very great extent—I do not suppose the whole of the fractures being so extensive, could have occurred from the mere circumstance of the child falling on the floor or any hard substance—a portion of them might have occurred so—I should think it improbable, but not impossible, that it might happen by her being delivered on the stairs, and the child falling down several steps.</p>

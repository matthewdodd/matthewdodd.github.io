This money was in a basin in my clothes-box; the prisoner called a little after nine o'clock on Sunday morning, about some glazing he was to do for me. I was in bed, and my wife getting breakfast ready; I invited him to take breakfast - he consented. My wife went to the public-house to fetch him a glass of rum; a man came in for some money; my wife opened the box in the prisoner's presence, and gave him 12 s.; she sat down to make the toast; the prisoner sat opposite to her, and said he should like a relish; she gave him a herring to toast; he sent her out to fetch him two eggs; he then went to the box, opened it, and put his hand in; his back was towards me. I heard money rattle, jumped out of bed, and caught hold of his hand in the box, and said, "Are you going to rob me?" He pretended it was a joke. I said, "You have robbed me - and insist on your giving me what money you have taken." He denied having any; I said he should not leave. He gave me a shilling. I told him to go out of the room, and never come in again. My wife came in as soon as he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there not a little girl in the room - A. No. I have a daughter, but she is servant to a lodger. She never told me she was in the room, and was sure the prisoner did not go to the box. When the person came for some money, the prisoner went to fetch him some gin; he returned and said. "They will not trust me," and I gave him sixpence to fetch it. He was taken on the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he would not leave the house till he had his rule - A. He had it back. I found it on my bed. I did not know where he lived. My child came to the door just as he came back. I did not know that he had taken more than the shilling.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030057"></xptr>called on Sunday the 2d of November - I fetched him a glass of gin; a carpenter called and was paid; there was then half a crown and three shillings in the box. I went to fetch him some eggs; the shop is twenty yards off, and when I returned my husband had just put him out of doors - I saw him at the door; he said my husband had accused him of robbing him; and when I went in, my husband said he had returned him 1 s., and he did not know what he had taken more. I went to the box and it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you ask him to go back - A. I said "Will you go in?" but my husband pushed the door too; he did not want to come in; my daughter was not in the room; I never told the prisoner's mother that if he paid the expenses we would not prosecute. I did not write a letter to him - I cannot write.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th, at the door of Tothill-fields Prison. The prosecutor gave me information on the day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was stupidly drunk on the bed, with his coat and hat on; when his wife went out, as she had refused to give him money for drink, he said to me, "Nunn, go to the box and get me a shilling;" which I did, and laid it on his bolster. I said, "You had better put it away, or you will get me into disgrace." He started out of bed, and charged me with stealing it out of his box. I called him a scoundrel, and said I would not stop in his house. I went out and told the neighbours, who came round. I remained there till Mrs. Elton returned, and told her her husband was a scoundrel and vagabond - that I would have struck him, if he had not been older than me, and I must have my rule; he took it from under his bolster, and she handed it out to me.</p>

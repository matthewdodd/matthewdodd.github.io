                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Hammersmith. The prisoner was in my employment, and served customers every day—some per<lb></lb>sons pay for bread on delivery—on Monday, the 2nd of August, he ac<lb></lb>companied me to Kensington, in my horse and cart—I left him in charge of the horse and cart, and went to Mark-lane, giving him instructions what to do—my wife gave him bread and flour, and a number of weekly bills—he had to call on thirty-four or thirty-five customers—I did not receive from him for Susan Wells any money that day—I never saw him from that time till I saw him in custody—Wells owed me between 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time—he did not account to me or to any body for it, nor for any money from Mrs. Fisher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has received this money since I have been in custody—my father has paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Witness. His father has not paid me what I charge him with—he left 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my house—that is more than I charge him with receiving from Wells and Fisher—the money is at my house now—I did not accept it—I have not returned it—I received orders from the Magistrate not to do it—I told him of it—on the 2nd of August, he was intrusted with twenty quartern loaves, thirty-four half-quarterns, and some flour, with the weekly bills—he returned to my house with the horse and cart, brought back two quarterns, three half-quarterns, and one quar<lb></lb>tern of flour, and put the horse in the stable—I wrote to his father at Hemp-stead, and told him, and I wrote again when he was taken, to tell his father he was remanded to such a day—his father came over on the Saturday—he said he was very sorry, and if I would allow him, he would pay me what he had robbed me of—I said it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said if I would be as lenient as possible, he would pay me—I said it was not in my hands, he was before a Magistrate, but I had no wish to press the "case, and would state to the Magistrate, if he thought proper to leave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if the Magistrate would like me to receive it, I should be satisfied—I named it to the Magistrate, who said I had acted right, and was not to give the money up till the trial—I hoped the Magistrate would dismiss the case, and I did not take my witnesses—he remanded him, and at the next examination I took some witnesses—he received money at eight places the same day, but the Magistrate said I need only bring two witnesses.</p>

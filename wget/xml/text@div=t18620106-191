                  </hi>. I have a slight impediment in my speech—I live at 38, Manchester-street, and am a pupil to an archi<lb></lb>tect—in the beginning of October last, I had occasion to go from Manchester-street to Brompton—for that purpose I went across the park—it was between 8 and 9 in the evening—I went into the park through the Marble Arch—after I had got into the park, I saw a young man; he came up and said something to me that I could not catch—I saw his face, there being a lamp near—I then went down the road in the path-way, inside the park rails, running parallel with the Bayswater-road, a very considerable distance, intending to go to Brompton by way of Rutland-gate—I thought the bridge gate, dividing the long walk from the Serpentine, would be locked, so I returned part of the way back, and made for the Albert-gate—I went up a path there, and when I had got a short distance up the path, the same young man, who had spoken to me before, came up to me again and said something—I thought he was begging—I said I had nothing for him, and turned off the path to avoid him—I then walked across the park, making for the nearest cut towards the Albert-gate bridge of the Serpentine, the bridge at this end of the Serpentine—when I had got a considerable distance I came to a clump of trees, where I stayed to make water—when I had nearly finished, the young man who had first spoken to me, came up again and said something I could not make out—at that instant the prisoner came from behind a tree, near, and said, "I have caught you b—g"—I said I was only making water—he said I was doing the offence he alleged, and he would take me to the station; he also said that the young man, who was standing near us at the time, would prove it—I was very much alarmed indeed; very much frightened; and he then said, "If you have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give me, you can go"—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I offered him my watch, which he would not take—he asked me if I had any rings—I had two rings which I gave him, with the watch, and some small change that I had, two or three shillings—he then said he would take my umbrella—he did so, and then made off—the other man was standing near us all the time the prisoner had been talking—he followed me for a short distance, and then he made off too, the prisoner making towards the Albert-gate, and the other making towards the Wellington-arch, Hyde Park—I have not seen the rings since, with one exception, or the umbrella—they have not been found—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is considerably damaged and altered, but it is mine—there was not the slightest foundation for this charge—I did not tell my friends, or anybody, about this when I got home—I do not exactly remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060070"></xptr>
               <p>the day of the month that this occurred; it was the beginning of October—I saw nothing more of the parties until 28th November, I then saw the younger man, who had first accosted me, in Manchester-square, and he said to me that he either had my rings, or he could get them for me; I do not recollect which—he was alone at that time, but I saw the prisoner in about a minute afterwards, not in Manchester-square; the younger man walked along Manchester-street, and turned up Edward-street by Anderson's, the chemist's, and the instant we reached Anderson's, the prisoner came, up, in Edward-street—he joined the other man—the prisoner said to me "I have your watch and rings," to which I replied, "Have you"—he then said he would give them me if I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for my address, and said if I would give him my address he would bring them to me, on condition that I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch and two rings—he did not name either the umbrella or the two or three shillings—I then agreed to give him only my address, not the other man, on condition that the other man went away—the other man then went away, and I gave the prisoner my address, and he walked with me to see that I had given him the right on—when I got to the door the servant, Mary Valentine, opened it, and the prisoner followed me upstairs without my asking him—I did not give any name then—I eventually gave him the name of Hawkin—the prisoner followed me upstairs to my room—I then said to him, "Then you will bring me my watch and rings to-night if you receive the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would, and he then asked me for my name, which I gave him in writing on a piece of paper, as "Hawkin"—he then left, saying he would come again the next night, and bring my watch and rings—the next night about 6 o'clock he came—he came up to my room—I asked him if he had my watch and rings—he said, without replying to my question, that I had given him the rings—he then went into my bedroom, which communicates with the sitting-room by a door, he looked under the bed, returned into the room, and produced the rings only—he laid them down on the table; I asked him to do so—I said he had agreed to bring my watch also—he said he had not—when he laid the rings on the table, I put five sovereigns into his hand—before I gave him the money be said that he had men waiting outside, and if I did not give him the money he would call the men in and have me taken up—directly I gave him the five sovereigns he seized the rings; he snatched them up off the table immediately, and then he said he would let me have them again if I would give him another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the house, but if he came at half-past 5, I would have the rings then and give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he then left—about five minutes after he had left the other young man who I had first seen, came up to my room—he said that he had my watch, and if I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it I could have it—he showed me the watch—he had it in his hand—I had not the money and I told him so—he said he would have it before he left—I had only 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the house of my own—I rang the bell to see if the landlady had the extra 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the servant came up on to the landing, and I went out of the room to speak to her—I sent her to see if she could get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she came back without it—when the servant had gone down to see if she could get the landlady to lend me the money, the man went to the window, sat down in a chair, threw up the window, and leaned out, so that he could see into the street—he left the house before the servant returned—I went down with him—I looked out when he left, and saw him speaking to the prisoner—I saw them join together and speaking together—I went out, and went over the street to tell him that the servant could not get the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but if he chose to meet me at the Vere-street post-office the following morning he</p>

               <p>could have it, if he gave me up the watch—on the following morning, Saturday, I left my lodging about half-past 8, and went to a tobacconists shop in Oxford-street, so that I could see the Vere-street post-office—while there I saw the prisoner pass the window, and in a minute or two afterwards I saw the other one—I went and spoke to the younger man whom I had first seen—I told him I had not the money, and made an appointment for half-past 6 on the Monday night—after I got home from Vere-street on Saturday, the prisoner came; he came up into my room—he was exceedingly rough in his manner, and said he would have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before he left the room—he locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, and walked about the room in a very rough manner indeed—I ran into my bed-room; there is a door into the passage from that, and I went out of that and met the prisoner on the landing—I seized him by the coat, and shook him, and said he should go to the police-station, and I would go with him—he said he would go to the police-station, he should only be too happy, his character would bear him out through everything—we went out at the street door and shortly met the younger man; he joined us—we all three went together down George-street and Marylebone-lane, nearly as far as Hinde-street, that is on the way to the police-station—the younger man then said he would not go to the police-station—the prisoner said to him, "I will make you go, you shall go"—the young man, after walking a short way down Marylebone-lane, left us, saying he would return and take away my character—I continued walking with the prisoner till we got to Wigmore-street—he then said that if I would promise to give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday night he would not go any further, and would leave me there and then—we did not go on to the police-station—he was to bring the rings on Monday—after he had left me I turned to go down Marylebone-lane, and when I had got a short distance I again met the younger man—after that I mentioned the matter to a friend, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of that two police-constables were in waiting on the Monday night—when the prisoner came on Monday night, he saw the constables and ran away and was taken.</p>

I am a sergeant of the detective police—on 2nd December, accompanied by Sergeant Thomas, I went to 38, Manchester-street, in the afternoon—we went to the second floor—after we had been there some time, in consequence of something the maid-servant said to me I went down stairs—as I was going down the stairs I saw the prisoner at the front door—he immediately ran away, pushing the maid-servant up against the wall—he could see me coming down the stairs; the staircase is straight with the passage—I, and the prosecutor, and Thomas, followed him—he ran up Manchester-street on the same side as 38, up to 50 or 51; that was towards Manchester-square—in running along there, he passed the house of Mr. Hawkin,. No. 48—I secured him just after he had passed No. 49 or 50—he was taken back to the prosecutor's lodgings—I told him I was an officer of police, and that this gentleman, pointing to the prosecutor, charged him with extorting money, a watch, and rings from him, by threatening to accuse him of having committed an unnatural crime—he said he was innocent—he appeared very much excited and became violent—I asked him if he would permit me to see what he had about him—he said, "No;" God strike him b—blind if I touched him, he would smash me—I said, "Such conduct will not serve you, you had better be quiet and submit to what I require, otherwise I must do it by force"—I then searched him and found on him a purse containing a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and a half-penny—I asked him if he would tell me the object of his visit to the house that night—he said, "To see Mr. Hawkin"—I said, "Will you be good enough to tell me for what purpose"—he said, "I shall not"—I then took him to the station—next morning I received this watch from Mr. Haworth—I have since been in pursuit of the other man, but have not been able to take him.</p>

            . I went out on the 15th of November, before my husband, and did not return until after he had returned. I missed a blue pelisse which I had laid on the bed on going out, and the bed clothes were taken with it. There was a gown cut out in the box, a silk petticoat, and all the things that have been found are in court, in the custody of the officer.</p>

            . I am patrole belonging to Aldgate parish. On Wednesday, the 15th of November, at about five o'clock in the evening, I met a man in a place called Back Rents, Rosemary Lane, with a deal box on his shoulder; I am not quite sure that that man was the prisoner; it was quite dark. He went into Solomon's shop. After we had heard of this robbery, I went with a brother officer to search Solomon's house, and there between the ceiling and the tiles, we found a box, to which the prosecutor will swear. I cannot swear that that is the box which I saw a man take into Solomon's shop.</p>

            . I lived servant with Solomon, on the 15th of last month; I saw the prisoner that evening; he came into Solomon's house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, with a deal box; he put it down in the middle of the room, and said, "he had made a bloody smash." The first thing he pulled out, was a blue pelisses; he said he should keep that for his girl. My master, Solomon, was at home then, and gave him a one pound note for them. I knew the man twice before; he had been at our house at about four o'clock on the day of the robbery, eating a herring.</p>

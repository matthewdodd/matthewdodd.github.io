I have seen the prisoner at Mr. White's chambers very often for the last two years—in the first instance Mr. White generally saw him, but not latterly—I learned from the prisoner the object of his visits to Mr. White; it was respecting a woman and a child—he said he had done something for Mr. White—he has often said he came for money—I received three letters, one from a boy and two others—this letter came to my hands, it is dated the 31st of December—it must have been then that I received it—I have seen the prisoner write—I believe the whole of this letter(marked A) to be his hand-writing, and the address—it is not the letter named in the indictment—the prisoner came to Mr. White's the day after this letter came, the 1st of January—he brought this letter. (B) delivered it to me, and desired it</p>

In the course of last year I was consulted by Mr. White on this matter—I was present, on the 9th of December, at Mr. White's chambers, when the prisoner and his attorney and Mr. White were present—I produces a release that was executed on that occasion, I saw the prisoner sign it, this is it—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to the prisoner on the execution of that release, and and acceptance of Mr. White's for three months, which is not due yet—the prisoner did not state that he had any other claim on Mr. White—I saw the prisoner again, on the even<lb></lb>ing of the 11th of December, at my office—He said he came to me as the attorney of Mr. White, and requested me to ask Mr. White to let him have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had an opportunity of getting in to business in London, and he wanted this sum to buy the fixtures—I told him I was surprised at the request, and refused to be the medium of communicating that to Mr. White—he then asked if I would request Mr. White to give his ac<lb></lb>ceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I refused to do—he came again the following evening, but I would not suffer him to come into my house—he came again on the 30th of December—he came into my room—I immediately arose from my chair, and said, "I can have no communication at all with you," and made him go out of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Water-street, Bridewell. In De<lb></lb>cember last, the prisoner was treating with me for a house—he referred me to his friend, George White, of Essex-street, a barrister—the fixtures were to be included in the rent—there was a treaty about some furniture which came to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he first referred me to Mr. White as to his character, and proposed to take this furniture at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and to pay me by an acceptance of Mr. White's to that amount—I objected to make any application to Mr. White—the prisoner was to do so—I called on Mr. White on the 28th in consequence of the prisoner's direction for the acceptance—It was to be drawn by the prisoner—he refused to give it, and stated he had informed Mr. Cook he would not—I wrote to the prisoner on that day, and he came to me the day following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not have an interview first with Mrs. White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she came into the room before I left—Mrs. White said, "You will certainly not accept a bill, not recommend that man"—but I should say that Mr. White had declined the acceptance before Mrs. White came into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell me, that Mr. White was indisposed when you first called, that there was no fire in the first-floor office, and Mrs. White came and asked you up stairs, and she would introduce you to Mr. White? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not one item of what you have stated is true, she did not do so, nor did I tell you so—the servant introduced me up stairs—this is my hand-writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)" 2, Water-street, Bridewell Precinct, December 22nd, 1835. Sir, Mr. Leblanc, who is the superior landlord of the house, No. 2, Tudor-street, has this day made inquiries of Mr. White, and is sa<lb></lb>tisfied with his statement as to your respectability, and I have therefore directed the notice "To let" to be taken down, Mr. Leblanc is going out of town on Thursday, in the middle of the day, it is therefore desirable, with a view to immediate possession, that the agreement with his as to rent, fixtures, &amp;c., is completed at the latest on Thursday morning.

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. It is utterly false—I did not visit her with you in the charac<lb></lb>ter of a physician—I do not remember your calling in a Mr. Hart, a surgeon accoucheur—you once sent me a prescription which I could not read, not understanding medicine—I burnt it—I remember on the 1st of last March giving her 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to convey her home to her mother in your presence—I said I would pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the child, not 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I did not advise you to try and get an appointment under Col.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember accepting a bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which not being honoured I was arrested on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe you were arrested—I told the attorney you were not worth arresting—you told me the writ was issued—I remember writing a letter to Mrs. Woodhouse—I promised when the bill was cashed to remit the difference—the document I indorsed was for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believe it became due on Saturday—I believe it was presented—a man of the name of Wettenholm came to me to accept for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you, and to take your counter acceptance—of course I refused.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

"—and before I left for the Spring circuit of 1834, I paid the prisoner the balance of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he pro<lb></lb>mised I should never hear any thing more of him or the child—In March, 1835, I paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the representation of the woman and the prisoner, that she was to return to her friends at Aylesbury—and that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to enable her to do it.</p>

               <p>(Letter A.) Addressed to "G. S. White, Esq., No. 39, Essex-street, strand"—"Sir, I have a great right to express my surprise at you con<lb></lb>duct, after the statement made to you by Mr. Ward. If you had not felt disposed to assist me, you need not have given Mr. W. your attorney's address. It appears I am to fall, for want of a proper reference, which you engaged to do, and which you have not done. I can only observe, in the event of my falling, you must also. It is true that, as regards my claim for debt, I might have had it settled, and a release signed in the presence of your solicitor as well as mine; but, as regards the criminality, for the benefit of the community, I fell compelled to bring it forward; and I do not hesitate to assert, that my respectability will stand equal with yours. I will leave you to your own conclusions, without expressing any thing until I receive your answer. I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant, "<hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES COOK</hi>".</p>
               <p>(Letter B.) To, "Mr. White, 39, Essex-street, Strand, January 1st, 1836".—"I this day gave notice to Sir F. Roe, of a circumstance of a very se<lb></lb>rious nature, which has preyed so strongly on my mind, that I am deter<lb></lb>mined to bring it before the public. G. T. White, Esq., special pleader, 39, Essex-street, Strand, employed me to procure abortion, he, G. T. White's remedies having failed, introduced a probe into the uterus of a girl, and G. T. White attended her with me in the character of a physician, The girl's health is ruined in consequence. My address is, Mr. Cook, sur<lb></lb>geon, Ilford, Essex. "</p>

I will cure you of your obstinate fit, you will then know whether you should take your own, or your wife's advice. I am Sir, your humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES COOK</hi>. "</p>
               <p>(Letter C.) "Sir, Before I proceed further in the unfortunate affair, I have one request to make; will you give me your acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months. I will take it up when due, and you shall never have cause to repent; If not things must now take their course. I went yesterday to Mr. Vickery, who declines acting, in consequence of being acquainted with you. I have been this morning to Fitzpatrick, in Clement's Inn, who is not aware of my writing to you; his advice it, to let the girl apply for a sum<lb></lb>mons for an assault of a peculiar nature, your answer to this will decide.</p>

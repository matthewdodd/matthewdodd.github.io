                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Messrs. McCaul, provision merchants of Hounds ditch, as foreman tin-smith—the prisoner was also in that employment as foreman butcher—on Saturday, 11th July, I spoke to him upon some small affair concerning the business and he answered me insultingly; nothing more took place between us—on the Monday in speaking to Mr. Whittingham, one of the firm, Harris' name was brought up and I mentioned that he had used insulting language to me—I could not say whether he saw me speaking to Mr. Whittingham—I believe he was on the premises at the time—about dinner time I was standing in the lobby looking down the court expecting to see somebody that I had sent out—I could not say who was in the yard at the time—the prisoner passed by me, I did not speak to him or he to me—about five minutes afterwards I was leaning on a shelf that goes across the lobby when he came behind me and stabbed me in the side, saying "Take that"—it was only one stab—Thomas Lee came up to me and I was taken to the London Hospital—a statement was taken from me that evening and my deposition was taken on 18th September, by Mr. Lushington.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of John McCaul and Co., 137, Hounds ditch—the prisoner and prosecutor were in our employ—on Monday morning, 13th July, one of the foremen made a complaint to me of the prisoner, in consequence of which I told the prisoner that it had been reported that he was the worse for drink on the Saturday evening and had delayed the work—he said "I don't have my meals like other people, I take a little beer instead"—he then became excited and asked who could say anything against him—a good deal passed, he was with me about ten minutes; one phrase he used was "I have been in all the prisons about London and no one can say anything against me"—I did not understand what he meant—afterwards Skinner complained to me that the prisoner was the worse for drink on Saturday evening, and had delayed the work and used insulting language to him, which he would not have done if he had not been the worse for drink—it was early in the morning when I spoke to the prisoner, he smelt of drink then, I could not say that he was drunk, he was exceedingly excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in Messrs. McCaul's employ—on 13th July, about 1.20 I came out of the kitchen, which is on the same floor as the lobby—I passed the lobby and saw Skinner standing leaning over the counter or bench near the lobby door—the prisoner was standing at a post just outside the lobby door—I went to my dinner—the prisoner went and sat down in the yard eating his dinner; he was using a clasp knife—I was a few yards from him—I heard a footstep come along the yard, and turned and saw it was Skinner walking down the yard; in a minute or two he came back and went into the lobby again—he passed the prisoner—I saw no more, but about three minutes afterwards I heard somebody crying out "Oh, oh!" as if in distress—I went into the lobby and met the prisoner coming out into the yard with the knife open in his hand that he had been</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not before the Magistrate—I was told to come here yesterday—Mr. Jarvis, the cashier, asked me about it, and I told him. Dennis Robinson. I am a clerk in Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 49, Philip Street, Commercial Road East—I was one of the house surgeons at the London Hospital in July when the prosecutor was brought there—he had a small wound externally, about three-quarters of an inch in length, within the margin of the ribs on the right side—I believe it had penetrated a thin layer of lung and passed into the liver; it was an extremely dangerous wound; it penetrated both the chest and the abdomen—I should not think it had gone the whole length of the blade of this knife—I thought it was probably about 2 inches in depth, but that I cannot state for certain—I did not probe wound—we believed it had penetrated the liver—he remained under my care something under a fortnight—there were no symptoms after<lb></lb>wards indicating that the liver was injured—it was only on the first day or two that I thought it was so, the symptoms afterwards were from the lungs—we concluded afterwards that if it had penetrated the liver it was not to any great or important extent—the danger consisted in immediate hæmorrhage, or subsequent inflammation of the chest or abdomen—I and certain the lung was penetrated—he has suffered from that since, Mr. Herman will speak to that—he was in great danger the same evening he came in, and I thought it necessary to take his declaration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is certain that the wound had penetrated the chest, I could not say absolutely that it bad penetrated the abdomen, we thought it had, it was neither proved or disproved afterwards, because that part of the wound might have healed without any further symptoms—this is a sharp pointed knife—it is very improbable that the wound could have been caused by the man suddenly turning round with the knife in his hand upon a person behind him—the length of the skin wound hardly exceeded the breadth of the knife—if the man had turned round as suggested, the skin wound would have been of considerably greater length, from the movement of the man turning; it would probably graze along the skin—it would require some force to push it in the depth it was.</p>

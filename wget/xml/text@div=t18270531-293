            . In April last I lived with the prisoner Plummer, in Pettiford-court, Drury-court, Strand - the prisoner Harman lived with Condell, in Grange-court, Clare-market. On Monday night, the 2d of April, I was at Condell's, in Grange-court, with Plummer - Condell and Harman were there; I heard Condell ask Plummer to go with him to Mr. Wood's; I had heard it mentioned two or three nights before; Condell said they could go and get money at Mr. Wood's, and would Plummer go with him, and it was agreed that we should meet on that Monday night. On Monday night Condell asked Plummer to go with him - he said they were to open the door of an empty house next door, and get in from the roof of the house; I went with them - Condell did not say I was to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Condell and Plummer go out on Sunday night? A, Yes; they came back, and said they had been to Mr. Wood's, but could not do it, as there were women about. On Monday we went and had tea at Condell's, when he asked Plummer to go; he said he did not mind; I and Harman went with them; we set out about eight o'clock or a little after - we went on to Thompson's, in Holborn, and there had some gin; Harman said she should like to go with them - Condell said he did not mind, and it was agreed we should all go together; we went straight to Mr. Wood's- I think it had struck nine when we got there; it was dark - I did not know the house; Condell pointed out the empty house, but did not go in then; we went and had some beer at a corner public-house, and staid there till about ten o'clock; we then came out, and walked up and down. - Condell said, "It is too soon yet;" we all four walked about till near twelve o'clock; Condell then opened the door of the empty house, with a crow-bar; there was no one about at that time; a coach was going by, which prevented the noise being heard - the door opened a little way, and they put in pieces of wood; Condell and Plummer went into the house - Harman and I staid outside - it was agreed before that we should not go in. The door was fastened after they went in - Harman tried it; we two then went straight home. We left our place again about four o'clock, and got there about five; they had not desired us to come back; we went of our own accord; it was them just daylight. We went up to the empty house; there was a coach going by at the time - Harman coughed, as a signal for them to come out, and they came out with two bundles; they said they contained lace; we passed over to St. John's-square; Plummer gave me one bundle, and Condell gave Harman the other; we took them to Condell's lodging; Harman said, when any one came by, "We had better make haste, or we shall be too late for the coach." We got to Condell's near upon six o'clock; Condell opened the bundles there - there was a great deal of lace, caps, and veils; there were three coats; Condell had one of the coats on when he came out of the house, and a pair of trousers on; there were three pairs of trousers; Plummer also had a pair of trousers on; there was some necklaces and bracelets; Harman gave me some of them - they opened them all, and put them into a box in the room; there was some lace, veils, and caps, tied in a yellow handkerchief; there was also two umbrellas; I went out, and pawned a pair of trousers, and Harman went and pawned a coat at Cameron's; I went into the shop, and Harman into the box; Condell asked me to pawn them - we went straight home to Condell's lodging. The officers came there as soon as we had done our breakfast; they handcuffed us three together, but Plummer was not there; he had gone out about two minutes before they came; Avis broke the box open, and Clements found the bundle. A man named Williams came there, and had some tea and gin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Nineteen last Saturday; I have come from the House of Correction; I have been there nine weeks; I am an unfortunate girl; I first told this story on Easter Saturday - I had then been in custody a week and a few days; I was the first to communicate it; the officers did not ask me to do it; I have no annuity, or any thing but what my mother sends me - she has 2l. a month for me, but keeps it till I am of age - Mr. Oliver pays it. I have come here to save myself, not to save my annuity; I know I should lose it if I was convicted. - Plummer is nineteen years old to-day.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long had you known Plummer? A. I had lived with him for twelve months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after they went into the house did you remain there? A. Five or ten minutes; we then went home, and when we went in the morning we waited about ten minutes before they came out.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. I think it must have taken them an hour to break into the house.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Tuesday morning, the 3d of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I and Clements went to Condell's lodging, in Grange-court, into the front parlour, on the right-hand; we found Condell, Harman, and Vandevelde there; I went up to Condell, said I wanted him, and handcuffed him; Clements took the others; I found a number of articles in this box (producing it) - I found a crow-bar, a picklock, a centre-bit, and punches - they are such tools as house-breakers use; it is not a complete set; I have had the property ever since. Condell said the box belonged to him; I asked him for the key - he said he had lost it, and that the box had been brought that morning, by two men, named Welch and Smith (Vandevelde was there); I asked Condell if he knew where they lived - he said No; he said the implements were brought in by the same men; I then got Mrs. Westcoat to search the women; she gave me a duplicate, which she said she took from Vandevelde - also a pair of bracelets, and in amber necklace; Vandevelde said Harman had given them to her - Condell was present. I also found in a cupboard in the room, some duplicates of lace, and different things.</p>

            . I live in Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell. I pawned this veil at Mr. Wood's on the 19th of March, for 5s. - I went for it again, and could not have it - I am certain this is it - I have the duplicate of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you know it by? A. The pattern - I did the hem of it myself, and know my work.</p>
               <p>Mr. WOOD. I know this umbrella very well, and have no doubt of this lace - I keep a duplicate on the goods. These duplicates, found at Condell's, were in my house on the Monday night.</p>

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Cameron. I took the trousers from Vandevelde, and gave her this duplicate.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AVIS. I found this pair of trousers on Plummer.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. I believe these trousers to be mine. I had several pairs of them - I cannot swear to them - no one article is worth 40s.</p>
               <p>M. A. VANDEVELDE. Plummer told me, when he came home, that he had got a pair of Mr. Wood's trousers on.</p>
               <p>PLUMMER's Defence. My Lord, I should wish respectfully to submit a few words, in pollution of the offence I am charged with. I have laboured hard through life, but I have had the misfortune to become acquainted with this wretched character, who is trying to swear away my life - I have kept her by my industry, little knowing her extravagant ways - she has had acquaintances at my lodgings, which I was utterly ignorant of. She has had a brother found guilty at this bar; another brother, a reputed thief, and herself, a common prostitute, I trust you will consider these things, and that she has been prompted to attempt to prove this to work my destruction.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Plummer a very good character.</p>

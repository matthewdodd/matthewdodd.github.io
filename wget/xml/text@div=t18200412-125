On the 21st of February the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for change for a 5 l. note for Mr. Field, of Addle-street, I will not be certain of his person, but am fully convinced he is the man. I asked if he would take four 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver? he said Yes, and I gave it to him so. I handed the note over to my son Charles, who wrote on it in my presence - (looks at one) - this is it. It has that address on it in my son's hand-writing.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. On the 4th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked the servant for change for a 1 l. note for Mr. Cox. I heard him, came into the shop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cox of Wilson-street?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes" - he is a bonnet-maker, and his men often come for change. I said I could not do it, unless he took 10 s. in copper. He hesitated, and then said he dare say it would do, he would take 10 s. worth. In the mean time I sent Mrs. Fortman next door with the note. He saw her go out, and I told him we always liked to ascertain whether a note was good - I put my initials on it before I sent it out - (looks at one) - this is it. When I said we liked to ascertain whether they were good, he said he would go and see whether Mr. Cox would take 10 s. worth of halfpence - he had agreed to take them before. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, stop a bit." He then run away, and I ran after him till I got into some ruins behind some houses; he had three or four pals waiting for him there - they kept close up to him, and I rather thought they were going to stop me. I thought it prudent to return - he had his coat off, his shirtsleeves turned up, and an apron on.</p>

Mr. Dimsdale immediately turned again, I had been obliged to go rather before him on account of the narrowness of the passage, and clasped his hands round me to guard my pocket and claps hold of an arm that he judged to be mine; he called out to know what I had lost, as did several others; I told him I believed a watch; I immediately looked and found I had lost my watch, I saw my watch again in the same passage, in the hands of Mr. King, he said, he took it on the prisoner; it was while the crowd was all thick about us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Litchfield, this passage was a good deal crowded? - It was, there was a good many people coming from a chapel.</p>

             a native of the town of Birmingham, being in London on the 25th of January, was passing Monkwell-street, having hold of my arm; just as we came to the passage it was narrow, we went off the foot path into the highway and she went before me because there was a great many people; there was a man and woman that seemed to jostle her about, I immediately said, what the duce are you at? she said, somebody had got their hand into her pocket, was picking her pocket; I immediately went to clasp my friend round to lay hold of her arm, and I immediately took the prisoner by the bare arm thinking I had hold of my friend's arm; in the mean time came up Mr. Byfeild, the clerk of the Chamberlain's-office, and said, what is the matter? I said, here is a person that has picked my friend's pocket, and Mr. King, of the Castle and Falcon, picked up the watch from the ground; then directly Mr. Byfeild and Mr. King produced this watch; I kept the woman's hand in my hand all the time, and we proceeded then to the Castle and Falcon, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman one of the persons that was jostling your friend? - So far as this, I got hold of her arm; there was a great crowd there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that woman take any active part in jostling of her for the purpose? - She did, she and the man that was beside of her, they appeared to me to be jostling of her more than the other people which were in the crowd; when we came to the Castle and Falcon, Mr. King sent for the constable of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. You was moving up the place, she was coming down? - I was close by the side of her almost.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said the pocket dropped? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think might be in the passage? - Some thirty or forty before and behind</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that somebody's hand was in her pocket, because she has told us a very different story? - She did not know at first it was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that watch shewn to the prosecutrix at the time? - It was, she said it was her own.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of this month, about a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty near the prosecutor's shop, which is at the back of Westbourne-ter-race, Paddington—one window looks into a mews—I heard somebody getting over the wall—I stopped about ten minutes or more, think<lb></lb>ing it was some one stealing plants—I then looked between the cre<lb></lb>vices of the shutters, and saw the prisoner in the middle of the shop with a light—I saw him take two planes, and put them into a bag which he had—after a while he looked about and got two more., and then took a saw off a nail in the wall—I thought he might be a man who was going to work, and I stood for a minute—at last I saw him get a hammer, a chisel, and a centre-bit or stock, and then put out the night—I expected him to open, the door and come into the mews, but he came up a ladder over the wall—he said, "Halloo," jumped from the wall, and ran away—I got over, and saw him on another wall, and When I got to that, he was over another—Iran after him for about ten minutes, across four or five gar<lb></lb>dens,</p>

               <p>over brick walls and fences, and at last caught him—I said, "What do you mean by thieving?"—he said he did not know, he must do some<lb></lb>thing to get a living—I saw him fling the property from him as I was run<lb></lb>ning after him—he had got through a window into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. James Peacock, who is a pianoforte-maker. On Friday, the 12th of May, I locked and fastened the shop door about half-past nine o'clock—my attention was drawn to it about six o'clock the following morning, by a policeman, and I then found it unlocked, and the window, which had been closed, pulled down and dipped on one side—there was no fastening to it—these tools were all safe in the shop the night before—these are my shoes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)—they were in the shop.</p>

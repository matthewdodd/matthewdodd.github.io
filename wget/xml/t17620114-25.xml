Mr. Bullock, a gold watch, which I put into my wife's muff, and secured it in the trunk.

            . I lived in Waterman's Lane, White Friers, in November last; the three prisoners lodged above me in the same house, the house of Mrs. Bailey; I used to light their fire every morning, and carry them up what they wanted. On the 23d of November, about half an hour after four, Brian and one Pallister came in loaded with some things; I heard both their voices; they staid above about three or four minutes, and went out again, and came in again exactly at five, with a box or trunk; I heard it strike against the cieling; at six they went down, and went out again; they came in again about two the next morning; I went up to wait on them as usual about eleven; there were Brian, Pallister, and one Duplex, they had got some silver buckles; they went out about eleven, and the next morning, about 3, I went up to wait on them; next morn. about eleven there came a Jew, he staid about half an hour, and went down with a great bundle on his back, tied about his head; then they call'd to me to bring them a candle, this was betwixt one and two in the day; there was no fire in their room, but that candle; then Pallister and Duplex went down, with each of them things in a handkerchief. Briant bid me light a fire; in ranking the ashes about, I saw a great many paper ashes; I found a paper with two corners burnt, and a card, with a direction on it for the Rev.

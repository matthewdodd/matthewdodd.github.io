I live at the Kale's Arms publics-house, Deptford—it is kept by my son—on Sunday night, 5th June, about 11 o'clock, I was putting up the shutters of the parlour window—the prisoner came up, with five or six others, and began to use bad language to me, and insulted me—my son Joseph came out to see what was the matter—my son asked what he was doing, and pushed him off the pathway into the road—the prisoner directly drew his knife and made a stab at me—James Cavell, a young man, drew me back, and the knife caught me a little below the groin—I have not had the use of my right leg since—the witness pulled me back, or I should have had the knife in my chest.</p>

I am a member of the Rojal College of Surgeom, at Deptford—on Sunday, 5th June, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was; called to attend Mr. Beech—I found him suffering from a punctured and slightly lacerated wound on the right thigh, a short distance from the groin—I dressed the wound—he has been suffering ever since—I did not probe the wound, and can't say how deep it was—if the knife had gone to the right instead of the left, fatal hemorrhage would have taken place—it was very close indeed to the artery—it was such a wound as a large knife would inflict.</p>

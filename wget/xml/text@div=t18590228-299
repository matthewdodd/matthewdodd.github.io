I am assistant to Charles Candy and another, of Watling-street, silk merchants—I know the prisoner from his coming to the warehouse before—on 31st January, between twenty minutes and a quarter to 9 in the morning he came just inside the door, and spoke to a young man, who called me, and as I had seen him before I pretty well</p>

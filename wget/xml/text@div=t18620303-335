                  </hi>. I live at 1, Albert-terrace, Wharf-road, Islington—I am a carman—on Friday, 21st February, about half-past 4, I was at the New Cattle-market—I saw the prisoner there—he was with a horse—I saw the deceased John Gould—he went up and spoke to the prisoner—I did not hear what was said, I was on the other side of the way—the prisoner knocked him on the nose with the end of his stick once or twice—Gould then walked away to the other side of the way—the prisoner untied his horse, which was tied up to the pens, and followed him, and said he would punch his b—head; and he called him a b—old rogue several times—Gould said he did not know as ever he <hi rend="italic">rogued</hi> him or anybody else—Gould was a farrier—the prisoner up with the end of the halter that he had hold of the horse with, and tried to put it round Gould's neck, and said, "I will hang you, you old b—, I will"—Gould said he would call the police<lb></lb>man, and the prisoner said, "Call the policeman; there he is"—Gould said he did not want to call the policeman if he would go on and not insult him; he had given him no cause to insult him—the prisoner directly up and shoved the stick in Gould's eye, and said, "Take that you old b—, do"—the stick went into Gould's left eye, between his nose and left eye—the prisoner had hold of the stick the whole time—it was a drover's stick; a little thin ash stick—a policeman was close handy—somebody called the policeman, and Gould gave the prisoner in charge—blood flowed from the wound; it came on to his cheek, and his eye swelled up very much directly after it was done—the policeman took the prisoner into custody, and took the stick from him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stick.</p>

               <p>were only their two selves and another man, who was standing with his back to them—I do not know what was the cause of the altercation between them—I could not hear what was said—I could not judge by their manner whether they were having angry words, I did not take that notice—Gould did not remain talking to him two minutes before he came over to me—I was rather better than the width of this court from them—when Gould came over to where I was he did not speak to me, nor I to him—the prisoner then came up; he spoke first, and called Gould a b—old rogue, and threatened to punch his head—Gould never made any answer—before he came over I saw the prisoner touch him on the nose with the stick—I thought they were only larking, because he did not hit him hard—nothing occurred beyoud what I have stated before the prisoner poked the stick in his eye—they were standing quite close together—Gould was right in front of the prisoner—he did not lift the stick as if to strike him; he deliberstly poked it in his eye—he held it in this way (<hi rend="italic">thrusting it</hi>)—he was leaning on the stick before, and had the horse in his other hand; the left hand—he brought the horse across with him—it is an ordinary drover's ash stick; it has a sharpish point—it is a common point, not made sharp—Gould did not fetch the policeman; he was close by, and somebody called, him—Gould walked to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller and live at 2, Roman-road, Caledonian-road, Islington—on Friday, 21st February, about half-past 4 o'clock, I was in the New Cattle-market—I saw the prisoner and the deceased there—I heard the prisoner say to Gould that he would knock his b—eye out, and he immediately ran the stick into his eye—he was close to him at the time—I was standing close to the deceased—I said, "You villain, you have knocked the man's eye out," or something to that effect, and I gave him into custody—it was done with a stick similar to this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on Saturday, 22d February the deceased was brought there—I examined him—he had a punctured wound in the corner of the left eyelid—I made no examination at the time as to the extent to which it penetrated—he died on Tuesday the 25th—he was not sensible when he was brought in—I made a post mortem examination—I found that the wound had penetrated altogther about four inches—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, which had produced paralysis—the brain itself was actually wounded—I believe a stick of this description would have inflicted the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the parts immediately in connection with the surface of the wound in a state of inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of inflammation, they were discoloured by extravasation of blood—it was impossible to tell from the external examination to what depth the wound extended—there was no doubt about it from the internal examination, because there was the track of the wound left by the instrument—it had not closed up at all—there was a track through which a probe was passed from the outside wound into the interior of the brain—the probe was not passed before the parts were opened, but afterwards—I am quite sure the probe did not cause any of it—I am able to say positively it was four inches in extent.</p>

On Monday, the 30th of April, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was at the White Lion public-house, High-street, St. Giles, both the prisoners were there; Driscoll asked me to give her a glass of gin, to which I agreed; the landlord refused to draw it; she and I left the house; Ragan did not go with us; we went to another public-house in St. Giles'; I gave her a glass of gin there; she asked if I had a handkerchief to sell her like one which I sold the servant of the White Lion a week before - I said I had; she said, "If you will come with me, I will look at them;" we left the house together, and went down <placeName id="t18270531-29-crimeloc150">Maynard-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. Quite so; I had been drinking after that, but not before I had my supper.</p>
               <p>Q. At what o'clock did you go to drink and have your supper? A. About a quarter to twelve - I went to bed at twelve - I was locked out of my lodgings, and slept in a room near the house I was robbed in - I had not been there before, and do not know whether it was the same house or not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310022"></xptr>- I found in the morning that it was Maynard-street, No. 9; I supped at the Castle inn, Oxford-street - I did not know, till morning, that I had slept in the same street - a woman said she would give me a bed, because she saw I was locked out - she was a stranger - I did not ask the prisoners to let me sleep there, or offer any one 2s. 6d. for a bed - I gave the woman 6d. for the bed - I was not with the prisoners half an hour altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not sleep in the very same room? A. I could not swear about it, as I did not take notice of the room - I had dined before the prisoners met me, and drank half a pint of beer, but no spirits - I treated Driscoll with two-penny worth of gin at the public-house, and had one penny worth of beer myself - she asked me to treat her, and stood at the door talking to a person, while I was at the bar - I showed them all my goods - they examined them for about five minutes - I never let go of the bundle while they were robbing me - I did not see the goods taken, but when I opened the bundle I missed them; I used to see Driscoll at the White Lion before, but never saw the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you went home to sup after being robbed? A. After being robbed; I was robbed about half-past six.</p>

I am married, and live at 19, John's Plaee, Commercial Road, Stepney—the prisoner and the deceased lived with me nine months, all but a few days, as man and wife—on the night of 23rd September they came home about 12. 10 or 12. 15—they had been to a raffle and had been drinking—as she came through the passage she was bleeding from the back of her head, and her hair was all loose about her; and as she went along the passage the blood went along—she said "He has hit me out of doors, and knocked me against the kerb, look at my head"—I said to him "Have you done that, Charley?"—he said "No, I only shoved her and she fell"—they went up stairs—I heard them quarrelling, and I heard some<lb></lb>thing fall very heavily—I went up and saw them having hold of each other, quarrelling in the room; they had knocked a chair over—I got between them, and said "Don't I be quiet!"—I was shoved on one side, and with that the candlestick fell off the table, and it was dark, but he had her between him and the window, and I saw her hair go right through the sash of the window; it broke three panes of glass—she said "You have hit me again"—he said "Open the door for me, Norah, she has stabbed me"—the door</p>

On the night of 28th September, I went and saw Hurley at the London Hospital—he was in a very weak state, and stated that he thought he was dying, and he wished to make a statement—I took it down in writing, this is it, he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I believe I am in a dying state. On Tuesday night last, about 12 o'clock, I was at the Nelson Street end of Baker Street, in company with Mary Ann Oaks—some words arose between us and she tried to tear my clothes; I pushed her, and she fell and cut her head against a kerb-stone—I picked her up; some policeman came up and got her in doors with me; I got her up stairs—the landlady and her cousin came up, and I said "This is the old game again. She rushed at me 'and I pushed her against the window; she then turned round and caught up the table knife and stabbed me through the neck. I then ran out of the house up various places and jumped into the barrow, and asked some one to bring me here. This is the third time she has stabbed me, once in the eye, and once in the chest.

He got drunk and kicked me, saying I had been with a fellow. He said he would kill me or I kill him, and he beat me till I could not stand; my eye was black, my nose broken, and my face bruised this was on the night. The last punch in the nose knocked me through the window. I took up a knife from the table, and said I would stick him if he <hi rend="italic">whacked</hi> me again. He ran to the stairs. I said 'Come back. 'He said 'I am stabbed 1' and I saw no more of him."</p>

            . Q. Have you a house No. 27, Surry-street - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of September last, was that house under repair - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of the day had you been in the house superintending the work - A. Yes; several times. I was there while the workmen were there. A quarter before eight, I went there to see if all was safe. No. 27 and 28, both the houses join backwards. I entered the house 28, I heard a noise over head. There is a room that Mrs. Howell always had projects into my house; there is a door which has communication to my house from hers; there had been a new door fixed up.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of September? my question is whether there was any door which by being opened would communicate from one house to the other - A. There was a door on the two pair of stairs, which was not in the house, by which you might go from one house to the other upon that door being opened; the door was fastened up, till this time, nailed up; it was considered as a party partition, and nailed up not to be used. Upon my hearing this noise, I went into Mrs. Howell's house to desire some friends to give the alarm that there were thieves in the house. Mr. Howell and I were providing ourselves with weapons. After having done so, I went out at Mrs. Howell's front door; young Mr. Howell was just before me; Mrs. Howell I believe, was standing at the door. She saw the two persons come out. When I got out at the front door, I was informed that somebody had gone away. I pursued Beck up Strand-lane, into the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. The front of the house is in Surry-street - A. It is. He went up Surry-street; I did not get sight of him until I found him in the possession of one of the witnesses,

I saw him stoop, on his stooping I saw a boy pick up something when he was stooping. I did not see him drop it. I suppose he put his hand on the ground, and laid it there.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was it picked up - A. I cannot say. I saw his hand close to the ground. They key was picked up close by the side of his heel; the key was laying as if it dropped before him; he was stooping that very moment. It is a skeleton key, which fits the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find by what means the thieves got access into Mrs. Howell's house - A. They had broken down the door. They had got into my house, and broken the door that I mentioned before. That skeleton key would open my front door.</p>
               <p>COURT. They opened your door by that skeleton key, they got into Mrs. Howell's by opening the door on the two pair of stairs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you find any of the stolen property in your house - A. It was found before I went back. A crow was found in the house. I saw the crow that was said to be found there. I was at the office when Griffiths was brought there.</p>

He came into my front parlour and alarmed me that there were thieves.

            . I ran out of the house at the alarm given by Mr. Wilson. I saw two men come out of Mr. Wilson's house, one of them passed me close; he took up Howard-street, that leads to the temple, he was walking very fast; I took hold of his coat, my sister was by my side. We were close together, and finding he was laid hold of, he turned round, and looked me in the face. I perfectly saw his countenance; I saw his face by the fineness of the evening, and the lamp very near me at the corner house. After he looked me in the face he ran off, up Howard-street, followed by my sister, brother, and myself; my sister pointed him out to my brother I heard her say, that is the man I laid hold off; that man she pointed out. I continued the pursuit as far as Arundle-street, my brother and sister went on. In a few minutes, the man was brought down. That was the same man; I recognized him immediately he was brought into my mother's house. That is the prisoner Griffiths.</p>

We did; upon going out, my sister told me that one of the men that came out of the house, turned down Howard-street; upon which I ran into Howard-street, there I saw another of my sisters, who pointed out Griffiths. I pursued Griffiths; he ran, and I ran after him; I gained ground upon him; when I came near him, he turned round, and said, if you come near me I will knock you down. I still got nearer to him; he kept running all the time. I came up with him in Grey-hound Court; I there took him;

When they came out, I said to them, who are you, one of them said, who are you. He crossed towards Howard-street. The other went through the arch way, towards Strand-lane. It appeared to me, that they dropped something at the door, as one was coming out of the door. I saw the prisoner's arm make a motion, the arm gave a jerk at the door; I thought he dropped something by the motion of the arm at that spot my mistress picked up a bag<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260045"></xptr>my mistress gave me the bag; I took it in doors.

            . That bag of clothes was taken to Bow Street, and given to the constable afterwards. That was the first thing that shewed us our house had been robbed, by the young ladies dresses, The two men were brought back immediately afterwards, and Griffiths was brought into the house,</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, did you know him again - A. Yes I did; he was one of the two men that I had seen come out of the house.

I noticed Griffiths the most. It was a fine light night, I have no doubt of the other. At Bow Street I swore to Griffiths, by his features; to Beck by his dress and appearance.

Miss Howell ran over to me and asked my assistance in catching the thief, saying, he was in the next house to Mrs. Howells. I saw the two men come out of that house. Hary Griffiths passed about a yard from me, and the other about two yards. Griffiths run towards Howard street, and Beck run up Surry Street, through an arch-way, which leads into Strand-lane. I pursued Beck, he was crying stop thief lustily. Beck ran through the Arch-way into Strand-lane; he crossed the Strand, and ran into Newcastle Street, I kept within a yard and a half of him all the way; he knocked a person down in Newcastle-street, that person never left hold of him. I came up, and caught hold of his wrist. I am quite certain he is one of the two men that came out of the house. I never lost sight of him; he resisted violently while I had hold of him.

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Limbrick. When you went to Mrs. Howel's house, did you go to Mr. Wilson's house - A. Yes, I examined the door by which they were suspected to enter. I found the door had been nailed up, and two or three of the nails were pushed off one side. The nails had been partly driven in and turned down on one side; the door had been forced open on Mr. Wilson's side; by forcing the nails up; there were marks of the nails being forced up; it did not want much force to get the nails up, it had been done on Mr. Wilson's s side. I found this crow lying down by the drawers; the drawers had opened by the crow, and the crow appeard to have been left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260046"></xptr>behind in Mrs. Howell's room.

               <p>Beck's Defence. Does it stand to reason that I could put my arms down to drop a key on the ground when there were twenty or more people around me. I cried stop thief all the way I heard the mob coming up Strand-lane, and the key that was found on me was the key of my room door, it was given me by my landlord.</p>
               <p>Griffiths's Defence. I was in hopes of bringing forward a respectable witness to prove that I was in his company a few moments of my being taken in custody; I left him because I had some business to do on the other side of the water. I was going from Temple-bar to Arundel-street, and on my going through the arch-way there was a cry of stop thief, and as I came along Mr. Hamblen said stop: I stopped; a minute or more elapsed before Mr. Howell came up: he said, you are one of them. I said, do not accost me in that way, I will knock you down if you do. Gentlemen of the Jury, there are two men charged in this indictment; whether one or both are guilty is for you to determinate: if any doubt should arise in your minds on that point, it is better that ten guilty men should escape punishment, than one innocent man should suffer. I have made every enquiry in my power to get my friend to come forward to prove I was in his company: he is gone down I find to Saffron Walden fair with horses; I cannot have the benefit of his testimony.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live near Prince's-Risboro, Bucks. On 9th August I was at work in the field of Mr. Hodgson, at Greenhill, in the parish of Harrow—the prisoner was at work there with me—his wife came to him after we had finished our work—she wanted money of him—he offered her five shillings—she said that was of no use to her; her children and her had not any bread—she would not take it—we then went to a beer-shop, and had one pint of beer—we then left and went on to Sudbury for another job of work—the prisoner walked on the road before me, and his wife along with him—I was about twenty yards from them—I did not hear what they were saying—they were talking, and appeared to be quarrelling—when they had got about a furlong from the public-house, the woman ran across the road; the prisoner followed her with a scythe in his hand—the scythe had a green brier or a bridle upon it—this is the scythe(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bridle was nut cut through before this happened, but I looked at it directly afterwards, and it was then cut through as it is now—the prisoner struck the deceased with the scythe on the head—she rather dropped on her knee—he only struck her once—she said, "I am murdered by my husband!" and the prisoner said, "I have killed my poor wife!"—I remained with the woman—she was bleeding very much—the prisoner went for a doctor and returned with him in about five minutes—the deceased had been taking some beer, and I think it had taken some effect upon her, and also on the prisoner—they had nothing but beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Harrow. On Friday, 9th Aug. I was called by the prisoner—he was so confused that I did not understand at all from him what I was to do—he did not tell me who had been hurt—I went with him directly to the public high-road, and saw the deceased sitting on the raised pathway—her cap and bonnet were off; her head was covered with blood, and the blood was flowing profusely from an incised wound on the left</p>

               <p>side of the head; it was four or five inches long, and extended from the fore part backwards—I removed the hair; the scalp was completely cut through; the upper table of the skull was cut through in a corresponding line with the external flesh wound, and much about the same length—I sponged and dressed the wound, and had her taken home to her own residence—after the first few days she went on favourably, and continued to do so for some time—she was in danger for the first eight or ten days—she continued to improve for some twelve days afterwards, and then some serious symptoms set in, and she became comatose and incoherent, and eventually died on Sunday morning, 1st Sept.—I attended her daily, occasionally twice a day, and sometimes three times—a female attended upon her the whole time, and proper attention was paid to her—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was a fracture of the inner table of the skull, in a line corresponding with the cut on the external table—the fracture that caused the death was such as might have been inflicted by this scythe; there was also an abscess in the posterior lobe of the brain—I ascribe the death to the fracture of the skull, with the abscess in the brain resulting from the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he had struck her with such an instrument, do not you think the injury would have been greater? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend upon the violence with which the blow was struck—it might have been greater, but I have no doubt the injury was caused by such a blow—I do not think such a wound would be made by the instrument coming down on the head in the man's hand, protected as it was by the brier, and it had cut through the bonnet, cap, and a great mass of hair, besides the scalp—when I first examined the woman I perceived that she had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it appear that the blade had cut through the bridle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it appeared to me as though it had been turned aside—I have no doubt the brier was on the edge at the time, and when the blow was given it got turned aside—I do not think it first broke through the brier and then pierced her head.</p>

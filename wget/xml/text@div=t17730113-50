            . I attend at Justice Wilmot's; I found four plates, a table cloth, four bottles of rum, a dark lanthorn, a chissel and a cutlass, last night was a week at Richardson's. (The plates produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Three of them have my marks, some of them I had not marked.</p>
               <p>Flanagan. Richardson and this other man had two rooms; they are both upon one floor; Richardson, and Meakham, and Meakham's wife were all together there. Richardson begged very hard to be taken before the Justice to be admitted an evidence; we took him to Mr. Wilmot's, and there he spoke freely about robbing Mr. Summers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no promise of pardon?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no expectation at that time that he should be admitted a witness?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; Mr. Wilmot told him he should not; he said these plates belonged to Mr. Summers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that?</p>

               <p>Flanagan. The night he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. And there was no treaty at that time about making him a witness?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; when we took him in bed he begged to be taken to the Justice to be admitted an evidence; we told him he should be taken before the Justice and hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise made him?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. No; I was present all the time: Meakham and his wife both said this was their tablecloth when we found it.</p>
               <p>Richardson. They made me drunk; all the way they said I should be an evidence if I would bring any body into the scrape.</p>
               <p>Flanagan. We did not.</p>
               <p>Richardson. In what room did I lie?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. In the further room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the things?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. In the hithermost room, and there was a bowl with four or five shillings worth of halfpence; he came into the room and took them out and said they were his.</p>

               <p>Wilson. Between four and five; I was awake when they were getting the goods out; I heard the copper pots, that disturbed me; I got out of bed and went down a little after five; then I saw the house was broke open; the sash was up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177301130030"></xptr> but the window shutters were put close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part appear to be broke?</p>


               <p>Wilson. The shutters which were new were forced open, the main part of the bolt was bent double almost; I thought they were in the house; the watchman called me at five as he commonly does; I searched the house and missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). All but the tea chest was in a little room called the kitchen; the tea chest was in the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I gave information at Justice Wilmot's of the robbery and of the men I suspected. I was sent for when they were taken; I heard them acknowledge they had robbed the house; I heard Mr. Wilmot ask them whether the rum belonged to me or the man at the Cock; they said they believed some of both; they said very little before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Richardson; the other said nothing. Richardson and another man were drinking at my house almost all the evening, till I went to bed; I cannot swear whether that man was Meakham; it was a man taller than himself. I found my house dog dead at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they say any thing before the Justice that you observed?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. Richardson said they broke the house open, and this was the chissel they broke it open with?</p>

               <p>Q. What house was he speaking of then?</p>
               <p>Flanagan. The Two Brewers in Brick-lane, Mr. Wilson's. When he could not be admitted an evidence, he said if he could not clear himself, he did not mind being hanged if he could clear Meakham. He told the Justice just as he was going to be committed, if he would make him an evidence, he would produce three that had broke open several houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no promise thrown out to him of any sort?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Richardson made no defence.</p>

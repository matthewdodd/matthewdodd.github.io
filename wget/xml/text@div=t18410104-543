On the 18th of Decem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner came to my house—another man asked in his presence if I could let his friend, meaning the prisoner, sleep there—I said "Yes"—one of them gave me a bag—the prisoner staid in the house—he came in and out several times, and staid in the parlour—in the evening my husband went to bed—I took the candle up, and attempted to get into the bed-room, and could not unlock the door—I had been there about five minutes previous, and it was right—I had left it locked—the prisoner was then in his own room, not that room—I sent for a policeman—he and Mr. Stodgell went into the prisoner's bed-room, and told him he could not sleep there—after he was dressed I went and asked him whether he intended to murder me and my children, and who and what he was—he said he was a rogue, and those that sent him were greater rogues than himself, and he was led into it like a lamb to the slaughter—the constable found a dark lantern, three pick-lock keys, and three skeleton keys—my husband broke open the bed-room door—the carpet-bag was given to the officer—something had been attempted at the bed-room door—I am sure there had been no other person at the lock—there was no other lodger in the house.</p>

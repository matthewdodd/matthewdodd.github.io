On the night of the 9th of June I locked up twenty-four ducks, close to the house, and next morning, about half-past four o'clock, I got up to let them out; I saw six tiles had been taken off the out-house, and missed fourteen ducks, and this basket; I told my fellow servants of it; I saw the ducks on the Monday following, and the basket with them - they were then dead, and some of them were picked; I could swear to two of them, and know the basket well.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 10th of June, I met the prisoner between Primrose-hill and the Regent's-park, near Camden-town; he had this basket on his shoulder - the blood was running out of it; I asked what he had got - he said nothing - I took him to the watch-house - the keeper found fourteen ducks in the basket, quite warm - they appeared just killed - some of them were picked.</p>

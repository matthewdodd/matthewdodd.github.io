On 6th Feb., the prisoner came to my house about 10 o'clock in the evening; she asked me for a penny<lb></lb>worth of gin; I served her, and she gave me a shilling—I found it to be bad in a moment—I said, "This makes the third one you have given us"—she said, "Pray don't lock me up, I have got a baby four months old"—I gave the shilling to the policeman; he marked it with my penknife—I gave him the other two shillings; he took them to the police station and marked them there—I got the other two shillings off the shelf in the back parlour; I saw my wife place them there.</p>

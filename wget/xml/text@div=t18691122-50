                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at 1, London Place, St. George's-in-the-East—on 12th November, I saw the prisoner and two others in Pennington Street—I saw them knock the prosecutor, James Moore, down—he was a seaman—I saw them take his money from him—I was by myself, and therefore I did not interfere, but I followed them—I could not swear that the prisoner struck him—the man fell against the wall—I saw them take the money from his pockets—I saw the money—they were all engaged in it; the prisoner as well as the rest—I followed them along the street—I was about ten yards behind them—I met a policeman, and the prisoner crossed the road, and looked into a beer-shop window—I pointed him out, and the policeman took him into custody—I lost sight of the others—I never lost sight of the prisoner at all—I am quite sure that he is the man—the policeman said to the prisoner, "I want you," and then he told me to run and catch the others—the prisoner said nothing.</p>

On 12th of this month I was on duty in St. George Street—the last witness came to me and pointed out three men—they were about ten yards from him—the prisoner was one of the men—I took him into custody, and told the witness to follow the others—they run away then—I told the prisoner he would be charged with rob<lb></lb>bing</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to John Nutt Sayer, a printer, in East-street, Manchester-square. On the first of March I saw the prisoner on the second floor of the house—she was a stranger and had no business there—I followed her, and she went down the yard—soon after I went out for milk, and as I came out of the milk-shop she passed me—I looked at her and she at me—I went home, and went up to my mistress, and heard the table-cloth was missed—I ran out down Halford-mews, and saw the prisoner—I called her, and said, "If you please, will you give me that table-cloth?"—she went out of the mews, and turned the corner—a man asked me what I wanted with her—I told him, and she went up another mews—the man went and took the table-cloth from her, and I went for the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Fee, a hatter, in Orange-street, Southwark. On the morning of 18th Sept I had been up all night with a neighbour who was ill—I was in an upper room, and about quarter past 5 o'clock that morning I heard a great disturbance in the street, and a woman making a great noise—I opened the window, and saw a woman standing under the window with a bonnet in her hand—I afterwards saw a woman in the act of lifting mud from the street with her hand and throwing it at the prisoner—it turned out to be the dead woman, Mary Ann Latimer—she was taking up mud and oyster shells, and what she could get, and throwing them at the prisoner, and calling him dreadful names, using dreadful language—I have seen him as a neighbour—he and this woman lived together—she called him a thief, and she called "Mr. Black, come down, he has stolen your shirt, and he has stolen three pairs of boots, too"—when she said this, she was running towards him with the mud in her hand, and throwing the mud over him—the prisoner went into the house, and she then ran and called Mr. Black, and said he stole his shirt, and three pairs of boots—the prisoner came out again, and she called him a b—y English <hi rend="italic">Sossener</hi>, and she turned up her sleeves as if turning them up to fight—she said, "I am a b—y lion, and I will tear your liver out"—she was then with her fists doubled, and her sleeves turned up, and was very near to him—up to this time, the prisoner had done nothing at all to her—he did not call her anything—I never heard him speak—on her using this threat, he raised his hand straight, as if he were going to hit her a blow, and he struck or pushed her, I cannot say which, but she reeled, and fell—she turned on her side, and her head struck against the iron post, at the corner of the street, on the kerb stone—I came down and went to her assistance—I lifted her up—she appeared quite lifeless—I put my hand on her chest, she appeared to have no pulsation—I put my hand to her forehead, and it was cold—I looked at her right hand, and there was a little blood—the prisoner struck her with his hand closed—I cannot say whether it was a push or a blow—I thought she was hit, as she fell—the prisoner went away as she fell—a policeman was called after some time—I heard the prisoner say she was not his wife, and that he had lived six months with her—I had not heard anything in their room before this—I had not opened the window—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about her brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Ewer-street. At half past 4 o'clock that morning I was standing at the corner of Norfolk-street—there was a disturbance between the prisoner and the deceased—I did not know either of them—the woman was using very bad language, and she likewise went and got mud and oyster shells, and was throwing them at the prisoner, striking him several times, and laying hold of him, and shaking him—he said, "If you don't go away from me, I will be forced to hit you"—she said, "I will have satisfaction for your knocking me about; I will go and fetch my brother from Spitalfields"—he said, "Before You have satis<lb></lb>faction of me, I shall have it of you," and with that he struck a blow at the back of her ear—she fell, with her back against the post, and her head against the kerb stone—she had nothing on her head—she gave a female her bonnet to hold—her cuffs were turned up—there were no other blows but one—I went to see for a policeman—I could not find one—I met the prisoner running down—the woman was drunk—the prisoner was solid and sober.</p>

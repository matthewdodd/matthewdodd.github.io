            . On the 26th of February, about 3 in the morning, I was coming from the city-home to King-street, Seven Dials; I met with the prisoner in Palsgrave-head Court, she took hold on my arm, I ask'd her what she did there so late, she said she could not help it, she was poor, and asked me to give her a shilling, which I did, thro' good nature, then I gave her another.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it you gave her the second shilling?</p>
               <p>Scheult. It was in less than a quarter of an hour after; I ask'd her what her name was, and where she liv'd? she said her name was

               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Scheult. I was not quite sober, I was a little merry; I had receiv'd that money about eight in the evening before, in Leadenhall-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Salutation, in Princes-street, Blackfrian. On 21st June the prisoner came there dressed as he is now, as a sailor—he called for a pint of porter, and gave a half crown—I tried it, and found it bad; I asked him where he got it—he said from his shipmate, on board a ship at St. Katharine's Docks—he afterwards said it was at the West India Docks, and he came from Switzerland—I asked him the name of the ship—he said he did not know—I sent for an officer, and gave him the half crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at Hammersmith. On 8th July the prisoner came to my shop, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening for two penny cigars—I gave them to him—he gave me half a crown—I saw it was bad, but I gave him the change, and said nothing about it—I put on my hat and followed him, to see if he passed any more—he turned down by the Black Lion, which leads out of the main road—he did not call anywhere, but came round into the main road, and went on his way towards town—I spoke to a constable—I afterwards saw the prisoner getting on an omnibus, and the constable took him—I kept the half crown in my hand till I got to the station—I marked it, and gave it to the constable—when the prisoner came back into the main road he went into one shop and had a pie, and into another shop and had some porter.</p>

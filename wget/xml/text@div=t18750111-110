I am a tobacconist, of 41, Great Smith Street—I saw the prisoner come in; his manner was suspicious, and I looked at him particularly—when another customer had taken up his change for a half-sovereign, I saw the prisoner put a florin into my man's hand, who rang it on the counter, bent it in the detector, and then passed it to me and said that it was bad—I asked the prisoner what he meant by passing such money as that; he said "It must have been some of the change you gave for the half-sovereign"—he could only find a penny in his pocket—I gave the coin back to him, and he made a rush to the door—I detained him by force.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 28.) On the 6th of Jan., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went with Morton and Baker, two other constables, to No. 3. North-street, Lock's-fields—on entering the house we got to the top of the stairs, and entered a small back room in which were the three prisoners—Prince was standing at an open cup-board near the fireplace—the two others were at the stove, in which was a good fire—the cupboard is quite close to the stove—there was a sort of bed in the room—it was only a quantity of shavings with some rags and things—we took hold of Prince—he made a violent struggle to get his arms loose—we were obliged to have him down on his back on the floor—he made a violent effort to get his right hand into his right waistcoat pocket—Morton took hold of the pocket—it was rather ragged, and he tore it off altogether—I saw Jones making to the cupboard and called to Baker to secure her—he took hold of her while she was in the act of extending her hand to the cupboard—Baker seized her and took hold of a mould that was in the cupboard—Prince said then, "You have got all, and enough too"—Jones said, "I think so, too"—I searched the cupboard and found in it a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece of 1843—one of these files I found in the cupboard, and the other on the mantelpiece—this pipkin I found near the fireplace at the bottom of the cupboard, with some pieces of metal in it, and some plaster of Paris in this paper—I saw some small particles of metal near the fireplace below the grate, on the floor—there was no fender to the stove—the pieces of metal were on the stone, part underneath the stove—Whaley was in the room all this time—she remained where she was, near the stove—I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 289.) I watched this house on the evening in question for about two hours before we went in, from between five and six o'clock—I did not see any of the prisoners go in during that period—I have known Prince and Jones, and have frequently seen them together—I have seen them go into that house, No. 3—I accom-panied Fraser to the back room, first floor—I saw Prince standing against the cupboard—he made a startle—I instantly went and seized his hand—he drew his hand to his right-hand waistcoat pocket—with the assistance of the others I seized him—he resisted very much—we threw him down—I perceived that he wanted to get something out of his pocket—I immediately caught hold of the bottom of the pocket—I felt something small and hard in it, and in the struggle I tore the pocket off—I called Baker to my assistance, while I examined it, and found these four 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—just about the same time, or a little after, Baker, who had gone to the cup-board, said, "I have found a mould"—Prince said, "You have got all now, and enough too"—Jones said, "I think so too"—Whaley said, "I don't know what this all means, I have only just come in"—I have seen Whaley frequently in company with Jones in the Walworth-road.</p>

I accompanied the other police-men to North-street—when I got into the room, I saw Jones make to-wards the cupboard—I put my hand against her, and told her to keep back—I immediately looked in the cupboard, and found this mould for groats, this white-metal spoon, and this piece of tin, and this piece of metal I found in the mould—I found one 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, of the date of 1843, on the floor—after I took the mould from the cupboard, and the other things, Prince said, "You have got all," and Jones said, "And enough too."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of coin to her Majesty's Mint, and have been so for many years. These are counterfeit groats, all cast in the same mould—these other two groats are the same in all respects—(<hi rend="italic">examining the articles produced</hi>)—this is a plaster-of-Paris mould, which appears to be constructed for the casting of counterfeit groatssimilar to these, and they appear to have been cast in this mould which is complete on both sides—this piece of metal is what is calleda get, which fills up the channel of the mould, down which the metalruns while in a fluid state—here is part of a Britannia-metal spoon, part of which has been melted, and it is a similar metal from whichthe groats are cast—this pipkin might answer the purpose of fluxing the metal—here is some plaster-of-Paris in powder—that is the samematerial of which the mould is constructed—here are two small files, which are usually applied for the purpose of removing any surplus metalfrom the edge of the pieces when cast—they have white metal in theteeth, and appear to have been so used—this tin band is for the purpose offorming the mould; it confines the plaster while in a fluid state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you form any judgment how long these half-dozen coins had been cast? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form any exact notion; I should say not many days, four or five on the outside—the metal, when exposed to the air, oxydates considerably, and no oxydation has taken place—I saw them yesterday for the first time—if they are wrapped up in paper, and kept from the air, the oxydation does not go on so rapidly—I judge of them as they would have been on the 6th of Jan. pretty much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prince's Defence.</hi> On Saturday night I found all these things in an old handkerchief in Locks-fields; I was foolish enough to take them home and to tell several people that I had found them, and had them in my pos-session—I suppose some of those persons gave information to the police, for the sake of getting something for their trouble; but if they had known anything of the sort before, all the police have known me for years, and they would have searched my place; I was never taken up but once, and then I was acquitted at the police court. If I had been in the habit of using these things, I should have had a more secure place for them than the middle shelf of the cupboard, where anybody opening the door could see them; and had I been making these things the metal would have been in a liquid state, instead of which it was hard and in pieces, exactly as I found them. I declare I am innocent of making either the coins or the mould; neither of these females even knew I had these things in my possession; Jones asked me what they were, but I never satisfied her; the handkerchief they were in was an old piece of black handkerchief, which I burnt on the Monday afternoon; I sell things in the street for my living.</p>

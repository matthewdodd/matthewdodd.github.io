I have served the landlord of that house, with corn and coals, for some years; I went to this house about four o'clock, and had some porter; Mrs. Kingsbury told me I had got a hat, and they took it from me; but whether it was put there as a trick or not, I cannot say; I don't know how it came there.</p>

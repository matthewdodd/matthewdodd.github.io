               <p>REBECCA MOORE. On the day in the indictment the prisoner came to the shop. I had known that he was the <rs id="t18160918-118-deflabel615" type="occupation">servant</rs>

He asked me if Mrs. Taylor was within. I told him she was, and he asked me to lend him eleven shillings for Mr. Backler, to pay the carriage of goods, lying at Wood-street, which had come from the Duke of Norfolk's. I lent him eleven shillings upon that. Mrs. Backler was a customer of ours, and we knew her. He came again on Thursday the 25th of July, bringing with him a paper, apparently a bill for the carriage of goods. The amount was one pound nine shillings and a penny, and underneath was written in pencil, "received one pound," and he asked me to lend him nine shillings and a penny, to pay for the carriage of goods lying at Wood-street, and I did so; fearing that it might not have been right, I wrote to Mrs. Backler, and she sent a verbal message. On Monday the 29th, the prisoner came to the house again, and asked for a one pound note for Mr. Backler, who, he said, was waiting in Gracechurch-street for it. I did not let him have it, but I gave an alarm, and he was laid hold of immediately.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BACKLER. The prisoner was formerly in my employment. I had no goods come to London from the Duke of Norfolk. I expected no such goods. I never authorised the prisoner to get this money.</p>

            . I lost these things in April last, the Prisoner lodged in my house; I had other lodgers, but missing several things, I turned them away; when they were gone I looked over my things, and missing more I charged her with them; said I, no body can have them but you; she sell a crying, and said, if I would forgive her, she would bring me my mob in a very little time; she brought the mob, and said she would bring the rest the next day. I missed a tea-kettle the day following, and before I came down she had put on my cloak, apron, and shift, and went away; I found her that night near Bond-street, and she had all the things upon her back; when I asked her for the things, she run out into the street, and said, D - n you, you b - h, if you offer to touch me, I'll swear a street robbery against you, and buy twenty times as much with the reward. I found her afterwards in Covent garden, with the apron on, but she had made away with the shift; I asked her what made her take the things, and she said she took them to dress herself up to be a whore, called me b - h, and used me very ill; I never went after her any more, for she belonged to a gang that I was afraid of; one who lodged in my house saw her come into a pawn broker's, where she had pawned my tea-kettle, and borrow six-pence more upon it.</p>

            . The Prosecutrix is a very bad woman, and makes it her business to indict people to extort money from them; she bears such a character, that she is not to be believed upon oath, and I have witnesses to prove it. I have known the Prisoner from a child, and her parents were honest, creditable people.</p>

            . The Prisoner lived with me; I am sensible she was indicted, because the Prosecutrix could not get her to swear for her in her base Prosecutions: she bears as vile a character as any woman in England, and the Prisoner bears a very good character.

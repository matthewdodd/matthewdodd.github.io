                  </hi>. I am an outfitter in Parson-street, Ratcliffe-high<lb></lb>way. On the 26th of January, about half-past two in the afternoon, the prisoners came and asked if I would cash their notes—I knew Hartman before, but not Summers—I asked Hartman who Summers was—Hartman said he had shipped him—Summers said yes, be shipped him, and he paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked Summers (who described himself as Brown,) where the ship was, and he said at Deptford—Hartman produced two notes from his pocket—he said he shipped both men—I asked Summers where he got the notes from—he said</p>

               <p>he had shipped to-day, had signed articles on board, and that was his note—Hartman was standing by at the time—I asked bow much he wanted on his note, he said 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I said it was too much—he said he wanted to buy some tools—I told him I had got plenty of tools, and he picked out 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of tools, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth of clothes, and wanted the rest in money—I asked where his clothes were—he said his tools were on board, he had been working there three weeks already, but his clothes were with Hartman in the house—I asked Hartman if that was true, he said, "Yes"—they came back about six or half-past—I had told him before, he should bring his clothes to my house for security—he said he told the waterman not to bring his clothes on board, but he had brought them on board this afternoon—I said he should endorse the note to me—he said at first he could not write—I asked him who wrote the articles—he said, "I wrote the articles on board"—I said, "Well, write the same name as you wrote to the articles," and he wrote his name on the back—I saw it was a lie, and asked if he had change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note—he said no—I went out as if to get it, got a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

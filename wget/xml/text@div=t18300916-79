On the 3rd of September my servant took some beer out at nine o'clock in the evening - she ran back, and gave me orders for a bottle of gin, a pint of rum, and change for a sovereign - I took a sovereign out of my pocket, and sent her for change; she took the change and the articles from me.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's employ. I took out my beer, and went to Lord Cathcart's, No. 3, Cumberlund-place - I left some beer there, and as I was coming back the prisoner met me, and asked if I served No. 3; I said Yes - he said I was to bring two pints of beer, with the liquor stated, and change for a sovereign; I went to my master, who gave me a sovereign - I got change, and took the articles to the house; I saw the prisoner at the door; he asked if I had the change - I said Yes; he said, "Give it to me and the bottles, and I will put them into my pocket" - I said, "You had better come in," but he refused; I gave him the change, and he put into my hand a King William's medal, instead of a sovereign, and ran away - I followed him; he took the bottles from his pocket, threw them down, and broke them - I called Stop thief! two men took hold of him, and held him - I came up, and gave him in charge of the Police; he said if I would let him go he would give me the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did he tell you? A. He said he was going to have a party with the servants, and told me to take the beer down; he put the bottles into his pocket - two men came up after he was taken, and wanted me to give them the piece of coin which he gave me, and asked me to let him go.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the top of Great Cumberland-street; I ran down - the girl had the prisoner, and stated what she has now; the prisoner did not deny it, but said it was a lark - I took him into a shop, found the change, and nine keys on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Bartholomew-fair, and from there to the Waterloo Arms; I drank freely - I called at a booking-office in Oxford-street, and drank with a friend; as I came out I stood looking at a scuffle, and a very respectable young man said to me, "This is something like Bartholomew-fair" - I got into conversation, and asked if he knew of any situation; he said, "I am going to No. 3, Cumberland-place to night, the servants will have a few friends, the butler is a good sort of a man, he will, perhaps, do something for you" - we went on to the corner of Cumberland-place, and the witness was going with some beer to the door; he said, "We wont go in without something, go and order some spirits" - I gave the order, and when it came, he said, "If you will go up, here is the sovereign;" and he put that piece into my hand - I gave it to the witness, and, I believe, I put the change in my hand; several people came up, and there was a cry of Stop thief! one of the bottles dropped from me.</p>

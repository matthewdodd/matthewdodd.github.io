                  </hi>. I live at 9, Hyde Side Terrace, Edmonton—I was formerly a wharfinger, in business at Red Lion Wharf and 3, Crane Wharf, Upper Thames Street—I was for ten years a member of the Court of Common Council—I have known Sir Francis Truscott about 22 or 23 years—I helped to get his father into the Court of Common Council, and afterwards himself—he was in the Court with me for the same ward, and afterwards he became an alderman—in 1867 I went abroad—I was in great difficulty with regard to some company; not money difficulty—I left Sir Francis Truscott</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150018"></xptr>
               <p>to manage my affairs while I was away, and he had 10 per cent. for doing it—he had the control of my property entirely, and of my house and furniture—while I was away I received letters from him—I returned to this country in August, 1877—in the mean time I had been made a bank<lb></lb>rupt by the connivance of Sir Francis—I have had no personal dispute with Sir Francis since my return—I ceased to be on friendly terms with him long since, when I discovered him—I was not on friendly terms with him; that is, hardly strong enough—on 25th July I was living at 9, Hyde Side Terrace, Edmonton—Miss Smith was living with me—it is her house—she is not my housekeeper now; she was formerly—she retained from Spain with me—some time in the evening of 25th July there was a knock at the door—I went to the door, and took from the postman this post-card—I read it—it was just in the same state as it is now, but a little dirtier—I noticed the handwriting almost instantly, astonished at the card—an instant after, having read it perhaps twice through, I saw it was Truscott's—I took it to where Miss Smith was sitting and held it before her—she made a statement about it—I then ran out of the house to find the postman, angry—I did not see him; he had passed—I saw Mr. Ryde, and had the post-card with me—I showed it to another person as well on the instant—that same evening I went to the police-station and made inquiries—I showed the post-card to three persons that same evening—I showed it to a Mr. Baker and a Mr. Green—after showing it to them I went immediately to the post-office and showed it to Mr. Wragg, who keeps the post-office at Edmonton—I noticed that there was a portion of a red mark over the flourish on the card; Mr. Ryde and Mr. Baker and myself talked of it—I noticed that at the time—I called Mr. Ryde's attention to it—after showing it to him I went and inquired at the police-station, and I then on that same night compared the post-card with one letter of the defendant's—on the 29th I took the post-card to the Mansion House to Sir Charles Whetham—I afterwards went to Guildhall—a summons was not granted there, and I preferred a bill of indictment here at the last Session—from the knowledge I have of the defendant's handwriting I have not the slightest doubt that the post-card was written by him. Q. Is it in an ordinary handwriting or a feigned hand in your judgment A. Mixed—some of the letters are perfectly distinct, others are a little holder than he usually writes—there are one or two letters that I cannot speak positively to, but the bulk of them I can—I had not the least doubt from the time I received it up to the present time that it was written by the defendant—I produce some letters signed by the defendant—this is the one thai I first examined, dated 25th September, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>)—that is written by the defendant and signed by him; it is addressed to Mr. William Clark—I don't think I have got the envelope of that letter—here is one envelope without a mark on it—there is nothing to identify it as the envelope of that letter—it came to me from Mr. Kay, the Queen's Counsel—this letter of the 5th August, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>) is in the defendant's handwriting and signed by him; it is addressed to Mrs. Clark, the wife of Mr. William Clark; this is the envelope of that letter (<hi rend="italic">marked x</hi>)—I also produce a letter of 17th August, 1868, addressed to Mrs. Clark (<hi rend="italic">marked B</hi>)—I don't think this is the envelope, there are so many; I do not know whether it is—the letter is written by the defendant and signed by him—I also produce a letter, dated 7th November, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">marked D</hi>), addressed to Mr. Clark—I have not got the envelope—the letter is written and signed by the defendant—there is another letter, dated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150019"></xptr>
               <p>13th July, 1868, to Mrs. Clark (<hi rend="italic">marked E</hi>)—that is Written and signed by the defendant—here are three envelopes—I cannot identify them—one is without a date (<hi rend="italic">marked J, H, and G</hi>)—they are written by the defendant—two of them are addressed to Mrs. Clark and the other to Mr. Clark—those documents were all in my possession on the night I received the post<lb></lb>card—I compared it with other letters on the Monday, the 29th, and on the 29th I went with them and the post-card to the Mansion House to Sir Charles Whetham—having made the comparison I have not the slightest doubt that the post-card is in the same handwriting—if necessary I can point out various instances of similarity—after the signature of the defendant I find a flourish in all his letters—besides the letters I had in my possession when I was abroad I received very many letters from the defendant—some of them are in the possession of Mr. Clements, the solicitor to my trustee in bankruptcy. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Clements here produced a number of document.</hi>) Amongst these there are a number of letters written by the defendant to me—here is one of July, 1868—I ceased writing to him at the end of 1868—the most recent is a letter of 15th February, 1869—there is not a great deal of writing in it—it is signed by the defendant, and is addressed to me—here is one letter of 24th, June, 1867, from the defendant to Miss Smith—that is in the defendant's writing—it is signed with initials—it has a bit of flourish at the end, but not similar to what he signs to his letters. (<hi rend="italic">The post-card was addressed to the witness, and contained the words</hi>, "Excuse an old friend mentioning to you, to put you on your guard, but you are being watched by the police."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I have not had any corre<lb></lb>spondence with the defendant since 1869—I have frequently seen his writing since; a seven years' law suit has brought his writing almost every day before me to be copied—I have none of his writing written by him since 1869—it was about 7.30 in the evening of 25th July that I received the post-card—later in the evening I compared it with this letter of 25th September, that comparison tended to convince me that the post-card was the defendant's writing—I was convinced before, but on that comparison I had not the least doubt about it—before I made the comparison I showed the post-card on the instant, first to Mr. Ryde, a neighbour, who lives a few doors from where I was residing—I also showed it to Mr. Baker, a neigh<lb></lb>bour, and to Mr. Green—I then went to the post-office—I showed it to Miss Smith before I went to the post-office—I was very angry at having imputed to me that I was watched by the police—under all the circum<lb></lb>stances, considering that he has robbed me considerably, it was a most serious imputation to say that I was being watched—it angered me; I felt angry—I was exceedingly reluctant that anybody should suppose I was being watched by the police or anybody else—I showed the post-card to Mr. Green, Mr. Baker, and Mr. Ryde because they knew from me how I had been treated by the defendant; that was the reason; to convince them how shamefully he was treating me; not satisfied with my. money he attacks my character—Alderman Cotton was presiding at Guildhall at my first application there—Mr. Martin, the clerk, was there—Sir Robert Garden was the Alderman presiding on the 31st, when the summons was refused—they did not tell me that they declined to grant the summons because in their opinion the writing was not the defendant's—Mr. Martin did not tell me that the writing was not the defendant's—the first person I saw on the Tuesday morning was Sir Charles Whetham, the Lord</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150020"></xptr>
               <p>Mayor—he said that he had no jurisdiction, but he did not say it was not the defendant's writing—Alderman Cotton did not tell me that in his opinion the writing was not the writing of the defendant—Alderman Carden said "I don't know that it is Truscott's writing"—Mr. Humphreys said: "We come for a summons, Sir Robert, and not to ask your evidence"—Mr. Martin was then the clerk—I was not told that they had documents signed by the defendant; that they were perfectly familiar with his writing and that that was not his writing—they did not show me documents signed by the defendant; nothing of the sort; I saw those statements in the paper, but they were untruthful—Mr. Martin was there the whole time—the summons was not granted—I preferred my bill of indictment before the Grand Jury on the following Wednesday, 6th August, and a true bill was found against Truscott for libel—I was before the Grand Jury; I was the only witness as usual when I asked for the summons—I only appeared before the Grand Jury with Mr. Humphreys—I swore to the writing of the post<lb></lb>card and the Grand Jury found the bill—I did not personally inform the defendant that I was about to prefer the bill—on my first application at the Mansion House in trying to get the summons I told the clerk that if he could not give it that day I knew Truscott would be off, which he was once before—that was the only thing I could do—I did not inform the defendant, or cause him to be informed, that I intended to go behind his back and prefer a bill of indictment against him; he was in London; I never went near him; I heard Mr. Humphreys suggest to the Lord Mayor that he near him; I heard Mr. Humphreys suggest to the Lord Mayor that he should be immediately informed of the charge against him—you know better than I whether I ought to have informed him that I intended to prefer the bill; I did not see that I ought; I did not know that it was necessary, and it was rather out of my hands—I have heard that there was an application to a Judge at Chambers for an order to inspect the post-card—I was not present—I have seen in Mr. Humphreys's office affidavits by the defendant and others on this subject—I knew as soon as I saw the affidavits that he denied the post-card being his writing, and I knew that Mr. Thomas Flight Smith swore that it was his—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>) looking at this memorandum, it enables me to correct the statement I made just now: I said I knew it when I saw the affidavits, but I knew it on the 29th August from Mr. Smith, the father—I saw the affidavit of the defendant and the affidavit of Mr. Smith some time in the beginning of this month—I don't know that it occurred to me when I consulted my solicitor about this matter that I might bring a civil action against the defendant for this libel—I don't think it did—it did not occur to me, my impression was that it was improper to do so—I won't say that I knew it could be done, I never asked the question—I have heard of many an action for libel—Q. Did not you know that if you proceeded against the defendant civilly he would be permitted to give his evidence on oath, and that if you pro<lb></lb>ceeded against him criminally he would not be permitted by the rules of law to give any evidence at all—did not you know that?—A. It did not occur to me, it never crossed my mind, on my oath; nor had I any conversation on such a subject; I went away to Mr. Humphreys—I really don't think I thought much about it, only that I was very much annoyed—I know Mr. Thomas Flight Smith and his father, Mr. Thomas James Smith—they are wholesale stationers, and carry on their business in Queen Street, Cheapside—Sir Francis Truscott introduced them to me about 15 years ago as near as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150021"></xptr>
               <p>I can guess—I have not been intimate with them, not out of their business—I don't know where they reside—I know their place of business, that is all—I have been in the habit of calling there pretty frequently and talking to them about my affairs—there was that sort of friendship—I considered they were friends of mine; that they were friendly to me—I called on them on 12th August, and again on the 15th—on 28th August I received a letter from the father to call when I was next in town, and on the 29th I called in Queen Street; and Mr. Smith, senior, said "Kearns, if I were to say my son wrote that card what would you say to it?"—I said "I should say it was a conspiracy between him and Truscott"—he told me that his son had written to him from Germany—he told me he was told to say by his son that he was the delinquent, that his son was in Germany, but not with Truscott, and that he had written to him two days ago, which would make it the 27th—that was what passed—I did not ask to see the letter, but he said "I can show you the letter," and he turned as if to show it me—I held my hand for it, and then he said "No, I have not got it"—he said "Then you don't believe it"—I said "No, I don't, I know the handwriting too well; it must be a question for a jury"—a day or two after that I saw the affidavit of Mr. Thomas Flight Smith, swearing that it was his handwriting; still I did not believe him—I never saw the handwriting of Mr. Thomas Flight Smith—he never wrote to me—it occurred to me to get to see some letters of his, but I did not know how to get them—I had no opportunity of getting them—I did not know his friends—I did not ask his father to show me some of his son's handwriting—I have not seen them since—if he wrote it, would he not have come to me, instead of going to the solicitor of the defendant?—the card is exactly in the same condition as it was when I received it—I do not observe any alteration. Q. Are you in the habit when you receive letters from people of underscoring some of the words; now, just think? A. I need not think, I never did such a thing—I think I may swear that I never did such a thing in my life—I went among other persons to Major Bowman, of the City police—Col. Fraser is the head, the Commissioner, and Major Bowman is the second in command under him—I showed the post-card to Major Bowman and a letter as well; that was on Saturday the 26th, as I received it on the 25th—on the Saturday morning I went to Major Bowman and showed him the card and one of Truscott's letters—when I showed it to him it was exactly in the same state in which it is now—on the Friday when I first received it I went to the local police and showed it to them—I suppose it was to some inspector—I don't remember his name—in my view this is like the style of the defendant's writing—it is not very much disguised—it is hardly disguised—it was not disguised from me, not so as to deceive me for a moment—I have expressed myself strongly against the defendant—I did not tell Mr. Thomas Flight Smith that I had been waiting for vengeance for 11 years, and I would have it now; nothing of the sort—I have said that as lorg as I had life I would take every legitimate and legal course to obtain the property he had robbed me of, and that when the time came I would prosecute him for perjury that he had committed in the Court of Bankruptcy—I told Mr. Smith that—I did not tell him that if I could help it the defendant should never be Lord Mayor—how could I?—you would not perhaps wish me to explain what occurred—I left England on 26th March, 1867—I was chair<lb></lb>man of the Anglo-Danubian Navigation Company—at the time I left I was,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187909150022"></xptr>
               <p>not indebted to a considerable extent—that is one of my hardships—I was made a bankrupt on 20th May, 1867, my agent not appearing for me and having destroyed or intercepted the notice of adjudication, which I never got, I never surrendered under my bankruptcy—I was not a bankrupt, and I have not surrendered—I can't answer whether I was declared an outlaw, unless you allow me to explain—I don't know whether I was declared an outlaw—a gentleman named Burke said he had a consider<lb></lb>able claim on my estate—he had been connected with me in the business relating to the Anglo-Danubian Navigation Company—he has been seeking to prove on my estate—the amount for which he should prove was referred to Mr. Clegg, a member of the firm of Messrs. Quilter, Ball, and Co.—I did not attend a meeting before that gentleman in July—I was there—the order of the Registrar was in February, and they have done nothing but once up to to-day—I think the meeting was about 25th July—I was not informed by anybody at Quilter, Ball's, that my proceedings would be watched, or that I would be watched—there was not an angry discussion between me and Mr. Crawford, the solicitor for the defendant—there was a discussion—I showed him a paper—he did not tell me that he would have me watched or anything to that effect; nothing of the sort, nor did anybody else say anything about it—a clerk of Mr. Burke's was standing in the room at the time—Mr. Hayling was there—Mr. Williams, a clerk of Mr. Clement's, was not there—he had left—it was a long time before I received the post-card that the discussion with Mr. Crawford took place—there was no angry discussion—I only told Crawford that he was a clever little fellow—that was months before I received the post-card—Mr. Crawford represented Mr. Burke and Sir Francis Truscott—he did not say anything to me to this effect, "I know you have money and I intend to have some of it, and I will watch you till I ascertain where it is"—I did not say "I know that I have and I intend to stick to it"—on my oath nothing of the sort—no such discussion ever occurred—I was joking him about his bye play; about what had occurred with Mr. Burke, in perfectly good feeling—when I went away I went to Spain—I did not remain there entirely from March, 1867, till I returned to England, I did principally—I returned to England in August, 1877.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> During the whole time I was in Spain till I returned the defendant had the management of my property; about 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had the control of—I had no debt owing except with the company, which I had guaranteed—I had given bills, and I had given property against those bills, and I gave Truscott property to meet anything else—Mr. Crawford was solicitor for Mr. Burke, who was jointly liable with me to the Anglo<lb></lb>Danubian Company; he is also the solicitor of the defendant, and his son-in<lb></lb>law—the Messrs. Smith were introduced to me by the defendant; they were friends of his; I knew them through him—Mr. Smith senior did not show me the letter which he said he had received from his son abroad—he said "I have a letter I will show you," and he looked round and added "No, I have not got it"—I have never seen it; it has never been produced to my knowledge—I went abroad in March, 1867—I did not hear of my bankruptcy until after it had occurred—I was made a bankrupt without my knowledge—I met the defendant in the October following in Switzerland, by appointment, and he told me of the bankruptcy, and that he would have it immediately put to rights; that it was nothing—the ordinary time for surrendering had</p>

               <p>then gone by—I conversed with him on the subject of the bankruptcy—not a word was said at the Mansion House or at Guildhall when Alderman Cotton was sitting, as to the post-card not being in the handwriting of the defendant—the same clerk, Mr. Martin, was there on the 30th and on the 31st—Alderman Carden was there on the 31st—on the first day I under<lb></lb>stood it was a question of jurisdiction only—on the second day we attended for the decision of the question of jurisdiction—Mr. Martin came to Mr. Humphreys and myself to ask us into the Alderman's room; on entering the room Alderman Carden was putting his cloak on, and said "Good morning, Mr. Kearns;" "Good morning, Sir Robert;" he said "I don't know that this is Truscott's writing; I am late in the Court"—on that Mr. Humphreys said, "Sir Robert, we did not come to you for evidence; we come to you for a summons"—he said "Oh, I don't know anything about it," or something of that sort, "and I am late in Court"—I think Mr. Humphreys also said to Mr. Martin that they were paving the way for a paid magistracy—my attention was not called at that time to any specific document for me to compare with the post-card; no document was shown to me; I did not take one in my hand and look at it—at the further end of the table I saw a paper lying upside down, and I saw Truscott's name and his sign manual under it, but it was not shown to me—I did not take it into my hand—notwithstanding Mr. Thomas Flight Smith's statement that this card was written by him, I have not the slightest doubt of its being written by the defendant—I have no writing of Mr. Smith's—I never saw his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 27, Red Lion Square—I have for many years been engaged in examining handwriting and made it a study—I have been a witness in a great many important cases, employed by the Government and other large bodies—I have had placed in my hand these letters marked A, B, C, D, and E, and have examined them, and also this post-card, with a view to see whether in my judgment the post-card was written by the same person who wrote the letters—I have carefully examined the letters and the post-card, and to the best of my judgment they are written by the same person—the first thing I observed was the similarity of the flourish on the postr-card to the flourish appended to the signature to all these letters.(<hi rend="italic">These alleged similarities and various others which the witness referred to between the formation of letters on the post-card and those in the letters were pointed out to the Jury, who examined them at they were referred to.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Many of the letters in the post-card differ in their formation from those in the letters, and partly from that circumstance and from the general appearance I came to the conclusion that the writing on the post-card is a disguised hand—I never saw the defendant's writing before I was consulted in this case—the writing on the post-card differs from the general character of the defendant's writing, for this reason, that the one is an upright hand and the other is sloping, and it is distorted—it has happened several times that my opinion of handwriting has not been accepted—I was employed by the City Solicitor in "The Queen vi Mayhew;" in that case I gave a confident opinion that certain documents were in the prisoner's handwriting, and it was proved that they were in the handwriting of a clerk of his, but I was instructed that a certain letter was in a certain person's handwriting which turned out not to be so, and I withdrew my evidence—I was not called on the trial in a case in the Probate Court—not long ago I gave evidence and my opinion was not adopted; I am not infallible—I don't pretend to swear that this is the handwriting of the defendant, I never do that, all I say is in my opinion it is—(<hi rend="italic">two post-cards handed to the witness</hi>) there are some similarities in the writing on these to that on the post-card in question; there is a resemblance, I think there is a very strong family likeness.</p>

               <p>Bedford Row—I have made handwriting a study for more than 30 years—I have been frequently examined in courts of justice on questions of handwriting—this post-card was submitted to me for examination with the letters A, B, C, D, and E, and four envelopes—I made an independent comparison between them; I was not aware that any other person was engaged in the case—my opinion decidedly was that the same hand which wrote the five letters and the four envelopes also wrote the post<lb></lb>card, but in a disguised hand; I had no doubt whatever about it—I have been in Court while Mr. Chabot was examined, and with two exceptions every point he has given evidence upon I have mentioned in my report, and six others which he has not noticed.

I am a member of the firm of Smith, Son, and Co., wholesale stationers, 83, Queen Street, City—I have been acquainted with Mr. Kearns, the prosecutor, for some years—I have also been acquainted with Sir Francis Truscott for a considerable number of years—latterly up to the month of June and July this year Mr. Kearns has been in the habit of coming to our counting-house from time to time and dis<lb></lb>cussing freely his own affairs with myself and father—I knew that he and Sir Francis Truscott had formerly been great friends, but that the friend<lb></lb>ship had ceased—Mr. Kearns has expressed himself very antagonistic to Sir Francis—I remember seeing Mr. Crawford, Sir Francis Truscott's son-in<lb></lb>law, on Friday, 25th July, and having a conversation with him with regard to Mr. Kearns—he made a statement to me with regard to Mr. Kearns, and about proceedings which were likely to be taken against him, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of that conversation after Mr. Crawford had left I wrote to Mr. Kearns on a post-card, and I see that post-card here—this is the post-card that I wrote to Mr. Kearns—it is my own writing, without a doubt—I wag not actuated by any malicious motive towards Mr. Kearns in writing it—subsequently when I heard that this indictment had been found against Sir Francis I was abroad, and in consequence of what I saw in the newspapers I immediately communicated with my father—my first idea was to write to Sir Francis Truscott and acknowledge that I did it—that was my first idea, but I wrote to my father instead—subsequently at the request of Mr. Crawford I made an affidavit on an application to see this post-card before Mr. Justice Stephen at chambers, in which affidavit I swore that this was my handwriting—in so swearing I swore the truth—upon my oath it is my own handwriting. Q. You have also sworn that Sir Francis Truscott had nothing whatever to do with it; was he aware in any way that you wrote</p>

               <p>that post-card?. Simply quite impossible—I had not seen him for some weeks before or some weeks afterwards—Mr. Kearns said to me that Sir Francis Truscott never should be Lord Mayor—the next time that I saw the post-card was at the office of Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor for the prosecution—that is the only time that I have seen it since—I forget the date of that—it was about the 25th August, two or three weeks ago—I only saw it that once—since then I have been asked by Mr. Crawford to write a post-card from my memory as well as I could, and I have done so on two occasions—these are the two (<hi rend="italic">marked Y and Z</hi>)—I wrote Y, it might be about a week ago, and the other I wrote this morning—thoy were written naturally from my own head and memory of what I had written of to Mr. Kearns.</p>

I wrote it in such a great hurry; I will write another if you like, and that will make five—these are not scored under, and there is no flourish and no punctuation, and it is not my custom to do so—I am not in the habit of writing post-cards—sometimes in business matters and little things I do—I think this is the first libellous post-card I have ever written—sometimes I initial them, sometimes I do not.</p>

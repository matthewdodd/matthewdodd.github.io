                  </hi>. I am an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Adelaide,</hi> which laid at the West India Docks, which is a port of entry and discharge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came on board on Tuesday, the 30th of January—I was cooking—he was there about ten minutes—he came on board with the pretence of warming his hands—I had a handkerchief and book on the forecastle, and my jacket too—I saw them on Sunday—while I was gone half he took the opportunity to go down to the forecastle—I and the officer law him come up, and he went on the other side of the deck—the officer asked what he wanted there—he made no answer—the officer opened his jacket and found my jacket underneath, with this handkerchief and book—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are mine.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the West India Docks—he had his jacket slung over the right shoulder—I asked what he wanted there—he said to go to sleep—I said he could not sleep there, and he must go out—he then asked me if the master was on board—I told him no, and I told him once more to go out, but he did not offer to go, and I fetched the officer from the gate—that is seven or eight yards from the ship—the officer was in his box there—when I came back with the officer, he was just getting out of the fore-hatchway, and he had got two jackets on—the handkerchief and book were in the pocket of the jacket—I said nothing more to him than to tell him to go out of the ship—there were two lads on board—one was down in the midships and one down in the cabin—the people on board could not exactly see where he went to—he said at the office that he hoped they would think of his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and sexton of Shadwell parish. I have known the prisoner personally nearly four years, and partially, on account of knowing his mother, seventeen years—he was summarily convicted of having a jacket in his possession—up to that time he bore a most irreproachable character—I have heard from his family that fourteen years ago he fell down a ship's hold, and was insensible (for three days, and there are now pieces of lint and things in his head; I know he is subject to such fits of aberration, that he will sit for hours together with his head on his hand, and beat his head to get sense in it—I know Mr. Deverell, the beadle—he has been able to get a ship for him—the prisoner had engaged himself to go a long voyage, but his wife did not like him to go so far—I know he was seventeen years at sea, and when he came home he was always at home at his mother's—he worked by daily labour in the Docks, but it was precarious, and we wished him to go to sea again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. I was about six years old when he sustained an injury—he was working on board one of Mr. Gale's ships, and fell down the hold, and fractured his skull—he was out of his mind for three weeks, and ever since that he has been rather singular.</p>

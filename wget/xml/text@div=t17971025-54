               <p>Q. Was any thing carried out of the house? - A. Yes; the watch and the tea-spoons, and tablespoons; all the articles of silver were gone; there was nothing found upon Goldsmith, the things were found upon the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Goldsmith was one of the men? - A. I am quite positive, I was never five yards behind him; I could have stopped him sooner, but I was in hopes somebody would come up to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At eight o'clock on the first of this month, it was dark? - A. It was a clear night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you can swear positively to the man's face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much surprised? - A. Yes, it struck me in amaze.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you could not be so minute in your observation as if you had not been in amaze? - A. Yes, it made me more minute.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons who had joined the pursuit? - A. I saw but one person, and he was running after the other man; there might be other people about that I did not see, but I could see twenty or thirty yards before me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you find the doors forced, or the windows? - A. We could perceive no marks of violence.</p>

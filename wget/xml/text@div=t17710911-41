             in my house, and confined in New Prison, Clerkenwell. My house I left locked, only the windows were not fast. I was afraid I should be plundered when absent. The prisoner came to the goal to ask after a friend of her's; I asked if there was any body in the goal I could send a message by to my neighbour; the prisoner said she would go;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110031"></xptr> but I did not know her. I sent her to my next door neighbour to desire her to take care of the house; I let her take the key; she said she would deliver the key, and see the house secured; and my neighbour took out some linen which she was to bring to me. The prisoner wrote a note, and Wright delivered it to my neighbour. I delivered the key to Murphy. I found afterwards my house had been robbed in the night-time. I was in gaol twelve weeks. When I came out I found the house stripped; other people had got it: all the goods were gone except what a neighbour had secured. The goods, mentioned in the indictment, were all in my house at the time I was taken up, and they were gone when I came out; who took them I do not know. She did not come as she had promised to do on Monday, but came to the gaol on the Thursday following. I asked her how she could do so; she abused me, and said it was only a breach of trust.</p>

            . I was prevailed on to do this by Murphy. We took some linen out in the day-time. We opened the door with the key. Murphy found afterwards a padlock on the door; we then took a poker with us to the house; Murphy broke the padlock with the poker, and went into the house. I staid at the door; she brought out all the things mentioned in the indictment; that was between one and two in the morning; the goods were carried to the lodging where the prisoner lived, with one Thomas, in Denmark-street. I had four shillings for my trouble.</p>

I live directly opposite the house; I took notice of these people going into the house, and taking out things; I knew the woman was in gaol; I thought it odd; the landlord put a padlock on the house, and shut it up. I saw Murphy go by the door after the padlock was put up, between twelve and one at night; I was in bed; I heard them at the door; I got up, and saw Murphy break open the door with a poker, Wilson was there assisting her: Wilson wanted her to go away; she said, no; and threatened and abused her; she made her stay and assist her. She brought the things out of the house; part she took under her own arm, the rest she gave to Wilson, and they went away together.

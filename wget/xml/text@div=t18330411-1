            . I live at No. 45, Dean-street, Soho, and am a turner. On the 11th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner force his hands through the window of Mr. Leplastrier's shop - I could not perceive what he took out, but I saw he had got something; I took hold of him, and took him into the shop - the shop door was not shut at the time; I saw him endeavour to conceal what he had got, and I found a watch-case in each of his hands - I marked them, and delivered them to the constable; he forced his hands through a very large square of glass, which he broke.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in Holyday-yard. I received the prisoner in charge, and produce the watch-cases, which I received from Curry.</p>
               <p>MR. LEPLASTRIER. These are my cases - they are worth about 4l.; the door which opens to the street does not at once admit you into the shop - there is a lobby, and on the right there is a door which enters the shop; the outer door is always open - the house is in the parish of St. Martin, Ludgate.</p>

             re-examined. Q.Which door did you mean was open? A. I meant the outer door - the inner door was closed, and the window was closed, but the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did it through distress - I had been out of work a long time, and did not know what to do to get a bit of bread.</p>

I had known Mary Welch for 15 years; she was married to the male prisoner in Ireland; I was present at the marriage six years ago; they lived together as man and wife at Mrs. Corkery's, in Church-street, St. Giles's; they lived very happy and comfortable together - Lyons is the deceased's first cousin; she came to England about two months before Welch and his wife left Church-street, and lived with them; they left Church-street, and went to live in <placeName id="t18250915-42-crimeloc231">Little Turnstile, Holborn</placeName>

I had seen her at Mrs. Corkery's before that and she was very ill - she said she was bad, her head was very bad - the clergyman, who was in the room, said she was deranged; there was nothing to make me think so; she told me something which I afterwards mentioned to Welch, and told him that she had said she wanted to go back and live at Mrs. Corkery's, for she did not like to live there, for she was jealous of Nell Lyons: he said there was no notice to be taken of what she said, for she did not know what she was saying, this was on Tuesday - on the Friday I heard she was dead; I went to Turnstile, between one and two o'clock, and saw her in bed, dead; Mrs. Corkery and Nell Lyons were there; I helped Mrs. Corkery to wash the body, and when I went to the head I found a cut; I asked Lyons how it happened, she said, she had fallen down stairs on Sunday night; I said I would not wash her any further till I saw Welch - I wanted her to move her head on the pillow, she kept her hand on the head, and said it would do very well as it was - I asked why she kept her hand there, she said she was purging out of her mouth the day before - I sent her for Welch, he came; I asked him how it happened; he said that he was drunk on Sunday night, that she had gone down stairs, and he was carrying her up again, when she put her feet on the stairs, and fell back on the tiles which were laying on one side of the door. After this I washed and cleaned her, cut off a good deal of her hair, and said I would go to the searchers and give an alarm; when I cut off her hair, I observed a bit of lint in the cut, which was at the back of her head, and her hair was bloody - I examined the bed and there was a little blood, which Lyons said proceeded from her head when she was brought up stairs - there was a little flour shook on her head; I fetched the searchers and was there next morning when they came; Lyons was present but not Welch; they asked Lyons what was her illness? she said she had been ill a good while, but she did not know what was the matter with her: she took off her cap, but did not shew the cut - I went home soon after. Welsh did not ask me to the funeral, but I went to walk after it; she was going to be buried on the Sunday; I went there on Sunday and saw the body in the coffin, the prisoners were present - Kennedy, who was there went to the body, put his finger on the cut, and said it should not be buried that day - Welch said, he had no business to prevent his burying his wife, Kennedy fetched the beadle. When I saw the deceased on the Tuesday, she was speechless.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. They had lived very happy together? A. Yes; her maiden name was Mary Connell: it is not the custom in Ireland to bury married women by their maiden names, that I know - they often use their maiden names after marriage. I believe she has had two children; she never complained to me of any particular suffering at their birth. When she said she was jealous of Lyons, I think she was flighty; they bury the day after the death happens in Ireland, but that is not observed here. I was not surprised at not being invited - it is common to follow without - she always went by the name of Welch in England.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, St. Giles's, and know Welch - he lodged with his wife at my house for twelve months; they lived happily together. Lyons came to lodge with them about March last; they lived with me in my room, in the same room as me; they all three slept in the same bed. I and my husband slept in a bed in the same room: they moved from my house to Turnstile; I called there on the Sunday before his wife died: she had come to see me about a fortnight before that, and appeared very ill, and was not in good spirits; I thought her wrong in her head. On the Sunday before she died I and my husband met Welch in Bloomsbury, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - we knew she was ill, and he asked us to go and see her - we went: she was sitting up in bed, and appeared better than when I last saw her; she said she was better: I do not know whether Welch was present - he was not sober when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150023"></xptr>met us. Lyons let us in, and went up to the room with us. Mrs. Welch said somebody had stolen her gown and cloak, and if I would send my girl with some of my clothes she would come and see me next day - she had told me when she was out of her mind that she was jealous of Nell Lyons and her husband - they were both present then. She said on Sunday that she had something to tell me - she did not appear very steady then. I left her about six o'clock that afternoon - Welch and Lyons were then in the room; she did not complain of any injury then. On the Tuesday following, which was the 28th of June, Welch called on me, about eleven o'clock that morning, and said his wife was very ill, and that he had brought the clergyman to prepare her; he asked me to go and see her. I and Donovan went between one and two o'clock - she was then in bed, and speechless; Lyons was in the room: Donovan told me to lift her up on the holster; I felt a handkerchief or something about her head; I asked Lyons what it was - sh said it was a handkerchief about her head, because her head had been light; she said nothing about any cut or accident then. On Friday, the 1st of July, Welch came to me, and said his wife was almost dead - in consequence of which I went about twelve o'clock, and found her very bad; she could not be worse: both the prisoners were there. She opened her eyes, and looked at me, but neither spoke or moved. I was there when she died between one and two o'clock - Welch was not then in the room; I sent for him - he came. I think he then had on a fustian jacket, and was in his working dress. I told him his wife was dead, and I wished Mrs. Donovan to be present when I washed the body - he said I could do it myself; Lyons was in the room: Donovan came up in the mean time, and helped me to wash the body. Donovan found out a cut - Welch had told me before that he was tipsy on the Sunday night, and was stretched on the bed - that she went down stairs, and Lyons called to him; he went down after her, and caught her by the body to bring her up - that she put her foot against the stairs, and fell back, with her head against the tiles, and so got that injury on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Donovan point out a spot of blood on the deceased's neck? A. Yes, and on the bolster - it was a mark of blood; Lyons said Mrs. Welch had purged that blood out of her mouth. I saw some tiles on the stair-case on Tuesday - I do not know whether any were broken. - Lyons's hand was on the back of the deceased's head when we were washing the body. I wanted to wash her face - Donovan told me to turn the body to wash her neck; Lyons said there was no occasion for that. Donovan turned the body on the side, and found the cut. Before that it lay on its back. Donovan called out that the woman was murdered, and immediately fainted in a chair. I saw the cut very plain; there was blood about it: Donovan cut off some of the hair - it was bloody. I said I would do no more till the searchers were sent for. Donovan and I went for them - they did not come till eleven o'clock next day (Friday) - he was at work. I was in the room on Sunday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Kennedy prevented the funeral.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from Welch or Lyons that she had met with an accident, till you discovered it on Friday? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Welch was an affectionate husband? A. Yes. I had every opportunity of observing his conduct - he was a good kind husband - he always spoke feelingly of her, and when she died he did the same - Poor women in Ireland go by their maiden names after marriage. I was with her about six months ago, when she had a dead child - she was very delicate; no violence was used to produce the birth: she was very ill afterwards. I know of nothing that caused her illness; her conduct was not such as to need control.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did she always go by the name of Welch? A. Yes. I saw her four or five times after she left Church-street - she had not lost her senses before she left me.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 26th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was in Welch's company - he was in liquor, but not very drunk; he came into Corkery's room, where I was, and asked me to go out and take a pot of beer; I went with him - we drank together. I asked how his wife was - he said she was very bad, and asked me to go and see her; we met Mrs. Corkery, and all went together - she was in bed; we got there between five and six o'clock, I think; she was very ill indeed. I saw Lyons there; Welch came away with me - he said that they three, meaning himself, wife, and Lyons, were sleeping in one bed, and that he thought Lyons was with child - I did not ask him by whom; I partly judged it was by him, from their sleeping together. I was there on Saturday at the wake - the prisoners and a woman were there. Welch told me that he and she were walking down stairs, and she was very drunk, fell, and was hurt; I think this was before she died, but cannot say - I think it was at the wake.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Welch did not say she was with child by him? A. No. He did not mention about her falling till Saturday. I was not with him above five minutes on Monday.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter, and work for Mr. Thomas, with Welch, who lived in this house, which Mr. Thomas was repairing: he lived there with his sister, as he called his wife; and Lyons staid there with them. On Tuesday, the 28th of January, he came into the shop to me and asked if I should be afraid to go and see a sick person - I said no - I went up stairs with him to the top room, and there saw the woman whom he had described as his sister, laying on her back in bed. I should have thought at first that she was dead: he took hold of her left hand, which was closed, and pulled it open - it closed again of itself, which satisfied me she was not dead; I asked if he had any medical assistance - he said Mr. Thomas's doctor had attended her - he had told me, on a former occasion, that Mr. Thomas had let him have money, with which he had sent his wife to Ireland - he gave me no account of her illness - Mr. Thomas came to the house that morning - I told him I had been up by Welsh's desire; I afterwards saw Welch, and said I had told Mr. Thomas about his wife being ill - he said he had mentioned it himself, and he thought his master would call and see her: the house was under repair, and there were tiles at the foot of the stairs. On the Friday morning master's apprentice brought a basket for Welch to take somewhere, and while the apprentice was talking to me Lyons came down, and said, "Go and fetch Welch, for she is gone." I supposed by that she was dead; the apprentice went - Welch came soon after and went up immediately, and in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150024"></xptr>about half an hour I heard a noise, which I supposed to be in their room - Welch came down afterwards, and I questioned him what the noise was up stairs - he said they had found a scratch on her pate, and the people up-stairs were talking of sending for a beadle - that he was searching about and the people asked him what he was looking for, and he said for a paper, which contained flour, which he had got to stop the blood; he told me that day, that on the Sunday he got more to drink than usual, and had laid himself down on the bed - his cousin Lyons awoke him, and said she had put on his coat, and gone down stairs - that he went after her, and in bringing her up in his arms she put her foot on the third stair, and shoved them both backward - she fell against some tiles, which caused the scratch on her pate. I examined the tiles on the Thursday after her death, but could observe no blood on them, nor about the stairs - some were broken: he said his sister had spoken to him that very morning, and said she wished him to follow her to the grave as chief mourner, and to bury her in St. Giles's church-yard, as her husband was away, he was the only friend she had: I asked him if she was a married woman - he said yes, and had parted from her husband through some differences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know whether she was his wife or not? A. No; I used to ask Lyons of a morning how Welch's sister was. Some of the tiles might have been removed before I examined them.</p>

            . My uncle, Steward, keeps the Ship, wine vaults, in Little Turnstile. Welch had his beer from our house - Lyon lived with him and his sister, as I always called her. I went over for the pots, two or three times in the week she died - she was very ill when I saw her - I was there on the Thursday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the day before her death - she was then sitting on something behind the door, and appeared very ill; I asked how she was - she answered me very faintly, "Very ill, indeed;" she was sitting alone; I observed no blood about her - Lyons was there - I met Welch that afternoon, and asked him if it was not his wife who was up stairs ill - he said no, that his wife was at Reading, very ill. A week before that I had occasion to go up to the room, the deceased was there alone - just as she was beginning to tell me something Lyon came in and the deceased said hush.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had said very little to her? A. No; she said she had something to mention and begged I would not mention it again. Welch has described her as his sister ever since he has been at the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Thomas. On the 1st of July Welch came to the house, I had met him on the Monday; he said he was going to ask his master's leave to go home as his sister was taken very ill after breakfast; that before breakfast she was quite well, and said to him "I think we may part with our cousin, as I am now quite recovered; when you can give her a trifle, I think you may let her go."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what happened to her after breakfast? A. He said it was one of her fits which she had been subject to; he had said she had scratched herself in her fits and hit herself, but did not say where; he told me on the following morning that he had had a doctor to her, but the doctor said it was too late for him, he could not save her - he came on Friday the 1st of July; he took a piece of paper out of his pocket, and asked me to give him some flour to stop the bleeding of the scratches - this was before twelve o'clock in the morning. I am sure he called them scratches, and in the course of the week he said there was a scratch about her temple, and the other on the cheek. I gave him about a tea-spoon full of flour, which he said would be enough; he never described her illness in any other way to me.</p>

            . I am a painter, employed by Mr. Thomas, and work with Welch; he told me his wife was at Reading - this was while he lived in Turnstile; at another time he told me she was gone to Ireland, and when she returned he would give me some whiskey. I understood from him, that one of the women who lived with him was his sister, and the other his cousin; he came to me on Friday morning, the 1st of July, at Southampton-row, where I was working - I think it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he was much agitated. I asked him to get me some turpentine; he said hastily, "Say nothing, oh! I am maddened! maddened! distressed and mad." I said, "What is the matter;" he said "She is gone," I said "What, your sister?" he said Yes; and seemed in a most agitated state; he put his hand to his head, as if he was in pain. I asked if he had a coffin for her, he said "No, master will see to that, he is very good to me."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the manner of her dying? A. He said she was frightened, for she seemed to spring up in her bed, and look at him, and he could not bear to stand to see her; that she said in her illness, that no person should follow her but himself, and she wished to be buried in St. Giles's church-yard; that he would bury her on Sunday, and have her screwed down as soon as possible, for poor creature she would not keep - she was not fit to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his working dress on that morning? A. He had a clean grey coat on, which I had never seen before; he usually wore a fustian or blue jacket - a circumstance occurred in my business, which makes me certain that this passed before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that? A. I had a particular piece of work to do, and was to be at my master's house as soon as I finished it, and was there before eleven o'clock. He expressed sorrow and was crying a little.</p>

            . I am a builder. The prisoner was labourer to the carpenters. I had an empty house in Turnstile, and put him to live there to save his rent - he bore a very good character - he came to work for me in July, 1824. I then understood him to be married, and living with his wife. About Christmas he told me one of his children were scalded to death, which caused his wife to be seriously ill, and made her subject to fits; that the doctor said she must go into the country. I advanced him 2 l. to take her, and he told me she was gone - this was at the end of March; he went to Turnstile soon after Midsummer, and I understood from him that his sister and cousin lived with him there. On the Sunday after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150025"></xptr>her death, he was apprehended, and confessed to me then that she was his wife. On the Monday before that, I asked him how his sister was - he said very ill, and that last night she had received a slight accident - I asked him the nature of it, he said he had laid himself on his bed, and his cousin awoke him, and told him she had gone down stairs, he followed her, and got to her just before she got to the street door, took her round the waist, and was carrying her up; when they got about the fourth or fifth step, she put out her feet, and by a sudden spring threw them both down - that she struck her feet against the sash, and bounded over the bannisters, and fell on some stones at the bottom. I am sure he said sash, and I think stones or tiles. I asked if she had hurt herself; he said she had a slight scratch on the head, pointing his finger to his head; he wished me particularly to go and see her, but I did not. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the day she died. I saw him in my yard; he said his sister was gone at last, and that she would have gone half an hour before, but she had waited to see him, to give directions about her funeral; that she wished to be buried very plain, and only him to follow. I saw him again that evening; he said, now his sister was gone, he must see about a lodging, and what was he to do about the bedstead, meaning one I had given him. I said "Sleep on it to be sure;" he said he would not sleep on it again for 50 l. Mr. Blair is my doctor - I never sent him to attend her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not you object to sleep on the bed on which a person had died? A. I told him I should not mind it, but I know he was rather timid.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Turnstile. At a quarter past seven o'clock on Saturday morning, the 2d of July, Lyons came to me, and asked for a bit of flour to stop the bleeding of a woman's bad head.

            . I keep the Black Horse public-house. The witness Donovan is my sister. On Sunday, in consequence of what she said, I went to the house where the deceased lay. I found the corpse in the coffin - they were going to bury it - the room was full of people. I said I should look at the body. I pushed the coffin lid aside - Lyons was in the room but not Welch. I lifted up the head, and my hand sunk into a large cut in the back, cap and all, and when I took my hand out it was quite bloody - I shewed it to the people, and forbid the funeral. Welch came into the room - I asked how that happened; he at first said I had no occasion to interfere with his wife, what was his wife to me. I said there was visibly something wrong - he said, what was that to me. I forbid the undertaker to bury: he said he would if the husband ordered him. Welch said, she slipped down at the bottom step of the stairs. I went with the beadle next morning, and examined the stairs carefully, but could not find the least appearance of blood. I looked at the sacking of the bed on Monday - it was stained with blood, and had some flour over it - there was blood on the bed and bolster, and on the boards of the room - the bolster was very bloody; there was an appearance of flour on the bed, but not on the bolster; a cap was very bloody, also a jacket had blood on the sleeve.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not remove the corpse? A. No; the people were dressed ready for the funeral.</p>

            . I am a beadle. On Sunday, the 3d of July, I went to this house. I told Welch we had heard the woman was murdered, and I must stop the funeral, and take him into custody. I said the corpse should not be taken out of the house till it was examined by a medical gentleman; his master came afterwards. I examined the body; Lyons was present when I discovered the wound. I took Welch to the watch-house; he told me she had fallen down stairs. At the watch-house I asked why he had not sent for a doctor. He said, "I don't know what is the reason, but I did not do it." I afterwards took Lyons. I examined the stair-case minutely, but found no marks of blood there; there was blood under the bed, and a large quantity in the centre of the bed; the blood mark on the floor was exactly under that, and the sacking was also stained with blood; the floor appeared to have been washed to get out the blood, and there was flour on the floor; the stain on the bolster, had nothing to do with the other part of the bed. I found a jacket between the bolster and ticking - the back of it was stained with blood; there was none on the sleeves; there were two caps and a handkerchief stained all over with blood, and an old cloth in the cupboard was stained with blood; it appeared to have been used as an apron; I found it in the cupboard, with shavings on the top of it; I found an old hatchet in the cellar of the house, and an iron hammer under the shavings with the cloth; there was no blood on them; I produce the cloth, sacking, &amp;c.</p>

There was a wound on the back of the head, about two inches long, it appeared a recent wound. I examined it more particularly the same evening with Mr. Paty. There was an extensive fracture of the skull, which commenced at the left ear, and extended right across the head, and terminated in the base of the skull, on the opposite side; a small branch of the same fracture extended backward; this fracture was in addition to the wound. The wound appeared a clean incision, as if cut with a sharp instrument. I think this axe could have inflicted it. A fall down three or four stairs could not have done it. A blow with the axe, if given with force, would have caused the fracture. It did not come in contact with the brain. There was an artery of the membrane of the brain ruptured by the bone, which was driven in. There had been an effusion of about four ounces of blood from the artery. I found it between the skull and dura mater.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150026"></xptr>Q. Could you judge how long before death these wounds had been inflicted? A. I do not think the wound could have been inflicted more than twenty-four hours before death; I think so from the appearance of the wound; the injury of the head altogether was the cause of her death. I opened the body; there was no appearance of disease elsewhere, except a disorder of the bowels, but not such as to cause death; blood must have flowed from the wound immediately it was inflicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the wound could not be caused by a fall down three or four steps; would not that depend on the nature of what the head came in contact with? A. That would make a difference.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If she had fallen down the whole stair-case would that have caused the wound? A. If she had fallen on any thing sharp; the edge of a common tile could not have caused it; a sharp slate tile would.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Might not the fracture have been caused by falling against the post of a bed? A. No; a fall from a great height might do it certainly; the membrane was naturally very strong.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. From the appearance of the wound, could it have been inflicted by a fall on the Sunday before death? A. I think not. I have it proved by a witness that she was seen sitting up without assistance. In my judgment the injury must have happened after that.</p>

            . I have heard Mr. Tweddale examined. I assisted him in dissecting the body. I differ from him in one respect. I think it possible for a woman to have had intervals of sensibility - that she might have sat up and talked - but it entirely depends upon whether the blood effused slowly or quickly, and I think there must have been two blows or falls to have inflicted the incised wound and fracture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you, from external appearances, judge that there had been more than one blow? A. Yes; the incised wound was a clean cut, and on introducing my finger I did not find the fracture corresponding - it was two inches beyond it, from which I conclude there must have been two blows. I think the fracture might have existed on the Sunday, but not the incision.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at any part of the skull, where you saw the mark of a bruise where the fracture had been made? A. The extravasation of blood had taken place, and there was some external appearances of a blow corresponding with the fracture; the fracture of itself was sufficient to cause death; the incised wound was not sufficient I think.</p>

I received them between nine and ten in the morning; I was going to drive them to Brentwood; they were to be left at Brentwood for Mr. Churchyard; I had no other cattle with me. I was stopped at Mile End with them, and detained there; Mr. Moss's man stopped me, his name is Collier; he claimed them as Mr. Moss's property. I delivered them over to Mr. Moss.

            . I am collector of the toll at Painsbridge-gate, three miles below Rumford. I saw the prisoner come through the gate in the morning between one and two o'clock on Thursday, the 18th; I knew him by sight. A person to go to Mr. Moss's land would pass my gate.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went through the gate, had he any thing with him - A. He had no cattle with him then; he was in company with another person. I saw him again about eleven o'clock at night, the same day, he drove the three beasts through my gate, and paid me the toll for the three bullocks, one penny halfpenny; they were small Scotch beasts. I am quite sure he is the man that went through in the morning. We have a large lamp at the front of the house at the toll gate; I had an opportunity to observe him; I am certain he is the man. When the prisoner paid me the toll, I saw no other person with him then.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner driving three beasts - A. Yes; the prisoner is the man that I saw driving the three beasts. He followed the beasts up, and went with me to Smithfield. I had more beasts to drive. He mixed these beasts in with mine, and he followed behind me.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to Mr. Finch, and I am clerk to Mr. Jones. I paid that five-pound note to the prisoner; by the direction of Mr. Finch, I took the numbers of the notes that I paid him. I have got a memorandum in my pocket. This note corresponds with the memorandum.</p>
               <p>DANIEL LEADEETTER. I am one of the marshal-men. The prisoner and another man last Wednesday were brought to the Mansion House; they were remanded until the Friday. The prisoner sent for me to come to him in the Compter. I went to him. He said, he wished to say something to me; he said, he received these beasts of Gazelie; he was induced to sell them as Gazelie owed him some money; he was induced to sell them to get the money of him. The Grand Jury threw the bill out against Gazelie.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed by another man to drive the beasts; when he came near the Fountain, he put the beasts into this drover's hands, saying to me, he wished me to go into the market, and speak to Mr. Finch, to make the best of them, and to receive the money for him; as he was something in my debt, he ordered me to keep part of the money for myself. It is a false thing to say of me I stole the beasts.</p>

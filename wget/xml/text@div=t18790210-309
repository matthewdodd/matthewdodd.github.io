Murder!" and when I had served my customer I ran to the corner to look, and I saw it was the same people in the road—I saw her clothes a little way up—she was on the ground a little way from the gutter—the man was kneeling over by her side or at the head—I could not see very well, it was dark—I did not go up close to them—I called out "You brute"—he appeared to be on his knees—her clothes were a little way up above her stockings—he never answered me—he appeared to be drunk—I was called away then to serve my customers—I afterwards saw them—I do not know whether she was walking along or being led or carried round—I could not see distinctly, because there were two or three customers round me.

I am a ticket-collector, and live at 8, Orchard Terrace, Bow—on the night of the 21st I was in the Bow Road, outside the Black Swan—I saw the prisoner there—we had worked together on the same line—he had got hold of a woman round the waist behind her, trying to pull her out from the public-house—she had hold of the handle inside, holding to it—as soon as she left go they fell—she fell sideways—I assisted her up—he fell on her—she kept saying, "Let me be, I am not drunk"—after I had assisted her up she called "Police!" and "Murder!"—he caught her round the waist again from behind to carry her away—they went a few yards and fell down again into the road—the prisoner held on her then and exposed her—he pulled her clothes up with one hand—they were both on the ground together, he on his side lying beside her and she lying on her side—he pulled her clothes about as high up as the waist, and he smacked her with his open hand—he said, "Now, won't you come home?"—a man then helped her up—the prisoner had got hold of her round the arm, and they got back again in front of the Black Swan, where they were at first; and there a policeman came up, and wanted to know what all the bother was about—I do not know what the prisoner said to that—I heard the policeman say, "What are you going to do with the woman?" and he. said he was going to take her home—the policeman said, "Take her home, then;" and the prisoner caught hold of her and attempted to carry her away again—after going five or six yards they fell down again, he on top of her, the woman under—her clothes were up—I could see the man was drunk—he was carrying her round the waist from behind—he did so twice—the police<lb></lb>man saw him do that the last time—they came up and saw the man drunk trying to carry the woman; they looked on without interfering—somebody said, "Aren't you policemen going to interfere, as that woman doesn't belong to the man?" and that he had been exposing her round the corner—the police then went directly and got the man off the woman, and got the woman up, and took them to the station.</p>

I said, 'I will lock you up.' He struck me on the nose and I fell. I got up. He took me by the arms and dragged me about; he hurt me. He then put my clothes over my face. He kicked me across the thigh above the knee with all his force. Then two police came. I called 'Police!' 'Murder!' The police did not take him at first; they then took him. My leg was cut where he hit me. I never saw the man before. I am sure the man who was taken to the station was the man who struck and kicked me. The prisoner is very like the man who did it.

I will not say the injury in the knee-joint was not caused by a fall on the kerb—the body was in a very diseased state—I examined the head—there was syphilitic disease of the bones, the rest healthy—syphilitic disease of the liver—syphilitic disease of the spleen and granular kidneys—most of the organs were diseased—the actual working parts of the organs were not so excessively diseased—there was more deposi<lb></lb>tion of structure of tissue than destruction of tissue—a wound or a blow would be much more serious to a person so diseased—with people having granular kidneys the slightest wound is very severe, and often followed by rapid and fatal results—we never make a practice of cutting such people—in a healthy subject the wound would not cause death—the wound hastened death.</p>

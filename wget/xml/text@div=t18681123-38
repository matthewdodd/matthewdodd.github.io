                  </hi>. I am a sadler, of 29, Russell Street, Mile End—about 12 o'clock on Saturday night, November 7, I was in Whitechapel Road, by the corner of the London Hospital, and was met by two or three men—I cannot say which it was, as it was so momentary—one snatched my watch chain and broke it, taking part of it—they ran away, and I followed them, but the prisoner came before me—I pushed him aside, and he struck me a fearful blow behind the ear, which sent me almost staggering into the middle of the road—he was laid bold of by a stranger, and I gave him in custody—in the excitement of the moment I cannot say that the prisoner is the man who struck, but nobody else was near enough to do so—the person who I pushed away struck me directly, and my witness laid hold of</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was merely passing along, and the man caught hold of me, and threw me on my face.

He said that he could not swear to me, but he had paid a witness to do so.</p>

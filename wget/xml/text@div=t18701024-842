                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I have been married eighteen years—I left him about twelve months ago, and we were separated in law on 10th January last—I live at 14, Carthusian Street, Aldersgate Street, and work as a milliner—I have always obtained my living in that way—I have seen the prisoner constantly since we have been separated—he has not spoken to me—he followed me about, and I always had a young lady to go about with me—on Sunday night, 2nd October, about 8.20, I was leaving Dr. Gumming's chapel, in Covent Garden, after service—I saw the prisoner waiting outside—he had his hand up to his face, and as I passed him he let it fall in that way and dropped the stuff on my mantle, and I immediately smelt a strong smell as of chloride of lime—I did not feel him touch me, but I smelt it immediately; my friend said, "He has thrown something on you," and my mantle was wet directly—there was no one else near me but him who could have done it—one of the young ladies said, "Give me your handkerchief," and she wiped it, and it went into rags immediately—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the mantle and skirt—they are burnt on the left side, and this is the handkerchief the young lady took to wipe it with; it turned green; she put it up to her face and said, "Why, it burns"—I had been to church in the morning, and I saw the prisoner there—I saw him in church, and as I came out—I have attended that church for ten years—he knew I was in the habit of going there—he has been there on Friday nights when I have been there—he is a watchmaker by trade—his hand was closed when he had it up to his face, and he dropped it as I passed him.</p>

I am a single woman, and live at 140, Cheapside—I was with Mrs. Droz at Dr. Cumming's church on the evening that this took place—I saw the prisoner there—he was standing outside; as we passed he touched her by the side as it were, and turned away at once; he was gene<lb></lb>rally there when I was with her—I smelt something immediately like chloride of lime, and I made the remark at the time—I noticed the dress was wet immediately.</p>

I am a Member of the College of Surgeons, and live at 3, Southampton Street, Strand—I was called to the Bow Street Station, and examined "the cape that is produced—I took some away and tested it; it was aqua fortis, nitric acid, which had been thrown or placed on the cape—it is an acid used by jewellers in their trade—I also examined the skirt—nitric acid is of such a nature that it would burn through a woman's drees; it is a corrosive fluid; it would do mischief if it touched the skin.</p>

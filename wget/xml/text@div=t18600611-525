I reside at 23, Sherrard-street—I recollect one evening seeing the prisoner—I do not recollect what evening it was—I was first called on by the police with reference to this matter about 16th April—I do not know very well how long it was before that that I had seen the prisoner—it was either three weeks or before that—I saw him in Marylebone-etreet—I think it was before 10 o'clock—I took him to my house in Sherrard-street—that is not far from where I met him—he asked me if I had got change for a 101. note—I said, "Yes," so when I came in I rang the bell for Mary Ann Barclay, and she came up stairs, and I said, "This gentleman has got a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, will you change, it?"—he gave the note to her, he never gave it to me—she went and brought a bottle of wine, and brought the change back and gave it to him—I do not know exactly how long he stayed in my house; not quite an hour; three quarters of an hour perhaps—we went up stairs to a bedroom together—before Barclay returned, he rang the bell, because he was in such a hurry to get the money and go away—we went up to my room directly he came in—we only went into one room—I have got two rooms—there was a light in the room while he was there—I am quite sure he is the person—I was taken by a policeman to the club, and there I saw the prisoner.</p>

             keeps the house, which is in the parish of St. Luke. The prisoner lodged in the same house for about a fortnight. On Tuesday, the 13th of April, about one o'clock, I came home; I had left three sovereigns in a pocketbook in my box half an hour before; I had seen them on Sunday. The key was in my box; I do not know whether it was locked. I found the pocket-book open, and the sovereigns gone. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and took him about seven o'clock, on Holborn-hill, standing in the street. I got an officer, and gave him in charge. I told him I took him for stealing three sovereigns - he was very sancy, and threatened to strike me; but after he was in custody he said he would tell me all about it if I would go into another room. I said nothing to induce him to say anything; I went into another room with him; he said he took one sovereign on Monday, and on Tuesday, about one o'clock, took the other two, and bought a pair of new boots and a hat with part of it, and he had them on. He was searched at the Compter, and 8 1/4 d. found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Your wife said if I would confess, it would be better for me - Witness. She was with me at the Compter, but was not alone with him, and could not have said anything without my hearing it - I heard her say nothing of the sort.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's. I received the prisoner in charge on Holborn-hill from the prosecutor's wife - I took him to the Compter; they went with me. He was very sancy to the prosecutor, but after I searched him he wished to speak to the prosecutor, and said he would tell all about it. Nobody threatened or promised him anything; the prosecutor went into the passage with him - I followed them soon after, and heard him say that he took one sovereign on Monday, and two on Tuesday - that he bought a pair of boots for 27 s., and a hat for 12 s., and had spent the rest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence.</p>

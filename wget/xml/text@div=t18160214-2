            . I live in Frying-pan-alley, with Thomas Griffiths; it is in the parish of Christ Church. I went out when the shops and lamps were alight; it was between five and six in the evening; it was dark when I went out, so dark that I could distinguish it was night, and not day. Before I went out of the apartment, I shut the shutter too, and bolted it; I locked the door, and left it so. I returned between eight and nine, I had the key, and put into the key-hole, as I thought to open the door; but the door was open; I went immediately to the window, and felt for the box; but the box was gone; a hat, a coat, a pair of boots, two waistcoats, a shirt, a sheet, a pair of breeches, (I can't say for any thing else,) were taken. All the things were in the box when I went out. The quilt from the bed was gone. I should know these things again if I were to see them.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Worship-street. I know the house of the prosecutor is in the parish of Christ Church, Middlesex. On the 2nd of February, I was on duty; I was going down Rose-lane; I was walking on one side of the way, and I saw the figure of a man with a bundle, on the other side of the way; it was about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; I crossed into the highway, and got before the prisoner at the bar: I came up to him, and said, what are you carrying here; he said he was carrying his own things. I told him, the reason I stopped you is because I am Armstrong, the officer; you must give me an account what you have here; he said, boots, a coat, and silk handkerchiefs. I said come into this cook's shop, and I took him, and examined the bundle; I told him I would take him before the magistrate; I took him a little further, and then he said, I will not go one yard further with you, you have not shewn me any authority; I told him I had mentioned my name, and the office I belonged to, and to the magistrate he should go; I never let him go, until I put him in possession of my son, and the bundle also; I opened the bundle, and examined it. I charged the prisoner that night, and he was committed. I gave the bundle to my son, having to drag the prisoner such a length of way. This is the bundle I gave to my son. When I stopped the prisoner with this bundle, it was not two minutes walk from the prosecutor's room, and house. On the morning of Saturday, I saw the prosecutor, and shewed him these things. He came to the office asking for a search warrant. The next day the things were produced in the presence of the prisoner; when the prosecutor saw them, and swore to them. The prosecutor did not tell me what he had lost. The prisoner said that the bundle was his own property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I not shew you the man going a head of me, who gave me this bundle, and did you not say you would have taken him if you had any one to assist you?</p>
               <p>Witness. My lord, he never said any such thing to me.</p>

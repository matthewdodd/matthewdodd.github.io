                  </hi> (City Detective). On Tuesday, 14th August, I was on Cornhill, and, in consequence of information, I watched the prisoner Graves—I saw him in St. Michael's Alley, about fifty yards from the Metropolitan and Provincial Bank—after watching him for about twenty minutes I saw him cross Cornhill, look in the bank, and come out again—Mr. Langham, a gentleman connected with the bank, was with me, and we followed him—he went into a public-house at Norton Folgate—I had previously received a description of Brown—after remaining there a short time he came out with Brown—I went up to them and said to Brown, "You have just recently presented a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at a bank in Cornhill"—I don't think I mentioned the name of the bank—he said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "Where did you get that cheque from? I am a police officer"—he said, "Oh! I had it from that gentleman," pointing to Graves—I said, "I shall take you both in custody; a lady has been recently robbed of that cheque, having had her pocket picked in the City Road"—Graves shortly afterwards said to Brown, "What's the good of telling that lie? You never had the cheque from me"—Brown then said, "No, I did not have it from that gentleman; I picked it up in a taproom of a public-house, and a highly respectable tradesman saw me pick it up"—I asked him for the name and address of that gentleman—he said he lived somewhere in London, but he could not give me his name or address—Brown was not wearing a watch—he had what they call a <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> guard, and a metal ring on—a purse with nothing in it was found on Graves.</p>

               <p>after waiting a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he walked over to our bank, opened the door, looked in, and immediately went off as hard as he could walk—I spoke to Bull, followed Graves, then returned to the bank.</p>

I live at 3, President Street, Goswell Road—on 14th August, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I was standing on the pavement in the City Road, waiting for an omnibus to London—there was a crowd there, in consequence of the bursting of some water-pipe, and I was asked by some woman if I had lost my purse—I felt, and discovered that I had, and my pocket had been cut—my purse contained six sovereigns and some silver, and this cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I immediately gave notice at the bank of my loss.</p>

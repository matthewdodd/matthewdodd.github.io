                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-house at 2, Smithfield-bars. On 12th June, about 8 in the morning, the prisoner Jones and another man brought this tea loose in the basket to my house; it was covered over with paper, and a coat was thrown on the top of it—I had seen the other man once before; they asked me to purchase it; Hayes was not there—I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I did not weigh it at that time because I did not pay the whole of the money then; I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was to pay the other afterwards—the men went away and in about an hour returned with Hayes, and Jones said, "We shall not be likely to call ourselves for the remainder of the money, pay this woman, she is my wife,"—she came on the Tuesday, Wednes<lb></lb>day, Thursday, and Friday—I gave her altogether 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other man, Album, received the rest of the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday—on each occasion that Hayes came for money I made her sign her name to the bill; here it is (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I am the mother of the last witness—on 25th June, the prisoner came to our house—he asked me how I was, and asked me to have something to drink—I refused, and he asked for some water—when it came, he rushed by me into the next room where my daughter had gone—he threw her down—my daughter then screamed out that he bad a knife in his hand—I went into the room and saw them on the ground, and the prisoner had a knife in his hand—it was a knife he had with him, and he was trying to aim at my daughter's throat with it—my daughter was cut; I saw the blood—I had observed the prisoner before this—I did not think he was in his right mind—his conduct was very strange, which was the reason we did not wish him to come.</p>

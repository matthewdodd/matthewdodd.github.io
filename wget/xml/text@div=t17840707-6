               <p>What was his conduct on board that ship? - His conduct with respect to the rising do you mean?</p>
               <p>His conduct in general? - I do not recollect that he was any ways worse than the rest of them, he never did me any harm or injury, not particularly, no more than aiding and assisting the rest, I saw him go from the ship's side in one of the ship's boats, and he never returned, therefore I had no doubt but he went on shore in Devonshire.</p>
               <p>Did those boats row towards the shore? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Prisoner. I beg permission of the Court to read my defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, from the well known justice of this honourable Court, I have not the least doubt of a patient hearing, especially as the hardness of my case is unparalelled in the records of the Old Bailey. I stood here convicted of a robbery, and afterwards received his Majesty's pardon; on the 4th of June I was apprehended in Smithfield, and brought to prison; I pleaded Not Guilty to this indictment, not with intent to give the Court any unnecessary trouble, but to explain the hardness of my case; the robbery I was cast for was attended with such circumstances of behaviour on my part, that the Court thought me not unworthy of clemency, and I was accordingly recommended to his Majesty's mercy, and I was afterwards pardoned on condition of serving in the royal army in the East Indies; but some difficulty arising in putting this pardon into execution, my prosecutor applied to Mr. Townsend, now Lord Sydney, for a free pardon; then I had a pardon on condition of serving on board any of his Majesty's ships or vessels of war; I went on board his Majesty's ship the Prince Edward, two months after, having been six months at my liberty, and I was taken up for not complying with the terms of my pardon, and committed to Newgate, where I continued six months, and was had up every Sessions, and was informed I should be discharged: during the time I was in Newgate, I had a severe illness, which rendered me insensible, and whilst I was in that state I was brought before Counsellor Harrison, who sat as Deputy Recorder. When the sentence of the Court was read to me to be transported to

Whilst I was on board the hulk, I had the mortification of seeing my fellow sufferers die daily, to the amount of two hundred and fifty? several who have had pardons similar to mine, such as

             that was tried and convicted for this highway robbery, and Owen who speaks to the identity of the prisoner, does not go all the length I have seen gone in those cases, for he falls short as to the identity of the man, that was tried in this Court for the robbery of Mr. Downes, now although the prisoner was on board this ship, yet unless he is the man that was convicted of that robbery, he is not the man described by this indictment, and Owen only says the prisoner was convicted for robbing a gentleman in his carriage, now upon reading the indictment, it does not appear how the gentleman was robbed, he cannot even tell you where it was, he says indeed that he was present when the prisoner was brought to the bar, and that he was to be transported afterwards, and that he saw him in the lighter; but the question is whether you are satisfied under all the circumstances of the evidence, that this is the very man who was tried for a robbery on Mr. Downes; if you are satisfied that he was tried for that robbery on Mr. Downes, that this is the identical person, and that he was found at large here, in that case you must find him guilty.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, in his defence he says he was pardoned on condition of serving on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to his defence I did not state it to you, because the facts respecting these convicts will be examined by the Judges, and he has proved nothing, but the facts can very easily be known.</p>
               <p>Jury to Owen. Can you positively swear to the identity of the man who was convicted for robbing Mr. Downs?</p>
               <p>Court. He has not swore that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Somebody ought to prove certainly that he was the man that was tried here for that identical robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. The indictment charges it to be a robbery on Mr. Downs, and Owen cannot go that length, I believe, Gentlemen, I can save you some trouble, I for my own part giving my opinion, am not satisfied with this evidence, I do not think the case is made out; for it must be proved that the prisoner was the man that robbed Mr. Downes, now that he has not been able to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070013"></xptr> prove; Owen certainly does not prove that that man committed the robbery as laid in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Jury. Owen said that he neither recollected the Gentleman's name that was robbed, nor the place where it was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he has seen the prisoner before, he was convicted in December 1781, of a highway robbery, he was present, it was for robbing a Gentleman in his carriage, he knew no more; certainly that does not prove that this was the man.</p>

               <p>Court. If the prisoner makes out his case he then will be discharged, if he does not he will then be sent to his former sentence, and every proper enquiry will be made.</p>

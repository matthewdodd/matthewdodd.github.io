               <p>JOHN KING. On the 21st of January, as I was going home, at two o'clock in the morning, I saw two men ill using the prisoner Ryan; she asked me for protection; I went with her to her own room; I went to bed, and put my watch under the pillow, and in the morning, when I was putting my stockings on, I saw her take my watch and boots and go out, I said "Give me my watch;" she said I should have it; I could not follow, as I was undressed. Marlow had burst the door open, and asked Ryan if she wanted any gin; she fetched the gin, and, in half an hour, she took the things out of the room. I took Ryan at her own room next morning; she said she was very sorry she had committed the robbery - I am sure she said "robbery." I told the Magistrate so.</p>

            . On the 21st of January, Marlow pawned this watch with me, about nine o'clock in the morning; she said she brought it from a friend who was at her house - the prosecutor came in that morning very tipsy.</p>
               <p>RYAN'S Defence. I was letting a friend out; the prosecutor came and spoke to me; he went up; he said he had been with a woman before, and she had robbed him; and in the morning, he said he would thank me to go and get eight shillings on his watch, and then he got me to pawn his ring.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I did not; I had plenty of silver.</p>
               <p>MARLOW'S Defence. I saw him give her the watch to pawn, and she gave it to me to get ten shillings on it.</p>

I was coming down stairs and I heard it, and I went and saw it open, and I came back again and went into my kitchen and found the prisoner and the things were gone, all in the indictment</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Very well.</p>


               <p>Q. Did she come to you at any time, and when? - She did not come to me, I have got some goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get these goods from? - From the Queen's Head, at Downam, the prisoner had lodged one night at this house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to this time? - About the 19th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before she was apprehended? - The night before, I was informed so by the woman of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? - I don't rightly know, but they passed the goods through two or three hands. I took them by the desire of the justice during her absence, and the night after she came to the same house again; and then they sent me word that the prisoner was returned, and I desired the constable that night to take care of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she claim them as her property? - She did, on the 22d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing else to you? - I told her there were some things in the bundle that I had got; I asked her whether they were her's? and she described a black handkerchief as her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she claim the whole of the goods to be her property? - Yes. The whole of the goods that I have now in Court; she described many things that were in the bundle, told me of two different gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present besides yourself? Was any body that is here? - No.(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were they packed up in that box together? - They were packed up in a large black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Levy. That clock is my property; it is a present made to my husband, we have had it upwards of a twelvemonth in our possession.</p>
               <p>Q. To Howe. Do you know the value of a movement of that kind? - They are things that are not saleable in our part of the country; it is an antiquated piece of goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth two guineas? - Surely it is worth more to some people.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Levy. Here is a mode cloak, I know it is mine, it is worth a guinea, but I do not value it at that. This silk gown valued at twenty shillings, but it is worth upwards of forty shillings; a petticoat worth half a guinea; these four gowns are mine, these shoes are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen these things? - In the morning I was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you miss them? - Within two minutes after she was gone. I found all my drawers broke open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived servant with Mrs. Levy. She set me to washing on Sunday, and I asked her leave to go out; and mistress and I had words, on account of washing on Sunday, and I was very sorry in my mind, her setting me to washing on Sunday; and I asked her leave to go out about three or four in the afternoon, and I never returned no more home. I have never a friend in the world.</p>

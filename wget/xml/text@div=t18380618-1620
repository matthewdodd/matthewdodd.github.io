                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich. I had known the prisoner about twelve months by seeing him about, but had not been familiar with him—I am unfortunate—on the 11th of June I met him at the Golden Anchor—he went home with me at his request in the first place, and I consented—my house is at the back of the Golden Anchor—we went to bed at twelve o'clock—it was up one flight of stairs—the prisoner fastened the door inside—it was locked and bolted—I am sure of it—he had not given me any money in my house, but he had before given me two six pences, and that was spent before I went to bed—I had a five shilling piece, six shillings, and two sixpences of my own—he was to stay with me all night—my money was put into my box in my room—that was safe before I went to bed—the prisoner saw me count it—I had some halfpence, and I put them into my box—I cannot say that he knew how much I had—awoke between four and five o'clock, and the prisoner was gone I found the door bolted and locked as it was when I went to sleep—nobody could have been in the room but himself—my chamber window was open, which</p>

Mr. Cavendish's stables, it being very dark, Johnson and Bath came up; Bath tripped me up on the left side and Johnson on the right, and I fell on my hip; I had a piece of Russia cloth under my arm; when I recovered myself, I said, what do you want? d - n your eyes, said they, your money. That expression struck me rather in a flurry. I thought it hard to be robbed in that situation, having friends not above fifty yards from me: he held something to the right side of my head which I believe to be a pistol, but it was so dark, I could not see whether it was or no and said, they would blow my brains out: they had both hold of me, and one of them put his hand into my right-hand pocket, when he put his hand into my pocket, he shook like a man that had the palsy or an ague: he took out some shillings and some half-pence, I believe, I cannot say, and the key of my box: they then said, not a word of noise! no, said I, then they ran out of the gate-way, and crossed over to the right-hand side of Oxford Road towards Swallow-Street. As soon as I got out of the gate-way, I cried out three times,</p>
               <p>"Stop robber, on the right-hand side of the way."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your cloth all this time?</p>
               <p>Germain. No, Gray had it; I cannot say which took it up when I was down, but Gray carried it off: they all three ran off together; Gray was behind, Path and Johnson were about six yards before him: on my making the outcry, Gray dropped the cloth by a butcher's shop, the corner of Swallow-street; I took Gray at a little distance from the cloth; the cloth was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130008"></xptr> picked up at the time I caught Gray by the breast; Bath and Johnson made their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this was a very dark night?</p>
               <p>Germain. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Germain. I knew Johnson by fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other two?</p>
               <p>Germain. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively say that Bath is the other man?</p>
               <p>Germain. To the best of my opinion he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now take upon you to swear Bath is one of the persons?</p>
               <p>Germain. He is really one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. From Bath. Whether as it was a very dark night, and you was in liquor, you had sufficient light to swear to us?</p>
               <p>Germain. I was not in liquor, I had been doing business in the Adelphi for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in such a state that you can undertake to swear positively that Bath was one of the persons?</p>
               <p>Germain. I do.</p>

            . I live at the Green Man and Still, in Oxford Road. At about five minutes before ten at night, on the 2d of September, as near as I can guess, I was within a yard and a half of Phenix Yard, three fellows came running out of the yard, the least of whom had a bundle under his arm. I am sure the prisoners are the men; I can swear to their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very dark, was it not?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not so dark but I could distinguish their persons. I am positive to them. As they were running across the road. I stood still to look at them. I could not think why three men should come out of the yard at that time of the night; in about a minute Germain came out of the yard, hollowing,</p>
               <p>"A robbery! a</p>
               <p>"robbery! a robbery! on the right hand-side</p>
               <p>"of the way." I turned round, and pursued them. I came up with the little one, (Gray) and laid hold of him. He had not the bundle then; but he had it under his arm when he passed by me. A tall thin man made a catch at the two big ones, who were about four paces before the little one. He missed them, and they got by him. I came up to the little one, just as the prosecutor got hold of him. I know nothing of the taking of the other. I heard one of the big ones say to Gray, as they ran across the road,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, make</p>
               <p>"haste, or else they will be after us."</p>
               <p>Q. From Bath. Do you know any thing of me?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; I know you by your having a very sharp cocked hat on, and being the first that passed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. From Johnson. Can you swear to me?</p>
               <p>Germain. Yes, by your dress. You had such a coat on as you have now; it was a loose bodied coat. I cannot swear to the colour. I can swear positively they are the men that passed by me.</p>

            . I am a constable. When Gray was in Marybone watch-house, he informed me, that Johnson and Bath were the two persons that were concerned with him in this robbery on Saturday night; that they were all three in company together; he told me, I might find them in Dyot-street, St. Giles's. I went to Dyot-street, and there I found Johnson; He told me; his name was Johnson, otherwise Dusty. I put him in a coach, and took him to the watch-house: then I went to Duck-lane, Westminster; there I took Bath, and brought him in a coach to the watch house. Gray, when before the justice, said, he hoped to be admitted an evidence, as the other men were taken by his information. Mr. Barnfather desired me to mention it in his favour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise made to him, if he discovered the other men?</p>
               <p>Elliot. No. The justices, on the contrary, said, as he was a party concerned, they could not admit him; but desired me to mention him to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was first taken by you, did you promise him any thing?</p>
               <p>Elliot. When he was first taken, and brought to the watch-house, he denied every thing; and on the Monday following, he denied knowing any thing of the matter, till the prosecutor came, and said, he could swear positively to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130009"></xptr> him; then he told me, if I would go with him into a room, he would tell me all he knew of the matter; it was upon that I said I, would use my utmost endeavours to get him cleared.</p>

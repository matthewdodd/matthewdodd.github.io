            . I live in Smithfield, and am a money-dealer. On the 15th of April, the prisoner presented a cheque for 2l. at my office - the payment had been stopped; I asked him how he got it - he said he found it at Temple-bar the night preceding - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN DANGERFIELD. This cheque is payable to me - it was in my possession on the 14th of April; I took it about eight o'clock that morning, of Mr. Rhodes, the drawer, in Wellington-street, Strand; I had it safe about eleven o'clock, when I was on Tower-hill - I was at <placeName id="t18280529-256-crimeloc1411">Limehouse-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not drunk? A. No - nor was I sober; I could have walked home - I live at East Ham; I cannot say that I ever saw the prisoner - I was not in Fleet-street that day - Yes, I was certainly, but I did not drink till I got to Tower-hill: I went to two public-houses; I drank nothing but gin and beer - I was on Tower-hill about ten o'clock in the morning; I cannot tell what houses I went into, or at what times I drank - I was not at four public-houses; I went and stopped the cheque next morning - I was knocked down by the side of the river.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Between eleven o'clock in the morning and nine at night, did you see your cheque safe? A. Yes; between four and five - I walked home that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going to Temple-bar to my uncle's, I found a piece of paper; I kept it till next morning and asked the gentleman if it was payable.</p>

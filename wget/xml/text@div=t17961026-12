             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. I was sent by Pletherick, the constable, to the prisoner's house three days ago, I believe it was Monday; she sold me one shillingsworth of halfpence, and she gave me 20d. for a shilling; she asked me who I came from; she did not like to let me have them, because she did not know me; I told her a barrow woman sent me that dealt with her; she said, I might have four pennyworth of farthings for a good twopence, but I had not got any good money; she said I might have a pound's worth of halfpence if I pleased; I saw a great quantity of papers, which appeared like five shilling papers of halfpence, in the room where the bad remained, and I went and laid the information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. What are you? - A. A <rs id="t17961026-12-viclabel73" type="occupation">green-grocer</rs>

               <p>Q. You were quite a stranger to this woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet, though you were a stranger, she carried on this traffic as you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were employed by a constable to go to her? - A. Yes; because they were afraid of being known; he went with me and showed me the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to have a little knowledge of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260017"></xptr>business, you talk of five shilling papers? - A. They looked to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to enable you to judge what they were, you must have been pretty well acquainted with that sort of traffic? - A. I saw them lying upon the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been pretty well acquainted with that sort of traffic, to have known that they were five shilling papers? - A. I have been in many shops where they wrap up five shilling papers, and they looked like them; I only swear what I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you were never acquainted with the form of five shilling papers before, you take upon you to say, you saw a great many papers in this woman's house? - A. Yes; that looked like them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were open to every body's sight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a witness before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath? - A. Upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave an information about hair powder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor about the lottery? - A. Yes; I took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, why did you say you had never been an informer? - A. I said, not about hair powder; I did in the lottery, and that was for the good of my King and Country, and so is this; bad money ought to be stopped.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never give any information for any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there was such a thing as the glove-tax, don't you? - A. I will take my oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.Not upon any other tax but the lottery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer pays you for your coming here, you know? - A. I don't do it for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath are you not paid for doing it? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath don't you expect it? - A. I have not been promised.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you not been promised? - A.Only what they please to give me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to the prisoner's house in Angel-court, and over-shot the door; we went past the house; a brother-in-law of that good lady knew me; I turned back to go into the house, and I saw her brush down the stairs; I went into the parlour, and a person that was with me went to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any bad money? - A. I found in the fire-place these bad sixpences and halfpence and farthings, that was under a saucepan upon the fire hot, and some had got upon the coals, and I raked some out of the ashes; then we took the man and her into custody, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given Flowers instructions how to act? - A. I did; I told him to go and buy some money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Who went first into this house, Flowers or you? - A. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not Flowers go in first? - A. I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was natural for you to send Flowers in first? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that without any difficulty you got in? - A. I got in because the street-door was open, but the parlour-door was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that this money was taken off the fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not such halfpence as are every day in circulation; do you mean to say these are halfpence that are newly made? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know they are always black and greasy before they are sold? - A. I cannot tell; I suppose the fire would take that off.</p>

I left it on Saturday night all safe - the sashes were in the frames, but not hung; we went on Monday morning; the sashes were then taken out, and the glass taken out of them. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house with the glass, and took the dimensions of the glass there; we have since fitted the glass to the sashes, and the little pieces which have been clipped off the sashes - they correspond exactly. I have a strong belief that they are Mr. Palmer's property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About five minutes before twelve o'clock on Sunday night, I stopped the prisoner in the New-road, about a quarter of a mile from Osnaburg-terrace, with these twenty-nine frames of glass on his shoulder - it has been compared with the sashes, and fitted exactly - I asked what he had got; he said they were books, which a gentleman had given him to carry to Gray's-inn-lane. I took him to the watch-house - he shook very much; the officer has got the glass, and I cannot find him.</p>

            . There were thirty-six pance in the sashes, but some pieces were left behind - they had been broken in getting them out; the panes are four different sizes - we have tried two sizes, and measured the others - they fitted exactly in size and number and corresponded with the small pieces left in the corner of the frames.</p>

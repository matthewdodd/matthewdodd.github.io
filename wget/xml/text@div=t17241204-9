             deposed, that on the 26th of October she put 80 Guineas into a Cup, and lock'd it in her Father's Cupboard, which was in his Bed-Chamber. That her Father, in the beginning of November, just before he went to Dunstable Fair, sent her up to fetch him some Money; at which time she miss'd 13 Guineas, but did not tell her Father for fear of Anger, nor her Sister till her Father was gone. When her father return'd, he gave her some Money to lay up, and then she miss'd 5 Gunieas more, of which she told her Sister. They then searched the Cupboard, and found that a Board on the top of it had been loosen'd and taken up. Their Father died. They examined all the Servants; but no body was more suspected than the Prisoner, because the Prosecutor being a <rs id="t17241204-9-viclabel49" type="occupation">Higler</rs>

Mary Montague deposed to the same Effect, and added, that in searching the Prisoner's Trunk, they found the half Yard of Sattin mentioned in the Indictment, which she produced in Court.

             deposed, that having bought a Piece of Sattin for a Suit, she left it at her Father Montagne's, to the Charge of the Prisoner; and fetching it away again when she went home to Bedford, and there sending for her Mantua-maker, they found it was half a Yard of Shorter than when she bought it. That the half Yard that was afterwards found in the Prisoner's Trunk was exactly of the same kind, Stripe and Colour. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that none of the Rooms in the House were kept lockt; that people were frequently coming in, and the other Servants often going up and down Stairs, and might know as well as the where the Money was kept. That she was busy a Washing when the Money was lost, and could not observe every body that came in and out. That the Sattin was given her two Years ago; and that her Masters Daughters had several times bought new Cloths without his Knowledge; and that he had often complain'd of it, and said, he was at more Charges now than when his Wife was alive.

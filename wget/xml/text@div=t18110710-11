               <p>Mr. Alley. He stated that he had laid a wager with two friends, they said that he could not pick your pocket - A. He said that he had said a wager that he could do it without my knowing it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no other defence than what has been before said. When I found the mistake and the error I had done, he gave me in custody, and as for the property I had not got it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

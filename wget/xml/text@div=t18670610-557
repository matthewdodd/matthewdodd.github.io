                  </hi>. I live at 2, Newchestcr Street, Paddington, and am a wheelwright, working at the Great Western railway—the prisoner is a labourer, working in the same shop—on Saturday, 4th May, about four o'clock, the prisoner and Chapman were in the shop—there was the buffer of a railway truck there, Chapman could not get the spring off—the prisoner said, "I will lay you a shilling I can get it off"—Chapman said, "You are a b—old liar" (he was about forty-four years of age, the prisoner is upwards of fifty)—the prisoner said he could—Chapman after<lb></lb>wards said some b—b—had pulled it up higher—Hunt said no one had touched it—Chapman said, "You are a drummed-out old soldier," making use of very bad language—Hunt said, "If you call me that again I will punch your head off"—"So you are, so you are," he said, repeating it over and over again, and Hunt up with his fist and struck him twice—Chapman hit him again—eight or nine blows were exchanged—Chapman hit Hunt rather harder than Hunt hit him—they had a scrimmage, round the shop—Chapman ran against a tool-chest and fell, and Hunt upon him—one of the workmen pulled him off—Hunt then pulled off his cap, put it on the bench, and said, "Come on, come on"—Chapman said, "Go away"—Hunt was excited, his nose and cheek was bleeding, and he struck Chapman on the right side of the ear, and he fell down dead—they were both excited and out of temper, they were only joking at first—I have known the prisoner a good while—I never knew anything bad of him; he was always a good labourer to me and Chapman also.</p>

               <p>As you understood; you did not go up stairs did you? - No, Sir, I did not, I understood he was there, I asked her to sit down, but she would not, she said, she would go to bed, she had not had any rest for some time, she went and laid there for some time, and very still they were for some time, I cannot say how long; by and by I heard her say to him, are you going to get up.</p>

               <p>Is it possible that such a scene as this should pass, and that you should not ask him what he had done, or what he was doing, or why he had done it? - I laid hold of his arm, but I asked him no questions, and he said nothing to me.</p>

               <p>Had you seen him in the course of that day? - I saw him in the morning going to work, about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>You do not work very near him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you meet him in the course of that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him in the morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you spoke to him within a week before? Yes, but I cannot say when.</p>

               <p>Had you within three days? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Now, my friend, did it not strike you as something odd, that the woman should come and desire you to sit in the room below? - As my wife sat with me, and I was going to bed, I did not ask her nothing, and she told me nothing what it was for.</p>
               <p>When she went up stairs to go to bed, did not you ask her how long you was to stay there? - No, she said nothing about how long I was to stay or nothing.</p>
               <p>Did Jones say any thing to you how long you was to stay? - I supposed no longer than the morning that we went to work.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her, why she supposed her husband would hurt her? - No.</p>
               <p>How did they live together before? - I do not know, I never was acquainted with them, I never was at their house above once or twice in my life.</p>
               <p>Would not you have thought it a very odd thing, if your wife had sent for a man to have come and staid in your house all night, while she and you were above stairs? - I do not know, it was something odd to be sure, I could give no account about it.</p>
               <p>Had you observed any thing remarkable about the man or the woman before that time? - No, the woman was always a very good sort of a woman.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he? - A very good sort of a man all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was he a sober man? - I never heard that he was given to drinking, I was not acquainted with them any otherwise than living neighbours by them.</p>
               <p>It seems to me, by your account, you might as well have lived a thousand miles off? - I never go to any body's house but my own, and that is best.</p>
               <p>Did you and he never meet at an alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any alehouses in your parish? - There is two.</p>

             came in after his wife, and he said, Nan, what do you mean by leaving me to myself? says he, you be not afraid of a man, you never used to be afraid of a man.</p>
               <p>What answer did she make to that? - She said, no; he then said, come along and go to bed; so I got up, and said, neighbour, how do you do; and he said the same to me, how do you do; then she asked me to go along with them into their house.</p>
               <p>He being present? - Yes, he said come along and go to bed, let any body come, I do not care who comes; so I went along with them.</p>
               <p>Is that all he said at that time? - Yes; when we came to their house, there was another woman at the door, and we went and followed Walker and his wife in doors.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between that other woman and them before you went in? - As soon as we were in, he locked one door and fastened the other, and he said, says he, I want to settle affairs with my wife, and she will not resolve me; she said she would resolve him any thing that lay in her power.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the very words that she said? - Yes, them were the very words.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell it me in the manner she spoke it? - She said she would resolve him any thing that lay in her power.</p>
               <p>I want you to put yourself in her place, and tell me the words that she said? - I do now; she said she would resolve him any thing that he asked her.</p>
               <p>But you know she must have said, I will resolve you? - Yes, she said, I will resolve you as far as lays in my power.</p>
               <p>Did she say husband, or my dear, or any expression of that kind? - No, she did not; so he wanted to go to bed, and she took the coals up, and he went to bed, and she went up stairs with him, and warmed his bed, I believe.</p>
               <p>Leaving you and the woman below? - Yes, she came down again when he was in bed, and told this other woman and us, that how he had drawn his knife upon her six weeks ago in bed, before that time, and on the Wednesday night before that in bed.</p>
               <p>That is the last Wednesday night you mean before you was there? - Yes, and he had drawn his knife on her on the Thursday morning following, and said he would give her time to say her prayers, and then he would kill her; then Samuel Woods came to the same house.</p>
               <p>Was that all that she said at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she say how it happened he did not kill her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her how she saved herself? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her what they had quarrelled about? - No, I asked her no questions at all concerning the affair she told me about.</p>
               <p>Had you no curiosity to know what should make the man draw his knife upon the woman? - No; then Samuel Woods came, and she asked him if he would be so good to go down to the overseers, because they had promised her that they would send somebody, and they had not sent any body to put in the house.</p>
               <p>For what? - Because she was afraid to be in the house when there was nobody else in the house but they and the children.</p>
               <p>Why was she afraid to be in the house, did she say? - I cannot tell, she did not resolve me any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Why did she send to the overseers, why<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270029"></xptr> did not she send to the constable to come and take him away, if he drew his knife upon her? - That I cannot tell any thing at all about; so Samuel Wood he went to one overseer, and he was not at home, then he went to the other, and he saw one of them, I cannot tell which, and came back, and brought word, that if she could get any body to be in the house, they would satisfy them; then she went and asked

               <p>Then the woman went to bed you say? - Yes, and in about two hours and a half after this, Walker came down stairs in his shirt, and said, what, my lads! to the other man and me; so I said, what do you come down stairs without your clothes for; he never spoke no more, he went up stairs again, and in about two hours and a half after this, as nigh as I can guess, he says to his wife, Nan, who is to pay these two men?</p>
               <p>Did not you drop in sleep in all this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you sit talking to one another, or what? - I cannot say that we did not speak to one another, but we heard every word that was said; she said, do not make yourself uneasy, they will be paid I warrant you; so Walker says to his wife, says he, Nan, you must satisfy them; says she, do not make yourself uneasy, go to sleep if you can, you have not had any a good while; Mr. Morton will satisfy them; and in about a minute or two before the accident happened, he says, Nan, where is the pot?</p>
               <p>How long did they lay after this before he said that? - About two hours.</p>
               <p>What two hours more? - Yes, and she said, shall I reach it you, and he said no, and there was not another word more spoke, till she began screaming out, and from the time she began screaming out, they were down stairs in a very short time, and this other man and I went to the stairs foot, and they both came down directly upon us, I laid hold of his left hand, and said, Walker, what are you at, what is the matter with you? he never spoke, and when we released him from her, she dropped all along upon the ground.</p>
               <p>How was he holding her then? - With his arm round her neck that I laid hold on, so she dropped, and he stamped his left foot on her.</p>
               <p>Describe the manner of his stamping his left foot upon her? - So, (a sort of stamp) then she got up and run out of doors, and tumbled down on the left hand side of the door, and he ran out after her, and I had hold of his left arm, and he pulled me along after him, then she got up.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to her, or do any thing to her out of doors before she got up? - No, he did not touch her then as I saw, she got up and fell down again; there is a hurdle on the right hand side of the door, and

               <p>She made no answer then to what he said about her trying to kill him? - No, Sir, I never heard any answer to that, that was the last that she said.</p>

               <p>Did you hear him answer any body to that question? - No, Sir, I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270032"></xptr>Did you ever hear him say, in answer to that, whether he was or was not sorry for what he had done? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long had you known the man before this thing happened? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Have you been often in his company? - Yes, several times, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>At his house? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>What aged woman was his wife? - I cannot tell, I have not been in the place above four years.</p>

               <p>Did they seem to live in friendship with each other? - Yes, Sir, as far as ever I saw.</p>
               <p>You know it is easy, if you was often at his house, to see whether either of them was of a quarrelsome temper, or whether they quarrelled with each other, or were upon good terms? - I never saw them when I was in the house, but I have heard her cry out many times when I was in my own house, I lived next door to him till within a fortnight.</p>
               <p>What sort of cries? - Cry out, O Lord, her head, or her arms, or her shoulders, or such a matter as that.</p>
               <p>Did you live nearer than Branch? - Yes, their chimney piece and mine were close together, and the two doors were not above three yards apart.</p>
               <p>Then you was near enough to hear a great deal that passed between these people when you was not in their house; did they live in bad terms, quarrelling, or in friendship together? - Whenever I was in their house I never heard them have a word amiss.</p>
               <p>I am not asking you that you know, I ask you when you was not in the house? - I never heard any words pass, only she would cry out.</p>
               <p>Did you hear nothing before that that led to it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did she complain of? - I never heard her say.</p>
               <p>But at the time that she cried out, could not you understand from her expressions what it was she was complaining of? - No, Sir, not at all, she was a woman that was very still woman, and hardly ever went to any body's house but her own, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Kept company with nobody, I suppose? - Nobody at all, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Did she take care of her children? - Yes, Sir, as much as any woman did, for all that ever I saw or knew.</p>
               <p>Was their house well taken care of and kept clean? - Yes, Sir, as clean as most poor people's houses are.</p>
               <p>Did she seem an industrious sober woman? - Yes, no woman more so, I believe, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man or a single man? - A married man.</p>
               <p>Your wife lived the next door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many children have you? - One.</p>
               <p>How long have you been married? - Little better than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Was he a sober man? - Yes, Sir, a very sober man, as far as ever I heard, any further than having a pint of beer and away.</p>
               <p>What tempered man was he? - I cannot say what his temper was.</p>
               <p>Was he a quarrelsome man? - I never knew nor saw any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell whether he was a good tempered man? - No, Sir, I cannot indeed.</p>
               <p>Have you any notion what it was he took amiss of his wife? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You cannot guess what it was? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had any thing passed before this happened that could give you any guess what it was he took so ill of his wife? - No, Sir, I know nothing at all of it any further.</p>
               <p>How long before this happened had you seen him? - This was the Thursday night, I had not seen him since the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Had you spent any time with him? - No further than we spoke together.</p>
               <p>How long before this accident happened was it that you heard her cry out of her head or her shoulders? - It might be quarter of a year, or it might be more, or it might be less.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270033"></xptr>Where did you see him the Saturday night before? - At his own door.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be in health then? - Yes, Sir, as well as ever he was, as far as I saw.</p>
               <p>You took no notice of any thing extraordinary about him? - No, Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>Had he ever talked at any time that you have observed, in any thing of a wild way? - No, Sir, I never heard him talk no other ways than as another man does.</p>

               <p>Then by your account I do not find that you had any suspicion that he was not in his right mind? - No, Sir, I had no suspicion as any thing was the matter with him not before the accident was.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful to me, my friend, when the woman talked of sending for the overseer, to desire that he would send somebody to be with them, as you know they had lived upon good terms, and had not quarrelled, that you did not ask the cause? - No, Sir, I could not think any thing about it.</p>
               <p>What could you suppose the overseer should be applied to for? - God knows, Sir, I do not know.</p>
               <p>They did not want money? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Then according to your account you had no suspicion that the man was out of his mind? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You had never seen any thing to lead you to suppose so? - No, Sir, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Does any thing occur to the Jury, I should be glad to have all possible assistance in this case, it is one of the most extraordinary cases I ever met with.</p>

               <p>A clasp knife open and a little bloody? - Yes, the deceased was not dead at that time, and I ran home for a horse to go for a surgeon, and while I was getting that and returning, the deceased was dead; I immediately got assistance and secured the prisoner, and took him up to the other constable's house, and kept him there till about eight o'clock in the morning; then we took him to Uxbridge, to Mr. Fellows's, and he said, he could not commit him till the Coroner's inquisition, the other constable took him Uxbridge, and I went for the Coroner, he was not at home, but he came on the Monday following, the 8th of March, and he took the inquisition, I was examined there and bound over, I took the prisoner to Newgate on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you and him at any time that was remarkable? - When I seized him with another man, he said, I will not hurt you, you may do what you please; I had not the handcuffs with me, but I got a cord and pinioned his hands, and I went home for the handcuffs.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing about it afterwards? - Not that day, but the day I was going to Uxbridge with him, I asked him if the handcuffs pinched his hands, and he replied, it is no matter about my hands, if they were pulled off, after what I have done; I heard no more, I went down from Uxbridge to the Coroner's, I went to see him once at the other constable's house, and told him to think of his latter end, and he asked me for a book that was down at his house, I asked him what book it was, and he said it was The Sincere Word of God; I went down to his house, and found the book, and carried it to him, and he thanked me; the other constable brought him in the chaise to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him often before this thing happened? - Yes, as passing by him; I saw him at work about a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>How did he look? - He looked very well, but rather disturbed that something troubled him.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice of his countenance, his eyes, whether there was any wildness? - I did not take notice that there was any wildness.</p>
               <p>Did he look paler than ordinary, or redder than ordinary? - No, my Lord, much the same.</p>

               <p>You did not happen to take hold of the man's hand? - No.</p>
               <p>If it had happened to you to have thought of calling upon the overseer, and sent an apothecary to this man, probably the losing of a little blood, and a little medicine would have saved all this? - Yes, my Lord, but I did not think that there was any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270035"></xptr> thing, but somewhat had troubled him; I did not know whether it was in his family, he did not say what.</p>

               <p>Jury. During the time that you had the prisoner in your custody, did he shew any marks of insanity? - No, I was very little with him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is something a little ambiguous in that, he might not shew marks of violent insanity, yet there might be a great deal more to be collected from that, than this man could observe; they are apt to think no man insane that does not do outrageous things; but we must collect his insanity from the fact - his mind seems to have turned to one object.</p>

               <p>What did she say to him? - I do not remember she made any answer to him, and I said, Walker, if you hurt your wife you hurt yourself, and I entreated him to sit down and make himself easy, but he was not willing; and he said to me, I want her at home, I have got some business to settle with her; so I says to this Jones that was in my house, go along with them, and I will come to you as soon as I have had my supper; when I had had my supper, I went, and when I came to the house the street door was shut fast, but Jones or somebody let me in, I cannot say which; when I came in, they told me he was gone to bed, and I went to the foot of the stairs and called to him, and said, Walker, what be you in bed, and he said, yes; then I went down to the overseer, Mr. Morton.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to the overseer, who sent you? - The woman told me that she had been to him, and he had promised her to send somebody to her; he was not at home, then I went to the governor of the workhouse, to ask him if he had seen Mr. Morton, or had got any body to be along with Mrs. Walker; he said he did not know that he had; Mr. Morton had been about the village to try to get somebody to sit up with him in the house, and that he would satisfy any body that would sit up with him; then from there I went back to the prisoner's house, and the woman met me at the door, and asked me if I had done any thing for her, that was, whether I had got any grant for any body to be with her that night; I told her, yes; and she says to me, I wish you would sit up with

               <p>Had the woman ever asked you before to come and sit up in the house? - No, my Lord, she never did.</p>
               <p>What was you to sit up for? - I do not know, there was somewhat I imagined.</p>

               <p>What did you understand to be the matter? - It seemed from what I thought, I cannot say any further, that this man must certainly have made some attempt to do something that he should not do with this woman, or else she would not be afraid to be with him by herself.</p>
               <p>If he had made any attempt upon her, the constable should have been sent for rather than the overseer, and she should not have been left in the house along with him. - That would certainly have been the right way; I was with Walker on the Tuesday before the accident, I heard he was not well, and I went to his house, when I came into his house, there was nobody but a young lad besides himself, and I asked him how he did, and he said he was very poorly, that he was in a very poor way; and I asked him what was the matter, and he said he could give me no account; and he went about the house trembling, the man seemed in a great flurry in his behaviour, as far as I could see, he walked backward and forwards; I asked him the reason, he said he was in a great flutter, and it came upon him at times, and then he got better when the fluttering went off, and he cried, and told me that he should be hanged, and that the neighbours said he bewitched people, and so he went on in that form in that discourse; and I told him there was no such thing, he must not fill himself up with such fancies, and he cried, and said that he had never done nobody no harm, and his wife was to have him away in a cart, and he was to be hanged; I tried to persuade him off of any thing of the kind of such nonsensical talk; his wife was gone to Mr. Morton's, I believe, at that time, and he seemed to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270037"></xptr> in a great flurry because his wife was not in the way; and he asked me if I would go and fetch his wife, I told him to make himself easy, she would not be long before she was back again, and he still seemed to be very uneasy; at last I said, well, Mr. Walker, if you are willing, I will go and see for your wife, and I went out into the yard which comes into the street, and I saw her coming down the street, and I went and told him she was coming, and she came in while I was there, into the house, with a man with her, which she had been up to get to be with him that night.</p>

               <p>Did he speak to her when she came home? - I do not recollect that she did.</p>
               <p>Because you have told us he was uneasy and impatient because she was not at home; did not he ask her where she had been, or what the man was brought for? - To the best of my knowledge he never spoke at all; then I went away.</p>

               <p>Was this the first time you ever knew of the man's being ill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before that time, how did he and his wife live together? - I never lived nigh enough to know any thing of their affairs in their living way.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he, was he a quiet man? - As nigh as ever I knew in my life, I never knew any misbehaviour of the man.</p>
               <p>What character did she bear? - As good a character as any woman, a quiet, steady, harmless woman.</p>
               <p>And you do not know of any thing that should have occasioned any unhappiness between them, do you? - None at all, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did he ever drop any thing of being jealous of her? - I never heard any thing of that in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you examined by the coroner? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you was applied to sit up, you say you refused because you was afraid, what was you afraid of? - I tell you, Sir, I had been with him on the Tuesday before, and I saw him run on talking a heap of stuff, and I thought that he seemed like a man not fit for me to be with; and another thing, I knew he was a strong powerful man.</p>
               <p>Court. That is speaking more satisfactorily to you, Gentlemen, than if he had said he was mad.</p>

               <p>Did she tell you the reason? - No, she did not tell me, she said she was rather fearful of being in the house by herself.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether he had used her ill? - She told me that he had used her ill of the Wednesday night, I went in of the Thursday morning after a bit of fire.</p>
               <p>Did she describe in what manner? - Yes, she said he got up an end in his bed about twelve on the Wednesday night, and he pulled his knife out of his pocket, and he opened it, and he took hold of her arm, and pulled her up an end in her bed, and said, damn you, you bitch, I will give you time to say your prayers; then I never heard any more of them till the morning that he had killed her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her then, that he was mad? - No Sir, I did not think he was mad, I never saw him any ways mad, he spoke as well as any man in the world, and was digging in the garden the day before he killed her in the night.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her what she had done to offend him? - No Sir, She said he was jealous of her.</p>

               <p>You did not see any thing in her behaviour, that gave you any reason to suppose he had cause to be jealous of her? - No, Sir, nor nobody else in the neighbourhood, she was as still and quiet a woman as ever was in the world, and always kept herself vastly close.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to know how long he had been jealous of her, had she ever talked to you of his being jealous of her? - No Sir, nor never made any complaint before, as I heard, to any body.</p>

               <p>What did she say? - She said he had killed the cat, and she had not seen the cat, she said he went out of doors with his axe, and followed her into another old house, and had killed the cat.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner stands indicted for the wilful murder of Ann his wife, by stabbing her in the breast with a clasp knife, giving her thereby a mortal wound, of which she instantly died; he is also charged on the coroner's inquisition: and the result of a very long examination is, that unquestionably, this man has been the occasion of the death of his wife, and that it has happened in the manner described in this indictment, by his giving her not one only, but no less than four stabs in the breast and body, one of which proved mortal, and of which she did in effect instantly die; and the fact being thus clearly proved against him, unless it is established in his favour that he did this under such an impression, and in such a state of mind that ought not to make him answerable for what he has done, unquestionably he is guilty of the crime of wilful murder imputed to him; for he that intentionally, with a degree of deliberation, uses such a weapon in such a manner, must do it for the purpose of depriving the party of life, therefore it is wilful in the strongest sense of that word; therefore the crime stands fully proved against him, unless there can be collected from the circumstances that are in the evidence, something which will amount to a defence for him, by shewing that though his hand was guilty of the crime, his heart was free from it; and the whole care is brought to turn upon a single point, whether this man, at the time he committed this outrage upon his wife, was in his right mind or no, whether he did it from motives of wickedness and malice towards her, or whether he did it under the impression of some distemper of mind which had deprived him of the use of his reason; in which case, though his hand committed the offence, in the consideration of law as well as upon the plain principles of reason and justice, no crime can be imputed to him in doing it.</p>

               <p>I state this to you on the outset, that I may turn your attention to that which is really the question, because there can be no question that he gave these wounds, and if in his right mind, that he has been guilty of a very foul murder, for which he is justly answerable to the laws of his country; on the other hand, if you should really see reason to collect from the evidence, that at the moment he committed the act, he was not in possession of himself, that he was not in possession of his right senses, and of his right mind, but that it was done under the pressure of some disorder of mind, occasioned by something that you and I cannot get to the bottom of, that will make him nothing more than a mere instrument in the hands of Providence, and he not at all answerable to the laws of God or man for what he has done, any more than the simple knife could be answerable that gave the fatal blow: the general outlines of the case led one to have a considerable degree of suspicion, that there would some such point as this arise in the cause, and after I have stated to you the particular evidence, I will endeavour to collect for your use, what those circumstances are that seem most strongly to bear to this point, upon which you are to exercise your judgment, whether the man was in his right mind: the first witness examined was

            , and then added] as far as the narration went, he told the story pretty well, but when I came to examine him to the circumstances, which the story told by him naturally led me to enquire after, I never found a man either so perfectly uninformed, or from whom it was so impossible to extract any thing; it was a singular circumstance related by him that this woman should come to him the first time in her life, to ask him to come and sit up in the house, but it did not strike him as at all extraordinary, he did not ask a question at all about it, when asked he was contented to go, and when there he was contented to stay; in short, nothing could be got from him; however that which could not be got from him, has been got from the other evidences; the next is a more intelligent man by far, one

            , he says [here the learned judge summed up the evidence of Jones and the rest of the witnesses, and then added] Gentlemen, this is the whole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270043"></xptr> of the evidence; the prisoner contents himself with saying he was not at at all sensible that he had killed his wife, that he did it in a state unconscious of what he was doing; and it is from this evidence, and some of the circumstances that are stated in it, that you will be to collect as I told you, the only point which remains in any degree doubtful on this inquiry, and upon which the fate of this man depends; that is, whether at the time he gave these mortal wounds, he was in his right mind or no; against the man, the general tranquility of his behaviour, his conversing with the people like another man, and eating and drinking, and appearing to be conscious of what he had done, endeavouring to justify it, and accusing her of having behaved ill to him; these are all of them circumstances that seem to denote that he was in possession of himself, that he knew what he was doing, that he meant to do it, and that he did it on motives of malice urging him to revenge, for some injury that he had received, or was to receive from her; and there is one circumstance beyond that against him, namely, the circumstance that one of the witnesses had frequently heard her cry out O my head, or my shoulder, or my arm; but whether that was owing to any ill usage received from him, or to an accidental hurt, or to pains in her head or her arms, which might make her cry out, the witness could not tell; however, they all agree in his favour, that she was a very extraordinary good kind of a woman, not likely to give him any cause of a quarrel, and he not a quarrelsome man, and that they lived in a state of good understanding together; this leads one to expect to find, that this unfortunate event did arise from something singular and extraordinary, and not to be accounted for in any way in which people ordinarily account for those dreadful acts of violence, which are committed either from deep malice, or revenge for injuries supposed to be received, or at least from some sudden transports of revenge, for some ill usage received: you find it is most certain from this state of the evidence, that for some days before this woman came to her end, the man had not been so well, and in the same orderly state that he used to be; it is a fact that is beyond all contradiction I think, that the woman was conscious that there was something amiss with him, that she had made complaints to the overseer that there was something wrong, that it was dangerous for her to be in the house with him; and these were not complaints expressive of resentment for ill-usage offered by him to her, for brutality, or any thing for which he should be punished; for she seemed to have tenderness to him to the last; she chose on the last night to go to him, to sleep with him, but if he had treated her as brutal men do women that they have in their power, one would have thought, having men in the house, she would not have gone to bed to him. The constable Tromper seems to me to be an evidence of great credit, and he says, on the Monday at the desire of the woman, he went to talk with the man, she having told him he was not well; there was something the matter with him, she did not know what! - She found him not well, and she had been alarmed with him before: Tromper spoke to him and found him in a condition which should have alarmed him; he complained he was troubled in his mind, he did not know why, but he was, he could not tell what was the matter, but he was troubled and uneasy; I am satisfied that if at that time the state of the man's body had been examined into, he would have been found to have had a fever upon him; I have not a doubt but it was a nervous fever that had seized his spirits: Tromper advised him to compose himself, and go to his work; accordingly the man did. The evidence of what passed on the Tuesday, which is given to you by 
               <persName id="t17840421-13-person222">
                  Samuel

                  </persName>
            , is still more particular; for, on the Tuesday between eight and nine, Wood had heard that the man was not well, he went to his house to speak to him, and at that moment you find the woman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270044"></xptr> gone to the overseer; at that time the woman must have a very strong impression on her mind, that he was not well, and not fit for her to be in the house with alone, and she actually brought somebody with her. The conversation he held with the man that night, was the conversation of a man whose brain was touched, that his neighbours said he had bewitched them, and he should be hanged, and then he talked of his wife's fetching him away in a cart, and that he should be hanged, and all the man could do would not pacify him; he was very uneasy because his wife was not then at home, and she came in with Provender, and he went away without saying one single word; that strikes me as a very singular circumstance: On the Wednesday the woman complained of his having frightened her, and again on the Thursday; and I am sorry to observe that the overseer did his duty very ill, for after these alarms he ought to have done more a great deal than leaving a blind message with the governor of the work-house; his duty would have been to have gone instantly to have seen the man; his duty would have been to have employed a person of skill to have looked at him; the man might have been saved, the woman might have been saved, and all this mischief prevented. In that manner, however it was, and this poor woman gets the two men to sit up, and in the course of that night this fatal accident happened, and it seems to me, as far as I can judge from the result of the evidence, to have happened under the effect of some disorder that had seized the man, and affected his spirits, and deprived him to a certain degree of reason, and that particularly rendered him suspicious, among other people, of his wife; she had been driven to take some care of herself by applying to the overseer; and nothing alarms a man, who has any symptoms of insanity about him, so much as the idea of being taken care of as an insane man; there is nothing that impresses them with so much terror, and there being no medical man present that I know of, I take upon me to say so, it having fallen within my own knowledge, nothing alarms them so much, nothing irritates them so much, as the idea of being treated as insane: I account for the sulky manner in which the man went away when Provender came, and on the next night he followed the woman, persuaded her to go back, but submitted in a a sulky way, and said she might have who she would, and went to bed in a kind of fullenness. If having his mind distempered, affected, disturbed, and deranged; if his madness was pointed against his wife in consequence of their having taken these measures which were fit for her to take, but which he was not in a humour to bear; if he conceived rage against her under that impression of mind, and under that impression did this fatal act, he certainly ought not to be considered as a man in his sober senses; but it is the unhappy effect of the distemper that was upon him; and I think we should not do justice to the case, considering the character of the woman, considering the manner in which they had lived together for a long while; the woman an extraordinary woman; the man, a quiet, sober, inoffensive man, if we did not look for something extraordinary to account for this tragedy; and if you do find symptoms of disorder, of disease, by which the man was apparently affected on the Monday, and on the Tuesday, by which that fatal act was committed; and if those expressions of rage and resentment against the woman is to be accounted for most naturally by his conceiving a wild prejudice against her, for her having brought people into the house to guard her and her children; that is a very different thing to that wilful and deliberate thing which the law calls murder: - Where men suffer their passions to get the better of their reasons, and do in transports of rage commit this crime, they must answer for the consequences; but rage which is the effect of distemper, is brought upon them by the act of God, and not by themselves, and they are not answerable for what they do in those moments. Gentlemen, upon the result of as careful an examination as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270045"></xptr> could make, it appears to me, that this was the unhappy effect of rage against this woman, conceived in consequence of distemper of mind, brought on by disease, and that under that impression the violence was committed. The man's afterwards coming to his senses will not alter the nature of the case, if it was committed under the impression of insanity, and the mind disturbed and deprived of its powers of governing the man: he is not answerable, and you must find your verdict, Not Guilty: Indeed he is either guilty of the crime of wilful murder, or he is a mere machine; but if you think that this was all artifice, and there was no disorder, that he did it cooly and deliberately, to satisfy some purpose of his mind, then he is guilty of the murder; but if it is, as I confess it appears to me to be, the effect of insanity, you must then find him not guilty.</p>

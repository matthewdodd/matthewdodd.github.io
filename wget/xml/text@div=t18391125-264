The prisoner worked for us—on Thursday, the 7th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, as she was leaving, I told her I was sorry to put an unpleasant question to her—that I had lost a great many things, but never suspected her till the last time she was there at work, and then I missed several articles, which she must have taken away—she said she had not—I said, "I believe you have articles belonging to us about you now"—she said she had not—I called in a policeman, and found under her clothes, between two pet<lb></lb>ticoats, drawn up with a string, 33/4 yards. of long cloth, which I missed from a trunk where she had been sitting at work, and a pocket handkerchief, which I had missed the last time she was at work, was in her pocket—I went with the policeman to search her premises afterwards, and all these other things were found there—in a drawer, of which she had the key, was found a veil, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., this piece of muslin, and this ribbon, which I had missed the last time she was at work.</p>

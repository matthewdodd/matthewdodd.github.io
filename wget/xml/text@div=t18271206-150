On the 11th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home, having supped at Islington; the prisoner overtook me in the City-road, near the wall of the Vinegar-yard - he caught hold of my arm; I was rather startled, and told him to be off - he was quite a stranger. I kept walking on - he kept close to me, and said, "Will you stand something to drink?" I made no reply; he still followed me, and asked me again - he pretended to be quite drunk, but certainly was not so; he asked me if I would toss up for something to drink; I still walked on, and said, "No, Sir, I am not in the habit of tossing, or drinking with strangers;" and that I considered he had had enough; he then crossed Old-street-road, and again laid hold of me - he staggered; he asked me for something to drink - I told him to be off, and not insult me, and pushed him away; he said he did not intend to insult me, he knew I was a gentleman, and had plenty of money, I told him it was of no consequence, and told him to be off; he came up and tapped my trousers pocket, and again asked me to toss him to drink - he repeated the same question several times; I walked a little way further - he came and tapped my pocket again, said he knew I had plenty of money, and caught hold of my arm again - I pushed him away; he turned round, struck me in the eye and breast, and knocked me down - I called Watch! the watchman ran and caught him - he did not appear drunk; when he was taken, he said "It is all right watchman, come along Bob," meaning me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you been at Islington? A. Nearly opposite the new chapel, at Miss Plumbers. I considered myself sober - I had taken brandy and water. I had passed Fountain-place; I was sleeping at a coffee-house in Finsbury-market, as my mother's house was under repair; there are a great many bad women about the Vinegar-yard - I do not think he intended to rob me at all.</p>

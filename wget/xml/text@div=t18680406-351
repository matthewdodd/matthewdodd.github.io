                  </hi>. I live at 33, Great Chapel-street, Westminster, and am a coffee-shop keeper—on Sunday night, 15th March, I went to bed about ten o'clock, and got up about twelve to let some lodgers in, and I then saw the street door safe—I did not let in the prisoner as one of the lodgers—I then bolted the front door—all the house and the things in it were safe at twelve o'clock—about two o'clock I heard a policeman's rattle—I got up, ran down stairs, and saw the front door open—I went into the street, and saw the contents of my shop window scattered about the pavement outside, pies and plates and all—a coat and a pair of boots were lying on the pave<lb></lb>ment outside the door, which the prisoner owned when he come back—I carried the things into the shop—the prisoner was brought back in six or seven minutes by three policemen—I had never seen him before—he was searched and owned the coat and the boots—one of the policemen said that he had heard a noise inside the house, and had stopped outside and stood at the door, and the prisoner came out with a bundle, and when he saw the policeman he threw it down and ran away: that he sprung his rattle and ran after him, and two more policemen met him in, Queen-square and brought him back—the prisoner was asked if the coat and boots were his, and he said, "Yes"—the property is worth about five or six shillings.</p>

On the morning in question, about two o'clock, I was on duty in Great Chapel-Street, Westminster—just as I passed the coffee-shop, I heard a noise inside—I stopped, and saw the prisoner open the door of the house from the inside, and come out—he had a bundle, a coat, and a pair of boots—when he saw me, he dropped the things and ran away—I ran after him and sprung my rattle—I ran about fifty yards into Queen Square, when he was stopped by two policemen, and taken back to the house—the prisoner had no coat or boots on—when we got back, I asked him if the coat was his, and he said both the coat and boots were his—I asked how he got in, he said he came in at the door—I then took him to the station—I afterwards searched the place, and found marks on the wall leading to the first floor window—the prisoner said the</p>

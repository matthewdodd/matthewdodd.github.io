I heard the watchman going one o'clock, I desired her to give me my money again, and I would make her a present of a crown; I called for a light, the other woman brought a light, I looked all about but found no money; then the prisoner snatched the candle out of my hand, and threw it into the fire place, and ran down stairs; I ran after her, and catched her at the door, and held her while the other woman came down; I thought she had the money in her mouth, the other woman put her hand to her mouth, and I heard something fall between them; she went out at the door, they called two men, one named Joe, and where they were to be found. In about 5 minutes two men came, and demanded what was the matter? the other woman was gone, this I had in hold, one of the men seemed to be going to hit me a blow, then I offered her half a guinea if she would give me my money, she would not own any thing of it; soon after that the watchman came, then a man came down stairs with a light in his hand, I looked to see what was fell, I saw half a guinea; I gave her in charge to the watchman, she was taken to the Compter, and the next day before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall, there she denied it, we did not search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Gilyard. I was not disguised as I thought, I had been drinking with an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your money last?</p>

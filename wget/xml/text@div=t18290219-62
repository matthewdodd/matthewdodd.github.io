The prisoner came into our service on the 15th of July - I believe she is single. On Saturday morning, the 3d of January, at half-past eight o'clock, when I came down she was sitting on a chair in the kitchen; I said,"Harriet, have you not opened the house?" she said No, she had been so bad in her inside all night, she could not- I went out to open the shutters, and when I came in she had gone up stairs; a few minutes after Mrs. Cook came down - I saw some marks of blood on a table and chair; I then went into the yard, and saw a stick covered with night soil: I afterwards put a small garden hoe down the privy, and drew it up, when the neck and shoulders of a child presented itself to my view; I did not draw it out - I called my wife, left it there, and went for a constable; I found the child exactly as I had left it: I then went to Isleworth, and brought Mr. Syers - when I returned with him the child had been taken out, washed, and laid on a table- the prisoner had lived thirteen or fourteen months with my sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever see any thing cruel in her conduct? A. Never; about four months after she came to us, we suspected she was in the family way - my sister is married; I did not know where the prisoner's father lived.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. When the prisoner had been five or six weeks with us, I charged her with being in the family way; she said No, she had only caught a cold - I got her some medicine to make her comfortable, and she said she was very well after that; I had agreed for her to leave us at Christmas: I asked her again a few days before Christmas, if she were not in the family way - she said she was not, so help her God; I said the parish-officers would come, she must tell me the truth, and I would be a friend to her; she said I spoke like a mother to her, and she would tell the truth, so help her God it was not so - I then agreed for her to stop longer. On the 3d of January, after my husband bad got up, she came up to me, and said she had been very ill in her inside all night: I said,</p>
               <p>"I heard you go down after four o'clock, but what is the matter?" I put the curtain aside, and said, "Why, Harriet, you have deceived me;" she said she had not: I said, "Why, you have miscarried - go up to bed;" she said,"I have not;" I went down stairs - every thing seemed in confusion; my husband shewed me marks on the work-table, on a chair, and the boxes. I carried her up some tea, and told her she had miscarried - she said, what would I say of her next; I went down, took her up another cup of tea, and asked what she had put in the privy - she said nothing, what would I say of her next, it was no such thing; we then went to seek for the child - my husband put a hoe down the privy; he called me, and I saw a full grown child there - he pulled it a few inches above the soil, on the hoe; when the constable came he got it up - it was washed, and laid on a table, for the medical gentleman to inspect; the *** had not been tied, but I tied it - the child was quite dead, and must have been there some time; she must have been delivered in the kitchen, on a brick floor - after this I said to her, "I know you have miscarried;" she said she had not - I said,</p>
               <p>"I know you have, for the child is found;" she said no more then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Coroner that she said the child did not cry, and she did not perceive that it had fetched breath? A. She said so to the doctor, admitted she had been delivered, and said she sat down in a chair, and almost fainted.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN SYERS, surgeon, of Isleworth, deposed that he had minutely examined the child - that there were no external marks of violence - that the lungs appeared to have performed the function of respiration, and floated freely in water; they had a florid appearance, and assumed the texture which they would, having performed that function; but he could not say it was alive when entirely delivered; if it had fallen on the brick floor it might have been suffocated: he considered it decidedly a case of infanticide, by omission.</p>

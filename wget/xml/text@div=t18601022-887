                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, of 19, Crown-street, Soho—on the evening of 10th September last, I went into the Champion public house and had a glass of ale—I saw the prisoner there—that was the first time I saw him—it was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I could not say exactly to the time—I left shortly afterwards, alone—I called there again between 7 and 8 o'clock and the prisoner asked for some stout, and asked me if I would have drink with him, and I did, and then he said would I toss up for a pint of beer—I did so—he paid for it—we tossed for another, and I lost—I paid for that—after I drank the beer I went out, alone—I returned very shortly—it would be about half-past 8 then—I hardly tasted the two pots of beer, because there were so many of the prisoner's friends there—the prisoner challenged me to play at billiards—I accepted the challenge—we went out from there to another house of which I cannot remember the name—I don't know where it was—I don't know the neighbourhood—then we</p>

               <p>went to the Perseverance, in Steven-street, Lisson-grove; and he asked if there were any billiards there—they did not keep billiards there—he came out of there and said he would take me to another house—when we got a few yards out of there he asked me what time it was; I pulled out my watch to tell him, and before I could tell him the time, he put his arm under my throat, kicked me on the knee, knocked me down, snapped my watch from the guard, and ran away—the guard broke—he ran down a court into a house—I cried out "Stop thief!" and "Murder!"—I was near the public house which I had left; I might be about ten yards—after he went into the house I saw no more of him—I waited at the door till the policeman came—when the policeman came we searched the house, and could not find the prisoner—after that I went to the station and gave a description of him—I was sent for about 2 o'clock in the morning to identify him, which I did—he was not alone—there were three or four more persons with him—I was sober when I left the public house, and when he inquired the time of me—I was not tipsy—I had had two or three glasses—I was perfectly aware what I was doing.</p>

I am barman at the Perseverance public-house, Lisson<lb></lb>grove—I remember the prosecutor and prisoner calling there on 10th Sep<lb></lb>tember—the prosecutor asked if we had a billiard-room—I told him we had not, that we had a bagatelle-board, but that that was engaged, and I should advise him to go home, because he had had a little to drink—they left, and in about five minutes I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" but from whom it proceeded I cannot say, for I was busy.</p>

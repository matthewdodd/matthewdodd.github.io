            . I belong to the General Post office. I am a letter carrier in the General Post office. I was on duty of the 22nd of November last, in the General Post office. It is my duty to carry the letters after they are sorted at the Inland office into the letter carriers office, and to put them on their respective divisions; according as they are sorted I put them there in their proper divisions. This I performed on the 22nd of November.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CRICKETT. I am inspector of the letter carriers in the General Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. Into how many divisions are the paid letters sorted - A. Into twelve, in the first instance; that takes place in the Inland office. A letter directed to Gough-square would be in the sixth division; after it is sorted it would be carried by Parsons into the letter carriers office, to the sixth division; and in the letter carriers office, letters of the sixth division are subdivided into nine walks.</p>
               <p>Q. Into which of these divisions would a letter for the Temple fall - A. Into the Temple-walk; that is one of the walks of the sixth division.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same walk as Gough-square would be - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation did the prisoner hold in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200022"></xptr>office - A. He was a letter carrier for the Temple-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have any business with a letter directed to Gough-square - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the letter carriers assist in sorting letters - A. They do; they assemble round the table, and each sorts for his walk.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18140420-39-person379">Q. </persName>
            When the letters are brought into the office, all persons belonging to No. 6 assemble round the table No. 6, and each take letters for his walk - A. It was the duty of two letter carriers to re-sort the letters for the sixth division.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do all the letter carriers sort the letters - A. No; it is the duty of two letter carriers to re-sort the letters for the nine walks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roe. The prisoner was not one of these men - A. No, he was not. But as it would suit him, he would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. It occasionally happens that letters are missorted, does it not - A. It does, daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter came into the prisoner's hands not in his walk, what would his duty be - A. It would have been his duty to hand it over to the proper letter carrier of that walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Ought not he to have done so before he quitted the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what place is it the usual course of letter carriers to arrange the letters for their own delivery, at what house do they place the letters for their own delivery - A. That is done in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if a wrong letter came into his hands he must have found it out - A. It is possible he might have taken it in error; he might not have seen it; it is the usual practice to arrange them in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of Wood, the prisoner, being there that morning - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that. (The book handed to witness.) - A. This the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. This is an order from the Post-master by which servants in the Post office are directed to sign each note they receive, with the name of the person of whom they receive it, and their own name when they pay it away; the prisoner's name is signed to it - A. It is. It is read over to every servant when they first enter into the office; this was read to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When any person pays money into the Post office is it attended to - A. It is. The receiver general would not receive a note without it is so endorsed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have mentioned that there are sorters and letter carriers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have other officers what you call charge takers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The peculiar office of the prisoner that which he was employed and paid was that of a letter carrier - A. Yes.</p>

On the 25th of May, between eleven and twelve in the day time, I was walking along the street, and met the prisoner—she asked me to give her a penny—I said I had no money in my pocket—she used profane language—I turned round to look at her, and she struck me on the breast—I fell backwards—she put her hand in my pocket, where I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and took out 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was my wages which I had received—I had changed a sovereign—I gave her in charge—I can swear I had two half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—I was quite sober.</p>

On the evening of the 19th, about 8, our foreman gave me information of twelve brushes, and two pots of blacking being under the cellar stairs. About nine o'clock, when the workmen were going out, I desired every man to go up stairs in the parlour; Codey was the first man, he went up two pair of stairs, instead of going into the parlour; he was called down, he then went into the parlour, all the men were there together, I observed I knew one of them to be dishonest, no honest man could have any objection to be searched. I searched Codey, and found a bottle of blacking in his pocket, I then desired him to go into the kitchen on the same floor. A constable came afterwards and produced four or five brushes, he said they had been thrown out of the window.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Matthews; on Tuesday evening, about a quarter before nine, master desired us all to step up stairs into the parlour, the prisoner went before me, instead of going into the parlour, he proceeded up two pair of stairs, I followed him half way up; I told him that I supposed we had come by the room that we were to go into; the prisoner said nothing to that. I returned down again, my master asked the prisoner what he went up there for, the prisoner made him no reply; we all went into the parlour, master searched the prisoner, he took out of his pocket a bottle of blacking; he then asked the prisoner where the brushes were, the prisoner denied any knowledge of the brushes, and said that he had not taken any; the prisoner then was ordered into the kitchen, and me and my fellow servant was likewise, we were to take care of him. When the prisoner had seated himself, he began to be very busy under his apron, observing to me and my fellow servant at the same time, that his life laid in our hands, he drew from his small clothes six or seven brushes, and put them under the sink, he also put two brushes over the cupboard; he sat himself down, in two or three minutes he rose up, took all the brushes, and threw them out of the window into a court at the back of my master's premises.</p>

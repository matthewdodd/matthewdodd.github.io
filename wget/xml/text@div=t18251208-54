On the 10th of November this gown and some other articles hung in my passage to dry; the prisoner came between ten and eleven o'clock, to take some things to mangle; I was up stairs - my husband gave her the things; she made a stop in the passage, and my husband called me down; I missed the gown, which I had seen safe about an hour before. She had often come for things to mangle; she was frequently intoxicated, and(I think) was so then.</p>

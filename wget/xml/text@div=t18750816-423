                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of 4, Chapter Street, West<lb></lb>minster, and am in the employ of Mr. Haynes, of Vauxhall Bridge Road—he is a relation of mine—on 5th July, about 11 o'clock, I was at work at the back of the shop, my sister called me, and on going to the front I saw the prisoner outside—he said <hi rend="italic">to my</hi> sister "Fetch your man out and I will do for you"—I went out to advise him to go away, and he struck at me with his fist—I closed with him to get away, and in the struggle we fell, the prisoner underneath, and before I could recover myself to get up ha struck me on the head with a knife—I got up not knowing I had been stabbed—he closed with me again and stabbed me in my side with a knife—I saw the knife the second time—I lost all consciousness—I did not strike him or challenge him to fight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am also in Mr. Haynes' employ—I know the prisoner—he had been in Mr. Haynes' employ—on this day he came across from the public-house and was blackguarding the mistress—he said "Bring out your fancy man and I will fight him"—that was Robert Haylook, I believe—he said "I will do for him"—of course he got down off the board and held up his hand, and they struggled and fell, and the prisoner pulled a knife out—of his pocket and gave him one stick on the side of the head with the knife and returned it to his pocket—they then had another struggle and he drew it again, and stabbed the prosecutor in the side; I rushed from the shop and pinned him by the arms—I struggled with him ten minutes till we got to the pawnbroker's, where I knocked the knife out of his hand, picked it up and put it in my pocket—there was blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 2, Upper Tatchbrook Street, Pimlico—on 5th July I was called to Haylock and found an incised wound on his head and another on his left side—he was weak and faint and almost in a state of coma from loss of blood—this knife would produce the wounds—the wound on his head was very serious—I attended him ten days, he is well now.</p>

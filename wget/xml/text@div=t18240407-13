            . I am a night patrol. On the 1st of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with two others, standing opposite the White Horse Inn, Cripplegate. I watched, and saw one go towards Fore-street; one crossed, and went up the inn-yard - the prisoner stood there a few minutes, then went down London-wall, and presently the other came from the yard up to him, and gave him a cask; he went down London-wall with it, and the man who gave it to him went towards the White Horse again. I went after the prisoner, stopped him, and asked where he got the cask; he said a man gave it to him to carry to the City-road - I asked where to; he said he did not know, but expected the man was after him - that he was to have something to drink for carrying it. I secured him, and gave information at the White Horse. When the man came from him he was opening a paper, what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. On receiving the cask, he went off with a direction in his hand - A. No; the other had a paper, not him.</p>

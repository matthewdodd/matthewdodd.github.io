There was another way to go down stairs; my wife met her on those stairs, and she had got on a pair of pumps, coat, waistcoat and breeches, which belong to Nathanael Day, and my wig. I seized her by the skirt of the coat at the stair-foot, and said, Young gentleman, where are you going? When I examined her, she said she was over-persuaded to rob her master when she got settled, and she was to meet the person that gave her that advice at Hornsey; she had got the two linnen shirts, the handkerchief, and a piece of linnen-cloth in a bundle: she gave very little account of herself, and said, she was very sorry for what she had done. I hope she will find mercy.</p>

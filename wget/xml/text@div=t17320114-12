            , Beadle. On the 16th of December last, as I was coming by Mr. Finlow's House (the <placeName id="t17320114-12-crimeloc69">Four Swans in Mile-end Town</placeName>

I took her up, and enquired who she was; for presently a great many People were got about me, but no Body could answer my Question: Her Body was all black, and her Legs were perfectly covered with a white Mold. She had on a thin old Crape-Gown, and a Bit of a red Petticoat, but no Shift nor Stockings - By-and-by a Woman came out of the Four Swans , took her under her Arm (for she was light enough) and carried her in; I followed, and still enquired who she was, and at last the Prisoner came, and said it was his Wife. And are you not asham'd to keep your Wife so? says I, she looks as if she was starved, she's nothing but Skin and Bone! No, no, says he, she's not starved. Some of the Company gave the poor Woman a Dram, and she began to come to herself. I desired she might be put to Bed, and taken care of: She was carry'd up Stairs, I would have followed directly, but they refused to let me, for they said they must put her on a clean Shift. Sometime after this, some Women went up, and I followed them into the Garret; and then she had got a Shift on. There was a half-peck Loaf wrap'd in a Cloth, and hanging up by a String: It was very hard and mouldy. I asked, why it was hung there ? and somebody answered, to keep it from the Mice. The Deceas'd being pretty well come to herself, said to me, For God's Sake stay by me! I have been used barbarously ! I am starved to Death! I stay'd with her about half an Hour, and came again next Day. The Lock and Key of her Door were without side: I asked the Reason of it, and was told by the Woman of the House, that it was to lock the Deceas'd up. I found several Bits of hard Cheese lying about the Garret. The Deceas'd said, Those Bits of Cheese are laid for me, and I would eat them if I could, but in the weak Condition I am in, I might as well try to eat a Piece of Board. When they brought me up any Victuals, they used to leave it just within the Door, and if I could not get out of Bed to fetch it, I might lie and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140014"></xptr> starve : And once I made shift to crawl to the Door, but was not able to get back again; so that I was forced to lie there in the Cold all Night; and they let me have none but cold hard Victuals, such I can seldom eat, and cold Small Beer. I have begg'd many a time for a little Water-gruel, but all in vain. They would not so much as let me have a little Fire, or a bit of Candle, or Sheets to my Bed, tho' they knew I was ready to perish with Cold, so that for want of these and other Necessaries my very Skin has peel'd off. And so saying, she shew'd me a Paper in which she had put some of the bits of her Skin as they peel'd off. They were all white and mouldy, and look'd just like her Legs which were cover'd over with a white Mold. Her Flesh was all over wasted, and black where it was not mouldy. - Her Flesh did I say? No; I mean her Skin, for I saw no sign of any Flesh that she had. I asked her why she did not cry out for help? and she said she had done so, and that thereupon the Prisoner came up and Horse-whipp'd her, and threatened that he would murder her if it was not for the Law. She lived 10 or 11 Days after this. I went to see her every Day. She spit Blood the first Day, and was all along very feeble, and complain'd of a Weakness inwardly. She said she was 55 or 56 Years of Age.</p>
               <p>Coroner. Did she tell you why she got upon the House?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes: She said she did it thro' Necessity, as thinking it better to make an end of her Life in that manner, than to starve to Death.</p>
               <p>Court. You say her Body was black, might not that Blackness come by the Fall?</p>
               <p>Best. I believe not, for her Body was all over black, she was stunn'd with the fall, but recover'd in about a Quarter of an Hour, and I did not perceive that she had received any further Hurt, for she was so wasted away, that she fell very light, and then her fall was broke by an old Shed.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think she could not eat the Cheese! was it so hard as not to be eatable?</p>

               <p>Best . Perhaps hail Man might eat it; but I believe that a Woman in her weak Condition could not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say why he us'd her thus?</p>
               <p>Best . She said, It was because she refus'd to sell a small Estate .</p>
               <p>Court. How long had she been confin'd thus?</p>
               <p>Best. She said a Year and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she give you this Account more than once? Best. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Court. And did she never vary in her account?</p>
               <p>Best. No, not in the least Circumstance. She repeated the very same Things from the first time to the last.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think she was in her right. Senses?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes, without doubt, she was examin'd before Justice Leake.</p>

And that he used her as above partly upon Account of her refusing to sell a small Estate she had, and his keeping another Woman Company. And that she lately offer'd to call out at the Window to the Neighbours for Relief, and her said Husband then whipped her with a Horse-whip. And the 16th of this Instant December, in the Evening, after her said Husband brought her up some Bread, and she desiring him to bring her some Water-gruel , which he refused, and she being almost starved and tired of her Life with the above Treatment, got out of a Window of the Said Garret, and tumbled down into the Highway, to make an end thereof.</p>

             , High-Constable. On the 17th of December, by Justice Leake's Order, I went to enquire about this Affair. I found the Prisoner in his Loom, and I ask'd him, Why he us'd his Wife in such a Manner? He took me up shortly, and said, He'd never use her better. Upon this I secur'd him, and went to his Wife, who gave me the self same Account, as she did to the Justice upon her Examination. I was present when she sign'd that Examination, and she then seem'd to have some Thoughts of Death; but so perfectly in her Senses, that if the Clerk mistook but a Word in his rough Draught, she always observ'd it, and desir'd it might be corrected; and she repeated it 2 or 3 times, that her Husband refus'd her Water-gruel that Day, and therefore she thought to end her Life by getting out of Window.</p>

             . I went to see the Deceas'd the Morning after she got out of the Window. I found her a Bed, very weak and sore, full of Pain, and in a sad Condition. She was a mere Skeleton to look at, her Body was as black as Wainscot , and there was nothing but Skin over her Bones. She told me she was starv'd for want of Necessaries, and had neither Fire nor Candle, and that he often swore he'd murder her if it was not for the Law. I ask'd her, why she got out of the Window? She said, she thought to make an end of a miserable Life, for she had undergone so much, that she was not able to bear it any longer; that she first attempted to cut her Throat, but the Knife she had was so dull, that she thought it would rather add to her Pain than release her from it. Afterwards she thought to Hang herself, and at another time to strangle herself in the Bed, but at last resolv'd to throw herself from the

I had no Acquaintance with her before this, when the Prisoner asked me to go up and see her; I said I did not know her, why then, says he, if you don't know her, nor she know you, she'll owe you the less Discourse. He was carried to Prison that Night. I believe she did not die by the fall, but was starved to Death.</p>

She was very weak and low, and almost wasted away to nothing but Skin and Bones, I enquir'd why she got out of the Window; she answer'd 'twas to release herself from her Misery and Consinement , and added, that she had been kept there about 18 Months, except a little time (Once) when she was out; that she had neither Fire nor Candle, nor the common Necessaries of Life to subsist; that she was kept with mouldy Bread, hard Crust of Cheese, and Small Beer, and sometimes Meat, but all Cold; that they always set it for her on the Ground, just within her Door, and if she could scramble out of Bed for it she might; and that sometimes she was so Cold that she could not get the Victuals to her Month, but has been forced to let it drop out of her Fingers again; and that she did not dare to call for help, because he threatened to beat her: Her Skin was quite discolour'd, and she look'd like an Anatomy. I visited her 3 or 4 times before her Death, she was in her Senses all along, and never varied in the Accounts she gave me of the ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140016"></xptr> Usage she receiv'd from her Husband. About 2 Months before this happen'd, I met the Prisoner's Father in White-Chapel, and asked him, where my Kinswoman (the Deceas'd) was? He answer'd, with her Husband. And do they agree any better, says I? Why, says he, I believe she wants for nothing. I told him I was glad of it, for I had heard otherwise before, and that when she went into the Hospital he would allow her nothing, for though he was but a Journeyman Weaver, yet he must have had some Money, because he took in Pawns.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she want for Victuals?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. She had no such Victuals as was fit for a Person in her Case to eat, and then the Room was in such a Condition with her own Nastiness (for she had not Necessaries to case herself, and to keep herself clean,) that the scent of it was very noisome to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she receive any Hurt by the fall?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. She told me she thought she had not, and I did not find that she was bruised.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you say to me when I was in New-Prison?</p>
               <p>J. Badily. The Prisoner talk'd of coming to an Agreement with me. She had a small Estate of about 7 or 8 l. a Year, and he offer'd that that should be made over to me if she would consent, and that he would allow me 3s. a Week more to maintain her; but this was after he was taken up.</p>

            . I went to the Deceased after her Fall, and found her in a very weak and lamentable Condition. She shew'd me her Legs and Breast; she was nothing but Skin and Bones; her Skin was all black, and she look'd just like an Anatomy that I have seen at a Surgeon's. She told me she got out of Window to rid her self of a miserable Life. I asked why she did not send word to me, or some of her Neighbours, to come and help her? She said she had no Body to send, and if she knock'd or call'd for Help, the Prisoner would come up and horse-whip her. There was a Half-Peck Loaf hung up in her Room, but it was dry and mouldy; and several odd bits of Cheese lay about on the Ground, but she said her Stomach was so bad that she could not eat any of it. O Conson , said she, no Tongue can express, nor Heart conceive, the deplorable Miseries that I have felt! I have been lock'd up in this Room for a Year and a half, perishing with Hunger and Cold, and in want of the common Necessaries of Life. In the Extremity of Winter, without Candle! without Fire! without Conveniences to ease my self! without Water to keep me clean, or Covering that would keep me Warm! continually languishing, unable to help my self, and yet without a Friend to help me! to comfort me! to pity me! In this Condition, tho' I have hardly had Strength to get out of my Bed, my Victuals, cold! and hard! and mouldy! has been brought but just within my Door, and there left upon the Ground, by the Creature that keeps Company with my Husband. I have been forced to crawl thither on my Hands and Knees, and when I have got to it, my Fingers have been so benunim'd with Cold, that I have not been able to lift it to my Head, but have been necessitated to take it up from the Ground with my Mouth, and then it was seldom that I could eat it! And sometimes I have been unable to creep back to my Bed again, so that I have been obliged to lie at the Door all Night, in the midst of Winter! Many a time I have begg'd for God's sake for a little warm Beer; and once, and but once, it was brought me. I had no better Place to case my self in that the Chimney, and there it used to be piled up together, so that not being able to bear the Smell, I have often been forced to lie with my Nose under the Pillow. Once I threw a little Water (which I had in a broken Pan) out of Window; for which he came up and horse me. O! Mr. Vezey , said I, you can ease your self where you please! you don't know what it is to want such Conveniences, sure if you did you would never use me thus! He damn'd me for an old stinking Bitch, and swore if it was not for the Law he would murder me; and so went away again. You see, Consin, how my Hair is matted together ; he will not allow me so much as a Comb. I am almost devour'd with Vermin, they have eat Holes in my Head. My Hair was so troublesome to me that I have taken a great deal of Pains to cut some of it off with an old rusty Knife. My own Filthiness has been intolerable to me. This, and much more, more than I can speak, I have suffer'd; because I was not willing to part with that little Estate of mine.</p>
               <p>After the Deceased had given me this Account, I desired her to consider with her self that she was a dying Woman, and therefore ought to be very careful that she spoke nothing but the Truth. Consin , said she again I have told you the Truth, and nothing but Truth; I have suffer'd more than I can tell you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140017"></xptr> and yet I never called him any thing worse than Mr. Vezey. When I wanted any thing with him, I always said, Mr. Vezy , pray let me speak with you; and his common Answer was, Damn you, for a Bitch; if it was not for the Law I would murder you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not the Fall the Cause of her Death?</p>
               <p>A. Badily . I ask'd her that Question, and she answer'd, No; I felt no Hurt whatever by the Fall, but I feel an inward Sinking and Decay, for want of the common Necessaries of Life; and I assure you, Consin , on the Word of a dying Person, that I am starved to Death; for tho' I had some Victuals, it was such that in my weak Condition I could not sufficiently eat of to support Nature. And she begg'd of me to get a Minister; and I have since been very sorry that I did not do it at that time, but I did not then think she was so near her End. When I went into her Room (tho' it had been clean'd out but a little before) the Scent of it was so offensive that I could hardly bear it. She offer'd to kiss me, but she was in such a sad Condition, and smelt so strong, that I was obliged to decline it. The Creature that belong'd to the House was almost constantly with her, to hear what she said, and to keep her from speaking, as much as she could. As for the Prisoner, I know little of him, and never had any Conversation with him. Whenever I talk'd with the Deceased on this Occasion, she constantly gave me the same Account, and never varied in the Circumstances of any one thing that she repeated.</p>

That she had often begg'd for Christ's sake for a little warm Small Beer, but could never get it but Once. That they set the Victuals on the Ground just within the Door, and that sometimes she was so weak that she could not get to it. She was very sensible.

            , Brother to the Deceased. Last November was a Twelvemonth, I found my Sister (the Deceased) in Forestreet, begging a Dish of Broth. I took her home with me, and kept her about a Fortnight; but being a poor labouring Man, I could not afford to maintain her any longer, and she being willing to go home again, I went with her to her Husband, and as soon as ever she came in he turn'd her up Stairs, and said, Get up, you damn'd Bitch, to your Room, and there you shall starve, and never come out till you are brought out on four Mens Shoulders. I went to see her sometimes on a Sunday; for as I was a working Man I could not spare time to go any other Day. She had no Shoes on her Bed, and was full of Vermin. When the Prisoner was at home he used to go up with me, but when he was abroad I could not get in, for he commonly took the Key with him. I offer'd to take her home, if he would allow me for her Maintenance, and take my Bond that she should not be sent home to him again; but he would not take my single Bond, and I could get no Body to be bound with me.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange that you should know your Sister was treated in this manner, and not complain to a Magistrate .</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140018"></xptr>Harrison. Why, I did speak of it to some People, and they told me that no Body could hinder him from locking his Wife up if he had a mind to it, for she was his Goods, and he might do what he would with her; and I was a poor Man, and could not afford to go to Law.</p>
               <p>Court. What Reason did he give for using her thus?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Because she would not part with a small Matter in the Country; and he told me, if she would but do that he would make her a happy Woman.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you never sollicite him to let her have her Liberty?</p>
               <p>Harrison. Yes; I talk'd with him about it the latter End of the Summer, and he told me, if I'd take her home he'd allow me 18 Pence a Week; but I said she was then so weak that I cou'd not get her home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the Man-in-the-Moon Tavern in White-Chapel, I offered to settle the Estate upon him and his Brother, and allow him 2 s. a Week to keep her. Mr. Martin the Attorney was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Harrison. Yes, he did so; but that was the Year the King was crown'd, and the Attorney said I must give Security to maintain her; and I said I could give none: And as for the Estate he talks of, that was seiz'd by my Brother, and I had no Money to go to Law about it.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I first married this Wife I was a Journeyman Weaver, and I took the Man-in-the-Moon Ale-house in Skinners Street; and no Couple could live more lovingly, for she was as good a temper'd Woman as ever trod Shoe of Leather. But she begun to wrong me in my Alehouse, so that I have miss'd a Guinea at a time; and she would take my Linen away and carry it out of Doors; and tho' I was a good Husband, and very careful and sparing, yet I found I was run out above 60 Pounds, for I was a 100 and odd Pounds in debt, and had but 30 Pounds to pay it with, and I was hard press'd for Money, and wept bitterly; and yet I could not believe my own Eyes, for she had got such a fair deluding Tongue, that I loved her as I loved my Life. And she took this Linen -</p>
               <p>Mrs. Badily . It was none of your Linen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She took this Linen, and a matter of 19 Pounds in Money and Rings, and a Counterpain and other Things, and put them all in a Trunk, and sent them to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel; but as God would have it, I got Intelligence, and fetch'd them all back again. Then I open'd the Trunk, and look'd over the Goods, and told the Money, and said, Mary , I desire that you would not carry my Things out at this rate, but let my own House hold my own, and if we can get Money let us keep it, there they are all again! do so no more; She cry'd sadly, and said, She did it for fear they should be seiz'd, and desir'd me to give her the 3 Rings, which I did to make her easy, and when she got them she said, This is for such a One, and this for such a One, and this for such a One; Zounds! Says I, yes, my Lord, I did say Zounds, that I did, Zounds! Says I, and which is for me? Then she cry'd again sadly for a Broad-Piece, which was my former Wife's, and I told her, If she cry'd her Heart out she should never have it; but if she had a mind to look at it now and then she should and welcome. At another time I look'd under the Bed, and pull'd out a Handkerchief, and there was 25 s. in Half-pence, all but 2 naughty Farthings, and under the Drawers I found another with 17 l. in Silver in it; this was 13 Months after we were married. Then she lent 30. in my Name to one Mackey, and she has I believe a great many Things out that I shall never hear of, and that's the Reason that I confin'd her. She had me Arrested by Mr. Badily ; she left my House, and I put her in the Postman to invite her Home, and once I gave half a Guinea only for the Sight of her, and then I could not have her away. After this she came again, and said, she was come to live with me; and I said, Mary, come and welcome, if so be you will live honestly, and not rob me; she made many fair Promises, and I believ'd her again. I would have set her up in a little Brandy-Shop, in Bell-Yard, but she did not like the House: Then she pilfer'd from me again; if I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140019"></xptr> but a Farthing's-worth of Oatmeal, she would steal some of it, and hide it. I verily believe, that at times, she has robb'd me of above a Quart of Oatmeal in this manner, and then she would steal my Butter, and Pudding, and Soap, and the Lord knows how many Things. and hide them upon the Bed's-Teaster, as if that was a Place to put Victuals in. But she would be doing, God knows, tho' it was but a little.</p>

            . I know nothing of that, I am a feeble old Man, I never was up in her Room in my Life, and I never saw the Deceas'd but that once when her Brother brought her Home, and then she was very thin and poor.</p>
               <p>Ann Crew [Drew] a Washerwoman . When I have been washing at Finlow's House, I have seen them carry up Plates of Victuals, such as they had themselves for Dinner, and as much as I could eat, and seen them bring the empty Plates down again. I have been up in her Room 4 Times. The first Time I went up, she complained for Beer, and said, she was almost parched up with Drought. I told the Prisoner of it, and he took no Notice of it at first, but I speaking to him again, he made me go up, and then Mrs. Finlow was there, and shewed me 4 or 5 Bottles of Beer. I asked the Deceas'd why she complained for Drink when she had so much? she said, She let it stand there because she lov'd to have it stale, and to drink it one under another.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see those Bottles when you first went up? Crew. No; I was not in the Room then, for he was gone out, and had the Key with him: She spoke to me through the Door. The next Time I went up, I swept the Room, and made the Bed. Court. What kind of Bedding had she? Crew. There was 1 Sheet, 3 Blankets, and a Counterpain; they were good tidy Blankets, fit for a poor Body's Bed. I washed her Shifts. Court . How often? Crew. As often as she soul'd them. Court. That's not the Question. How often have you washed them? Crew. Why, my Lord, she would not always soul them: She said, she would not wear them out, because she was willing to keep them to go into the Hospital; and so she cut the Sheets, and pinned the Pieces about her instead of a Shift. Court. You will not answer the Question. Crew. I have washed 2 Shirts. Court. Did you wash any Sheets for her? every Month, or two Months. Crew. I cannot say how often; but I have washed Sheets. She had 9 Caps. Court. And how often have you washed Caps for her? Crew. As often as she soul'd them; but she would not soul them. Court. When you went up, how did you get in? Crew. With other Company; my Mistress let me in: But the last Time the Key was in the Door, and I got in myself, and carried her up a Couple of Eggs and a Rosher of Bacon; and she said, Very well. This was about 9 or 10 Weeks before she died. Court. What Conveniencies had she? Crew. A Chamber-pot, and a Pan to spit in. I swept the Room after she fell down; I never saw any Ordure about the Room, nor any Nastiness in it but Dust. This is one of her Aprons - and this one of her Handkerchiefs - The Deceas'd gave them me for laying her out. She had 18 Handkerchiefs, 2 colour'd Aprons, and 1 Muslin Apron; they were in a Trunk in her Garret, and I did not see that the Trunk was lock'd. I never saw her out of Bed but once, and then I peeped through the Key-hole, and she was standing on the Floor.</p>

A Goose roasted, a Giblet-Pye, and 2 Rabbits. Court. That was very well indeed, considering your Sister boarded both a Man and his Wife for 7 s. a Week. Vezey . And my Sister carried a Plate full, heaped. Court. Are you sure it was given to the Deceas'd? Vezey . I don't know that; but after Dinner I carried up a Dram of Brandy, and she drank it, and made no complaints to me. Court. Do you know why she was confin'd ? Vezey . To tell you the Truth, my Brother said, that if she came down, nothing would be too hot nor too heavy for her, she was so given to pilFering . Court. What condition was the Room in? Vezey . Very clean, handsome and decent. She ask'd me why I did not come and see her oftener? I had lodg'd in the same Room my self before she came.</p>

I have clean'd her Room, made her Bed, washed her and shifted her; she had tolerable good Shifts; and a Month afterwards, which was the Morning she got out of the Window, I found her without a Shift; says I, why do you go so? Because, says she, I can't bear a Shift. I have eat and drank with her many and many a Time, and have carried her up, Fish, Flesh, and Fowl, hot, and sat by her Bed-side while she eat it. She had a very good Stomach, and eat heartily, till latterly. I went up with Dr. Scurry, when he came to see her: He asked her how she did? and said, it is a Mercy that you got no more Hurt when you fell out of the Window; and she answer'd, I know nothing of it. About 3 Months before her Fall, I would have taken her to keep at my House, and her Husband offered to give me 3 s. a Week, but she would not consent, and said, she would stay where she was. About a Year before her Fall, she went out, and said, she would go to her Kinsman, who owed her 100l. she staid a Fortnight, and then her Brother brought her home, and a Porter came with them with a Bundle. Her Brother desired the Prisoner to pay the Porter for bringing the Bundle, but he refus'd till he saw what it was, and when it was opened, it was nothing but a Bundle of Rags.</p>

He had Information of a Trunk being carried away, which he got again. They were very much unsettled, he found more Embezzlements , and at last lock'd her up, to hinder her from taking his Money. After she got out of the Window, I heard he was apprehended for starving her, and went to her on the 18th of December: I asked her how she did, and if she had wanted ? she answer'd, No. I told her , I had heard him say that he had cut for her before he cut himself, and she said so he had. On the 26th of December I went again, and ask'd her if the Bread was tied up by her or him? she said, She tied it up herself to keep it from the Mice, and that she was sorry he was in Jail. But I heard her say nothing about her Information.</p>

            . I went up after her Fall, and asked her how she did? she said, I thank God, indifferently, considering my Misfortune. How do you sleep? says I, Very well, says she, but only I sometimes wake in a Fright with the Trouble about my Husband, since he has been in Prison; but I don't know what I have said to the Justice, that he has taken him out of the House, any more than the Child unborn. While I was there, Mr. Badily came up, and asked her how she did? and she said, She did not know him. No! says he, why, I am your Cousin Badily; they say you have been starved. No, says she, it is no such thing, and I beg that you would not believe their Lies; for I had the best of Butchers Meat, both roast and boil'd, and Bread and Cheese, and small Beer; but only within this Fortnight my Stomach would not bear it.</p>

             . When Dr. Scurry was there, he ask'd her why she throw'd herself off of the House? and she said, She knew not why: And he said, it was a barbarous Action, and Self-Murder. And somebody ask'd if she was in her Senses? and she said, Sometimes she was , and sometimes not. Then the Doctor ask'd her about the Loaf, and she told him, she hung it there herself to keep the Mice from it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scurry. Surgeon. I never ask'd her why she throw'd herself off of the House; Mr. Dawson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140023"></xptr> and I indeed enquir'd about the Loaf, and she said she ty'd it up her self, to keep the Mice from it. I went to see her the Day after her Fall, and found no Contusion or Fracture, or any thing like it. She had a Difficulty of breathing, and a Cough, attended with a great Spitting, an ill Habit of Body, was very weak and asthmatic, and prodigiously emaciated. I order'd her Panada, and such kind of thin Diet. When I open'd her, I perceiv'd no inward Contusion, nor extravasated Blood. Upon opening the Thorax I found her Lungs much decay'd, and an Adhesion on the Left Side. 'Tis frequent to find an Adhesion, a Decay of the Lungs, and a general Waste, in Consumptions, for these are the common Symptoms.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think you should have found such Symptoms in a consumptive Person who had lived well, and wanted no Necessaries?</p>
               <p>Mr. Scurry. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coldkam ; Surgeon. I saw the Body of the Deceas'd open'd; her Lungs were wasted and decay'd, and adher'd to the Left Side. I believe she dy'd of an Asthma and Consumption.</p>
               <p>Court. If she had not been consumptive, but by being kept from the Air, and wanting proper Aliment had only been starved, would that have had the same Effect upon her Lungs ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Coldham . No, I believe not; tho' I never examin'd the Body of a Person that dy'd for Want. The Lungs might be entire , for tho' the Body is emaciated, it does not follow that the Intestines must be corrupted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mackenny , Surgeon. I examin'd the Body with Mr. Scurry , and his Opinion agreed with mine, that she dy'd of an Asthama .</p>
               <p>Mr. Scurry . I had heard the Report of her being starved, and asked her if it was true, she said she had Victuals, but complain'd of her Consinement.</p>

I was on duty on Friday morning, 7th January, between 11 and 12 o'clock, in Victoria-street, Clerkenwell—I saw a truck coming down from Hatton Garden—the prisoner and a lad were with it—the prisoner was first walking by the side of it, and afterwards he was pushing behind—I followed the truck to Cow Cross-street—they stopped and left the truck, and the prisoner and his son, who had met them about a hundred yards before they got to Cow Cross, and a man who lives in Petticoat-lane, who had been walking on the pavement by the side of the truck, went into a public-house-the prisoner and his son went in first, followed by the other man—I went in and told the prisoner I belonged to the police, and I said, "Are those goods outside on the truck, yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said "From home"—I said, "Where is that?"—he said, "In Brook-street, Brook's Market"—I said, "What are they?"—he said, "Cuttings"—I said, "What cuttings?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Where are you going to take them to?"—he said, "To Petticoat-lane"—I said, "Where there?"—he said he did not know; he had been hired by a man named Aarons to take them there—"I said, "Where does Aarons live?"—he said, "In Brook-street; he keeps a marine-store dealer's shop close to where I live "—I took him into custody, and his son: his son was discharged—I took the trunk to the police-station, and examined it—it contained two whole pieces, of carpet, and some small pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—on Thursday evening, the 6th January, about 9 o'clock, he brought two pieces of carpet like these small pieces—he asked me where my husband was—I said he had just turned his back—he said he had some carpet cuttings for sale, and he said, "I sold you some some time back"—I said, "In this house?"—he said, "No, the other house, and you gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb."—I asked him what he wanted for these—he said not less than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would not have it, I could have it at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the regular way, in the open market, and unless I could have them of him at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

I am a slipper maker, at 31, Middlesex-street—when I came home on Thursday evening, 6th January, I found these patterns in my house—the prisoner called on me the following morning, and asked me whether I had seen the patterns of carpet he had left the previous evening, and whether I could afford to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I told him No; and said that was not a fair sample for a cwt. and a quarter—I had some on the counter, and I showed him the difference of the size and width—I asked him if there were any like them—he said, "No"—I asked him if they were this size or that size—I took his pieces and asked him if they were the pieces he left—he said, "Yes"—I asked if what he brought was a fair sample of what he had, and whether any were smaller than those he brought—he said, "No, none smaller, these are the worst"—he then said he had a friend waiting for him—he went out—I waited, he was gone about two minutes, and then the friend returned with him—that was Mr. Aarons—Mr. Aarons left, and the prisoner wanted me to go with him to see the carpet—I went with him to a cellar at the bottom of Brook-street, and he showed me two rolls of carpet—I said, "Very bad carpet cuttings these"—he said, "Are they not better than cuttings?"—I said, "They may be better, but I won't buy them"—I went from the cellar another way to a parlour, a small room with a bed in it—there I saw Aarons—he then showed me this other article, and a piece of blue cloth, and asked me if I would purchase them—I said no, they were out of my line of business, I would not buy anything of the kind—I left the two patterns with the prisoner—the rolls of carpet corresponded with them.</p>

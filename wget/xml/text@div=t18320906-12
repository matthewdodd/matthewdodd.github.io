The prisoner did some work for me, and charged me 30s. for it; I paid him 25s., and he summoned me for the rest; the case was decided in my favour - this was about twelve, or between 12 and 1 o'clock on the 28th of August; I did not see him again, but went home, and about six in the evening I was going down Mile-end-road, and stopped to speak to Mr. Wissett, a friend - we were in conversation, and somebody came behind and struck me a violent blow on the side of my head, in the eye; I did not see who it was - I do not remember receiving more than one blow, and have no idea with what it was struck; I do not know whether I fell to the ground, or what; my senses were entirely taken away - when I came to myself I found I was wounded; the wound had broken the skin.</p>

            . I was in conversation with Allpress about two minutes, and then the prisoner came up to him, and struck him violently in the face with a piece of wood, made into the shape of a bat - (producing it) - he did not say a word; he struck with only one hand; he struck him the first blow on the top part of the eye - his hat was on, but he hit him on the face; he struck him three times, the second blow over the forehead, and the third over the head; the first blow drove him from the path into the road - he reeled into the road, but did not fall; the prisoner followed him into the road, and struck him again, but he never fell; I secured the prisoner from striking him any more - some people came up immediately, and he was taken into custody; he was in liquor - he said nothing when he was striking him, but when the stick was being taken away from him he requested they would not pull his arm off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared to have been drinking a good deal? A. He seemed greatly excited, and his mind being under the influence of much liquor, I should hardly suppose he knew what he was doing.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. Allpress came to my house between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening of the 28th of August; he had three wounds, each of them laid the bone or covering of it bare; the skin was broken in all the wounds - great violence it appeared had been used; I did not consider his life in any degree of danger- he had fever to a slight extent: I could not judge what instrument had inflicted the wounds, but should think a weapon of this description very likely to have inflicted them - his eye, I fear, is entirely lost - that is the only injury which still continues; he has got well in other respects - he cannot see at all with his eye now, nor has he since I first attended him.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker. I saw a blow struck by the prisoner - I saw no provocation given - I was eighty yards off; the blow was given with this bit of wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you agree with the witness that the prisoner seemed intoxicated? A. He seemed in liquor; I cannot say whether he knew what he was doing - he knew his daughter, who he met about two minutes after, as I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you took him to the station-house he met his daughter, did he? A. Yes, she spoke to him first - she said, "What have you done, father?" he said he had done what he intended to do, and he hoped he had killed him - that is all I heard him say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, - I deeply lament the injury the prosecutor has received at my hands, but which was solely occasioned by his own outrageous and unprovoked violence and abuse; and when I explain to your Lordship and the Jury the circumstances under which I experienced that violence and abuse, I humbly trust that your Lordship and the Jury will think my case deserving merciful and lenient consideration. I had done some work for the prosecutor, for which he was to pay me 1l. 10s., but when he had paid me 25s., he said if I expected to get any more, I must summon him; I did summon him to the Court of Conscience, in Orange-street, but in consequence of some evidence produced by him as to the work done by me, the Commissioner refused to make any order enforcing payment of my demand. I left the Court, but immediately on getting into the street I was assailed by the prosecutor, and persons in his company, with oprobious epithets, and with such violence and abuse, that I was compelled to seek refuge in a public-house called the Two Bells, where I remained drinking with a friend until the prosecutor, and those who were with him, were gone away; I then left the house with my friend, and went to my own home to fetch a tool, or piece of wood, used by me in my trade, which my friend much wished to see, and borrow (he is in the same trade as me;) I was then a good deal intoxicated. We both then went forward to a public-house, called the King's Arms, to have some more beer; we remained there some time drinking I had occasion to go outside the door, into the street; I happened to have the piece of wood in my hand; at that instant the prosecutor was passing, and seeing me, pointed me out to a man who was with him, and seemed to wish to annoy me: I felt greatly irritated, and at the instant, and on the impulse of the moment I struck him, and inflicted the injury he has sustained. I was very much intoxicated, or even under the provocation I received I should not, I think, have raised my hand against him; but I was irritated at his having a short time before exposed and abused me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060015"></xptr>street, in addition to refusing payment of what I conceived to be a just demand. I sincerely lament the occurrence - I am in a very infirm state of health, and throw myself on the mercy of my prosecutor and the Court.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor say any thing to the prisoner, or do any thing before the prisoner came up and struck him? A. No - I do not think he had seen him before he struck him; he did not point the prisoner out to me.</p>

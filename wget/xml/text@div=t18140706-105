The prisoner acknowledged when he was taken, that he took the pole. He was not at home when I went to look for the pole. He absconded from then until now. I have made enquiries, and never could find him.</p>
               <p>WALTER BRIANT. I am a painter. I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060054"></xptr>prisoner take the pole, and saw him bringing of it: he took the pole from the end of Church-street; it was a fence against the common sewer. I cautioned him, and desired him to bring it back; he said, he would not. I told Mr. Payne; Mr. Payne employed Mr. Spencer to do this work. I gave up the place, at the things were lost; I did not wish to have the charge of it any longer. I saw the prisoner cutting it up; he applied it to a roof of a shed. which he built to keep his tools in. After Mr. Payne and Spencer looked for the property, the prisoner absconded for a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>DENNIS FLANNAGHAN. I saw the prisoner sawing this pole. Upon the next day, I saw a shed built up. Mr. Spencer came the next day, and claimed the pole. I am sure the prisoner is the person that I saw cutting this pole.</p>

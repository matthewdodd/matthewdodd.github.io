               <p>Lawrence. I have been Constable two or three Years on the other side of the Water - A Neighbour of mine having had his House broke open, I suspected the Prisoner, because he had been an Evidence against Williams, Isaacson, and Gulliford (in February last.) I and G. Holderness went to look for him, and making Enquiy, we heard that the Prosecutor's House had been broke open too. We found the Prisoner abed in his Room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173512100003"></xptr> in Black-boy Alley in Chick-Lane. We secured him and four or five Women who were in the same Room. Perceiving a loose Board in the Floor we took it up, and found a Dark Lanthorn, a piece of Wax Candle, a Tinder Box, and these two Iron Instruments. I asked him what he did with them. He told me they were his Mills, with which he could open any Door in England - This with the Claw at the End of it is to wrench with, and this with the Round Hole is to put over the Head of a Bolt to force it out. Next Morning he desired to be made an Evidence. I asked him how many Accomplices he had. Why, says he. If you had let me alone but one Night longer, I and three more were to have milled a Silversmith and then I could have jamm'd three or four, but now I can do but one, and that's

            . I am a straw hat-maker. The prosecutor has part of my house: between eight and nine o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April, the shop bell rang; the little boy who generally attends the door, went to it, and soon after called out "shop;" I went into the shop and missed a picture; I looked into the street and saw the prisoner with it, partly concealed under his arm, and just turning into a court; I pursued him, and called Stop thief! he ran pretty sharp, but there were three person on horseback who pursued him, and he was taken; I kept him in view all the time, except when he turned a corner; when I came up to him I asked where the picture was; he said, "I have no picture, this is what I have taken," and he gave me this card - I took him back the same way he had run, and the picture which he had dropped was given to me by of the neighbours. I knew the prisoner before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came back, the card was given to the gentleman by another person, not by me; the picture was given me by a man to hold, and when I had it he ran away. <rs id="t18280410-263-verdict1414" type="verdictDescription">

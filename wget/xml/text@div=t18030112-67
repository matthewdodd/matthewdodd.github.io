               <p>"have a yellow one, have a yellow one," I was going to open the piece, but the prisoner would do it himself; another young man then came in, and after looking at them, the prisoner said he would call in teh morning as he could not see the colours at night. I had some mistrust, and as they went out of the door I lifted up the piece, and missed five handkerchiefs of a red piece, six of another, and we odd ones. I pursued them and saw them running, some in the horse road and some in the too road; I called out stop thief, and a gentleman stopped the prisoner, who I had not lost sight of-I have never seen the handkerchiefs since. A.constable took the prisoner in charge, who offered all the money he had about him for his liberty.</p>

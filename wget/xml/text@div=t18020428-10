               <p>Q. Was it light when you came down stairs? - A. Yes; I was going to take down the shutters, and saw a pane of glass in the door broke; I then observed that the lock of the door was broke, it was put to, but not locked, the wood was shaved away on each side with a chisel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lock forced? - A. No; the woodwork gave way; I went up stairs to my wife, and in coming down again I found a soldier's button, marked Coldstream, in the passage near the door; the shop-door is in the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the street-door secured the night before? - A. Yes; I immediately missed a pair of leather breeches, coats, waistcoats, shirts, and a great number of other articles, and there were coats, waistcoats, and breeches, lying upon the floor; the prisoner was quartered in a public-house adjoining me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there not plenty of people lodging in the house beside me? - A. No; there was nobody else that night.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields: On Tuesday, the 20th of April, about nine in the morning, Mr. Cowen gave me information of the robbery; I went up to Hyde-Park, where I understood the prisoner was, it being a field-day, and applied to the commanding officer; Cowen pointed out the prisoner, and I brought run away in, a coach; I thought he might have left the cloaths at the barracks at Knightsbridge, and in my way there I searched him, and, upon opening his coat, I found these two waistcoats upon him, and a shirt on him; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cowen. One of these waistcoats has my private mark upon it, E; the other waistcoat has got a little bit of a darn upon the front of it; the white waistcoat was my own wear, I had not such another figured waistcoat in the house; the shirt is marked K.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you sure you did not sell those things to any body the day before? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought these things of a Jew; if I had stolen them, I should hardly have worn them the same day.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Donaldson.) Have you examined this button with the prisoner's buttons? - A. Yes, it is the same sort of button.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him in the regiment seven years, and gave him an excellent character. <rs id="t18020428-10-verdict52" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I reside at Glasgow, and am manager to Mr. Makekmy, of hutchinson-street, Glasgow—the prisoner has been our agent since the beginning of December last—I received this bill of exchange for 47<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated 1st March, from the prisoner; it professes to be drawn on and accepted by William Williams, of 32, New-cut, Lambeth; it is made payable at the South Eastern Bank of London—I also got this bill, of 15th March, from the prisoner—it is for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn on and professes to be accepted by H. Mountjoy, 4, Market-place, Battersea, and is made pay<lb></lb>able at the London and County Bank—the acceptance, "H. Mountjoy," is in the prisoner's writing—this other bill, dated May 4th, is a bill professing to be accepted by James Smith, 20, York-road, Battersea, for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the acceptance of that is also in the prisoner's writing—on the receipt of that last bill I came to London, and made inquiries at the addresses given—the result was that I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>Was you at Mr. Lynch's at the time the mob assembled there? - Yes. I am an headborough of that parish; I was on duty that night, I had been to Westminster; when I came to Old-street I saw a great fire and people bringing things up Golden-lane from Mr. Lynch's house to that fire, that was at about a quarter after one; there were about fourteen or fifteen people about Mr. Lynch's house; I saw the prisoner at the bar bring out a post belonging to a bedstead and part of a curtain; I followed him up the lane to the fire and saw him fling it into the fire which was made near the turnpike.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Mr. Lynch's house? I dare say three hundred yards. I followed him back; he went into Mr. Lynch's house again; he staid about two minutes and then brought out a copper pot and a lid; I saw him fling them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes; I believe he has been taken before Justice Walford two or three times before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person of whom you have been speaking? - I am.</p>
               <p>What were the mob doing in the house? - Some were receiving things, which others threw out, and carrying them up to the fire.</p>
               <p>Jury. When was this information laid against the prisoner? - I do not remember the day of the month.</p>
               <p>How long after the 8th of June? - I believe about a fortnight afterwards as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>How came you not to give information before? - I splintered a bone in my leg on the morning I saw the prisoner in Mr. Lynch's house and was confined.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you tell it to any body? - Yes, to a brother officer.</p>
               <p>Who gave the first information against the prisoner, was it yourself? - Yes, it was myself, and he was brought before Mr. Walford and Mr. Blackborough. I was sitting in a chair when the prisoner was brought in.</p>
               <p>Then it could not be in consequence of your information? - No, Mr. Lynch's.</p>
               <p>Did you know of his being taken till you saw him brought in there? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me in the house? - Yes, I did, at about one o'clock or a little after. The pot and pot-lid were produced before the justices in the Artillery-ground after they had been three hours in the fire.</p>

               <p>Was you in Golden-lane at the time Mr. Lynch's house was destroyed by the mob? - I was; the mob were going to burn Mr. Lynch's goods before a gentleman's door,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280074"></xptr> the gentleman said he would give them some beer to carry the goods farther. He ordered me to carry them some beer up stairs, and I took a gallon.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where did you carry the beer? - Into Mr. Lynch's house. I saw young Burgess the prisoner there, knocking the wainscoting to pieces.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It might be about twelve o'clock, but I cannot exactly tell the time. He was pulling down a partition. When they saw me bring the beer they came round me, and I served them half a pint a piece. The prisoner came to me for some; he was all of a sweat; he snatched it out of my hand before the others were served.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, but I took particular notice of him by his coming to have the beer first.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the person? - I am. I served the beer out, then I left him. I saw him taken up the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>How long were the mob at Mr. Lynch's destroying the house? - They came about half after ten o'clock. It was about two hours before they came to my house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner taken up the Sunday following? - Yes, I believe it was, but I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Jury. The other witness said he believed it was a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. The house was destroyed on the Wednesday, he was examined on the Thursday se'nnight following. He was taken up four days before he was examined.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. What time did you see me there? - About twelve in the morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 588). About 4 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, on 21st Sept., I was on duty, and saw a mob of persons at the bottom of the Minories—I ran down to see what was the matter, and a gentleman had the prisoner by the collar—he said, "He stole my handkerchief; I give him in your charge"—I took him, and led him three or four paces—he then said, "What the b—y hell do you want with me?"—I said, "You are given into my custody"—he went down, and kicked me very violently in the lower part of my body—I called for assistance—I was not strong enough to keep him—he bit the person's finger who came to assist me—the prisoner had been given into my custody by a gentleman, for stealing his handkerchief—the handkerchief was picked up and given to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Who gave you charge of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman, who appeared to be a sailor—he said ho was a captain—a gentleman gave this handkerchief to me, and a sailor said it was his handkerchief—you kicked me twice in the chest, and likewise in the lower part of my body—there was no other constable present at the time you kicked me—there was one came up afterwards—I used no violence to you—I threatened you—I told you if you kicked me again I would knock you down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. I saw the prisoner in custody of the policeman—I saw the prisoner down, and the policeman scuttling with him—the policeman called me to aid and assist—I did so, and the prisoner bit my finger.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see anything of this handkerchief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I am a porter by trade—I was not out of employ at that time, I was in employ—I saw you kick the policeman in the chest twice—he called me to assist him—I caught hold of you, and you caught hold of my finger—I said, "Let go my finger"—you went about 100 yards, with my finger in your mouth, more like a dog than a human being—the policeman was there—he did not get me away from you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Then he did not do his duty. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I think he did—if he had not, he would have knocked you down—you kicked him twice in the chest in my presence—I cannot say that I saw you kick him any when else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am a costermonger. I left my barrow and walked a little way, and turned down by the Crooked Billet; I heard a gentleman call, "Stop thief!"and he came after me, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me; I asked him what he was doing, and he said I had picked his pocket; I said, I had not; I opened my hand and said, "Look at my hand; do I look like a man that gets his living by thieving?"he gave me in charge to this policeman; the handkerchief was picked up by some person, and given to the gentleman, and the officer snatched it out of his hand, and said, "You must come along with me for your handkerchief;" he said, "I will, "and he went to the station, and accused me of picking his pocket; he said, he never saw me take it; nor saw me with it; nor saw it picked up; I never had it in my possession; I think that I stand before this bar quite innocent of that; the punishment I have gone through for a month or five weeks, I think suffi<lb></lb>cient; I know I assaulted the policeman, but I was used in a most shameful manner; he got me down and trampled on me, and tore my trowsers all to pieces; he took his staff out and said, "I won't let you get up till you promise you will go quietly; "I said, I would if some one would mind my barrow; I had no person with my barrow, and it is gone; I called on the public to know if this was treatment I ought to have, and two or three gentlemen said it was a shame, but I could not get their names; I tried to get away to mind my barrow; this witness put his hand over my mouth to prevent my hallooing out; I bit his finger, and I believe I bit it severely to save myself from being choked by his hand; I got to the station, and there they used me ten times worse; they got me down and twisted my hands back, and said they would twist my arms clean off; I went quietly to Arbour-square, and I asked to have the gentleman produced to give up the handkerchief, but the Magistrate would not allow it.</p>

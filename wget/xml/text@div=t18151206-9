               <p>THOMAS -. I am a servant to Mr. Southgate. On the 3d of August I was going to my business at five o'clock in the morning; I met the prisoner coming down a court called Well court, Fleet street. He came in to Pancrass lane, where I stopped. As soon as he came up to me I called him by his name three times. He did not stop. I crossed the way, and laid hold of the trunk which he had on him. I said to him, this is my masters' trunk. I thought it was empty. He directly replied, it is my trunk, and I will have it. I forced it from his shoulder, and as soon as it reached the ground, he made his escape. There was not any one near that I could give charge of him to. I took the trunk to the warehouse from whence he had it. I could not carry the trunk all the way to Watling street to get the key, so I put it behind a truck of ours, to fetch the key: and when I came back I found the padlock of the door was wrenched off, and the warehouse broken open.</p>

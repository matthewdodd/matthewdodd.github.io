               <p>I am a housekeeper, I live in Virginia-street, Ratcliff Highway. On the 20th of April, about half after nine, as I was coming round the corner of <placeName id="t17940430-95-crimeloc520">Black Horse-yard, in East Smithfield</placeName>

The handkerchief was in my right coat pocket, and the money was in my waistcoat pocket. I lost a knife, but I did not know that till she was taken into custody, and it was found on her; she was searched in a public-house in Church-lane, at the watch-house door in St. John's, Wapping; she dropped the silk handkerchief, and returned me part of my money. I see her drop it, I picked it up; I have had the handkerchief in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be searched at the watch-house? - The watch-house door was not open, and an officer coming by, I gave her in charge of an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the knife taken from her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a clasp knife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever find your money again? - I had four farthings and a penny returned; the silver I never got, we did not find it on her.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that you had two shillings in your waistcoat pocket? - I believe I had more, but that I am positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him whether he did not pull me down an alley first, and give me sixpence farthing in money and the knife along with the halfpence? - It is not true, she dragged me off the pavement with her hands about my waist.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an headborough; on Monday the 2d of April I was coming down East Smithfield, and I saw the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together; I told him if he was robbed that I was an officer, and I would take and secure the prisoner for him; says he, you take hold on one arm, and I will take hold of the other; accordingly we took her into a public-house and searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he charge her with stealing? - He did not say any thing then, but I am robbed! I am robbed! in searching her I found these two knives, one of which the prosecutor claimed immediately as he saw it, and I found a few halfpence; she had no silver about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing at this here alley last Monday night, and it mizzled with rain a little, and this gentleman came and pushed quite against me, and I said, I with you would give me something to drink, and he gave me some halfpence, and then I was going to the public-house, and he pulled me down the alley, and in pulling me down the alley he tore all my bed gown, and then he took hold of my wrist, and charged me to this gentleman, and this gentleman searched me in the ale house, nigh the watch-house; the next morning he had his own silk handkerchief in his pocket, and shewed it to the justice, and he went to give it to the constable, and Mr. Staples said, no, keep it yourself; and he told the justice that he found seven shillings and sixpence in his outside coat pocket next morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in liquor at all? - I had been drinking a little, but I was not any ways forward.</p>

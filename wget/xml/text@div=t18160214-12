At ten o'clock he returned to go to bed; I opened the door for him, and he asked me to call him the next morning at six o'clock to go to work.

I and the family went to bed about eleven. The window of his own room was fast. The street - door was locked and the key was in it. There was only one window in the room, which opened in the gateway, and which was fast. I made my husband get up at six o'clock in the morning to to call him; I could hear my husband knock at the door several times. I arose myself at about eight o'clock; then I went into the prisoner's room. His door was locked inside. A young man went in at the window, which was open, and opened the door; when I went in, I observed that the bed-clothes were gone; every thing off the bed. I had a counterpane which was gone, and the blankets, and the sheets, and the pillow, and two cases; they were all gone. I did not see the goods again until I saw them on the Saturday following at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. At about eleven o'clock on the night of the 5th of February, I met the prisoner in Holborn; he had a bundle on his back; I asked him what he had got, and he said, dirty linen to wash; he said, he brought it from Princiss-street, Drury-lane. I asked him if he had any objection to my looking at it, and he said, no. I took him into the public-house, and examined the bundle; it contained one counterpane, two blankets, one of which was double, a pair of sheets, one pillow, two pillow cases, and a small coverlid. I asked him again where he got them; the outside sheet was dirty, by having been thrown into the mud; he said he had been at a public-house in Princiss-street, and a woman brought them to him in a public-house. I then detained the things, and sent my brother officer with him to point out the house. He went, and was gone about an hour; I told him I should take him to the watchhouse; I did so, and the next day, Tuesday, I took him before the magistrate; the prisoner was put to the bar on the Saturday, to be discharged; in consequence of our not being able to find an owner for the property. At that moment, Mrs. Cole came into the office; she was shewn the things, and identified them to be her property.</p>

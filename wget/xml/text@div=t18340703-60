On the 20th of May, I saw a paper parcel on one of our muslin wrappers, and found it contained some Irish linen, partly cut up for shirts - I inquired aloud in the shop who it belonged to - the prisoner said it was his, and I gave it him - I afterwards looked through the books to see if any such linen had been entered to him - I found it had not - I inquired of each young man if they had sold the prisoner any linen - they said they had not - I then called the prisoner up-stairs, and asked how he became possessed of the linen - he said it was a piece of cloth which he had from his employer whom he lived with at Bristol - I said I felt assured it was our linen, and asked him where it was, that I might see it - he said it was not in his possession, as he had given it out to be made into shirts to a woman, but he did not know where she lived - but when he found I was quite positive, he said it might be a mistake, as a friend of his named Handley had bought some Irish of him about six months before - I discharged the prisoner, and went to Mr. Handley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not that linen in the shop where it could be seen? A. Yes; he told me the woman who had the shirts to make would call the next morning for a pattern shirt, and she did call for it - Mr. Handley told me that he had bought a piece of linen at our shop, which the prisoner's sister had to cut up for shirts; and that he had a piece which he had bought of his former master.</p>

            . Some months ago, I gave the prisoner two sovereigns to get me a piece of cloth of his employer, similar to one which he had had for himself of his former master - his sister had to cut them both out, as I wanted to have mine the same pattern as his.</p>
               <p>MR. TIDMARSH re-examined. Q. Do you know whether you had sold Mr. Handley any cloth? A. I have no account of it - it is customary to allow shopmen to purchase at wholesale prices - I find no entry in our book of this, but if the prisoner had paid ready money it would not have been entered.</p>

            . I was porter to the prosecutor. I went with a parcel of some things which had been purchased at the shop, to the prisoner's sister in Stamford-street, Edgeware-road, by the prisoner's direction - I received this parcel from his sister, wrapped in the same paper that I had taken the parcel to the house in - I took it to my masters, and laid it on the counter - it was then about five o'clock, and day-light.</p>

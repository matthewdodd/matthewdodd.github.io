               <p>I am a salesman, and dealer in plate, on Monday the 7th of April, about eight in the morning, the prisoner and another man came to my house, and he said, he had brought this poor fellow or this poor sailor, I cannot say which, to sell a pair of buckles, and the other man pulled them out of his pocket; I asked him whose buckles they were, and he said they belonged to the prisoner, the prisoner stood on one side of him; I thought it rather extraordinary, that so young a man should have such a pair of old fashion buckles, and I questioned the prisoner about the buckles; he said that he was in Portsea hospital, and had wages and prize money to receive, and that one of the Lieutenants had advanced him seven guineas, and with that money he had come to Chatham, and there he got drunk and spent the money; and with a part of the money he had bought these buckles, he said he gave 26 s. for them, and he was drunk when he bought them, and all the next day; here is a part of the buckles, that is all that is left of them; when Mr. Skar came to me, I had disposed of some silver, and that had gone among the rest.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop in the Edgeware-road. On a Sunday evening in January, I observed three boys at my window—a pane of glass had been broken before—I heard the glass break larger and some boxes knocked down—I ran out and saw them running away, and the prisoner among them—I ran after them, and took the prisoner about fifty yards off, down a court—the other two had run straight on—when I caught the prisoner, I said I suspected he had stolen some cigars from my shop window—a man immediately pulled a bundle of cigars from his own coat and said, "Here they are"—he said he had picked them up in the court—they were wet, as if they had been on the ground—the pri<lb></lb>soner said nothing to it, but before the policeman came he pulled sixteen or seventeen cigars out of his pocket, and threw them on the floor—a policeman came and found two more in his pocket—when I returned to the shop I examined the window, and missed cigars of this description from a box, and one bundle.</p>

            , Esq; About ten at night on the 7th of June. I was returning from the Park towards Temple-Bar. Just by <placeName id="t17650710-40-crimeloc217">Somerset-house</placeName>

I told him, in order to terrify him, I would carry him before a Justice, though I had no intention of doing it. Upon that the prisoner Carrol came up immediately: I believe he was lurking under the side of the New-Church; he seem'd to come that way. He came up. and fix'd his attention upon me and the boy: I went on, leading the boy towards Temple-Bar: I had him by the sleeve of his waistcoat; he had no coat on; he is dress'd the same now. Carrol followed me. When I got at a little distance, I perceived two others that I thought to be part of the gang. The little boy's name is Darby, and the other 
               <persName id="t17650710-40-person389">
                  William

            , as I suppose: he was dress'd much as King is now. I took notice of his size, his height, and his hair. I believe he had more hair on his head than now. I cannot say I took particular notice of the features of his face: but he answers in every particular to the remarks I then made of him Carrol was particularly active, sometimes before me, and sometimes behind, as I thought, meditating some mischief to me. Upon seeing this, there was a well-dress'd person behind me, whom I desired to walk behind me, to keep those people off: he promised me he would, saying, he saw there was a gang after me. I walk'd on very slow as the weather was intensely hot; and I was frequently interrupted by the number of people that pass'd by on the new pavement that was then about: we were forced to go over boards, which, with that and stones lying about, I walk'd so very slow, it was four or five minutes before I got to the top of Arundel-street, from the time I first saw these people; it might be more. I talk'd a little while with the boy. When I got there, Carrol came before; he put his head down, and look'd up under my hat; and as soon as I had raised my head, with a back-handed blow, as violent as he could make it, he struck me across the nose and eyes with a knife. I wear my hat exceedingly low on my forehead: the blow was so violent, that it cut my hat entirely through (produced and inspected): it was a very strong hat, almost new. I perceived my nose benumm'd by the violence of the blow. I struck at the fellow with my cane, but unfortunately miss'd him. At first I thought he had put dust in my eyes, by the little capillary vessels bleeding so. I put my hand up in order to wipe the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100028"></xptr> dust away, as I thought, and found the blood running very profusely over my hand; I then went in at the Crown and Anchor, and ordered a surgeon to be sent for; and Mr. Ingram, who lives in Arundel-street, came in about two or three minutes  but before the time he came, I believe I had bled full two quarts. I found the wound had divided the flesh entirely upon my nose; and the knife or instrument, whatever it was, had gone to the bone. My eyes are very much weakened by it, and the muscular part of my nose is very much contracted; and at present I have no sensation in that part of my face where the wound was deepest. I have no feeling on the part where the wound was on my nose. By the time Mr. Ingram had dressed the wound, Dr. Morris, whom I had sent for, came: they ordered me to go home in a chair; and the next morning, when they came to dress me, I was advised to call in another surgeon, though I no ways doubted Mr. Ingram's ability. Mr. Pile, from Westminster hospital, came with them. I think, the next morning: I was not then in a situation to attend Justice Fielding, but desired Dr. Morris to give a description of them as I had given to him. On the Monday morning Carrol, and the two boys, the evidences, were brought to me; I look'd very attentively at Carrol, as I had particularly remarked his dress: I knew him immediately upon seeing him; his ragged breeches I had particularly remark'd, and he had a great coat on that did not come so low as his knees. Byfield, the boy that attempted to pick my pocket, I immediately knew; I talk'd with him about the attempt he had made upon me, which he confessed. I was not quite so certain as to the boy Matthews; he was dressed then much as the boy was who made part of the gang on the Friday evening. On Saturday the 22d of June (I think it was), I went to Sir

            , to give my information there as to the several people; then I saw the prisoner King. I gave then pretty near the same description of him as I have now. I can't be sure of King, but I believe him to be the person. Carrol had the same coat on at the time he cut me he has now. I put an advertisement in the paper for the person that I desired to walk behind me, to come and give evidence: he is now in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Which corner of Arundel-street was the cut given you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. At that corner nearest Temple Bar. Carrol slipp'd by me in the Strand, and stopt some few paces before me. When I came up, he look'd under my hat, and cut me, as I before related. I had no sort of doubt then but that he was meditating some mischief against me, and I have none now.</p>

            . I was coming along the Strand on the 7th of June, a little past ten at night. I came up to Mr. Kirby opposite the New Church. Just as I was going to pass him, he stopt the boy nam'd Byfield. He said, You rascal, you had your hand in my pocket. I hearing that, stopt to hear what it was; then I saw Carrol come from towards the New Church, and the boy Matthews followed, and after him came King: they all came from towards the opposite side the way. Mr. Kirby was taking the boy along the street: I stepping a little before, look'd over my shoulder, and said to him, I believe there is a gang behind you: he desired I would walk behind him to keep him from being knock'd down, which I accordingly did. As we were passing along towards Temple-Bar, Carrol came up several times along-side of me; sometimes he was before us, and sometimes behind. A little before we came to Arundel-street, he was behind; and when we came to the corner of the street, he made a push by me, and stopt short till Mr. Kirby came up; then he struck him a back-handed blow cross the face. When he made the blow, he said, D - n you, Sir, let go the boy. I seeing that, jump'd to him, and laid hold of his cloaths behind. Mr. Kirby making a blow at him with his cane, struck me over the hand where I had hold of him: that made me let go my hold: then Carrol ran off across the Strand into St. Clement's church-yard: I pursued him there: he ran through a narrow passage, and I lost sight of him. I was at Sir

               <p>Carrol. Please to turn out Matthews while this gives his evidence; for what one swears the other will. (He is put out of the court accordingly.)</p>
               <p>Byfield. Barny Carrol and I had been together all day; we met King at night at the Golden Boot in Cross-lane, about six or seven o'clock; there was Matthews; we all four of us made an agreement to go out that night. Matthews and I were to pick pockets, or take hats, and the other two were to come up if any body molested us; they were to strike or stab, or cut the nose and eyes, of any that stopt us; they were to receive the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100029"></xptr> handkerchiefs, or what we took out of gentleman's pockets. Matthews and I had found a razor-bladed knife on the King's birth-day, and Barney Carrol gave us each a penny for it; he had that with him at the Boot; he said, D - n his blood, he wou'd make it sharp; and if any body molested us, he would stab them, or cut their nose and eyes. We went down Bow-street, Convent-Garden, and was in the Strand between nine and ten o'clock. Mr. Kirby's pocket was the first I attempted to pick that night: the prisoners were behind us two boys; Carrol bid me go after that pocket: King was the last of us; I went and put my hand in Mr. Kirby's pocket; he turned about, and laid hold of my sleeve, and ask'd me what business my hand had in his pocket, and led me along about twenty yards: Carrol came along-side of me; I said, Keep away, the gentleman will let me go. Carrol was out into the high-way, and he walked by us; he came up three or four times; he was sometimes before, and sometimes behind. About five minutes after he look'd up into the gentleman's face, and ran his hat under his hat, and struck a back-handed blow on his face: this was by Arundel-street: he said, D - n you, let the boy go; then the gentleman let me go, and I ran behind a coach. and got away. I saw

             the next day; he said, D - n him but he had cut his nose off, and bragg'd of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Byfield. This was up in the ruins in St. Giles's; I saw the knife the next morning also; it was bloody; (a clasp knife produced in court, handle and blade about nine inches long when open); this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was King when Mr. Kirby had hold of you?</p>
               <p>Byfield. I saw him; Carrol turned about to King, and said, D - n him. but I will cut him. This was about two minutes before he did cut him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of King that night?</p>
               <p>Byfield. I saw king run away after Carrol; they both ran away across St. Clement's church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Carr. Did you see King when you was in pursuit of Carrol?</p>
               <p>Mr. Carr. I can't say I did; there were several people in the church-yard at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. When Carrol ran away, Mr. Carr ran after him; and the man I saw with Carrol, which I believe to be King, ran after Mr. Carr. Mr. Carr was close to Carrol, and King was about a yard and a half behind Mr. Carr. I understood he was pursuing Mr. Carr.</p>
               <p>Darby Matthews. I met Carrol, King, and Byfield, at the Boot in Cross-lane, about 9 o'clock that night; I cannot rightly say the time; it began to be dark. We agreed that Byfield and I should pick pockets, and the two men were to assist us, to cut any body across the face that should lay hold of us. Carrol produced a razor bladed knife (he takes the knife up in his hand); this is it, Carrol swore he would cut off the nose of any body that should attempt to lay hold of us. We all four went out together for this purpose; we went into Bow-street, Covent-Garden, and down into the Strand by the New Church; and the first pocket we attempted to pick was Mr. Kirby's; Byfield attempted it: we were all on the same side the way as he was on; we all came down Catharine-street, and so cross'd the way to that side Somerset-house is on: I was last of all till I saw Byfield attempt to put his right hand in his pocket. then I went up. The gentleman took him by the sleeve, and said some words about his hand being in his pocket, and led him along to Arundel-street. Byfield ask'd the gentleman if he had lost any thing or not; he answered, If it had not been for my good look-out, I should have lost something or some such words. King kept behind all; Carrol kept walking backwards and forwards; he went beyond them, then back again, and look'd at them: I could observe more plainly than Byfield could; ( he was engaged. I saw the knife in Carrol's hand, but I did not see him draw it; I saw it shine when he was behind Mr. Kirby; he put his hand to his side, and I saw the blade shine by the lamps; he strove to hide it under his coat when he went by the gentleman: he went backwards and forwards till he came near a tavern; there he waited till Mr. Kirby came up; then he took it in this manner (throwing his hand backwards); and said, D - n you, Sir, let the boy go. Byfield was let go: I saw the gentleman's hand go up, as if he put it to his eyes, and heard a cane rattle, as if it fell on some stones. Byfield ran away first towards the church-yard, then Carrol ran across the street; a gentleman followed him, and King was behind: I can't tell what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q Where was King at the time the blow was given?</p>
               <p>Matthews. King was at that time behind with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Mr. Kirby when the blow was given?</p>
               <p>Matthews. King and I were about three yards from the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect a blow would be given?</p>

             and Matthews. I laid hold of Carrol, and said, You are the man I have been looking for: said he, I judg'd it. I took this knife out of his right-hand breeches-pocket, which I had taken from him before. I said, Now shew me the nearest way to St. Giles's round-house, and I will not hand cuff you: I had a cutlass in my side-pocket. On the Friday I saw King; he was, I believe, in the same dress as now; I believe he had a deal more hair than he has now; he had a hat in his hand. Carrol and Byfield were on one side the way, and King on the other; they were even with each other: I had known the other two a great while, but I did not know so much of King; I thought they all belonged to each other, but I did not trouble myself about them then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dale Ingram. I was sent for to Mr. Kirby on Friday the 7th of June, a little after 10 at night, to the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand. In passing through the alley, I found a vast quantity of blood. When I came into the room, his forehead was pouring out; I believe there were near two quarts of blood; I found the two great vessels on his forehead divided; there was a large transverse wound across the nose; it was open so wide, that I saw the bone naked. I examined the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the nose slit?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. The old word slit we now leave off, and call it divided, in surgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what was formerly called slitting?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. It is; we understand them as synonymous terms. When it comes there, we call it a transverse slit wound. Mr. Wiseman, who wrote on surgery, makes use of the word slitting for what we now call dividing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a blow was across the arm, would not that be a slit wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. We make no distinction whether it is directed one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they had slit the nostril?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. We call that an incis'd wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the wound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. It began from the right, and went across the eye lid, and across the nose; the two muscles of the nose were cut through; it proceeded to the left eye lid, and terminated at the temple: there is a nerve cut: I suppose the eyes were saved by the knife touching the hat. the hat saved him, or I believe it would have been fatal.</p>
               <p>Dr. Morris. I saw the wound; it was of a very alarming kind; I advised for sending for farther help, left very bad consequences should attend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can that be called a slitting?</p>
               <p>Dr. Morris. I should think there is no impropriety in calling that a slit; the nose was cut across through to the bone; all the vessels were divided. In many old authors, such wounds are called slits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. On the Sunday I was desired to wait on Mr. Kirby.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard Mr. Ingram's description of the wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. I have; I found he had received a wound across the nose, and across the left eye to the temple; it was not then bare; it had been dress'd; there was a great inflammation, and a very large wound; I saw it open'd and dress'd; the flesh of the nose was entirely divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it proper to call that a slit?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. Slit is a word not made use of now; but if any body had told me of the wound, and made use of the word slit. I should have known what they meant. I understand the words slit and cut to be synonymous terms.</p>

             was after me; I sent for him, knowing my innocence. When he took me up in the Ruins of St. Giles's, he took me to the round-house; then he told me it was for cutting a gentleman's face. I know nothing at all about it.</p>

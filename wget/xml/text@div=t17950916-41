               <p>Q. What time of the morning? - Nearly on five; I see Mac Donald in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go down stairs? -My wife waked me, and said there was somebody in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body in the house yourself? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mac Donald inside or outside of the door? - Inside of the door</p>
               <p>Q. Had the door been locked the over night? - Yes, I locked it myself; the bar of the door was forced open, that which fastens it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of Mac Donald? - Yes, I never see Mac Orkhill but the night before. I looked to the left, and I see Mac Donald in the bar, taking the money out of the till, and putting it into his pocket; I could not tell whether it was silver or halfpence; he still continued taking the money out of the till, and putting it into his pocket; I says, Mac Donald! Mac Donald! Mac Donald had lodged in my house two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was Mac Orkhill you see inside of the door, and Mac Donald you see taking the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure that you knew Mac Donald? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the same certainty to Mac Orkhill? - Yes, I can; they were both in regimentals; I says, Mac Donald! Mac Donald! for God's sake, says he, what is the matter, Mr. Young; my wife answered and said, Mac Donald, what is it you? my wife followed me down stairs, and stood on the right side of me. Says I, when you have done walk forward, I said so to Mac Donald; as soon as he came out of the bar I laid hold of the skirts of his coat, I took him towards the foot of the stairs, I went up some stairs, and he was up one; my wife went up stairs to alarm the house, and one Haydon he came down stairs first, a lodger to me, and as soon as he see Haydon, Mac Donald made a sudden plunge, and got from me, Haydon followed in pursuit of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160103"></xptr>him; he came back and told me he found it was of no use, he could not overtake them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both run away? - Yes, both; I immediately went in pursuit of a constable; I followed them down to the Barracks at Knightsbridge, they told me at the Barracks that Mac Donald had been there, and had half drest his horse and gone; I staid there some time, they were called over, and I could not see either one of them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the call over? - That might be half after six, or seven o'clock, within a few minutes; I see the corporal, and the corporal told the general, or colonel, or whoever he is, that he was deserted</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this did you get your money? - I did not, nor no part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lose in all? - I cannot say to a pound, nearly on twenty pounds, in halfpence and silver, from a till in the bar; I locked it myself the over night; it appeared to be forced. This happened on Wednesday morning; on Friday I went with the constable to the King's Arms, Tower-hill, to take Mac Donald; he had entered into another regiment, the Louth Volunteers; we found the other man at the Barracks at Knightsbridge; he stood centry the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. Mac Orkhill you had never seen before that night? - That night he came to lodge with Mac Donald.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Mac Donald was taking of the money, did Mac Orkhill see what he was about? - Yes, it was daylight almost.</p>
               <p>Q. He was standing in a situation that he could see? - Yes, he was standing opposite.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Mac Orkhill only. When you came down, the person you say was Mac Orkhill had the door open in his hand, and he went away directly, did he not? - Whether he heard me or not I cannot tell, he passed from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you see him in the act of going out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you are as sure of Mac Orkhill as you are of Mac Donald? - I never see the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer. Whenever you see Mac Orkhill, you was as sure of Mac Orkhill as you was of Mac Donald; you did not mistake there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this house? - Nearly six months, better than five.</p>
               <p>Q. The till happened to be very rich? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I think it is a rich till that contains twenty pounds? - It has been as rich a good many times before and since.</p>
               <p>Q. You always thought it was somewhere about twenty pounds, and always said so, you are sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body comes and represents you have said otherwise, they must tell a lie of course? - Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. Estimating the value of your till, you never said there were ten or twelve shillings in it? - That day I did not know what I had lost, till the next morning, my wife did not tell me; I started off after them as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had not lost more than ten or twelve shillings? - I might say so, or I might not, to my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to recollect that, because it is an important thing? - I will speak the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your recollection, and tell me whether you did not say to more persons than one that you had not lost more than ten or twelve shilling? - I don't know to my knowledge particularly what I did say that morning, I might say so, or not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160104"></xptr>Q. Don't you believe that you did, and don't you know that you did? - I could not tell at that time what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body that you had lost ten or twelve shillings? - Can I say a thing that I don't know from my heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Then now, thought you have taken up the men for robbing you of twenty pounds, yet you cannot tell whether you never told people that you had not lost more than ten or twelve shillings? - I might say so, more or less, I never said positively that I had only lost ten or twelve shillings not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You were always sure of the person of Mac Orkhill; when you see him; you never in your life could mistake any man for Mac Orkhill? Perhaps you did not hear the question, I will repeat it; you was always sure, &amp;c. - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pitch on any other person as Mac Orkhill; yes, or no? - When I see him I knew that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer, but I will have an answer I assure you; on your oath the next morning did not you pitch on a man of the name of Waller, and say that is Mac Orkhill, and that I will swear to? - The next morning?</p>
               <p>Q. I will not be particular to the morning or afternoon, at any time before Mac Orkhill was taken up did you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you swear positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will refresh your memory a little; on your oath did not Waller remonstrate to you for having pitched on him as Mac Orkhill, and you begged his pardon? - No such thing ever passed. Such a thing might pass, and it might escape my knowledge, one soldier being so much like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a thing might then pass? - No, it never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I tell you Waller is here, and I give you time to recollect yourself, I will give you leave once more to give me an answer; did you pitch on Waller as

               <p>Q. Did not you pitch on him as Mac Orkhill? - Not to my knowledge I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have sworn positive? - Have I sworn positive? I did not, besides the man that did it; I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a plain answer, yes, or no? - Not to my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see there is nothing like bringing people to the ten; you have sworn positively three times you did not pitch on him; on your oath did not you beg the man's pardon, saying one soldier is so much like another? - I might say that, but I never did beg the man's pardon, I might ask them a civil question, and they might give me a civil answer, the same as other people do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, six on that man as Mac Orkhill? - Not to my knowledge, I might say several things that morning that I do not recollect; did I take the man up on suspicion?</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to say that you never said that man was

               <p>Q.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On Wednesday morning, the 29th of July, I heard two men get up and come down stairs, which waked me, and I heard one go out of the yard door, and open and shut it several times; it was about five o'clock in the morning; the other went to the bar door, and forced the lock back, I heard it all, I was awake; the bar door was locked the over night; and I heard him go into the bar, and force at the till, and open it, and when it opened it made a gingling, and I awaked my husband, and told him somebody was in the bar, and he ran down stairs, and I followed him, and the first that I see was Mac Donald, in the bar, with his hands in the till, taking out the money, and putting it into his pockets; I called out Mac Donald, but he made me no answer, and my husband called Mac Donald twice, and then he came out and asked him what was the matter, and my husband catched him by the coat, and I ran up stairs to alarm the other lodgers, and the first I came to was 
               <persName id="t17950916-41-person445">

            , and he ran down stairs before me, and when Mac Donald saw him coming down stairs, he forced away from my husband, and ran out at the door, and that was the last that I see him; I see nobody else; I did not see the other at all, I heard two, but I did not see but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Mac Donald had lived some time in your house as a lodger? - Yes, he had. It was broad day light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your husband has no other business but the public business? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He gives change from the till as well as you? - No, he does not, he is more in the tap room than he is in the bar, he brings the money to me, and I give change.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose when you went to bed again you talked over your loss? - He went immediately up stairs and dressed himself, and went out and got a constable, and went after them; he never asked me about it till night; there was about twenty pounds in the till, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a large sum of money to be in the till, a very extraordinary sum, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160106"></xptr>never had so much money in the till before? - Yes, we had, but we never had been robbed before, and so we had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long have you been in this house? - About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. And twenty pounds in the till, in silver and halfpence; is it always your custom to leave your till in the bar at night? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. How much beer do you draw in a month? - Ten or eleven butts, besides spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what is the probable receipt in the course of the day? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You never took twenty pounds? - No, not in a day.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first examine to see how much money was missing from this till? - I had not seen the till that day, for my husband had the key of the till in his pocket, out with him; the last time I looked in the till was on Sunday night, then there was fifteen or sixteen pounds in silver and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been robbed, how soon did you look at your till? - I never looked at the till until night.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you find missing? - It was all gone, but about sixpenny worth of halfpence, and a few farthings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Prosecutor. Where do you live now, do you live at this public house still? - We have left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now? - In Calomel-buildings, No. 10.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to this till, when you went up stairs to dress yourself, after you see the money, did you lock the till, or how did you leave it? - When I went up stairs I left it open, when I came down I locked it; the money was gone, except a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before you went out in pursuit of the prisoner, you knew what money was missing? - I did not know particular what was in the till, my wife did, I don't know when I had looked in it before, to know what quantity was in it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a lodger. The wife came up stairs and awaked me, and I went down stairs, and I said, O, Mac Donald! and he gave himself a turn round, and got away from Mr. Young's hand, and went through the door, and went out, I went out after him, and Mac Orkhill was about ten yards from the door, when I got to the door on the outside; I had never seen him before the over night; he has got a tooth that stands rather out, on the right side, I took particular notice of that in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two men that you see in the morning, in the same uniform that you see the over night? - Yes, I drank part of a pint of beer with one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all about the person of Mac Orkhill? - All that I have got to say is, I see him within six yards of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the person that came into the house the over night to lodge? - Yes. I pursued them up the court, and Mac Orkhill says to Mac Donald, d-mn you, come forward, or we shall both be taken. I followed them to Portman-mews, and I durst not follow them any further, and I immediately turned back and came home and dressed myself, and went to the Barracks with Mr. Young; and Mac Donald had dressed one part of his horse, and left the other undressed; I went all through the stable, and could not see him, and we went to a public house and had a pot of beer. and the corporal came and said Mac Donald had deserted; I could find neither of them there, and I came back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You had been living some time with Mr. Young? - It is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160107"></xptr>long since I came from abroad, and lodged with Young.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a sad loss of Young's? - I cannot tell what the loss was, he told me twenty pounds, two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you ask him that? - I did not stop in the house, I was not at home, except at dinner, when I did not stop five minutes in the house, nor did not speak to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor they to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You see Mr. and Mrs. Young when you came home in the evening? - No, I did not see Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had not you the curiosity to say, ma'am, what have you lost? - I never asked her that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor she had not the curiosity to tell you? - No, she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that they told you three or four days afterwards? - They told me that they counted it, and it was twenty pounds that was missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps Mr. Young might tell you that very probably he might get forty pounds for it? - I declare upon my oath he never mentioned such a word to me.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were following the people all the way; were you in your shirt? - I had a light flannel jacket on, a pair of trowsers and my slippers; I followed them as far as I durst follow them.</p>


               <p>Q. Still you was always behind? - A good reason, because I could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Q. You was then always behind? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see this tooth behind him? - I see his tooth the over night, and the next morning we stood face to face, waiting for Mac Donald's coming out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him waiting? - How could I see him waiting, as soon as Mac Donald came out he ran on.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with Young, did not you see the troops drawn up? - Yes, I see them drawn up in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Young see him there, standing centry? - No, it was me and my partner only.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Young. You say you did not know till the evening that the twenty pounds was missing; your husband's account is, that he locked the till when he came down stairs; did not you want to go to the till in the course of the whole day? - No, I did not, I had plenty of halfpence and silver in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it opened first? - In the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did not you go to the till that day? - I did not, I had the key all day in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him when this enquiry took place, about his being robbed? - Yes, I did, at eight o'clock in the morning, when he came to the Barracks at Knightsbridge, the troop were then parading.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mac Orkhill, then there or not? - He was the next file to me, the next man to me, on the left hand side; Young asked the corporal to look over the men, for the man that had robbed his house, and he did, and when he had done he said the man was not there; he took no more notice of Mac Orkhill than he did of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - Not at that time; in the evening I had. In the afternoon Thomas Bennet and me were going to the stables, in Portland-street, and we met Young, and he came up to me, and he looked me very seriously in the face, and he stopped Thomas Bennet, and he said I was the man. In the evening when I see him at Knightsbridge I asked him what reason he had for thinking I was the man that had been concerned with Mac Donald in robbing his house? he begged my pardon, and said, that one soldier was so much like another that it was very hard swearing to any man; and I think Mac Orkhill was present then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pretend to know Mac Orkhill then? - He did; but I dare say he did not, because he took no notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn at all from himself what was the amount of his loss? - I heard him say that morning, that he supposed that he had lost nearly twenty shillings in halfpence and farthings, and he dared to say there was some silver among them.</p>
               <p>Court. You knew Orkhill very well. Has he not rather a remarkable tooth? - He has one tooth that stands out.</p>

               <p>Q.

I went and informed the captain, and he had captain Lee's leave to look over the ranks again, which he did both the front and rear, and the man that was with him, and he said the man was not there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220109"></xptr>Court. Did you lock it? - I did not lock it, nor the office door neither, I shut the door; I returned in about ten minutes; I found the prisoner in the office, he offered me 10 s. to take for his 9 s. 8 d. I blamed him much for telling me a lye at first, and was rather surprised to find he had 10 s. after he had declared he had but 5 s. 3 d. when I took the 10 s. I saw a shilling which struck me I had seen before; I then opened my drawer, and began to look over my silver; the witness Saunders said immediately, you have lost your gold; I said I had; I rung the bell immediately, and inquired if any body else had been there, they said no; the prisoner remained there; there was a lad coming, who was in the passage, I believe; I bid him to shut both doors, and told the prisoner I must be under the necessity of searching him, on which he said, you need not search me, I have got 36 s. in my pocket; I laid hold of him, and immediately he pulled out the three half guineas, and some silver; I asked him, where he got it? he said it was his own money, and said I need not be surprised at his having that, for he had six and thirty shillings in his pocket which he had received of one Mr. Jaques that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your office had been pretty full? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left the office-door unlocked, and the drawer unlocked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were other persons who have access to the drawer beside yourself? - There was no other person that day.</p>
               <p>You did not come 'till a quarter past ten? - No.</p>
               <p>Is the house inhabited? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Every person that inhabits that house then, can of course have access to the office?</p>
               <p>Court. It goes further, the door being unlocked, any body might have access.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The door of that house is opened in the time of publick business? - No, it is not kept open.</p>

               <p>There was a lad in the passage, you said? - I only asked him a question, and discharged him immediately.</p>
               <p>It frequently occurs, that people that come to discharge their recognizances, represent themselves as being poor when they are really not? - Sometimes it happens that they say so.</p>

I said, no; he said, I have lost money; Mrs. Saunders said immediately, you have lost your gold; Mr. Denton said to the prisoner, I must be under the necessity of searching you; and then he said he had six and thirty shillings in his pocket, and pulled out two half guineas and some silver; then the lad went away.</p>
               <p>Pleading poverty is an old trick at that office when people come to draw recognizances? - I do not understand it; I was only there two days.</p>

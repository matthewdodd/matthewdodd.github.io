            . I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner in Paddington street; I searched him; I found the buckles in his right hand breeches pocket. After I had got the things in my hand, the prisoner said he meaned to take them back again, if he had the opportunity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the buckles in my possession four days. I was painting this room, and I saw these buckles in charge on the top of a little bulk among some old harness and rubbish in the lost; I took them, conceiving them to be of no value. On the Tuesday night I took them; on the Wednesday night I found them to be silver. I immediately related what I had done, and having to finish the job in the coachman's room, I wrapt them in paper in order to retain them till I went again.</p>

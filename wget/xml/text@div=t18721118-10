                  </hi>. I am barman at the Falcon public house, Green Street, Bethnal Green—on 6th November the prisoner came in with another man—he called for a pint of <hi rend="italic">half-and-half,</hi> which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me sixpence; I put it in the till, and gave him change—he then called for some more beer, and gave me a bad florin—I bent it, gave it back to him, and told him it was bad—he said that he got it from the gas-house, and gave me a good half-crown, for which I gave him change—I afterwards went to the till, and found a bad sixpence on top of two good ones—I had not taken any sixpences between; I had not been to the till—I charged the prisoner, and gave the sixpence to the constable—he said that he got the coin at the gas-house, and said "Don't be hard upon a poor b—"—I saw him searched at the station, and a small parcel containing bad money was taken from his trousers pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 318). I took the prisoner in Grove Road, about 200 yards from the Falcon—I charged him with uttering a counterfeit florin and sixpence—he said he did not know he had got any bad money about him—I took him to the station, and received this bad sixpence from Macaire—I searched the prisoner, and found in his right trousers pocket two packages, one containing four sixpences and the other nine, all counterfeit; and in his left trousers pocket a bad florin, which Macaire identified—I also found eight shillings and five florins, three of which were in one pocket, and two loose—there was paper between them—I told him they were bad—he said that he picked them up; it was a bad job, and he must put up with it.</p>

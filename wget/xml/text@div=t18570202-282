                  </hi>. My father keeps a hosier's shop in Bridge-street, West-minster. On 23rd Jan. the prisoner came to the shop to buy a pair of cloth gloves—they came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign in payment—I cannot say whether it was good or not—I placed it in the till, where there was no other sovereign—I am sure of that—I took out of the till about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but had not sufficient to give him change—I went inside, and I gave him a half sovereign and nine shillings—he then said the gloves were too expensive, he wanted a pair for about 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I told him we had no such gloves, and I gave him back the sovereign from the till, and took back the change—he then said, "Well," he thought he would take them—I wrapped them in paper, and gave them to him—he gave me a sovereign in payment, and I gave him the change I had taken up—before he left the shop, I placed the sovereign on the tester, and thought it was bad—it was very light—I handed it to my father, and said, "I think this is bad—he said, "It is very bad "—the prisoner had by that time got across the road—I left the sovereign with my father, and went after the prisoner—he had crossed the corner towards Cannon-row—he turned the corner, and commenced running very quickly—I ran after him, and never lost sight of him—as he went along, he threw something away, but I could not see what it was—he was stopped in Cannon-row—he ran against a stable, and there he was taken by me—he was brought back to the shop—my father saw him, and he went to the station—when we came back from the station, we observed a half sovereign on the matting, on the floor, in the shop, outside the counter, exactly on the spot where the prisoner had stood when he was brought back—it was a good one—Baines brought me that evening the pair of gloves that the prisoner had bought.</p>

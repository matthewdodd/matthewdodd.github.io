            . I had been but five Minutes in the House when the Prisoner came in - He had worked with me about two Years ago - He said he was glad to see me, and so we sat down, and called for a Tankard of Beer. He said he had been an East India Voyage, and that the Captain's Boy was at the Door, but was so bashful that he would not come in. I have given him a Cake, says he, and I'll make bold to carry him some Drink to wash it down. And so he took the Tankard, and went to the Door, and then went quite off.</p>

            . Between eight and nine at Night, as I was going along Drury-Lane by the end of Russel-Street, I heard a cry of Stop Thief! he has stolen a Tankard.*  The Prisoner run, and one Austin stopt him, and he was carried to the Crown in Russel-Street, where the Tankard was taken out of his Pocket. I was Headborough, but this being out of my Parish, the Constable of Covent-Garden was sent for - The Tankard had a Boar's-Head upon it.</p>
               <p>* The Prisoner went from the Boar's Head in Fleet-Street to the King's Head in Drury-Lane, where he play'd at Cards. The Boy of the House perceiving something bulky in his Pocket, told him he had got something more than his own, upon which, the Prisoner went away. The Boy followed and said to him, If you don't give me a Pot, I'll blow ye. The Prisoner telling him he had got no Money, and running away; the Boy called to Austin, who pursued the Prisoner and took him.</p>

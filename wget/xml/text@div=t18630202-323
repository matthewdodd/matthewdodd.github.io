                  </hi>. I am the son of Isaiah Lewis, an upholsterer, of 26, and 27, Elm-street, Finsbury—on 22d January last, between 12 and 4 o'clock the prisoner came to our shop and asked for an Arabian bedstead—I showed her some, one at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she eventually bought the cheapest of the two, and paid for it with what I supposed to be a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has on it a stamped endorsement of "Miller and Son, Piccadilly," and some other endorsements, and my own name; I put that on it when she gave it me—I wished her to pay for the bedstead when it was sent home—she said she knew it was our custom not to leave the goods without the money, and she would rather pay for it at the time she bought it—I said I had not change in the house, and asked her to sit down while I sent for it, which she did—I sent Reed, our shopman, out with the note to be changed—the prisoner came into the counting—house to give her address, where I was to send the bedstead—I took it down—it was "Mrs. Beaumont, 1, Wellington—place, Britannia—street, City—road"—when Reed returned with the change, he handed me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the prisoner 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave her a receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she took it away with her—we paid the note away the same night—it was afterwards returned to us marked "forged"—I subsequently identified the prisoner as the woman who gave me the note.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Lewis—I recollect the prisoner coming to the shop on 2d January—I was in the shop—she addressed me first at the door—she said she required an Arabian bedstead—I handed her Over to Mr. Thomas Lewis, and he supplied her with one—she was in the shop, I should say, about a quarter of an hour; she eventually purchased a bedstead—I heard her give her address, "Beaumont, No. 1 or 2, Welling<lb></lb>ton-place, Britannia-street, City-road"—she paid the note to Mr. Lewis, and be said to me, "Go and get change for this"—I said, "Have you endorsed it?" and I saw him put "Thomas Lewis" on the note—I saw some initials or some<lb></lb>thing of that sort on the note besides, but I did not take any particular notice of it—I went and got it changed—I gave the lady 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Mr. Lewis 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I gave her the change, she was carrying a black bag or reticule, such as are used by ladies—she took a porte-monnaie out of that, and she made the observation as she passed it into the porte-monnaie, "It is very necessary to be careful in the streets of London"—I saw her again at the Worship-street, police-court, and recognised her the moment I saw her—she was then coming out of a doorway where they keep the prisoners—I don't know whether she came out alone—I did not hear her asked to put her name on the note—it is not the custom at our shop to ask parsons to endorse them—it is done at other places—I have seen my employer do to, bat he is one thing and his son another—I never saw the prisoner between the time of the purchase, and my seeing her at Worship-street—I was going to identify her, and the policeman said, "Come this way"—I said to him, "I have passed the woman"—he took me into an adjoining room where there were two more, and I said, "That is the woman"—I recognised her as I was going to be introduced to others—she was not in the dock, she was standing by the side of a doorway—Mr. Lewis was not with me at that time—the prisoner was standing in the court; I suppose she was in custody, I don't know whether she was brought in by mistake.</p>

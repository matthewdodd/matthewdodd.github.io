                  </hi>. I am a widow; I keep a beer shop at West Ham. In the beginning of March I had a pair of scales, which I kept in a cupboard under a flight of stairs—I missed them on Thursday, 28th March—I had seen them safe on the Friday before that—they were not all taken away, only the brass and copper part—I had another pair of scales which I kept in the same place, and on the same occasion I missed the brass and chain part of them—I gave information to a constable, and on the following morning Mr. Reeves brought back my scales—this is the small scale, and this is the brass and chain of the large scale—I can swear to this by a mark there is on it.</p>

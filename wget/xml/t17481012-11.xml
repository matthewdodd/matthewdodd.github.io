             . The prisoner came up into my room, and there was a lad and a woman; and as soon as he came up, he took my wedding ring off my finger, and went down stairs; and I said, come, give me my ring, but he went away with it, and I did not see him again till the 10th of Febr. and then I charged him with robbing me; and he said, the ring was pawned in Whitechapel, and he would redeem it, and he did redeem it on the 10th of Febr. and I asked him to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. So after he had robbed you, you asked him to come to your house; what did you do that for?</p>
               <p>Cornish. In order to get him there, to take him. And on the 21st of Febr. he came again to my room, and took away the same ring that he had redeemed; and then he came another time, and took a ring off a chest of drawers, and I said, you rogue, what, are you come to rob me again? I met him some time afterwards, and asked him where they were, he said he had pawned them, but I should have them again; but he sold them three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I saw him afterwards the beginning of March, at a house where I was (one Bull's, in Dyer's street, Bloomsbury) and he offered me a dram, and I threw down the cup and broke it ; and he took an opportunity to abuse me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no husband ?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Not that lives with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish . I never saw him after March, till he was taken, which was the 28th of Sept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him after that till he was taken?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; but I had no body to take him up. I would have taken him up twenty times if I had had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Pris. Co. to Mrs. Cornish. I am obliged to say a thing to you, which makes against yourself. Did not the prisoner work for a tenant of yours, one Hookham?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think he work'd there about six weeks; where was your husband then?</p>
               <p>Cornish . He was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner lie all that time?</p>

               <p>Cornish. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cornish . I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he took the ring off your finger in Febr. was the time of his visiting you before this, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No; it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. So he visited you for six weeks afterwards?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I do not remember the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the ring in a jocose manner?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; he took it off my finger, and run down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you go with this young man to take this ring out of pawn?</p>
               <p>Cornish. Yes; because he promised to pay me for the ring 5 s. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did not you give him this ring?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ring pawn'd?</p>
               <p>Cornish. At one Dawson's, in Bell yard, Whitechappel .</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the second ring, what time was that taken away?</p>
               <p>Cornish. On the 21st of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Now were they two different rings, or the same ring?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120014"></xptr>Cornish. It was the same ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how often did you see him after the 21st of February, before you got a warrant for him?</p>
               <p>Cornish. About three or four times, I was very ignorant, and did not know how to go about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the third ring taken from you?</p>
               <p>Cornish. At Mrs. Bull's, I was there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And had you no bedfellow there?</p>
               <p>Cornish. I lay with Mr. Bull, his wife, and his child.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray now did not Mr. King lay with you one night there?</p>
               <p>Cornish. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your father-in-law beat you for?</p>
               <p>Cornish. For nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Estber Lander. About a fortnight ago, the prisoner owned he took the ring, and was very willing to make her recompence, and before the justice, on the 8th of September, he said, as she had let it alone so long, he would take his remedy at law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barret. I am a plaisterer in Mount Street, by Grosvenor Square, the prisoner worked for me a year and an half, and when work was scarce, I employed him at home, believing him to be a very sober honest man; and I employed him where-ever I could.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawson . The prisoner and this Woman came to my house to redeem a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you asked him if this woman was his wife?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Yes, I did, and he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in her hearing?</p>
               <p>Dawson . Yes, he was as near to her as I am now.</p>

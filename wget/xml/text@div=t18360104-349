                  </hi>. I am the son of John Smart, a brush-maker, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. Last Friday I was in my father's shop, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner standing at one end of the window, and another man at the other end—the other took the brushes off the nail, And gave them to the prisoner, who ran up the street, putting them under his jacket into his breast—he ran down Wild-street, I ran after him, calling "Stop thief," a policeman ran after him, and then he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the brushes into White-horse-yard—the police<lb></lb>man caught him in Drury-lane—I picked up the brushes—they belong is my father—I gave them to the policeman—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

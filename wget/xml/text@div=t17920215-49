               <p>I went in with this young man, and he acquainted me that he had some tools in Mr. Walker's shop; and I went with him for these tools, to accompany him, as I had not any tools, and was out of employ; and I accompanied this young man, and he told me that they were his tools, and I had these tools of him; and then afterwards he acquainted me that he had left his tools in the shop, but they were locked up in Mr. Walker's workhouse, or repository, where he kept his tools; at last then I found out that these tools were not his; he gave me the tools; we had them together jointly, on Saturday evening; we did not go there with an intent to take any tools at all, but with an intent to lay there to sleep, as we were out of lodgings, and could not get any at that time.</p>

               <p>I left Mr. Walker's shop between three and four, on Saturday; I carried my tools to one Mr. Talmarsh, at Kingston; I left my tenon saw there for 3 s. or 4 s. I owed him: Mr. Walker gave me a job, and I was to go to work for him on Monday morning; and I asked Mr. Walker if he would lend me half-a-crown, by leaving my tools there till Monday morning; says he, young man, go over to the King's-arms, and I shall have money when I come to pay my men; going over to the King's-arms, I saw this young man; he asked me what trade I was; I told him I was a <rs id="t17920215-49-deflabel282" type="occupation">joiner and carpenter</rs>

               <p>Court to Mr. Walker. Had this man worked for you? - He had worked one day in two days; he was not to work for me on Monday.</p>

                  </hi> I am a widow, and live in Ebenezer-place, Bunhill<lb></lb>row. The prisoner lives with my daughter, Mary Montgomery—on the 28th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner's house—he was not at home—I found my daughter there—I went away, and I went again in the afternoon—when I got close to the house I heard my daughter cry out—I went in, and found the prisoner and her quarrelling—he had her <hi rend="italic">throttled</hi>—I went to her assistance—he had got hold of her by the neck, I cannot exactly say whether with his hands or with anything else—I got her away from him as well as I could, and put her into passage—he told me several times to let her go—after I had got my daughter away, the prisoner turned round, and said, "You b—y old cow, if I don't have satisfaction of her, I will of you"—he had something in his hand, but, in the height of my passion, I cannot tell whether it was a stool or not—he had a stool in his hand, but whether it was with that, or anything else, I know not, but he struck me on the temple—I was taken to the doctor's, and then to the hospital—I remained there from Monday evening till the Friday following—I had not struck him, or done anything besides getting him away from my daughter—I had said nothing to him—I never had an angry word with him—I have known him twenty years—he is a very hasty young man—he had been living with my daughter ten months—he was a little intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a customer of Mr. Homewood's. On the 6th of December I received two loaves from the prisoner, and no more—I am sure I am not mistaken—I have a sheet of paper here on which the pri<lb></lb>soner wrote, "6th December, two loaves."</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner took out bread on the 6th of December, for which he accounted to me in this book. On the 6th of December he charges three loaves to Mary Brown—I took it from his own lips—he took out ninety-two loaves that day—he must have charged more to her to make his account square, and he has charged a great many other customers more than they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I must have made a mistake, having to deliver so many loaves. I could not always be correct; but if I found a mistake one week, I made it right the next. I once put four loaves in Mrs. Brown's book when she had but three, and I paid her for that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I was in the habit of making out weekly bills, but he did not deliver them, and a number were found on him, some of Mrs. Brown's—I detected this by a bill being sent to a customer with "bill delivered" so much added to the weekly bill—the prisoner erased the amount of the bill delivered, and left the bottom part, and the customer seeing there was something wrong sent to me—he has done that in several instances—I have told him of it, and he has given me the money—he was in my service nine weeks this time, and previously for about two years—he takes a private memorandum-book with him when he goes round with the bread, and he always accounts to me from that book—I could not by mistake have put down more than he told me—he saw what I put down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have often found my bread short. One Saturday afternoon, instead of eighty loaves I found but seventy.

I have had to pay 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week out of my own pocket, to make the account right. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is not so—it is false—he has got very much in my debt since he has been with me—the last week he was with me he booked twenty-seven loaves</p>

               <p>to various people more than they had—his account is right on the face of it—I have weekly customers and ready money customers, and the weekly bills, which I made out regularly, he never delivered—it appears that Mrs. Adams always paid ready money, but I made her hills out because he occasionally booked bread to her—I have gone through the rest of the ninety-two loaves, and find that he has entered more to the persons who did not pay, than they had, to make the account right—I went round to all my customers on the Monday, and found he had charged ten more loaves to different parties than he had delivered—the greater part of my customers keep books, and I inspected them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I certainly took a book round with me, but having generally to work eighteen hours a day I was tired, and it got dark before I finished delivering the bread, so that I did not always put it down till I got home, and then I have fallen asleep after working so many hours, and may have made a mistake—it is entirely a mistake.</p>

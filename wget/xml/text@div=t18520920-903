                  </hi>. I am employed in the General Post Office, and live at Dalston. On Thursday evening, 2nd Sept., I was in Tabernacle-walk, Hoxton—I saw a boy running, pursued by a man in a butcher's dress—I do not recognize the prisoner as being the man, only by his height and appear<lb></lb>ance—I could not see his features—the boy ran about six or eight yards before the man overtook him—he then slid himself on the pavement close to the wall, and the man came up and gave him a slap on the head—the boy said something, and he gave him another, and the boy laid himself on his side—the man hit him first on the left side of his head with his open hand, and then on the other side—several people came round, spoke to the butcher, and requested him not to go away, as it appeared he had hurt the boy, but he went—the policeman came up, and I, supposing there could be nothing the matter, went on—I did say to a person standing by, "You had better have him re<lb></lb>moved to the other side, for I believe the boy is merely imposing on the public, to get the sympathy of the passers by"—that was my impression, or I should have stopped to see the result; I thought the boy was shamming.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 2nd Sept. I was in Tabernacle-walk, and saw the boy running, and the prisoner after him—I saw him follow him across the road for about twenty yards, as near as I can say; at the end of those twenty yards the prisoner overtook the boy, and hit him on the right side of the head, and with that the boy leaned towards the wall, and laid him<lb></lb>self down on his left side—I only saw one blow—I should say that hit him at the side of the ear—I did not think anything about it, and went away—I have known the prisoner by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The boy was brought to me; he was collapsed and in a dying state—I administered stimulants, and did what I could for him—he lived not more than five minutes—I afterwards, in con<lb></lb>junction with another gentleman, made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was nothing about the body to cause death, but a rupture of a vessel in the base of the skull—the blood vessels of the brain were turgid, and the conse<lb></lb>quent effusion of blood was the cause of death—there were no external marks nor anything unhealthy internally—I have heard of the blows the deceased received, they might have produced such an injury—I believe a blow was the cause of the rupture of the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say a vessel of the brain could be ruptured by any blow that would leave no external mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when there is considerable effusion of blood immediately—there was no extrava<lb></lb>sated blood, it was fluid—I never met with a case before where there was a vessel ruptured by a blow which left no external mark, but I have heard of such a thing—the boy was not so old as fifteen or sixteen—he was a boy of general good health, not of a particularly full habit of body—I did not see anything in the internal organization of this vessel to rupture it easily—it was the artery leading to the brain on the right side—that was the only artery which was ruptured—a shake would not cause the rupture so easily as a blow—in consequence of the rupture there was no external mark—supposing the boy was running very fast, and suddenly dropped down, that would be very likely to cause the rupture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard what Mr. Ireland has stated, and agree with him—in my judgment the cause of death was a rupture of a vessel at the side of the brain, leading to the membranes of the brain on the right side—I have heard the description of the blow inflicted—I think such a blow would cause death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You seriously believe that boxing a person's face is extremely dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not boxing the face; boxing behind the ear over the seat of that vessel—there was no external mark—vessels are not frequently ruptured by excitement—a sudden jar may do it—if a person were running, and suddenly dropped down, that would not rupture a vessel unless it was previously diseased—I did not understand Mr. Ireland to say so—I have met with a ruptured vessel from a box on the ear in this way, and found no mark outside.</p>

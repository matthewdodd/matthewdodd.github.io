                  </hi>. In December last I was in the service of Mr. Hill, a town-carman, and drove one of his carts—I went out daily, and took a stand among other carts, to be hired—I was standing in Thames-street, on the 4th of December, and saw the prisoner Vincent in Thames-street—I had known him before—it was about eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had been doing a little job for a gentleman in Thames-street, and had some beer with five or six others, at the Lion and Key—Vincent was there—I saw him again about half an hour after—he said he had got some friends coming down for twenty casks of butter, and as I had nothing to do would I do it—I asked him whether it was Priestley's work (Priestley is a master carman, who generally does the butter work)—he said, "No," it was not Priestley's—he went away then for about a quarter of an hour, then returned, and gave me a note—he said there was twenty tubs of butter all ready to put into the cart, in the new warehouse, and they <hi rend="italic">knowed</hi> about them—he did not mention Barber's quay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this, is it the order ho gave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, because I never opened it—it was doubled up like this—I can read writing a little—when we had this conversation we were close to one part of Mr. Barber's warehouses—the warehouse I received the butter at is called the New warehouse, because it has been lately built—I went there—I did not take my cart at first—I gave the order to a young man there—he went and showed it to Mr. Murphy, in the warehouse—Murphy told him to go to the counting-house and show it, which was done—the young man came back, and said I might have the twenty tubs, I am pretty sure he said twenty tubs—I went and fetched my cart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was Vincent when you went with your horse and cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was in Thames-street at the time, he was ten or twelve yards from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I brought the horse and cart to the warehouse, he stood about the same distance—the twenty tubs were put into the cart—I saw Vincent while the cart was loading—he stood close against the tail of the cart—I had some mats over the horse and on the copse of the cart—when the butter was put in, Vincent got to the off-side of the cart, and moved the mats more back into the cart, which would partly cover the tubs, but not all—my master then came up to me, and asked where I was going—I told him—I then proceeded with the cart over Tower-hill—Vincent ordered me to take the road to Whitechapel—he kept on the near side of the way—he walked on the path, and I rode on the near side of the cart—I went on till I got near Whitechapel-church—I saw Vincent most all the way, and I found him there when I got there—he asked, by Whitechapel-church, if I had got money to pay the toll—I said</p>

               <p>"No"<lb></lb>he said he would get some—he then left me—he kept on, and spoke to some man going along—I cannot say who it was, as his back was towards me—I lost sight of him for some time—I went on to Mile-end-gate, and stopped at Mr. Man's, a little brewhouse, and called for halt a pint of beer—Vincent came up and said, "Make it a pint of beer"—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay the toll, and told me to go to the King's Arms, down the road—I went—he kept on walking—when I got to the King's Arms Vincent went in—he came out again, and said the parties were not there—we had some beer there, and dined—we staid there an hour and a half, or from that to two hours—while there a man named Roberts came up and joined Vincent—Roberts lived in North-street, Whitechapel, and kept a <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry-shop,</hi> a beer-shop and chandler's-shop—I said that I was stopping there too long, and told Vincent I was squandering my time, I wanted to get back again—Vincent came out again—Roberts was outside and spoke to him—we turned round, and went down a lane at the side of this pub<lb></lb>lic-house—it might be a quarter of a mile up that lane—we stopped at a public-house there—Vincent and Roberts were there—I saw two more men there—I knew one of them by sight—it was neither of the pri<lb></lb>soners—I saw a van near that public-house, with one horse in it—nothing was done with the butter there—the van drove away—Vincent and they all went away with the van and left me there—and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes Vincent came back, and told me to go on—he got on the cart itself, and drove it down another turning out of the lane, and there I found a van—I cannot say whether it was the same—Vincent and Roberts moved the butter out of my cart into the van, and drove on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the turning they went down take them out of sight of the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was one horse in the van, I think—I did not assist to move the butter into the van—I did the ropes up—Roberts and the two men went off with the van—it was about one hundred yards from the public-house—Vincent remained with me—I spoke about the money just before the van went, and Roberts told Vincent to pay me—after the van was gone, Vincent told me, as we came along, if they asked me where the butter went, to say it went in a van with four horses—he returned with me in my cart—we did not stop any where till we got to Roberts's house, in North-street—I went in there, and called for a pint of beer, and Vincent went into the chandler's-shop side—he came outside after that, and paid me a sovereign—the proper charge for the cart was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said I was to give my master the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for my<lb></lb>self—I gave my master 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we came into Whitechapel-road afterwards, and had a quartern and a half of rum—I kept 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., had the rum, and gave Vincent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told my matter the butter was put into a van with four horses.</p>

               <p>warehouse before—I had been to Barber's concern, and removed butter for Priestley, the town carman, when he was busy, four or five times—I am well known there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Vincent tell you nothing about the butter more than to go and take it away by virtue of that note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nobody heard him give me the order that I know of—there was no other carman by, I know—I went into the warehouse out of Vincent's sight, and there got the butter, which I brought out, and <hi rend="italic">put</hi> in the cart—he was about ten or twelve yards from me in the street when the butter was being delivered—Mr. Barber's people put it into the cart, I did not—I did not point out Vincent to them as having any thing to do with it—they did not ask any thing about it—I gave them the note, and they gave me the butter—they saw nothing of Vincent that I know of—when I drove off he walked on the off side of the cart on to Tower-hill—he then got on the pavement and walked on—I did not see him speak to any body there—I had often drank with him—It was about a mile from the warehouse that we had been when he said, "Make it a pint"—there were plenty of people there, but nobody that I knew—I did not ask where the butter was going to—Vincent did not tell me—I stated that it was a four-horse van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after the transaction did you hear of it again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour after—my master said Mr. Barber wanted to see me—I went to him and told him I took it down Whitechapel-road, and put it into a van with four horses—I did not then tell him who employed me—I did after<lb></lb>wards—I did not then know why he was inquiring about it, or that it was stolen not till he said it was a forged order—he said so then—I did not then tell him Vincent had employed me—they took me up, and put me in the Compter—I was taken before the Lord Mayor two or three days after—I was in custody during that time, but nobody came to me that I could mention about Vincent to—I did not tell the officer who took me to the Mansion-house, of Vincent, nor the Lord Mayor, because the Lord Mayor asked me no questions—I was remanded—I was at the Compter from Friday till Monday, and then went to Lambeth-street—I then told about Vincent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard in the meantime that any body else had been taken up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was committed as a witness—I was never in prison before on any charge of felony, only for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was in the service of Mr. Thomas Bailey, as carman—I left'on account of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the fore<lb></lb>man, and he accused me of stealing some silk—Mr. Bailey did not dis<lb></lb>charge me, it was the foreman—I was not discharged from any other ser<lb></lb>vice in the same manner—Mr. Hill pays me weekly, unless I have money in the course of the week—I have frequently kept money back in the course of the week, which is taken out of my wages on Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were your wages under stoppage at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the time I buried my wife—he lent me some money, I took a little more, and it was stopped at so much a week—I gave Vincent the shilling for giving me the job, it is always usual—we always get something, and if any body is with us we always give them something—it did not occur to me that this was an ir<lb></lb>regular transaction at first, till Mr. Barber mentioned it—I thought it very queer when Vincent mentioned about the four horses, but not till then—I did not mention about it till eight days afterwards—I told my master it was a van and four horses that took it away—I described the person who employed me as a stout man—I did not give his name—I did not give a</p>

I think, and said I was to give him some<lb></lb>thing for himself provided I bought it—I said it would not do for me unless it was very good, and I should not buy it unless I saw it—he said they should bring me one in the afternoon, about three or four o'clock, to see if I liked it—as he was going away I said, "There is some butter stolen from Mr. Barber's quay, it is none of that, is it?"—I do not exactly know what he said, but it was "Oh no," or something to that purpose—he said nothing about the quality—I did not ask him about it—I did not see him again that day—I went out, and left word at home if any body called with any thing, to leave it, but nothing came—I saw him about eleven or twelve o'clock</p>

               <p>the business for Mr. Robinson—on Friday, the 7th of December, the prisoner Christall came to my house between four and fire o'clock in the afternoon—I did not know him before—he said he had some butter to sell, and that his name was Hancock—I asked him if he was brother to Mr. Hancock of Great St. Helen's, as I knew Mr. Robinson had dealt with Mr. Hancock—he said no, but he knew Mr. Robinson, and had had dealings with him—I told him I had no recollection of him—he said yes, he had sold him a 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of butter some time ago—I have no recollection of any dealings whatever with him—Mr. Robinson is since dead—he said he lived in Great Alie-street, next door to the Black Horse—he asked me to buy, and brought a sample in his pocket in paper—it was not left with me—he said it was Kiel butter, and 84<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was named as the price—there is a large quantity of that butter in the market from time to time—I looked at the sample, and tasted it—it was not very good—it appeared Kiel but<lb></lb>ter—after some conversation, he said he had got a cask outside if I would allow him to bring it in—I gave him leave—(a man named Tripp had been with me two days before, and I was aware of the robbery at Brewer's Quay)—the butter was brought in, by the prisoner Hopkins, in a cask co<lb></lb>vered with a sack—I told Hopkins to put it down at the end of my coun<lb></lb>ter, but Christall told him to take it into the back warehouse, which he did, and I and Christall then went into the back warehouse—mine is a whole<lb></lb>sale and retail shop—there are folding doors between the back and front shop—the sack was taken off in the back warehouse, and I found the head and top hoops had been taken off the cask—it contained Kiel butter—I tried the quality, and it was very good Kiel butter, worth about 104<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the market—I asked how long it had been landed—he said from thirty-six to forty hours—I asked where the head of the cask was—he said it was at home—I asked him what ship they came out of—he said, "You must not be too particular"—he gave no reason for that—I then asked if I could see the remainder of the butter, the bulk of the goods—he said I could—he had said he could supply me with ten casks a week, but he had only got five by him at present—I wished to see the other four—he said, if I would go home with him, I could see them—I went with him—the cask of butter was left at my warehouse—he took me to Toy's house, the Angel and Crown, Wellclose-square—I asked him, as we went along, what ship they came out of, and he said, "You must not be too particular, not ask so many questions"—he did not give me any account of the butter—I did not see any thing of Hopkins—I suppose he walked behind, as I saw him at Toy's house, in the tap-room—when we got to Toy's, Christall asked if I would take any thing to drink in front of the bar—I said no—he asked me to walk into the parlour, which is a back room behind the tap-room—I went towards there, and found that Christall had turned back, and gone into the tap-room—I turned back, and followed him unperceived by him—he went up to one of the boxes in the tap-room, and joined some person there, but who it was I cannot say—Toy was not there then—he came directly almost.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040220"></xptr>
               <p>and heard what passed—I said I could not stop, I expected to find the butters there—Christall wished me particularly to walk into the parlour and stop there—I said, no, I could not wait—Gregson then came up from the tap-room, and said to Christall, "Oh, if the gentleman makes any obstacle, I will give you the money for the butters"—Northcote was there, and could hear that—they were all together, Northcote, Christall, and Gregson—during this conversation Hopkins had returned, and was sitting in front of the bar—I do not know whether he could have heard the con<lb></lb>versation—Christall (I think) said it was not convenient to take me to the place where the butters were—I am not positive it was him—it was said in the hearing of the others—they said they did not like to point out the houses of their friends, as they were engaged in these smuggling transac<lb></lb>tions—I did not consent to wait—I said I would have nothing further to do with it, and left the house—I had got about half-way across Wellclose-square, when Christall came after me, and said it would be doing him a service if I would buy the butters, as he should only get his commission upon it—I said no, I would have nothing further to do with it—I called on Tripp at his lodgings within five minutes, on my way home, and com<lb></lb>municated to him what had passed—in consequence of that, Shelswell and Taylor, the officers, were sent for from Lambeth-street—I went home, and Tripp came to my house soon after, and Shelswell and Taylor were placed outside my door—I and Tripp looked more par<lb></lb>ticularly at the cask, and noticed the brand marks had been cut out—Christall then came to my house, and asked me to buy the one cask—I said no, I would not have any thing more to do with it—he said he had made a mistake, it was not Kiel butter, as he had told me, but it was Friezland butter—I told him no, it was not Friezland butter, it was Kiel, but I refused to buy it—he beckoned to Hopkins to come and take it away, and Hopkins came and put it on a truck in front of my door—I do not think there was any name on the truck, but I did not look parti<lb></lb>cularly—I did not notice whether they went away together—I saw it put into the truck, Hopkins being with it, and Christall left my house—I did not notice whether he covered it over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutor. On Friday, the 7th of December, Sutcliffe made a communication to me, and I procured Shelswell and Taylor—I went in to Sutcliffe's while Shelswell and Taylor remained outside—I went into the warehouse at the back of the shop, and saw a cask of butter covered over with a sack—there was no head on it, nor any top hoops—I saw the place where the dairy mark ought to have been was cut out—while I was there Christall came in and spoke to Sut<lb></lb>cliffe—Hopkins also came in, took the cask in his arms, took it out, and put it into the truck—that was while Christall was talking to Mr. Sut<lb></lb>cliffe—Hopkins had drawn up with the truck as Christall came in—I came out, and gave notice to Shelswell, and he and Taylor went down Red Lion-street, following Hopkins—I afterwards went to Toy's, after borrowing a great coat of Mr. Sutcliffe, that I might not be known—Toy was not at home—he came in in seven or eight minutes with a butter-knife in his hand—it was a regular knife for drawing samples of butter—I asked him what he wanted of a butter-knife—he said he had borrowed it of Mr. Jarvis—I knew Toy before, and that he had one child—I asked him if he was aware my employers had been defrauded of twenty casks of butter, and asked him if he knew any thing respecting these butters—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I then told him, I had received information from Mr. Sutcliffe that there were some more casks in or near his premises—he said he knew nothing at all about them—I told him there had been two men stopped, offering a cask of butter for sale, and if he did know any thing I begged of him to tell me—he then said he did know, but he would not tell me, for if he did he should get other people into trouble—I never said, "Never mind other people, look to yourself, you have got a wife and family"—he then said he did know, but he would not tell me—I told him he must take his chance then.</p>

Tripp applied to me on the 7th of December, and I went with Taylor within a few doors of Sutcliffe's—I did not see any thing brought out of the shop—I saw a cask of butter in a truck, covered with a sack—the sack was thrown carelessly over the top of the cask—we followed the truck to opposite the door of Potter, a green-grocer, in Rosemary-lane—Hopkins was drawing it—Christall</p>

However, I hope things will be better with you; yet I must be candid enough to say that we have all had a jolly laugh at your expenes. Mr. Jones, begs to be very kindly remembered to you, and at the same time he hopes that you will not be so far forgetful as to leave his shirts in the Isle of Wight; don't forget to take your regular dose, for Jones is very uneasy about your welfare. Wishing that you may receive this safe, and that it may be of service, I am yours truly, F. TOY."</p>

On the 17th of December, John Brown, my servant, came up - I went down stairs and found the prisoner in the wash-house with the officer; his clothes were very wet - the staple had been drawn out of the wash-house door-post.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there not a privy just by the wash-house? A. Yes: persons have access to it - there were fourteen or fifteen people in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live at Mr. Leman's. I went down at half-past ten o'clock and found the prisoner in the middle of the wash-house, near the water-butt; he said he thought it was the privy - I saw him drop a piece of calico and a pillow-case, and found near him a neckerchief and a waistcoat; they had been taken off a horse - I am sure I saw him drop the calico and pillow-case which had been in the copper; I was in the wash-house at seven o'clock, it was then all safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For three hours and a half you had not been there? A. No; I had been at home all the time, and saw the prisoner in the house; he asked me for some paper to go down stairs - I do not know that he had ever been to the privy before; it is on the left hand and the wash-house on the right - there was no light below;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140078"></xptr>persons do not go to the water-closet without leave: he had not been down above ten minutes - I saw him come in at half-past ten.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MOBBS. I am an officer. I was fetched, and found the prisoner in the wash-house; he said he had come to the privy - his left-hand trouser's pocket, his right coat pocket, the front of his shirt, and crown of his hat were wet; I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No. instrument of house-breaking? A. No: he had a knife.</p>
               <p>SARAH BROWN. I am the wife of Henry Brown. Not having a copper, I wash at Leman's; I left the wash-house at five o'clock, and all this property wet in the copper - here is a bit of calico, a pillow-case, handkerchief, and waistcoat: I also lost two sheets, two pillow-cases, three aprons, and other things which have not been found.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I had a candle in my hand when I opened the wash-house door; there was no light there - the door was shut. <rs id="t18300114-159-verdict860" type="verdictDescription">

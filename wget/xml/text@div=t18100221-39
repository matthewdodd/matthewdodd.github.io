               <p>Collins's Defence. Mrs. Ingram lived facing where I lived; she used to bring her work into my room, and sit with me; she wanted me to put in the lottery with her; she brought a gown into my room, and asked me to pawn it. I told her I could not, my husband was coming home. I told her to go up to Mrs. French, perhaps she would. She then asked me to buy it, I bid her four shillings for it. I gave her a shilling in part, and the remainder the next morning. She offered me half a guinea to take a false oath against this woman, that she did not bid her take this gown to pawn.</p>
               <p>French's Defence. The prosecutrix came up to me, she said, she had a frying-pan to sell, I bought it of her; she brought the gingham gown up to me, I pawned it for five shillings. I went out in the morning into the Highway, and in the afternoon I went out with her again, pawning for her. After I came home, she called me down; she said, my key opens Mrs. Collins's door. Collins and I fell out, she owed me two shillings, and I out of spite said, if any body has robbed you, it is Mrs. Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix.) Did you go out with her in the afternoon - A. I did; I did not give her the gown and shift to pawn.</p>

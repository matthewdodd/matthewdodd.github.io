                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of George Warner and others, in Rood-lane. The prisoner was our porter at two periods; for the first rather more than twelve months, for the latter about two years—about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th of November, my attention was drawn to a small packet of tea in the upper part of the warehouse—it was about half a pound, neatly done up, first in tea paper, and blue paper outside—I set somebody to watch it, and I watched the prisoner the rest of the day—I received information from a fellow-servant of his, who is not here, and when he returned to work, at seven o'clock, I gave him into custody—a small quantity of black tea was found on him in an old brown paper bag—there were several casks of tea open in the warehouse—I compared that found on him with that in the casks, and, in my opinion, it was the same tea—next morning I still found the blue parcel undisturbed where it was before—I opened it—it contained entirely different tea to that found on the prisoner, but it was similar to tea we have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. On the evening of the 27th of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I went, by Mr. Richards's directions, to a room in the upper floor of the tea-warehouse, where the parcel was deposited, and concealed myself behind some chests and a door—the prisoner came up alone while I was there—he passed by where I was, into a room beyond—he then came back, and stood a short time where the parcel was, and then left the pre<lb></lb>mises without taking it away—I do not think his business could call him up there—he occasionally came up to shut up the loop-holes, but that evening they had been shut before he came up—there were empty casks and loose papers kept there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were the loop-holes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the floor where I was concealed—all the men put their coats into a cellar under the warehouse, and there they remain while they are at work—any body can get at them—I think there are eight men at work—the prisoner generally had his dinner on the premises.</p>

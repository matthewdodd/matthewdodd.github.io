                  </hi> I am a chair-maker, at 36, St. George's-road, New Kent-road—my father has a house, No. 13, Rockingham-row East, which is unoccupied. On the morning of 26th Feb., from information I receive, I went there, and noticed the lead of the water-pipe, which supplied the wash-house from the water-butt, and the brass tap, gone—I had seen them safe the evening but one before, and locked up the premises—I have since seen them at the station-house—the ball that was left behind fitted to the tap that was found on the premises—I had nailed up the washhouse door, but found it open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman M</hi> 249.) On the evening of 25th feb. I was on duty near ST. George's Church, in the Borough, and saw the prisoner and Davis on a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-rank together—I followed then through Mint-street into Union-street, and saw them both speak to a man at the door of a marine-store shop—I then followed them to 13, Rockingham-row, and there saw them walking backwards and forwards, in front of this washhouse door—I then lost sight of Davis, and kept watching People about a quarter of an hour—I then lost sight of him—I suspected they were gone, and ran towards the marine<lb></lb>store shop—on the way I overtook People, carrying a quantity of lead-pipe in a coat, which I believe Davis had on when I followed him—I asked what he had—he said, some lead he had brought from home—I asked how it came there—he said a man had brought it there in the morning I went, he did not know who—I took him to the station—in the morning I went to the empty house, found the door forced open, and a copper hall lying on a chair, which I fitted to the lead I found on People, and it corresponded exactly—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> What he states is all true, except about going to the marine-store shop; I went for a walk Davis, and he spoke to a person at a door; I do not know whether it was a marine-store shop or not; we found it was late, turned back, and down the London-road; I asked Davis to lead me his coat; he did so; we walked together as far as ST. George's church; I had half a pint of beer, and as I came out a man came up, and said, "Halloa! I have seen you before in the Borough;" I said, "Very likely;" he said, "Will you carry this?" I said, "Where?" he said, "As far as Guildford-street, I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" I put it into the coal, and as I was going along the policeman stopped me.</p>

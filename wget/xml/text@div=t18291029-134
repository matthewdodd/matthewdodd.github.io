            . I am an officer of Leadenhall-market. I have known the prisoner some time - I apprehended him on the Friday after this robbery, which was on the 9th of October; on searching him, I found a pocketbook, a watch, a rule, a snuff-box, and 15s. 6d. in silver; after searching him, having heard of this robbery, I made a search at Mr. Brown's, his master's, and found a great coat, a pair of boots, a hat in a box, containing several books, which I produce; he was Brown's apprentice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do these goods refer to this indictment? A. Yes.</p>

I left home some days previous to the 7th of October - I received a letter on the 9th, informing me I was robbed; I came to town on Monday morning, the 10th or 11th, and missed the property stated in the indictment; I observed that the wood work of one of the locks leading to the shop had been cut away, but not sufficiently to remove the iron work - a window leading to the shop had the wood work removed; I have not a doubt the party had got out of the house by breaking the window open - he had not got in that way; there was no external mark of violence at all: I missed property, including the bills of exchange, to the value of 100l. - I knew the prisoner by sight - he had been on my premises; he was apprenticed to Mr. Brown, a neighbour, who lived about thirty yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290048"></xptr>from me, in Half Moon-passage; among other things, I missed this rule - I had left it on the premises, and this pocket-book I can swear to, and this pencil-case - they were in the parlour; I am positive they were safe when I left town - the property was produced by the officer when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How soon after the robbery did you see the house? A. On the Monday morning, four or five days after - how it was entered I cannot tell; the bills of exchange were not due at the time - they are worth 100l. - I lost three, but the other was over due, and 12l. had been paid on it - the other two were for 50l. each; the amount of the other property taken out was 15l. or 20l; I believe it is all here - I have no partner.</p>

I saw the prisoner in my shop on the 13th of March: I was serving a customer at the opposite counter, and I heard McNab say to her, "What have you done with that roll in your hand" - she said, "I had none"- he said "You had," and he came round the counter - she came back from the counter, and I heard this roll of ribbon drop; I took it up; it is mine - she was about two feet from the counter, and I think it impossible that it could fall from the counter.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Reid - the prisoner came in, and asked for some ribbon; I showed her a drawer of ribbons, but there were none to please her - I showed her a second, and she took up a roll of ribbon in her hand - at that instant another customer came into the shop, to whom I spoke without turning aside, and while I did that, I saw the prisoner roll the ribbon up in her handkerchief - she laid down a child on the counter while she did it, and then took it up, and held the ribbon in her hand under the child's clothes - I showed her some other ribbons, and then I charged her with having that - she denied it - I went round the counter - she went back, and I heard the ribbon fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she express any surprise, as if the ribbon fell from the child? A. Yes, and she appealed to two people in the shop, if they had seen it in her hand; they said they saw it fall, but had not seen it in her hand.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring that she had not touched the ribbon, but that her child must have thrown it on the ground.</p>

               <p>Rev. Dr. ROBERT HAMILTON sworn. - On Wednesday the 10th of March, about three o'clock, I was to the north of the <placeName id="t18010520-2-crimeloc7">Serpentine-river, in Kensington-gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure? - A. I am sorry to say I am certain; he then threatened my life, and demanded my money; he had a heavy stick in his hand, it had been torn off a tree, with the bark peeled off; I then gave him my money, to the amount of about 28 or 29s. in a guinea and silver; there was no person in sight, nor within a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a dull or a bright day? - A. A gloomy day; he then demanded my watch, which, after some pause and remonstrance, I gave him; he then ordered me to return the way I came; he said, if I turned round to look back, he should follow me, and would kill me; I then returned the same way without looking back; I immediately went to Mr. Forsyth, his Majesty's head gardener, with whom I am acquainted, and told him of it; he went with me to Bow-street, and gave information; I saw no more of the prisoner till the Monday following; he was apprehended nearly upon the same spot; I saw him in the guard house at Kensington, near the barracks, I am certain he is the same person; I knew him again immediately, I was looking at him for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I see, by your wearing spectacles, you are near-sighted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your spectacles on at this time? - A. Yes; I always wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see distinctly with them? - A. Yes. WILLIAM ANTHONY sworn. - I am one of the officers of Bow-street: On Tuesday, the 10th of March, Dr. Hamilton lodged an information at our office; I made enquiry, but could not get any information of the prisoner till the Monday following; I went to Kensington, and found the prisoner in the guard-room as a deserter, in the custody of the serjeant of the guard; I apprehended him, and told him what for; he positively denied that he had committed the robbery; I took him to Bow-street, and Dr. Hamilton came and immediately pointed him out, and swore that he was the man; the prisoner said he had been at work by Bayswater at a cow-keeper's, and he could bring several people to prove where he was on that day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did Dr. Hamilton immediately recognize the prisoner at the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hamilton. I had previously seen him in the guard-room, and then I went to Bow-street for the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WISE sworn. - I was in Kensington-gardens at the time of the robbery, I do not recollect what day it was:

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Dr. Hamilton that day in the gardens? - A. No; two gentlemen asked me if I had seen a soldier with a red jacket and blue collar; and afterwards, I said to him, how those two gentlemen looked at you; he said, if they had said any thing to him; he would have knocked them down with a stick; it was an elm stick, and was not quite dead; he fenced the stick about my head, and said it would fetch any body a good knock; he said, they would not tell of it in a hurry, and then he walked away.</p>

On the 16th of May the prisoner was brought into the shop, charged with taking this cotton, which I had seen on a pile, about a foot within the door; he must have put his foot into the shop to take it.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY DARLEY. I am a ship-joiner. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prisoner take this printed cotton from Mr. Bailey's shop, and walk off with it; I was going the same way as him, and when he turned down Newgate-street, I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him he had better take it back; he was very unwilling, and threatened to strike me with his fist, but did not - several people came up, and I gave him in charge; I went back with him - he had the cotton under his coat; he said I had nothing to do with it - he is a soldier.</p>

               <p>JOHN CHURCHILL. I am a constable. I saw some persons collected, and took the prisoner - he was charged with taking this print; he said he was not going to give it to the witness.</p>

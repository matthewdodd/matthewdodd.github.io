In consequence of something that he told me, and some direction which he gave me, I ordered both the prisoners up stairs, and asked each of them if they knew anything of a tea caddy which was missing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060023"></xptr>and they both denied any knowledge of it. I then desired them both to come up into their bed rooms, and also the footman, in order that he might be a witness to all that passed. The prisoner Gummer was the first person I desired to let me see her clothes, that was to open her box; she did so, and to my great supprise, it was nearly empty; I found nothing in it, which I claimed. I enquired where her clothes were, and she informed me in the drawer; by my orders, she turned the contents of the drawers out. I found a plain muslin cap belonging to my mother; that is not in the indictment. I found no other property of mine in these drawers. Then I told West to open her trunk. She unlocked it, and the first thing that presented itself, belonged to one of my children; several other things I saw in her trunk, peices of muslin; but I did not count the number. Then she put her hand into the centre of the box, and took out the tea caddy, for which I had been enquiring; it was a tortoise shell caddy, and I had had it about a year; I don't really suppose it is worth more than twenty shillings. She said, there is your caddy ma'am, and I have no more of your property in my possession. She was then going to close her trunk, when I desired a further search. I found various articles which are mentioned in the indictment, and which will be produced. The twelve yards of lace, valued at twelve pounds, was not found. There was a great quantity of baby linen, and various small articles. I did not send for a constable until after some conversation had taken place. Whether these things were taken all at one time, or at various periods, I cannot tell.</p>

I was employed in removing part of the things from the house at Parson's Green, to Walham Green. When my mistress came on the 10th, she made some enquiry respecting a hat, which I had had to brush. When I looked for it, I found it was missing, from a shelf in the pantry where I had put it. I told my mistress I could not find it, and she ordered the two prisoners up stairs. I have heard the account my mistress has given of what took place then, and it is perfectly right.</p>

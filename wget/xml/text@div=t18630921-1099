                  <hi rend="italic">This indictment, laying the money in the Royal Liver Friendly Society, the Recorder required proof that the Society was entitled to be so described. Mr. Abel put in the Rules of the Society, certified under 18 and 19 Vic. c. 63, sec. 19, but they only provided that the property should be laid in the Trustees. Mr. Abel then applied that the indictment might be amended in conformity with Lord Campbell's Act. The Recorder entertained considerable doubt whether the Court had the power to amend in this case: Lord Campbell's Act enabled the description of a body corporate to be altered, or the names of any persons to be corrected, but did not provide for the substitution of persons for a body corporate. The Jury were therefore directed to find the prisoner.</hi>

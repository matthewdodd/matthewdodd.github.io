On Monday last, the 9th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was going down Whitechapel, and met the prisoner Peachey - I asked her the way to Houndsditch; I was as sober and sensible as I am now - she said, "You are not in Houndsditch, but in Whitechapel." She persuaded me to go along with her, and I went to a house in <placeName id="t18260112-166-crimeloc933">Wentworth-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18260112-166-crimeloc933" type="placeName" value="Wentworth-street"></interp>

Peachey then asked me if I would go with her - I told her no - she then called in Chester, and asked if I would go with her, which I refused. Chester then went to the door, and Peachey blew the candle out; she caught me in her arms, and pulled me over towards the bed; I resisted, and she jumped away from me in a moment; I turned round, and my two parcels were gone- one containing six yards of silk, and the other six table-covers; I called out Murder! I came down the court, and there were some persons in the street, who seemed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120061"></xptr>laugh and make fun. The parcels were on the floor when Chester left the room, and when Peachey left they were gone. I went next day to a public-house next door to where this happened, and said I would give 2l. 10s. if any body would fetch me my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you quite sure you are sober now? A. Yes - I have had three drams this morning. I was sober when I went to the house, but the girl over-persuaded me. I might be in the room ten minutes. I am married. I did not see Peachey again till after she was in custody.</p>

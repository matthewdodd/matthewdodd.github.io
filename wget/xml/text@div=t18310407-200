               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I am a Police-constable. On the 21st of October, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another lad near the prosecutor's window, in <placeName id="t18310407-200-crimeloc1079">Bethnal-green-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310407-200-crimeloc1079" type="placeName" value="Bethnal-green-road"></interp>

               <p>JAMES HODGES. I <rs id="t18310407-200-viclabel1080" type="occupation">keep an earthenware-shop</rs>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the road - I heard the Policeman cry Stop thief! I turned, and he took me to the shop; the people said they had lost two hats, but they did not say I took them from there - he then took me to the watch-house, and as we were going he asked if I had any money; he said if I would give him a few shillings I should not be hurt, he would make it all right.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I never lost sight of him; I saw him drop the hats close to his heels - I stopped to pick them up, and he gained ground on me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

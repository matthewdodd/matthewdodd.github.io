                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and life in Dunning's-alley. On the 10th of Nov., in consequence of information I went with a person named Levy to his father's house in Dunning's-place, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I went on the stairs—there is no landing—the door opens into the room—I saw the panel had been forced in—I looked through, and saw the prisoners handling Mr. Levy's property—soon after they blew out the light, and jumped out of the window—I went to the door, and saw one of them go into No. 2, in the court, and the other into No. 3—the entry was made by taking out the panel—I saw the prisoners distinctly—the candlesticks were placed on the ground with Mr. Levy's coat snuffers and tray, ready to be taken away—I waited for their coming out of the house, and then took hold of them both till the police arrived—I afterwards went into the premises where Price ran in—I there saw two pencil cases, a chain, and breast pin picked up (those premises belong to Mr. Goosey, of No. 8, Brown's-lane) they were claimed by Levy.</p>

I am a fishmonger, living at Yarmouth—on 20th March, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day-time, I was on Tower-hill—I walked up to some men, who were playing at pitch-and-toss, and the prisoner drew my watch out of my pocket—I felt a <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi>, and I cast my eyes down, and saw the watch in his hand—he gave another chuck, broke the ring, and passed it as far as his pocket—he was close by me at the time—I collared him there and then, and held him till a policeman came up—I did not get my watch—it was a German silver one, but a very good one; I gave 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it about seven years back—I saw him pass the watch towards his pocket, and then two or three of the others ran away—I held him.</p>

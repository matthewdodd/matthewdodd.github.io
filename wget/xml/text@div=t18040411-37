A night-cap, a pair of cotton mitts, one silk sash, two cards of black trimming, two cards of white, sixteen pair of garters, cotton and worsted, fourteen dozen of cotton laces, and three pair of cotton gloves, these were in her room; I met her coming out of the house; she said she was going to buy a penny candle; I went into the butcher's shop and borrowed a candle, and when we came up stairs there was a candle burning in the room at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Can Mr. Dawson speak to the purse? - (Mr. Dawson looks at them.) A. I believe them to be of my manufactory, and as to the garters and laces I know them by passing through my hands at several times, and these articles, and what was delivered up by the prisoner in the parlour, I believe to be of my manufactory.</p>

            , was sent into a damaged ware-room, to clean it, he, Mackworth, came up, and gave me two dozen of purses and one dozen of stay-laces, which he told me to take to one Mr. Marley; in Long-Lane, West-Smithfield; it being tea time, he ordered me to go home and take the articles with me; however, I had not proceeded for, when I was informed my master wanted me; I was taken into the parlour; nobody was there but two clerks, excepting Mr. Dawson, and he told me I had robbed him; I said I had not robbed him; I know not what further I said to them; I have always been a faithful servant to my master, but for my character in general I refer you to my master; we, therefore, implore this most Honourable Court for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mackworth.) Had you delivered them to him to carry any where? - A. I never delivered to him on that day any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dawson.) I suppose, by your continuing him in your employment, he behaved very well? - A. I knew nothing of him before, he came only from a neighbour's; where he lived I heard a good account of him.</p>

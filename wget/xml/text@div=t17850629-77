               <p>About half after ten the prisoner took a one pair of stairs lodging of mine, ready furnished, he came the night he took it, I never saw any more of him after the second night for ten weeks, he gave me no notice of quitting, after he went away I missed the things in the indictment; I had seen them there, the things were never found again, I never saw them since.</p>
               <p>Did he leave his lodgings locked or open? - Locked, and he took the key away with him; as I was at work I saw him about ten weeks after in the street, and I immediately went to him and seized him in the street.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said he was not the person, but I am quite positive; I saw him both nights, he came and stood the side of me when I was at work some few minutes; I did not see him by day light before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Councel. How have you described this person and his dress before the Magistrate? - I can tell you the particulars; the first night when he came into the house a fire was lighted for him, he went up in his room, the door I locked myself the last thing in the morning, when I got up to go to market, I found the door open , I saw no more of him till the next night , when I was at work he came in and asked for a candle, and went to bed; the next night when he came, I did not say anything to him; I have other lodgers.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed when you apprehended him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it the same dress in which he first came to you? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Have not you said that he has appeared before the Magistrates in different dresses at different times ? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said that he frequently wore boots? - No.</p>
               <p>Several people I believe attended this gentleman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that he had been a man of great estate in America, which he had lost by his attachment to his country? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Have you not said before the Magistrate that he wore boots and half-boots? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You never found any of your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - I did not know where.</p>
               <p>Did not you take the trouble to enquire where he lodged ? - I enquired into his character, and I found it a very good character, but I did not think it worth while to enquire after my property ten weeks after.</p>

               <p>Please your Lordship, I never knew the man before he took me, I never was out of my lodgings but one night since I took it, from the 10th of December, to the 15th of April, then the house was given up, and I moved with the people, I now live with them, I used to be with a gentleman that came passenger with me, one Major Ward; I am a gentleman that have a wife and family in America; I came here on my own matters; I was very angry with the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290104"></xptr> that took me , I had a stick in my hand, but I did not use it.</p>

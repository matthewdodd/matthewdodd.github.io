                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 2, Salisbury-street, Strand—in con<lb></lb>sequence of the Coroner's order, I went to 47, Bedfordbury, to see the child—it was dead, and exceedingly attenuated—I never saw a child in such a state before—it was so exceedingly worn that its legs were not thicker than my finger, and its whole weight would not exceed 3 1/2 lbs.; certainly not 4lbs.—there was no external mark of violence—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion, and found the organs perfectly healthy throughout—there was no fat whatever; not there slightest—there was no disease that could in any way account for its death—want of proper nourishment would account for what I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How soon after death did you see the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Less than twenty-four hours—I was informed that it died on the Tuesday evening, and I saw it on the early part of Wednesday afternoon—decomposi<lb></lb>tion had set in—I do not think it would have been in a better condition if I had examined it immediately after death—my first examination was only an external one—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination did not take place till about seventy-two hours after death—I do not think it would have offered any more satisfactory results if I had examined it immediately after death, because the decomposition was more on the exernal surface—there was scarcely any internal decomposition there was a little—I think want of nourishment might have caused it to be in that state, and I formed an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230042"></xptr>
               <p>opinion from what I saw and heard—a long course of want of attention to so young a child might have assisted very much towards the state I found it in—there was no disease whatever—when there is a tendency to atrophy in young children there is always a cause for it—I should say that atrophy does not exist without previous disease—I hare not seen it in young children—I do not know, from my reading, that in young children there is a tendency to waste away without any perceivable organic disease—if a mother's breast was diseased, and her milk bad, it might affect the child temporarily, because she finds it a painful operation to give the child nourishment with a diseased breast—if the quality of the milk is bad, that would affect a child—insufficiency in quantity, and badness in quality of the milk, would account for the appearances I saw—I had never seen the child before its death—Dr. Harvey was present with me at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I examined the lungs; they were perfectly healthy, and almost colourless, except the posterior portion, into which the blood had gravitated—there was bile in the gall bladder—the eyes presented a dull appearance, and were covered with a thickened mucus—they were partly closed—they were the natural colour—I do not think it is universally the case where persons have died of starvation, that the eyes are open and present a fiery-red appearance, as in a case of acute ophthalmia, and it is not the case—it is so in grown-up people, but this child was too young for this and in grown-up people it is only in some bad cases—I have seen very few persons, thank God, who have died of starvation, but I say so because the quantity of blood in the body is insufficient to produce the effect—I have never seen a child before that died of starvation—I have only read parts of Dr. Taylor's book—allow me to explain my views; the want of blood in this child was evident throughout the body: there was not a particle of blood in any of the vessels which I severed, not ten drops of blood escaped, and there was not blood enough in the body to produce those appearance—the same thing would not apply to an adult, unless it was a case of sudden loss of nourishment—in a short case it might be—in the case of a person who died from a starvation of twenty-three days, I think there would still be sufficient fluid to produce the effect, but if it was spread over many weeks I think it would be different.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 16, Tavistock-street, Covent-garden—I was requested to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of this child—I had seen it before several times—the mother had not brought it to me—I could find no disease—I feared mesenteric disease—that is an hereditary disease, or it may be brought on by bad living; either insufficient or Im<lb></lb>proper food—the proximate cause of the child's death was inanition, wasting—the organs were all perfectly healthy, which leads me to the conclusion that it died from want of sufficient nourishment—I form my judgment by comparing the symptoms after death with the appearances during life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>depend upon the condition of the child—I do not think it would be more so than in an adult, because in an older person you have more flesh and more than, and putrefaction is more rapid and where there is no flesh and nothing to decompose, decomposition does not set in so soon—I agree that food in<lb></lb>sufficient in quantity and bad in quality would account for the appearances I saw—I have a memorandum that the child was brought to me five times before its death—I saw it every time, and I believe it was brought to me on another occasion, but cannot say—whether that was by the mother I cannot say—I gave it tonics; iron was the last medicine it had—I was told that it was weak and sickly from its birth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab driver, of Pimlico-on 27th July in the evening, I was in Pont Street, following about 15 yards behind a van which the prisoner was driving, and going at the same pace as he was, which was about five or six miles an hour—I saw the' bar, and when he was 12 or 15 yards from it, I saw the prisoner's whip flourished, but on account of the boxes on the van, I could not see whether he hit the horse, but I saw the whip go down—the bar keeper ran out with the bar in his hand, and it was about three-parts closed at the time the prisoner reached it—the deceased raised one hand as he caught the bar with the other—I saw the deceased fall, and both the near-side wheels went over his head—I saw a boy sitting in the back of the van.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bar keeper ran out in a hurry to close the bar the action of holding up his hand was hardly distinguishable from that of pushing the bar—I have driven horses for five years, and I believe I am a judge of pace—It was impossible for him to pull up his horse and avoid the accident, considering the short notice he received from the bar keeper-the van was I should think 12 yards at the utmost from the open space when the barkeeper ran out—the man was hidden by the sentry-box, and I could not see him till he was in front of the bar—I cannot say whether the flourish of the whip was as he was trying to pull up, but, as a rule, they flourish the whip to stop anything—I took it as a signal that there was danger ahead the bringing the whip down would be done by bringing his hand on to the reins-as the van passed the bar the prisoner pulled on one side—I did not notice whether the horse went faster when the bar struck his chest-when the van had got some distance down Pont Street, I saw the boy speak to the driver, and as soon as the boy spoke to him he pulled up-a gentleman, whose name I do not know, was a dozen yards from the van, when it stopped but he did not stop it, and he and the prisoner came back together-the prisoner was' perfectly sober—In my judgment, as a driver, he used every</p>

               <p>precaution to avoid the accident—I have no doubt about it—I am a perfect stranger to him and to all the witnesses—I saw the policeman, and volunteered to give my evidence—I was at the inquest on one occasion, and was at the police-court—I told the policeman that I did not think the carman was to blame, and I should like to appear and tell the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reexamined.</hi> I cannot recollect saying before the Magistrate that when he was 50 yards from the gate he hit his horse; I may have—he held his whip up, I saw him hold his arm up, but cannot say whether he hit the horse; he did so first about 50 yards before he got to the gate, and then 15 yards—I cannot remember whether I said that the horse went faster after the prisoner struck it and I do not know whether it did—I have not mentioned to-day about his raising his whip 50 yards from the bar, because I was not asked the question-that was before any one appeared at the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Blackland Terrace, and am a greengrocer's assistant-on 27th July, about 7.15 or 7.20, I was standing outside Mr. Catchpole's shop in Pont Street, 30 or 35 yards from the bar, and saw a man coming in the direction of the bar at the rate of about 7 miles an hour—I could see the bar, and I saw the man attempt to close it, he had got it about three parts to, when the horse went against it and knocked the old man down and the wheel went over his head—I went to his assistance and went for a doctor, but. he was not at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The van was about 12 yards from the gate when the old man ran out—the prisoner pulled the reins as hard as he possibly could and pulled the horse on one side; he was pulling the reins when I saw him, and I thought the horse had bolted with him—I saw the bar knock the horse I saw no whip used—the prisoner said that he was very sorry.</p>

I live at 4, Pont Street, Chelsea—I had been speak<lb></lb>ing to the deceased about ten minutes before this and was standing about 15 yards from his bar at 7.15 or 7.20, looking towards the bar and saw him take the bar in his hand and go across the road—the van then dashed up and knocked the bar out of his hand, he fell under the wheels and they went over his head—I did not see him put up either hand.</p>

I was a gentleman's servant in July, and on the evening of the 27th, I—was in Pont Street, and saw a van driven by the prisoner—I was standing at a little grocer's shop, near the Bedford public-house, 30 or 40 yards from the bar—It was going at first, I should think at the rate of 6 or 7 miles an hour, and it afterwards went faster-when he first came out of Cadogan Place, 60 or 70 yards from the bar, I saw him flourish his whip in the air; I could not see that he used it, but the horse then went faster-when I first saw the bar keeper, the van was 40 or 50 yards from the bar—the bar keeper put his bar to within a yard, or half a yard, the horse came to the bar, the man was knocked down and the wheels went over him.</p>

Pickford, the large carmen are the prisoner's masters—I have not heard that an action is to be brought against them for negligence, by the deceased friends.</p>

I am a groom on the evening of 27th July, from 7.5 to 7.25, I was in Pont Street, about 30 yards from the bar, and saw a van with one horse-my attention was first attracted by the prisoner, who was the driver, whipping his house, and he passed me at a faster rate than he was going at when I first saw him—the bar keeper had left me about three minutes before and had been talking to Manning, and when I saw him again he was pushing the bar to—I did not see him knocked down, but I saw him down and saw the wheels go over him—the van stopped, I consider about 80 yards past the bar.</p>

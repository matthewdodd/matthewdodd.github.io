            . On the night of the 29th of January I was in Harrison-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from Compton-street, east; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and we ran to see what was the matter; we met a man running very hard - he seemed out of breath; he had a hat on his head but nothing in his hand - we followed and asked him if there was any thing the matter - he could not speak to us, and we ran after him into Gray's-inn-lane - we looked into some new buildings, and found the prisoner in an area - he had a hat on his head - this was about five minutes after I first saw him; we took him and delivered him to two officers, and the prosecutor came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the man pass you in a great hurry? A. Yes; he had a hat on his head - there was no other hat in the area - he appeared much agitated.</p>

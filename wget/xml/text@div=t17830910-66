               <p>I am an officer belonging to St. James's Clerkenwell, I know the prisoner, on the 2d of August, he brought a mare with this halter round her neck through St. John's-street turnpike, it was a little after four, the prisoner led the mare carelesly along the road, I suspected him when I saw him first of all going to take it to the collar-makers, or horse-flesh people; and followed him into Thames-street, and there about thirty-five minutes after four I attacked him in Thames-street with the mare; and he said he brought it from St. Alban's, I asked who she belonged to, and he could not answer; I asked him where he was to bring her to, he said to Thames-street, and to be there by seven o'clock, I asked him at what house in Thames-street, he could not tell; upon that I charged him on suspicion of stealing her; he rather hesitated, says I, I believe you have stolen her; he persisted that the man was to come at seven o'clock, I took him to Bridewell, and I left the mare just by Billingsgate in care of a person till ten o'clock, at ten I took the prisoner from Bridewell to be examined before Justice Blackborough, I called him into the lodge, and said, says I, young man you had better relate to me how you come by this mare, you certainly did not came by her honestly: In short he said, he did not come by her honestly, and he said, if he must tell the truth, she belonged to 'Squire Mason, at Elstree, Herts.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him to induce him to confess? - No.</p>

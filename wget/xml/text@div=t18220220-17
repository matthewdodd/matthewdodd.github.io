The prisoner was about ten days in my service, I had no character with her, but a recommendation from a Mrs. Harrington, who she had lodged with. On Sunday, the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving her in the house. I have three children, I took two out, leaving her with one - I returned about a quarter past five o'clock, she was not at home, I found the door a-jar. On my knocking, the pressure forced it open, I found the parlour door open also, and on examining it, found the bolt of the lock out, but it had passed beyond the staple. On going into the parlour, my wife went to a chest of drawers, which were not locked, and missed a small red box, in which I kept my cash. On the night before, I had put some cash in this box, there was some there before - there was six 10 l., Bank notes, upwards of forty sovereigns, between 2 l. and 3 l. in silver, also a black leather pocket-book, a gold pencil case, a silver eye-glass, and a variety of papers, of consequence to me. Within five minutes afterwards, the prisoner came to the street door with a key which she had, and with my child in her arms. I immediately told her to walk in the parlour, and told her that my red box had been stolen out of the drawers, during my absence, and I strongly suspected she must know something about it. She fell down on her knees, and protested her innocence, saying, it was impossible she could have behaved so unkindly to such a master and mistress. I told her that was not at all satisfactory to me, and that I should use every means in my power to find it out. I went out to get an officer, but could not - I desired her to go to bed, and sat up all night, to prevent her having any communication with any one out of the house - I said she had better tell the truth. Next morning, I fetched Clemence, the officer, and gave her in charge. I got a search warrant, and searched the apartments of Harrington and Fowler, and found two letters in a box there, which led me among her connexions at Woolwich - she never told me where to find the box. On Thursday, the 10th, I went to Woolwich, to Bowles, he was not at home, I saw his wife, and the prisoner's sister, Mary Bettelly, I enquired about the box and the contents; they said they knew nothing of it. Mr. Bowles brought me the box on Wednesday, the 16th; it contained 87 l. 16 s. 6 d. then, also a pair of scissars, two silver thimbles, which I could not swear to, but I sell such things - I know the scissars to be mine, and know the box perfectly. On Thursday, the 17th, I attended at Marlborough-street, asked to see the prisoner, and asked her if she knew any thing at all of the robbery, she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I do not." I then took the box from my pocket, and shewed it her, I said,</p>
               <p>"Of course, if you do not know any thing of the robbery, you know nothing of this box, or how I came by it;" she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I do know of it, I did take it from the drawer, packed it up in a cloth, took it to the coach-office, at Charing-cross, got a direction wrote for it by the bookkeeper, and sent it down to my sister, at Woolwich, to be left at Mrs. Lee's. St. Mary-street." I asked where the remainder of the property was, which was in the box, she said, she had thrown the pocket-book, the gold pencil-case, the silver eye-glass, and all the papers down the privy. I got a man to search the privy, and saw him find the pocket-book and the eye-glass there, about a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The drawer was not locked - A. No; she might suspect I kept my money there, I had locked it in my bed-room on Saturday night, and my wife brought it down in the morning.</p>

On the 15th of January, she told me there was a box, which came to Mrs. Lee's, directed for her, and that Mrs. Lee had got it. I went to Mrs. Lee, and Mr. Lee brought it to my house in the afternoon and delivered it into Mary's hands. I took it from her and opened it, there was a key tied to the handle, which was broken, and would not open it; I forced it open, and found the money in it - I took it the next morning to Atwell. She was gay and unsteady, but I never heard any complaint of her dishonesty.</p>

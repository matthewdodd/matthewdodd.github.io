               <p>Q. Had you collared him, or laid hold of his person, to take him as a prisoner - A. No; my hand might have touched his clothes, as my left arm was up; I am not sure whether my hand did touch his clothes or not.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he - A. In Mr. Gole's premises, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut any gate upon him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he come in when this took place - A. About twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not collared him, or gave him the idea that you were going to stop him - A. I had not collared him nor stopped him when he ran the knife into my left arm. - I cannot say how deep the wound was; there was a great deal of blood came from the wound. After he had stabbed me in the arm he attempted to run out of the yard, I ran after him to prevent him from making his escape, as he got to the gate I got hold of him he stabbed me in the thick part of the thigh with a knife. It was a small wound, but I had a great deal of pain with it; it is not perfectly well now. It was a very small pointed knife.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you once seen the knife - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Both cuts were done with a knife - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gole. When he was apprehended was the knife taken from him - A. Yes, by me; this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Clare. That appears to be the same knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he after having stabbed you in the thigh this way get away from you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the knife in his hand when you first saw him - A. I did not see him take it out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you put out your hand to him for - A. To stop him to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had spoke to him before - A. He stabbed me at that very instant in the arm, when I asked him what he left the boat for. I did not see the knife until after he had stabbed me in the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no time to open it, had he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There he must have it in his hand at the time what could be your reason for putting out your hand to stop him - A. To speak to him; he was walking on fast to the barrack-yard when I put out my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean to do with him when you stopped him - A. Nothing at that time; Mr. Gole was not at home, I wanted to ask him the reason why he ran away from the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the house door at this time - A. Four or five yards; he was going towards the house; I did not lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other Lascars in the house at the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you want to stop him to prevent the others from taking part with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under any apprehension that he might induce them to leave the house in a holly, or take part with him - A. No. I am certain I did not lay hold of his person before I received this wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman wanted to send me to the ship, I told him I did not belong to the Company at the time that he laid hold of my clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clare. Had you struck him, or had you any quarrel with him going down to the ship - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man permitted to go out of the house to take exercise - A. Yes, without any body in the care of him, and they are expected to return at a particular hour. This man was under no restraint in Mr. Gole's house. I and another man took nine or ten men from Mr. Gole's house to the boat they walked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man leave the Company when they got to the boat - A. No,</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got to Mr. Gole's house before you perceived it - A. No. I got into the house first, I did not see him in my way to Mr. Gole's house.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way from Mr. Gole's house to the ship did you or any other man make use of any threats to force him on board - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man with this man, they took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Clare. There was another man with me, an acquaintance of mine who came to see me, he did not attempt to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other man pinioned me back by holding me.</p>

I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290054"></xptr>prisoner stab him in the arm, then he went directly towards the gate from whence he came. He was going into the barracks when Clare spoke to him, I and Clare followed him, and laid hold of him at the gate, and then he stabbed him in the thigh; then he came towards me to stab me, I hit him on the side of his head with my stick, then I got outside of the gate to stop him, and he made a strike at me; I struck him and he fell; that blow could not hurt him, and I got no mischief.</p>
               <p>COURT. He stabbed at you did he - A. Yes, and after he got up again he held up the knife.</p>

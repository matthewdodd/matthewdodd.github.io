                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Annett, a baker, in Hops-street, Spitalfields. On Sunday, the 21st of April, about half-past five O'clock in the evening, I went out to see a funeral, and being wet, I get my mistress's umbrella—as I came back, across Black Eagle-street, I say about a dozen and a half of boys playing at ball—one of them said to the Prisoner. "There is B for baker, with his umbrella"—they all came up to me—the Prisoner sparred up to me and hit me in the face—I had know him before—the Blow knocked me down—I had the umbrella in my hand</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183705080097"></xptr>
               <p>and when I jumped up I hit him with it over his back—he forced it from me, and ran away with it, in the presence of all the boys—I ran after him but he got away, and I have not seen the umbrella since—he was fake up on the 27th, at a beer-shop in Fashion-street—I did not break the um<lb></lb>brella in striking him—I did not hit him so hard as to break it.</p>

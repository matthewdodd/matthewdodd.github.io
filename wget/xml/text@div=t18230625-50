            . I am a constable. I was in the Old Change on the day the children went to St. Paul's, and saw the prisoner with six or eight others, whom I suspected, and saw them attempt person's pockets - I kept my eye on them, and knocked down one of them. Mr. Barber just passed at the time, and I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from his pocket - I seized him, and immediately saw him drop it; he said he would not go with me. I took him to the Compter, and afterwards took him to a public-house for refreshment - he was handcuffed to another prisoner, who had some friends with him, and I took the handcuffs off - the prisoner immediately said "Now I should like to floor you," and immediately struck at me. I had great difficulty to secure him, and as I brought him to Newgate he threatened to stick a knife into me. I found another handkerchief on him, marked T. W., and a card of buttons.</p>

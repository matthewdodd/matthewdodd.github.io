                  </hi>. I live at Boxmoor—I sometimes live in Greenland place, Camden Town—I am a fireman on the railway. I met the prisoner, by the Black Cap, on the 17th of September, and went with her to the back part of Bayham-street, a little after twelve o'clock—I was guilty of some imprudence, and gave her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she ran away—I went back into Bayham street, and found her with the policeman—I missed two half-crowns, eleven shillings, and two sixpences—my trowsers pocket was turned inside out which could not have happened by accident.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of September, I saw the prisoner run away from a field into Bayham-stree—I stopped her, and asked her what she had in her hand—she said two shillings—I asked her to open her hand, which she did, and there were two half crowns, eleven shillings, and two sixpences in it—the prosecutor came up, and I asked him if he had been with her—he said he had, and had given her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked how much he had in his pocket—he said 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not told him what I had found—I took her to the station-house, searched her, and found one shilling tied in the comer of her shawl—I returned to the spot where they had been, and found a sixpence loose on the ground.</p>

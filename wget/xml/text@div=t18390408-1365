                  </hi>. I know William Miller very well—on the 1st of April I saw him at a beer-shop at Uxbridge, about eight o'clock in the evening—he was rather <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—he put three shillings on the table, and one rolled off—the prisoner, who was there, picked it off the floor, took the other two off the table, and put them into his pocket—he then sat down by Miller—I was opposite them—about ten minutes afterwards Miller was asleep, and I saw the prisoner put his hand into his trowsers' pocket, and draw out a canvas purse—he put his hand into the purse—I could see two shillings in the purse, but whether there was more I cannot say—he put the money into his waistcoat pocket, and took the bag also—Miller after-wards awoke, and went out of the room—the prisoner followed him, and I saw the bag in his hand when he went out of the room—this is the purse he took—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief constable of Uxbridge. William Miller attended before the Magistrate, but is now out of the way—the pri<lb></lb>soner works in a brick field—I took him into custody from a representation made by Miller—I found him at the beer-shop where this robbery had taken place the preceding evening—the purse was found on his brother—I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about this—he said, "No"—I showed the bag to Miller in his presence, and he claimed it—the prisoner denied all knowledge of the transaction, and said he had never had it, and had never taken the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did take it out of his pocket, as I had been drinking with him all day—it was my brother took it from him afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant of the Metropolitan Police. On the 29th of January I went to No. 6, Mill-lane, Deptford, the prisoner's house, with Sergeant Freeman, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—the outer door was bolted—I knocked at the door, and the prisoner unbolted it—I found a candle burning in the room—I had passed the house before, and could not see a light, because a cupboard-door opened against the window, and acted as a shutter, but the outside shutter was open—I had had the prisoner in custody about three weeks before—when he opened the door I said, "Well, Taylor," he said, "It is no use your coming here, for I have</p>

               <p>not got any of those things in my house"—I said, "Very well, I shall see whether you have or not"—we went into the room—the street-door opens into the room—there is no passage—I commenced searching under the stairs, and found nothing—Freeman called to me, and said the prisoner had thrown something into the fire—there was a very clear coke fire—I examined it, and raked the principal part of it out, but did not find any thing—I examined the back of the grate, and found the file which I was raking with came in contact with a piece of sacking, and I found a sack at the back of the fire concealed among some ashes—it was a very old-fash<lb></lb>ioned grate, and there was about three bushels of ashes at the back—I found wrapped in the sacking a pipkin with metal in it, thirteen counterfeit shillings, and three moulds—the prisoner knocked at the wall, and called a person on the other side, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi>, (I understood him <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> Redding) here is b—Roscoe here, and he has found two pairs of moulds"—I did not know they were moulds at the time, never having seen any such things before—I gave all the things found to Freeman, and continued searching—I found nothing more at that time—I took the prisoner to the station, searched him, and found three counterfeit shillings, two in one shoe, and one in the other—I had left the house fastened, and a person next door took charge of the key—I searched the house directly afterwards, bout midnight, and saw a broken tobacco-pipe on the hearth—it had not been used for smoking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the R Division of Police. I accompanied Roscoe to the prisoner's residence—the door was shut when we arrived—Roscoe knocked, and it was opened by the prisoner—it did not appear to be fastened more than the ordinary lock—on opening the door we entered, and Roscoe said. "Well, Taylor, what are you about?"—Taylor replied that he was asleep—he said, "You will find no<lb></lb>thing here, I have got none by me, and don't mean to have any more"—Roscoe commenced searching under the stairs, and I noticed the prisoner apparently throw something into the fire—I said to Roscoe, "He is throwing something into the fire"—Roscoe immediately left he place he was searching, and began raking the fire out with an old file—there was nothing found in the fire—it was bright—he then raked behind the fire, where there was a quantity of cinders and rubbish on a ledge, and turned up a small bundle wrapped in dirty rags—I produce the contents of it, which are, a pipkin, containing some white metal, with a counterfeit shilling in the metal, as if it had been thrown in when the metal was soft—it is fixed; and in the pipkin there were also thirteen counterfeit shillings, and three plaster moulds—on these being found, the prisoner knocked at the next house, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Johnny,</hi> come in, the police are here, and have found two pairs of moulds"—he said, "The officers are here, and have found two pairs of moulds, but, so help me God, I know nothing about them; God strike me dead if I do"—I am not aware that he men<lb></lb>tioned the name of either of the officers in calling to the person—I knew him before—I partly searched him—his pockets were turned out—I found nothing—he had his shoes off then—I remained in the room till he was taken away—he put on his shoes when he left—I was present when he was searched at the sfation, and saw three counterfeit shillings found in his shoes.</p>

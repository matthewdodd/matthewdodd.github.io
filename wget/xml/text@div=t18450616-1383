                  </hi>. I live at Uxbridge, and am owner of boats which go on the canal for coals. The prisoner was my boatman for seven or eight months—I paid him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—at the end of Feb. I sent him with two boats along the Grand Junction Canal to go to Rugby—the party shipping the coals pays me the freightage—it was the prisoners duty to receive that</p>

                  </hi>. I am an agent at the Staley iron-works. The prisoner came for coals on the 5th of March—he was loaded with upwards of sixty tons, making an allowance to the trade, and he left on the 6th—there was nearly 10 cwt. besides the 60 tons—it was my duty to pay for freightage and hauling—I advanced the prisoner 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him again on the 25th of March—the balance I owed him was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—before he came the second time I had heard of some deficiency—I asked him how he could account for 2 tons 7 hundred weight which appeared to be missing—he said he did not know, and after a time he produced a receipt from Mr. Proctor, of selling 25 cwt., for which Mr. Proctor paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there then remained a deficiency of one ton, after making every allowance—he did not give me any explanation of what had become of that—I de<lb></lb>ducted 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for that ton—I am quite sure I did not deduct 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but only 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as my cash-book will show.</p>

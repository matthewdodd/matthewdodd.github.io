             came into my service; on the 2d of August, my wife missed the muslin apron; in consequence of that she was searched; I had a strong suspicion of her, and I gave an officer charge of her, and in searching her he found the gloves and handkerchief in her pocket, a cambrick handkerchief and a pair of silk gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she was searched? - Yes. In her pocket was the duplicate of the apron that was in pledge. She cried and made a piece of work, but finding a great number of duplicates, and believing she had been and offender before, I was determined -</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the things? - The officer has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her? - Yes, by the mother; the mother took and shewed us the house; but I am sure it was a disgrace to the house to mention in this Court that such a girl should come out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever behave amiss? - She never behaved amiss, no more than pilfering every thing that she could lay her hands on.</p>

               <p>Q. You searched the girl? - Yes, on Monday, the 3d of August. Before I searched her Mrs. Chapman told me that she had missed a silk gown and muslin apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon her? -A pair of old silk gloves, and an old cambrick handkerchief, and the duplicate of a muslin apron that was pledged.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you produce? - A white apron, pawned by the prisoner on the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes, I am. She said it was her own property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear it is my wife's apron by some stains in it at the corner, by hanging it over the corner of the door. The black silk gloves I bought of Mr. Jones, on Holborn-hill, myself; the cambrick handkerchief I can positively swear being at my beside the night before it was missing; it happened to be put into a banbox along with some small linen, and the cat got in and tore the lace to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived <rs id="t17950916-28-deflabel151" type="occupation">servant</rs>

The things that were in my pocket I took them from the children that were playing in the yard, for fear that they should lose them. Gentlemen, I assure you I had no view in keeping them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. At the time that you searched this woman, did you tell her what you were going to do? - Yes. She refused to be searched, said, she knew nothing at all about any thing. There was a silk gown, and a great many other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160079"></xptr>things of her mistress's locked up in her box.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's father-in-law gave her a good character.</p>

Cooper and Co., that we had in our warehouse.</p>

Harrison was in my employment from 1851, as a kind of foreman porter in the fruit and refined floor—the sugar would be in his department—I had made a purchase of a large quantity of sugar of Bruschner and Co., previous to 5th May—the contract was in writing—this is the contract note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I purchased 883 tittlers—when we purchase we leave the tittlers in the refiner's hands until we want them—it would be Harrison's duty to write orders for them, as they were sold—he had nothing to do with the selling—I have the delivery order book here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these orders are printed with blanks, and with counterfoils—it would be his duty to write the order, filling in the blanks, and to fill in the counterfoil to correspond—this produced is one of the forms—there is no counterfoil corresponding with it—there is a counterfoil bearing the same number—this is in Harrison's writing—(<hi rend="italic">this, being read, was an order for raisins</hi>)—this does not refer to any transaction for sugar—there is nothing that corresponds with the tittlers in the counterfoil—I attend to the business myself—I had given no authority for any such order as this, the goods not being sold—if this had been a regular transaction it would have been Har<lb></lb>rison's duty to make an entry in his warehouse book previous to writing the order—I have the warehouse book here—I have searched it—I find no entry at all of the transaction to which this order refers—Roger Durant was in my service from Oct., 1854, till 2nd March, 1857—he would have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with our course of business—he gave notice to leave, and left on his own account—during the time he was in our service we had a customer of the name of Mitchell—Roger Durant introduced his name to our firm as a customer—his place of business was first in Noble Street, and then in Lillypot Lane—when Roger Durant was about to leave our service, I asked him who this Mitchell was; he said he</p>

On 22nd May I received this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was brought by Johnson's cart—I wrote something on it, and returned it to the person who brought it—he afterwards brought it back to me—Harrison accompanied him—I know Harrison's handwriting—I believe this is his signature on the order for the delivery of forty tittlers—I wrote on it, "Please say blue or white paper"—he said, "Always deliver goods in white paper, unless we say 'blue' on the order"—at that time we had a quantity of sugar tittlers, the property of Cooper and Co.—I delivered the forty tittlers in white paper—(<hi rend="italic">The order for forty tittlers, marked "R. A. T" and signed "C. Harrison"</hi>)—the mark "R. A. T." was on the white paper, and on the bottom of the sugar loaves</p>

               <p>themselves was "85," with a stroke under it—we prepare a weight note on these occasions, after weighing—we gave Mr. Cooper's weight note to Harrison, and the carman's weight note was put into the scale—the note that I gave Harrison, was for forty tittlers, marked "R. A. T." and "85"—I have since been to Chamberlain's Wharf, and seen about thirty tittlers there, which I believe to be part of what I delivered on that day—I found the marks "R. A. T." on them—I examined the bottoms of them; there were no marks at all there—they had the appearance of having been scraped or rubbed—there was then blue paper over the white—on 19th May I delivered two lots of fifty tittlers from Mr. Cooper's stock, and sent them to Mr. Cooper's—this note of those two parcels is in my handwriting—there has been a "40" added to it—that is not in my handwriting, nor written by my authority—I know nothing at all about it—I do not know whose handwriting it is.</p>

I am in the employ of the two Durants, in Lillypot Lane—I know Harrison; I have seen him there—I went into the service in Nov. last—they carried on the business of wholesale grocers—I was there on 22nd May when forty tittlers of sugar were brought by Johnson's cart—I assisted in unloading them—they were placed in the warehouse—Ryder Durant was there at the time—I did not notice whether any invoice came with them—they were in white paper—part of them were afterwards removed to Chamberlain's Wharf—I cannot say the exact number—they were placed with some other tittlers that were in the warehouse—I think thirty-five of them went to Chamberlain's Wharf—I believe I was there when twenty came on 6th May—I cannot say whether any of those went with the thirty-five—I directed the carman where to take them—Ryder Durant had desired me to do so—I do not know where Roger Durant was at this time—I went with them to Chamberlain's Wharf—two packed bags were also taken, containing sundry articles of grocery—they were directed to R. Attwell, No. 95, Lower Union Street, Torquay; 25: 5: 57 (<hi rend="italic">looking at a card</hi>)—this is Roger Durant's writing—I did not see him write it—I put it on the bag; it lay on the counter—I cannot say who put it there—Roger Durant was there that day, and he was there when I went away with the things—both of them were—the sugars were directed "R. A.," with a "T." under it—one of them was directed the same as the card—I was directed to put the card on the bag by one of the Durants; I cannot say which, they were both there—I believe they were partners in this concern—I attended the first examination at Guildhall on 10th June—Ryder Durant said something to me after that about the partnership—he said he was going to be a working partner—he was saying so to some friends there, he was not addressing me particularly—I heard it—what he said was, that he was going to be a working partner with his brother—that was before I had been examined, I believe; I cannot recollect—I remember asking for an alteration to be made in my evidence after that had been said to me, so it must have been after I was examined—it was in consequence of that being said that I requested to alter my evidence—I took a receiving note with me to Chamberlain's Wharf—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—one of the Durants gave it me, I cannot say which—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill headed, "Debtor to W.

Cooper's—we visited each other—he introduced me to Ryder Durant, and I also became intimate with him—Mr. Mitchell is the father of Ryder Durant's wife—he is a ship owner—Ryder Durant told me he had his father's permission to carry on the business in his name—he made no concealment of the grounds on which he used the name of Mitchell—I was aware of it about last Aug. or Sept—when Roger Durant left Mr. Cooper's, I think he went out of town for three or four weeks, and when he came back the name of Mitchell was removed, and that of Durant put up.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

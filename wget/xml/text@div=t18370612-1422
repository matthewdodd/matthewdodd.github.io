About seven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of May I saw the prisoner in the shop, about a quarter of an hour after my husband left—nobody had been near the till after my husband left, nor shortly before—I saw the prisoner reaching over the counter with his hand in the till—I was in the parlor behind the shop—I went into the shop—when he saw me he shut the till, and asked me if I had got any men's belts to sell—I said yes, but he ran out of the shop immediately—White brought him back in about two minutes—I examined the till, and there was six shillings in it, but ✗ half-crowns.</p>

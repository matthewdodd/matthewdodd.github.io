               <p>I am constable and patrol, of Dowgate-ward; a partner goes with me; we go on at dusk, and stay till nine; at half past six on Monday night, the 17th of December, we passed Mr. Lomas's door; just as we got to the compting-house, which is the house-door, I saw the shutters move backwards, towards the street; I went forwards a step, and they opened a little wider; half open; I saw the prisoner at the bar, withinside the window of the compting-house; he seemed very much flurried, and in a fright, in a great hurry; he came over the window, which was about as high as I could reach; and I caught him in my arms, and I threw him down; he said, do not stop me! do not stop me! I have not done any harm, I belong to the house, I said, I will stop you to know; I knocked at the door, and found he did not; I took him into the compting-house; I told the prosecutor's son, and we found the upper sash was pulled down, and there were marks of a person's feet on the desk, and on the floor; fresh dirt; and there were papers on the compting-house desk, that had been trod on by dirty feet; in looking further, Mr. Lomas's son picked up a bag; this is the bag, and there was a nest of drawers, containing three drawers that were close to the desk; this drawer (produced) was the middle drawer, and was out of its place, and lay on the compting-house door by this bag; I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon him of any suspicion, but this; which is a thing, when you pull out the cork, it lights a match, and there are matches in it; it is in the same state, as when I pulled it out of his pocket; (a bottle of phosphorous produced) I asked the prisoner how he came there; he said, he had come from Bethnal-green, and that he called on his father in Wood-street; after that he took a walk from Wood-street for a little air down that way; and going past Mr. Lomas's house, a man pulled his hat off, and threw it into the compting-house, and he got up and leaned over to get his hat out; on his examination at Guildhall; he said, it was two coal-heavers that came by, and threw his hat in.

            . Was your father at home this evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was at home besides you and the servant-maid? - Mrs. Lomas, and a young man, and two children.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening is your compting-house window shut generally? - As soon as it is dark; it is my business to shut it up; I had been in the compting-house about twenty minutes or half as hour before this; I was there about six.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090074"></xptr>What situation was it in then? - The shutter was not put to, and the sash was up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. Which of the sashes was up? - The top sash was up, and the bottom sash is nailed down.</p>
               <p>Was the top sash up or down? - It was shot; I looked to see if the shutters were to; I did not shut these; I went up to tea; I intended to shut them when I came back.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you quite sure that the top was up? - I am quite sure the sash was up.</p>
               <p>Where did these drawers belong to? - To a nest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Did you know whether that was in its place when you looked in the compting-house before? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with any certainty? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice, whether it was or not? - I did not take any notice.</p>
               <p>How came you not to shut the shutter? - I was coming down again.</p>
               <p>Had you any light with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you could not see whether the drawer was in its place or not? - No.</p>
               <p>How could you see the window was up? - By the lamps in the street.</p>
               <p>Are you clear that you saw that it was up? - Yes; somebody rung at the bell, and I went down to them, and I staid at the compting-house door, talking to them on the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the compting-house at all? - I was at the door on the outside; the compting-house door was open.</p>
               <p>In the room, or in the passage? - In the passage.</p>
               <p>Then you was not in the room? - No. at the door.</p>
               <p>Is that door opposite the windows? - It is on one side; I could see the side that the windows were on; the windows are to the right hand, and the door was where I am.</p>
               <p>You was not within the door? - I was part in, not quite.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell me before you found it to be material that you was part in the door? - I was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Could you standing in the passage, see the windows that are on the right hand-side of the door? - There is a window in the passage that looks into the compting-house from the passage; I could see it from there; I did see it through there, before I went in.</p>
               <p>Now, did you see it through the window or through the door? - I saw it through the window, and through the door too.</p>
               <p>Is the window on the same side with the door which looks into the passage? - Yes, it goes almost to the other window; so that standing in the passage, you can see through the window.</p>
               <p>How came you to look particularly at this time, when you was in the passage? - To see whether it was shut or no.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - If it was not to have shut it.</p>
               <p>Does that bag belong to any body in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Consider, you are upon your oath; you say that you went down upon a knock at the door to speak to some person about business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If the person had not come, you would have had your tea, and would not have taken care of your compting-house till after your tea? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us it is your general duty to take care of the compting-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe, that if this window had been discovered to have been left open by any neglect of your's, or want of care of yours; that you would have been very severely reprimanded, for exposing the house to be robbed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nothing else brought you down but to speak to this person about business? - No.</p>
               <p>It was business of some consequence to your father? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Then your attention was taken upon this business very much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not mean to look at all about the compting-house, till after you had finished your tea? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090075"></xptr>This window in the passage is public to the street door and the compting-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You just let him in, I suppose; and he stood pretty near the street door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was conversing with him as near as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any enquiry made of you by the family after this happened; whether you had left the window open or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After this happened, who spoke to you about it? - Mrs. Lomas.</p>
               <p>What did she say to you? - I do not rightly recollect.</p>
               <p>As near as you can? - She asked, why it was not shut.</p>
               <p>She was angry with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you tell her? - I told her I intended to have shut it after tea.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about the sash being shut or not shut, by either you or her? - No, I do not recollect whether there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Wainwright. Had you gone past that house that evening before? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my Counsel; I went to Wood-street, to the sign of the Magpye, to meet my father, between five and six; he was not there, my wife had lain in only three weeks; I was going to my wife's sister at the Old Swan, at the bottom of the bridge, and coming along two men insulted me, and used me very ill, and they took my hat and threw it away, and it happened to lodge on the window sill, and I got up and reached it down; and these two men came and asked me what I did there, and I told them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's witnesses called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>Court to Lomas. At the time you went to speak to this man about business, where was you called from? - From up stairs.</p>
               <p>When had you gone up stairs? - About five.</p>

            . I keep a public house; a girl belonging to the prosecutor came to my house and said they were rob'd, so one went one way and another another way, to see if we could find the person. I went towards Mile-end, and overtook the prisoner at the bar with the things in her apron. I brought her back to Mr. Bennet's house. The goods produced in court.

               <p>Coming along a woman came out of this place with the things, and desired me to carry them a little way up the road for her, and said she'd give me part of a pint of beer. Mr. Adams came and asked me what I had got. I open'd my lap and shewed him, he said they belonged to the persons. I shew'd him the other woman, and while he was talking to me she got off.</p>
               <p>Q. to Adams. Was there another woman with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Adams. There was a woman about twelve yards a head of her. The prisoner told me she had a parcel of rags in her lap. I asked her if the other woman had any more. She told me no. I asked her if she was concerned with her, and she said yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did she say the other woman had given them to her?</p>
               <p>Adams. No. I sent the two men that were with me after her, but it was dark, and they could not find her.</p>

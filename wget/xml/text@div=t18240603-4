On Wednesday, the 3d of March, between twelve and two o'clock, I was at home, standing by the fire, and saw the prisoner in the tap-room; several other people were there - Burton served him with something. I lost sight of him a very short time afterwards, and saw him again between six and seven o'clock in the evening coming down stairs - he was at the foot of the stairs leading to the best sitting room; we have two stair-cases leading to that room, but only one is kept open - the stair-case he was at the foot of has a door at the top of it, which is kept locked - it is the door of the room at the top of the stair-case; I saw that door locked at eleven o'clock that day. When I saw him at the foot of the stairs my husband seized him, and I ran out for assistance. I saw him in custody afterwards, and swear that he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any property in the room the door of which was locked - A. No; we lost some money from our bed-room, which he could get to from that stair-case, but he must go through three rooms first. I had left twelve sovereigns and four half sovereigns in the bureau drawer in that bed-room, and know that the drawer was locked at five o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you see the door locked - A. At eleven o'clock, and at five I went to the drawer and it was locked then. I did not know the prisoner before. There were seven or eight men in the house when he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you come from the bed-room if one door is locked - A. Down the back stair-case, which was not locked up. I saw him at the front stair-case.</p>

            . I keep the Goat, public-house. On Wednesday, the 3d of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I went up the back stair-case to my bed-room, and on getting to the top of the stairs, the prisoner rushed out of the bed-room, and ran along the passage leading to the front stair-case - I immediately ran down the back stairs to the street door, and found him at the foot of the front stair-case, which is behind the street door - I seized him, shut the door, and gave an alarm, and almost at the same moment he called to another man for assistance; they both endeavoured to get the street door open, which they did, and got outside, but I still held the prisoner fast, and his companion finding that he could not liberate him, commenced beating me with a bludgeon until I fell from the loss of blood, but recovered before the prisoner got many paces from me. I pursued him calling for assistance - Saville joined me; I ran after the prisoner; he ran down Carter Hatch-lane - I got within three yards of him, and was attempting to seize him - he turned round and looked at me, put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and said if I approached him he would be the death of me - I ran close to him till assistance came, and he was secured. I walked home behind him, went up to my bedroom, and found a drawer taken out of the bureau chest, and put on a chair, and a picklock key laying by it - the gold, which was safe five or six hours before was gone; there had been about 20 l. there, most of it in sovereigns, and the rest in half sovereigns. The key of the drawer was in my wife's possession at the time. While I was following the prisoner he untwisted an apron which was round his waist, and threw it down, and on the following day I saw one Baalam; he accompanied me down the lane, and in my presence picked up a crow-bar, which has been tried in my presence to the door at the top of the front stair-case, and it made exactly similar marks to those we found on the door; there was a dent on the door as if the edge of this instrument had been pushed against it - I had found it open when I returned from following the prisoner. One of the Saville's brought me three sovereigns about half an hour after the prisoner was taken. Cuffley has the crow-bar and apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose property were they - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030006"></xptr>Mine; they were in a little drawer laid within a large drawer. I had not seen the prisoner before that day, but am sure of him - it is impossible that I can be mistaken; I had him in my grasp for five or six minutes. My house is in Enfield parish; I rent it.</p>
               <p>ELIZABEEH BURTON. I reside in the prosecutor's house. On the 3d of March, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the house, and afterwards, about six I saw the prosecutor seize him at the foot of the stairs - they were together for some minutes; I went to his assistance. His companion came up (I had seen him there also about one o'clock;) he came to the prisoner's assistance, and got the door open, got into the porch, and began beating Mr. Reynolds, and hit me a violent blow over the arm, which made me leave go, and he ran towards the lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before - A. No.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Bush-hill, Edmonton. On the 3d of March I was coming towards the prosecutor's house, and about a hundred yards from it saw Reynolds, the prisoner, and another man scuffling outside the porch - Reynolds fell on the ground; the prisoner and the other man ran towards me; Reynolds got up and cried Stop thief! The prisoner said if I attempted to stop him he would kill me; Reynolds came up. I never lost sight of him till he was taken. My brother James came to our assistance with Smith and Huzzey - my brother secured him. When he passed me I saw him throw his hand out, and heard something jink, but did not see what it was. After he was secured, I went to the doctor's, and as I returned I picked up three sovereigns on the spot where I heard the jinking; it was in the open road, close to a shop. It was about half-past six o'clock when I saw him, and twenty minutes past eight when I found the sovereigns.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a man was the other - A. He was about the prisoner's height. I searched all round, but only found three sovereigns.</p>

I went into the high road, and saw a man running towards Carter Hatch-lane - I ran after him, and saw Reynolds, the prisoner, and my brother running - they looked back, and called me.

            . I am constable of Enfield. On the 3d of March, about seven o'clock, Reynolds sent for me - I found the prisoner at his house, searched him, and found five sovereigns, a shilling, two-pence, a knife, and a gimblet on him. Reynolds gave me a crow-bar, which I tried to the door at the top of his front stair-case, and made a mark myself with it; it made the same impression by opening the door with it as was on it before. Reynolds was all over blood, and the doctor was dressing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not fit the crow-bar to the impression - A. No. The house is in Enfield parish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Waltham Abbey, and went into this house to have some beer - a person ran down the stairs; he passed me, and ran out. Reynolds came and accused me of being the man who had come down the stairs.</p>

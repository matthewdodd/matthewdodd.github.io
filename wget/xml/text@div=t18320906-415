               <p>WILLIAM SHORT. I live with Mr. Gregson. On the 23rd of August I fell in with the prisoner at a beer-shop in Shoreditch; he was with another person, whom I knew - I have known the prisoner twelve years; the other person asked me to drink, and I sat down and drank out of a glass of ale - it was then between eight and nine o'clock, and I stopped till ten o'clock, but I was not intoxicated - we then all left and went to another house in Church-street, and had some beer there; we then went to Whitechapel, and there had a quartern of rum; that was between eleven and twelve o'clock - the other person paid the reckoning; the prisoner said he had no money - we then went with some females to the door of a house in <placeName id="t18320906-415-crimeloc2340">Baker's-row</placeName>

Jem! I then went with the other person to the prisoner's father, but he was not come home - the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What is the reason you did not give an alarm? A. I did not think you meant to rob me, as we had been particular friends.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor and the prisoner - we all sat on the step, and the prisoner in the middle; I fell asleep in a short time - Short touched me, and said that Long had taken his watch and ran off - we went to the corner, but lost sight of him - I heard the prisoner caution him about his watch in Shoreditch, and he put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DEVEREUX BOLTON (Police-constable H 49). At three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and the other two in company with a prostitute - as they passed me the prisoner said "It is all right, Bolton;" I said I did not know that it was, they had better go on - they went to Rose-court, and stood talking together; I went past them, returned, and they were still there - I desired them to go on; I went on, and when I returned a third time, they were asleep on a step in Baker's-row - the prisoner said, "It is all right, let us sleep a while." - I said, No, go about your business" - he then started up, and before I could well turn round, he was out of sight; the prosecutor looked about and called Jem! and asked if I saw which way he ran; I said No - he afterwards went to the station, and gave notice.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was innocent, and that 
all he said to the officer was, "I know what it is about."</p>

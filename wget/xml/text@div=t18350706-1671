                  </hi>. I am the son of Francis Jury—he had a chain cable belonging to the barge <hi rend="italic">Robert Mann</hi>; it was off Union Stairs—on the 1st of July, and made fast—on the next day I was rowing past, and saw two men with the cable hooked to their grapplings—I called to them that it belonged to me—they used bad language, and threw it overboard—I think the prisoner, Tappey, was one of the men; the other I cannot swear to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police surveyor. About one o'clock in the night of the 3d of July, I saw a boat pulling under a tier of vessels—the two prisoners were in it—I came side, and found in it this chain cable of 400 and odd pounds weight—before I got hold of them, Tappey got on board a French vessel—while I was getting after him, I was called and told that Gray had jumped over-board—he was got out of the water, and Tappey was taken into another boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they are dredgers; they go about the river to pick up ropes by day, but not at night—persons may be employed to do so at night, but they do not jump over-board—chain cables have been picked up, and brought back to the water-bailiff.</p>

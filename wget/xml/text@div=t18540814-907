                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Howe. I had been to Great Stanmore, hay making—on 26th June I left a bundle in the care of John Saunders—it contained clothes of my own and my children's—Saunders was to take care of the bundle while I was at work at Mr. Canard's—the prisoner was working with me there—after leaving work on Monday, I went to Mr. Blackwell's, to get other work—I left the prisoner against the gate, as we went into the yard—I did not get back till between 10 and 11 o'clock—I saw Saunders, and he gave me some information—I did not give the prisoner authority to go and get the bundle—it contained three gowns, three pairs of stays, a dozen and a half of napkins, five shirts, petticoats" and other things, and a Bible and Prayer-book.</p>

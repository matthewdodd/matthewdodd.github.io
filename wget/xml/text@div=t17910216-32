On Wednesday, the 16th of this month, I stopped the prisoner in Dover-street, about a quarter past nine; he had a bundle under his arm; I asked him where he was going; I knew him; he said, to the washerwoman's with foul linen; I laid hold of the bundle, and found it weighty; and I desired him to come back with me; he accordingly came back to my shop; and he shewed me the half hundred weight wrapped up in his foul shirt; I had him taken into custody; the prisoner is my servant as a porter; he has lived with me about seven months; it was about twenty yards from my own door, where I stopped him; the weight was in my shop: (the weight produced): I had no other lead weight but this; the prisoner acknowledged the fact as soon as he came into the shop; I had made no promises or threats; I had lost things before, and I was determined to watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You swear to it by a hole? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is the value of the weight? - I have valued it at six shillings; I never doubted his honesty before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Isaac Solomons, a clothes salesman, Smithfield-bars. On the 19th of Dec, about eight o'clock at night, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to the shop—he had a cloak on, and a coat, which he offered to sell, and buy another in exchange—he said he had seen my master on the Monday night—he tried on one coat—it did not fit—he tried another, whioi did—while he was doing that, two females came in, and asked me the way to London-bridge—on turning my head rather sharp, I saw the prisoner putting coat under his cloak, not the one he was trying on—he said, "It is no use waiting for your master; I shall go to the coffee-house, and get a cup of tea"—he went to the door—I followed—the policeman was going by, and I said, "I give this man in charge"—he ran, and I saw him drop, the coat by the side of the door—I had pulled it off the shelf for him to try on—he had not tried this on—he did not buy any.</p>

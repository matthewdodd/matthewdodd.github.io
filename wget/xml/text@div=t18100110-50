On the 22nd of December, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in my shop, she was looking at some purple ribbon; and suspecting, from her appearance, that she was a shop-lifter, I asked her, what she wanted; she replied, some ribbon to match the pattern he shewed me; I answered, that it was impossible to match that colour by candle light. She selected a piece, and had a yard and a half cut off, which she paid for, and went out of the shop. I instantly went out of doors, and got sight of her. At Rupert-street I pushed her into Mr. Pitts shop an hosier's, I said, to her in Mr. Pitts shop, you have robbed me, and sent for a constable; and before the constable came, half a piece of ribbon dropped from underneath her, I said, to her, what is that, she said, I do not know sir; it does not belong to me, I took it up, it had my private mark on it; she said, she had kicked it along the street, I observed it was impossible, it was a very dirty night, and the ribbon was clean.</p>

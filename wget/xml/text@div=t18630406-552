               <p>Westminster-road, Lambeth—on 29th January last, the prisoner came there with a woman, and called for a quartern of gin—he paid with a florin—the lad, John Fay, to whom he paid it, called my attention to it—I asked the prisoner if he had any more of the same sort—he said, "Not that I know of"—I asked him if he had any good coin—he said at first he had, and then he said he had not—I asked him where he got it—he said he got it over the water in change with 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not show me any other coin—I marked the florin at the police-court, and gave it to the constable—I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

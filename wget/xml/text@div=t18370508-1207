                  </hi>. I reside at Ilford, and am on auctioneer. I came to town on the 6th of April—I got to Grove-street, Commercial-road, and there being no accommodation for my horse and chaise, a friend took it for me—I went to go back about four o'clock, and found my great coat was gone, which had been in the chaise.</p>

I took the prisoner on the Monday afterwards—he said a person gave him the coat to pawn, and he dare say he could point him out, as he was at Sinclair's—when we went there, he pointed out a person—he said the first time that that was the person who gave him the coat, and on the second he said he was not the person—Jones was the name of the person we took up, who was afterward discharged.</p>

               <p>cannot say that any one ran away—he never gave the name—I never heard of the name of Levick—there was a woman of the name of Chase taken up—she was examined as the person who saw the offence committed—a person was brought forward who saw the coat taken, and she if not here—on the last examination she was not present—on the second exa<lb></lb>mination the woman said that the prisoner was not the man who stole it—she was a respectable, decent woman—she gave an account of a man wear<lb></lb>ing a cap, and a youngish man—I found the man, but he had changed his dress—in the afternoon we found the jacket and cap, and put them on the man, and then she said she could not be certain, and he was discharged—the woman was brought forward by me.</p>

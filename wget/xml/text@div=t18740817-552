                  </hi>. I live at 34, Grafton Street, Mile End, and am employed in the Great Eastern Railway—on 27th May, 1873, I saw my premises safe about 2 o'clock—I did not go to bed, as my wife had just been confined—I sat in a chair and went to sleep—when I woke in the morning to go to my work I found the doors open and the window had been forced and the flower pots taken, from the window and placed on the pave<lb></lb>ment—I missed my great coat then, and I afterwards found the drawers almost empty, except a few things at the bottom.</p>

I live at 20, St. Dunstan's Road,—on 27th May, 1873, about 2.25. in the morning I saw the prisoner come over a wall—I asked him what his little game was, and he said he was waiting for his mates to go to work—I get my living by calling people up who want to be up early regularly</p>

               <p>—I turned round to tap at some one's window and the prisoner struck me on the breast and knocked me down—he had a carpet bag in his hand and it was full, the lid would not come over—I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw—he had a cheese cutter cap on, a square peeked cap.</p>

I saw him again in August the same year at the Thames Police Court—I was taken to see him—he was then alone in the dock, and I was asked te say if I knew him—he was 300 or 400 yards from the prosecutor's house when I saw him—the wall he came over had nothing to do with the prosecutor's house—he struck me in the breast and knocked me down and then went over the wall again—I did not follow him—he had a long blue coat on with the collar turned up.</p>

I took the prisoner last Monday morning about 9 o'clock—I took him to Arbour Square and sent for the last witness—I placed the prisoner with eight or ten others and Neal identified him—I told him the charge—at first he" said he knew nothing about it, but on the way to the station he said "I daresay they will make it hot for me as it is near where the other job was done."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> First he told me where it was done and what time it was done—I said "If it is like that it will sure to make it hot for me because I was taken near there"—the witness picked me out another man first. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He did pick out another man first, but he did not touch him—he pointed to one, but he did not speak—he went by three or four' men and he took hold of the prisoner's collar and said "This is the man," and brought him out in front.</p>

The prisoner is my brother—in May last year he lived at 2, George Street, Spitalfields, and I lived there—from the 2nd March till 2nd July the prisoner and his eldest brother were at work in Spitalfields Market as porters—I don't remember the 26th May, but I remember one day in May that my husband went to the play and my brothers had supper on bread and cheese and pickles, and sometimes they slept together, and some<lb></lb>times in a different bed, but never away from each other—he was taken on 25th August—he never got up before 6 o'clock or 6.30—he never wore such a thing as a peak cap—he wore a soft felt round hat at that time.</p>

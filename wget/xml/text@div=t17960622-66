               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Prescott and Co. No. 62, Threadneedle-street: On the 7th of May, I paid a draft of 92l. upon Messrs. Prescott, drawn by S. Cundell; Mr. Cundell keeps cash at our house, I don't know the person to whom I paid it; I gave a Bank note of 25l. No. 8858, dated the 10th of December, I believe, 1795, I have got the note, and another Bank Note for 25l. No. 258, dated the 22d of March, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Cundell's hand-writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have been giving an account of the transaction from that book, is that the original entry? - A. It is the first entry made of the transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. Made by yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that entry is the number 8858, entered as dated 1795? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it is the note? - A. Because it is taken down in another book, before it is paid away by me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that book here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The No. 258 is the date of that entered? - A. No, it is not; it is not our custom to enter the date, I speak of the dates from taking them down the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that note to be the note you paid away? - A. I believe it to be the note by the number and the date, (reads the book); 20l No. 8858, 25l. No. 258, and 42l. in money, making 92l. the amount of the draft.</p>

Yes; 76l. constituted of Bank's cash, and a check; the Bank's were 35l. in more than one note, I cannot say how many; I carried it to our bankers, Sykes and Company, which I paid in on account of Mr. Gilbert.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Sykes and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Gilbert's clerk coming to you on any day, and what day? - A. I don't remember any particular day of his coming; he often brings cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to your book, and look at the 9th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that your own entry? - A. It is 68l. 13s. which consisted of a draft drawn by Williams, upon Harper, for 20l. a Bank note, No. 504, the 5th of April, for 5l. No. 6921, 1st of April, for 5l. and No. 8858, 10th of December, for 25l. with 13 guineas in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return him any? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. The 10th of December, in what year? - A. The entry itself is No. 8858, 10th of December, for 25l.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no year upon the book? - A. No; we never put down the year in the book that it is entered in; if it is not in the same year, we usually put it down; it must have been December, 1795.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220085"></xptr>Q. You have no memory of it but from that book? - A. No other whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot venture to swear that it was of that year? - A. I cannot certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Forsier.) Q. Look at your book; who made that entry? - A. I did; No. 258, 22d of March, 25l. No. 8858, 10th December, 25l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. That other entry, in the rough book, is of the same notes that you have there entered? - A. Yes; we received no notes of that number that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what year were those notes dated? - A. I don't know that I have got the year; one was 1795, and the other 1796.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I have discharged the notes in my waste book with the same number that I have taken them down here; and we did not receive any other notes of that number that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not discharge a note of that number of the year 1793? - A. I cannot; I believe I can prove there are not two notes of the same year the number the same; there is a person in Court that will prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe every Bank note has the date of the year, as well as the day of the month? - A. Yes; but it is not the custom to take them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Bank clerk? - A. No; a banker's clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear the Bank don't make out notes of the same date and the same number, except the year? - A. No; I leave that to the other party to do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Have you these Bank notes? - A. Yes; (produces them).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. A Bank note, however dishonestly come by by one person, may go through twenty hands in the same day? - A. It is not impossible that it may go through so many, but it is not likely.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you, as banker's clerks, make memorandums of Bank notes, but a great many individuals don't do it? - A. It may be so.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember receiving a note of the prisoner on the 7th of May? - A. I received a payment of 82l. 11s. for shops the prisoner had bought of me at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it paid to you? - A. I don't recollect; it was in Bank notes and cash, but more cash than Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many notes there were, or how much cash? - A. No; it was 82l. 11s. I took no account of the Bank notes; on the 9th of May I paid to Graves, Swaine, and Co. 32l. 12s. 6d. I believe they had a Bank note, but I had no number of it, nor sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gardner. Q. Did you make any other payments? - A. Yes; to Price and Son, thirty odd pounds the same day; and, I believe, within an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that payment made in money or not? - A. I cannot say; there might be a note in that; the whole sum I paid was 63l. 5s. 6d. to the two; it was paid out of the money I received of Mr. Berry.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you receive any thing of any body else that day? - A. of nobody.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Were there any Bank notes paid in that 32l.? - A. I cannot say that there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Ninn pay you a Bank note that day? - A. He paid us 32l 12s. 6d. I cannot say in what way it was paid; we received a Bank note that day, and but one; we paid a Bank note into Wilkinson's house that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You cannot say who you received that Bank note from? - A. I believe I received it from Mr. Ninn, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Why do you believe that? - A. Because I received but one that day; and we paid a Bank note into Wilkinson's house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much did you pay into the banker's that day? - A. 148l. 18s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say at first, that you did not know whether there was a Bank note in what you received from Mr. Ninn? - A. I said so, because we have no particulars of it; I cannot account for our coming into possession of that 25l. note any other way; I cannot swear that we received it of him, but I have no reason to believe we received it of any other person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Does no other person receive cash at your house? - A. Yes; but the money goes through my hands; I credit what is received.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand there are hardly ever two exactly alike? - A. No; it is the most improbable thing in the world.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a Coal-merchant in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hammond? - A. I have very little acquaintance with him; I was there last Sunday was a week, and I went to Mr. Gilbert's along with Mrs. Berry, where Mr. Hammond was clerk; I asked Mr. Hammond and Mr. Gilbert both, if they kept any regular entry of their Bank notes that they received before they sent them to their bankers, and they told me they did not enter the numbers down; and I asked them, if they knew whether they had taken a note of Mr. Berry to the amount of 25l.; and Mr. Gilbert and Hammond both said they could not swear that they had.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did Mr. Hammond say so? - A. Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did any thing further pass about any other Bank notes? - A. No; for I did not know the nature of the business when I went there; Mr. Hammond said, he could not take upon him to swear that they took a note of that sum of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years have you known Berry? - - A. About seven or eight years; I believe, he is a <rs id="t17960622-66-deflabel381" type="occupation">grocer and hop merchant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960622-66-defend713 t17960622-66-deflabel381"></join>, in Shoreditch; he has had as fair a character, I believe, as any tradesman in London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Are you very correct in your memory as to what passed between you and Hammond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that the precise words were as you have stated? - A. Yes; I understood it to be about a Bank note that was forged.</p>
               <p>Q. As Mrs. Berry was with you, it is very odd you should suppose it to be about a forged Bank note? - A. Mrs. Berry, I believe, did not know otherwise herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any examination took place, before Hammond was known to be a witness by any examination, you went to him, yet not knowing what he was accused of; then how could you guess Mr. Hammond was the man to apply to? - A. He had had an examination on Saturday night at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. And did Hammond appear at that examination? - A. I believe, either Mr. Gilbert or Mr. hammond did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go, professedly, to talk to him, that you might afterwards give evidence for the prisoner? - A. No, I did not; I never thought of coming here at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Berry did not acquaint you that she meant to make use of you as a witness? - A. No; I went to know if he had taken any minute of the notes, and if he could swear that he received a note of 25l. of Mr. Berry.(The prisoner called eight other witness, who gave him a good character).</p>
               <p>Court. I think there is no occasion to call any more witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have, my Lord, two dozen more upon my brief yet uncalled.</p>

The workshop behind my house was broken open about four months ago - I suspected him, and brought him to the Mansion-house; he was dismissed, and I discharged him; I have since taken him again - I told Smith, my other boy, to watch him; he gave me information, and I sent for an officer, who found this whalebone in his trousers and inside his stockings - there was 1 lb. of it; he said nothing; it is part of my stock; I never sold him any.</p>

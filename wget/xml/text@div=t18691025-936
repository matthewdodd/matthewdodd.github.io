                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>) I live at 15, Jermyn Street—on Saturday night, 23rd October, about 11.30, or from that to midnight, I was walking along Jermyn Street, going to a night-house, when the prisoner came behind me and snatched my watch and chain, and broke the chain in three places—I cried "Police! police!" nobody was in the street, there was no policeman there—the prisoner struck me two blows with a cane, and ran away as fast as he could—I ran after him and cried "Police!" and "Thief!" several times, and he was stopped by a policeman—this is my watch and chain, and this is the stick I was struck with—I got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the pawn-shop for the watch—one part of the chain fell on the ground, and one part remained round my neck, and the watch remained in my watch pocket—there were very little marks on my shoulder from the blows—I had a very thick shawl on—he struck me with the thin end of the stick—it was broken.</p>

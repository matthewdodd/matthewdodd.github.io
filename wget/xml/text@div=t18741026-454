                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner put in the following written defence</hi>: "On Saturday evening, September 26th, I left home at 6.30 p.m. and went into Mount Pleasant Fields, which I usually did of an evening for a walk, where I met Taylor about 7.15 p.m., not by appointment, to give her money as she states. She asked me what I was doing there, I told her I had been watching a man, which I had, she then asked me where I was going, I told her I was going across the fields, where she followed me. I did not ask her to go with me. She then began to ask me for some money towards the support of her child, which she says I am the father of, whenever I met her she always asked me for money. Knowing that I am not the father of her child, I did not give her any. The first time I had anything to do with Taylor was about the end of December, 1873. She then said if I did not give her some money, she would swear the child to me, whereupon I got in a passion and struck her on the head with my fist, when she fell into the water—I did not throw her into it, as she states, we were at the edge of the water at the time I struck her. I then took hold of her hand, and assisted her out, we then went out into the field, I struck her again, I then went back and fetched her hat, and gave it to her, and told her I was sorry for what I had done, I had done it in a passion, I then wet my pocket-handkerchief in some water and washed' her face, I then told her I would take her home, I went more than half-way home with her, when she asked me not to go any farther with her, for fear some one might see us together, I again told her I was sorry for what I had done, I then left her and she ran towards home. I had no intention whatever to do Tayloy an injury, which was done in a passion, for which I am very sorry. I beg to state that I never had the life preserver in my possession, neither did I use it. The first I saw of it was when Inspector Gray shewed it to me at the Police Station on Sunday, September 27th, and asked me if it belonged to me, I told him it did not, and had never seen it before. The witness Corfield, has never seen me with it in my possession. I hope gentlemen you will deal as lenient with the case as possible, and I will endeavour to leave the country at once.</p>

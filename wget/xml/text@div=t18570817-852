                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the F division of police. On 9th July I went, at half past 3 o'clock in the morning; to No, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., New Compton Street, where the prisoners resided, in a room on the first floor—I found the prisoners in bed—Mason was dressed, with the exception of his coat, waistcoat, and boots—Jarvis was undressed, in bed—I looked behind the door, and found this large chest, and, on looking in it, it contained the articles now produced on the top of it—I told Mason to get up, and I com<lb></lb>menced searching the room—he dressed himself, and I directed a policeman, who was with me, to take him down stairs and put him into a cab which we had at the door—I desired Jarvis to get up, and, on looking round the room, I found this needle case on a dressing table—I asked Jarvis who it belonged to—she said, "To me"—I directed her to dress herself, and took her down stairs and put her in the cab—I then recommenced searching the room, and found this second box under the table—I found the oil cover of it under the bed, and also a large bundle, which contained three damask table cloths, twenty-two napkins, twenty-six towels, two toilet covers, five dusters, three shirts, five pillow cases, one damask chair cover, nineteen D'Oyleys, and five kitchen cloths—in the chest I found three worked cushions, one toilet cover, thirty-five pieces of silk tabaret, four curtain holders, two kettle holders, one piece of chintz, one stuffed pheasant, three glass decanters, one claret jug, thirteen brass ornaments, one photograph likeness, nine books, one piece of taper, one silk scarf, three collars, two women's sleeves, one cigar stand, one fancy work case, one scent decanter, one deal box, and an otto<lb></lb>man under the table—Mason was taken to the station, and I took these articles there, and asked him how he came in possession of them—he said that he had bought them at Debenham and Storr's—I asked him from whom he bought them, and what he gave for them—he said, "I refuse to answer any further questions now."</p>

I accompanied the last witness to No. 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., New Compton Street—I produce twenty-five skeleton keys, which I found under the bed; these five files, two screwdrivers, a knife, a life preserver, and other things—I went the next day to No. 16, Portland Road—one of the keys which I found under the bed opened the door—I got in, and found the place in great confusion, and, on further examining the inner door, I found marks as if it had been attempted to be forced open—I com<lb></lb>pared this knife, which I found in the prisoners' room with the marks on the door and the door post; it exactly matched them—the shop is blocked up from rest of the house—you cannot enter it from the house—I heard Mason say at the station, when the charge was read over to him, "They are my own property; I bought them at Debenham, and Storr's"—when the inspector first went into the prisoners' room he said to Mason, "Doctor, We want you"—Mason goes by the name of "Doctor."</p>

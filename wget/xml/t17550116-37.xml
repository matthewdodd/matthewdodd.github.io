I told him that the Warden had locked Mr. Hunt up, and he would not let it be a public-house any longer. He asked me if I had any leather chairs to sell? He went up into the dining room, and looked at some, after that we went both down stairs. He called for half a pint of wine; then he said, Mrs. Robertson, I have got an exceeding good public-house, I will let you have, with a hundred pounds stock in it; but it is out of the freedom of the city. Then he said, I see you are so full of business, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160037"></xptr> is no opportunity to talk to you; and asked me if I would go with him any where else? And mentioned some place up in Holborn, a great way off. I answered I would not go there for ever so much. I said, if any other place would do, I would go. Then he mentioned the Leg in Fleet-street; but did not say whether it was a tavern, or what; and I never knew there was such a house as the Leg tavern there before. I said I would meet him there. I went, and at the top of the market I asked a woman where the Leg tavern was? She said it was a little higher up in Fleet-street. After that, I asked at the Tin-shop. When I came there, the prisoner was not come; I took a chair and sat down in the passage, where I staid some time, and finding he did not come. I threw down six-pence for a glass of wine and came away; I met Mr. Jones in Fleet-street, fronting the Saloop-shop, he clapped his hand on my shoulder, and said, Mrs Robertson, where are you going? I said, my business was so urgent I could not stay; I went back with him, when we came there we went to the upper end of the yard, in a private room, a ground-floor, I don't know whether there are two or three windows, they opened fronting the tavern-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the yard?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. The room is about thirty yards from the bar; the prisoner called for a pint of wine directly, a Dutch woman followed us up the yard, we sat down with it, she did not stay at all, then I said, let me know about this house; he said, Mrs. Robertson, there is a hundred pound stock, and you shall have it for one night's lodging with me; I made answer, I would not do such a thing for the world, I would not live or cohabit with any man living, neither would I wrong Mr. Hunt's bed.</p>
               <p>C. Explain what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Mr. Hunt is in the Fleet, and he is the person that I am under contract of marriage with.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do to you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He made no more ado but took and pulled me forward and unbuttoned his breeches, and forced my hand to his private parts, and pulled my petticoats up before in order to lay with me, I cried out as loud as I could, nobody came to my assistance, nor did I see man, woman, or child all the time I was in the place; I struggled very much, and got myself disengaged, then he got my cloaths up behind, in order to lay with me backwards; after that I called out again, and struggled, so that living a new pair of shoes on the heels came off with struggling, he always kept hold of my petticoats, so that I could not get away from him, then he took and threw me cross his lap, with my head upon the ground, and had hold of both my hands, he took my petticoats up all round me, I was as much exposed as ever any monster was, then I found him enter my body, as my husband, as I lay with my head on the floor, and one leg down on the ground betwixt his knees, he kept my hands fast in one of his, that I could not stir them, and he held me fast by my middle, and with the other hand was forcing his private parts to me. I am a widow, I was married to one man nine years all but three days, and have had four children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive he did enter your body?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I am very positive he did. I got one of my legs down, that which was cross his knee, and forced myself down on the ground, and said, for God Almighty's sake don't, you'll ruin my soul and body, when I got up from the ground, he got me on his lap again, and my right-hand he forced to his private parts, but I clinched my fingers fast, so he could not make me, then he said, d - n it, I can do nothing, I can do nothing, and d - d his eyes and limbs and swore he would st - h me; he endeavoured it again, but did not succeed; I told him I did not think he would have brought me to a house to use me ill; he said, what did I mean by using me ill? I went to lay hold on the decanter and glass to break the window, but he pushed them out of my reach; I told him it did not signify, go I would, or I would raise Fleet-street about his ears, he said, I should not go at all, many times over, and said, he would lay with me. I begged and prayed as much as possible, and told him my business lay at six's and seven's; I got away at last by swearing an oath that I would return back again to sup with him, and he was to get a fowl for supper; when I got out of the house I never returned, I saw a woman in the room close to where we were; when I got out I went as fast as I could go, fearing they should bring me back again, and went home directly, and made complaint of it in about two hours afterwards, and cried sadly, for my cloaths were torn from off my back; I complained also to Mr. Hunt and Mrs. Slayter in the Fleet; the prisoner came again that evening about six or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160038"></xptr> seven o'clock to buy some pots, Mrs. Slayter sold him them, one Gwin, that came with the prisoner, wrote a receipt, and brought it up for me to sign it, I refused signing it; after they were gone Mr. Hunt beat me unmerfully, and said there was some meaning in my refusing to sign it, then I told him the reason why I would not sign it, Mr. Jones had used me ill at a tavern, so he called two or three more people up, and I told the story there, and the Monday after I went before Mr. alderman Janssen and made my complaint to him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the bar of that house in Fleetstreet.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, I was not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be there in the whole?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. About an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Council. I can't conceive how there could be any possibility of his penetrating your body.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did enter my body a little.</p>
               <p>Q. To what degree; describe which way it could be?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did indeed a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he get within you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I tell you but a very little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you apprehensive you could be with child by him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I am not that I could, because it is a thing impossible, for where a woman has no inclination, it is impossible there can be a child</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Because I have been a married woman a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had consented, have you any reason to think you might have been with child by the consequence of it; you say he entered your body as your husband did?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't say I am with child, I don't think I have any reason to think I am with child. My husband never used me in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not lay with you in so complete a manner as your husband did?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, he did not, because of my struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive - ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I know what you mean; no, I did not.</p>
               <p>Council. Look upon that piece of paper.</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the body of the note wrote by?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. It was by Mr. Gwyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter; do you know this name at the bottom?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This is Mr. Hunt's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is another letter; whose hand-writing is this?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. This also is Mr. Hunt's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read the date of that receipt when you signed it?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I did not look at it; I was forced to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Hunt a married man?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Upon my oath I don't know the he is; he always denies it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Ever since the 8th of October was twelve-month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not set you up in that house in the Fleet?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did not; the goods and effects were great part of them his, and some were mine; for he had a great deal of money of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He had a place in the commission of bankruptcy I think, and he dealt in brandy and wine, he bought the liquor in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him a bailiff, or sheriff's officer?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be locked up in the Fleet?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't know that; I think it was a linen draper did it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner discoursing with you before he became so violent?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Not a great while; not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been seated before he talked about the house?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I had drank one glass of wine before, and so had he; we had but one pint of wine in all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in the room with him?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. To the best of my knowledge about two hours, or two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body appear in this time?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. Never a soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of having any command of the yard?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. As I sat, I could see the bar and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175501160039"></xptr> the kitchen sideways; but I did not see any of the family moving in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the bar-bell ring in the time?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say, when you cried out?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I said, for God's sake some body come and help me! as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to stop your mouth?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, he did not, he said, d - n you, why do you make such a hire noise?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in this struggling position?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I don't know whether it was not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door fascened ?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. I believe it was only shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he entered your body a very little way; what do you call a very little way?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. He did just enter my body.</p>
               <p>Council. Will you swear he was the length of his thumb-nail in you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson, Yes, sir, more than that; but it was but a very little way. My senses were gone for a good while, it might be for five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to throw himself on the floor, in order to lie with you?</p>
               <p>S. Robertson. No, sir, my petticoats were towzed all round me, and my legs tangled in them.</p>

            . I was sent to sell Mrs. Robertson's goods on the 5th of October; I remember Mr. Jones coming between three and four in the afternoon, and bought some pots. He went out, and returned about dusk. He came again on the 7th, and said he had been quarelling with his wife concerning a letter sent her about a rape on Mrs. Robertson; and said he could have laid with her over and over; but she was a little dirty b - ch, and he would have nothing to say to her. I said, if you know yourself clear, go to Mr. Hunt in the Fleet, and clear yourself.  He went, and I was there. Mr. Hunt asked him several questions; he said, may-be she might sit on my knee, and my breeches might be open; and said to me, you may put your hand in, if you will, and pulled them open.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said she did not take any notice of Robertson's cloaths that evening being torn.</p>

            . On the 5th of October last, Mrs. Robertson was selling some houshold furniture for me; I was then a close prisoner in the Fleet. She came to me on the close of the evening, and fell a crying but said nothing then. About candle lighting came Mrs. Gwyn and the prisoner; he had bought some quart pots, and desired a receipt. I desired Mrs. Robertson to write one; she would not; but with a great deal to do she did sign one. After Jones was gone, she cried, and said he had used her very ill at the Leg in Fleet-street. I said, I had before cautioned her to take care how she went into that house. She said she had forgot it. To know the truth of this, I was willing to get the parties together. So I sent a letter on the 6th of October to Jones's wife, and made the scene look black against him. I sent her word Mrs. Robertson was then in keeping by the prisoner, and if she would come to me, I would acquaint her with the whole, and where she was. The messenger returned, and told me she delivered it to Jones's wife's own hands. Jones's wife came to me, and I desired the prosecutrix to repeat to her the whole transaction; which she did. On the Monday after that came Jones; he said he did go to the Leg tavern with Mrs. Robertson, and they there had but one pint of wine, and she might sit on his knee, or kiss his lips; but as to any thing else, he never did attempt. I desired her to tell her story before him; there she charged him with abusing her, and lying with her; but he denied it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said he was a married man, that his wife was then near him in court, that he had two children by her, and that he, notwithstanding that, had made a contract with the prosecutrix to marry her; and he had been acquainted with her eighteen months or two years; that he went from his wife the 16th of January, and made the contract with Robertson on the 8th of October following; that he wrote two letters to Jones's wife; that he struck the prosecutrix some pretty hard blows, because she did not tell him of Jones's lying with her when Jones was there, that they might have it face to face, and for being concerned with him, and not because she would not sign the receipt. That the prosecutrix had once lived in Red-lion-court, Fleet-street, which is ten or a dozen doors from the Leg-tavern.</p>

               <p>The prosecutrix wanted to talk about this house alone, and desired me to go with her to the King's-arms or Leg tavern, which I pleased. I went there with her; I called for a pint of wine; the two windows were open that join to the kitchen. All that she has said of this ill usage, is a contrivance of Hunt's and her's, to make a property of me. Please to let the two letters he sent to my wife be read.</p>

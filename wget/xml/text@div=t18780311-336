I am a grocer, of 24, Shepherd Street, Mayfair—Cox was my porter in October and November last, and one morning in November, at 2.30, I was awoke by the police being in possession of the premises—I found the house had been broken open; the safe was open and 1 missed the cashbox, containing watches, rings, and other things, and 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—I also missed nine shillings in copper coin which was in a paper parcel in the office, and a shilling's worth which was on the shelf for change next morning—when Cox was in my service he knew about the management of the shop, and that a spill 2 feet 6 inches long and a box of matches were kept there, and when I found the spill it was only a few inches long—it would only be known to a person who knew the premises.</p>

I am a porter, of 1, Queen's Terrace, Edgware Road—I know Howard—I had just returned from Wales, and on 7th December I went into Shade's public-house, in Nutford Place, and saw Howard there—he had on a new suit of clothes—I asked him if he had been at work—he said said no, and that his aunt had died and left him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him again soon after, and he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, some silver, and coppers—I asked him if he had seen Williams—he said he had let Williams through the grating outside Hall's shop, and they took the contents of the cash-box; but Cox was there and was frightened and went away, and they met him at 3 o'clock next morning; that they took out the contents of the cash-box, broke the box up, and threw it over Park Lane and changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for the clothes he was then wearing; that he had been to Bath and Bristol, and met a gentleman in a train who was going to buy the cheque of him which came from Mr. Hall's, and that the watches were sold down Petticoat Lane—he made those statements on the 6th, 7th, and 9th; and on the 10th I went to Mr. Hall.</p>

I went straight home and they came to me between 6 and 7 on Wednes<lb></lb>day morning and brought the money, and said "There is some for you," and I took it. I asked how he got in; he said "I went through the little room and I took the box and broke it open and threw it into the Green Park." I never saw the contents of the box, and Howard knows that very well.</p>

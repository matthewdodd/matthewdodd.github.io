I saw Smith break open one chest of tea; he then emptied one of the nose bags into the other, and gave it to Sering under the cart, to hold for the tea to run into I suppose, but I ran into our yard to get assistance, came out, and they had moved further down the lane. Hickman, my fellow-servant, followed the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did Smith break the chest with? A. A cross prop.</p>

            . Mayhew came into the yard, and asked whose teas they were which had gone out of the yard; I said it was Clark's cart; but the tea was Mr. Garratt's. I went out; there was a stoppage down the lane. Sering got off the cart till a truck was unloaded; they then moved on to Tower-street, and instead of turning to go to Old Swan, they turned to the left, to Barking churchyard, and staid there a short time; Smith was at the horses' heads - Sering got on the cart; he came down in five or ten minutes - they put a nose bag on the horse. Sering pulled off his hat, put on a leather cap, and got on the tilt; Smith tied the tilt down upon him. An Excise officer came by; I sent him for an officer, who came - Sering was then in the cart, and had broken the tea chest open. We found a nose bag, with 11 b. 2 ozs. of tea in it, with him in the cart - his hand was in the chest. Smith had gone away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to Sering? A. Not till we got him off the cart; I thought him tipsy when he was in our yard - he was fresh, but not so drunk as he pretended. Smith did not appear so tipsy as him; they were both in our yard when the cart was loaded. I cannot say whether there was a cross bar in the cart - Sering was driver of the cart; Smith was his odd man.</p>

            . I am an Excise officer. I got an officer by Hickman's desire, and helped them untie the tilt, and caught Sering in the cart, with his hand in the chest, and the nose bag under him, with tea in it - he was tied under the tilt, inside the cart, laying on his belly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear in an helpless intoxicated state? A. I considered him quite sober; he jumped out of the cart as well as I could.</p>

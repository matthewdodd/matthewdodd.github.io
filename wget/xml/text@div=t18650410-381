Between 9 and 10 o'clock on 17th March, I found a letter and A brown-paper parcel on my desk at the police-station in Tower-street—it contained this revolver—I gave instructions to a constable, and the prisoner Collins was apprehended—I saw him at the station at 2 o'clock the same day—I told him I should apprehend him for being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of pistols in the city—he said that he had sold one to the grocer at the corner by the Windmill—he also said that he had had a row with <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> about five, meaning Campbell—I asked him who <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> was—he said "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Campbell, you know, and these five were found in a dust heap at the back of the Windmill, and <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> had them"—I showed him the pistol that was left at the station—he said it was the one he had sold to Jones the grocer.</p>

I keep the Windmill public-house, in the New-cut Lambeth—I know all the prisoners—they used my house—on Monday, 6th March, I saw Campbell with one of these pistols in his possession—he was showing it—I saw White sometime afterwards join him, and in the course of the day I saw Roberts, or <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, as I call him—I saw Campbell showing him a revolver—Campbell asked me to buy one, but I said I did not want one—next day Campbell left two in my charge—I lent him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them till next morning, when he said he had a customer for them—he returned me the money next morning, and took them away—they were pistols of a similar description to these—I had seen the prisoners almost every day previous to the 6th of March—I had not seen Roberts for weeks before—the others I had seen almost every day—they are living in the street—Campbell and Collins were in and out of my house all the evening of Saturday, 4th March—I have no doubt that Collins was in my house on the 6th; I could not swear it—I did not see any pistols in his charge.</p>

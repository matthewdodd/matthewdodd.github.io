On the 1st of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter; Mrs. Tate called out, "Stop thief! a man has stolen a ham, and gone up that court" - I followed up the court, crossed Tottenham-court-road, and took the prisoner in Russel-street; he threw the ham down under a cart - a butcher took it up, and gave it to the watchman. I saw the prisoner throw it down, and never lost sight of him. - The hams were kept in the door-way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it your custom to keep them there? A. Yes. I had not seen the prisoner's face; mistress was at the shop door; I took him about one hundred yards off; he turned out of the court, but I was close behind him - I did not see him in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your mistress told you a man had taken a ham? A. Yes. I first saw the prisoner about twenty yards from the shop; I kept him in sight, and saw him drop it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission merchant. I know the prisoner—last Tuesday, the 20th of this month, in conse<lb></lb>quence of what was told me, I went to No. 3, Ship-court, Old Bailey, and found my wife and the prisoner there—my wife said to me, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had called me a b—the prisoner told me to sit down, and he would explain it—directly I came into the room, he took a knife from his pocket, and opened it—I saw him do that—when he asked me to sit down, I said I would not sit down with a man with an open pen-knife in his hand—he said, "Sit down, you need not be afraid of me"—I said, "What do you mean by calling me a b—?"—he asked me two or three times to sit down—at last I said I would not, and a struggle took place—a woman tried to take the knife from him—my wife turned every body out of the place, and said, "Now I will have an explanation between you two about calling my husband a b—"—the prisoner said, "Yes, you are a b—, it has been told so to me, and so I believe it—I said, "Then you are another b"—he then put his fist in my face—I avoided his knock—he gave me one, and I gave him another—after I gave him two or three punches, he thrust his pen-knife forward, and said, "This is for your guts"—he cut me an inch and a half in length, and a quarter of an inch deep, and if I had not avoided him a little, I should have been killed on the spot—Mr. Holding, the surgeon, saw me, and I showed him the wound the day after—the prisoner was taken up then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you desert with a large sum of money, and were you not tried by a Court Martial for it in France? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I got my living when I came over here by the money I got for my pay at Portugal—I sold picture-books about the struct—I would sell any thing—I have been in prison, but it was all through a conspiracy against me—it was from the information of the prisoner—I was arrested on the 3rd of June.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the house No. 3, Ship-court, last Tuesday week—Mrs. Grillieres and the prisoner were in the parlour together, and had a dispute—I went and fetched the prosecutor, and when he came into the parlour I walked out—I heard them quarrelling, but what the words were I cannot say—after Mr. Grillieres was in the parlour some time I went in, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of the window—Mr. Grillieres called out, "Oh, God, I am stabbed!"—a watchman came in immediately and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Claricoats, a collector of taxes, residing in Richmond-terrace, Walworth. On Tuesday evening, 14th Oct. last, the prisoner called to pay the property tax—he asked me if I would give him a receipt and change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—my husband had left the receipt with me—I said I had not change, as my husband was out, but I could get change of my neighbour, Mrs. Young—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and sat down in the parlour while I went over to Mrs. Young's with the note—I noticed the name of "Man," or "Mean, St George's-road," on the back of the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I wrote this name of "Church" on it, as the taxes stood in the name of Church, and I wrote my own name also—Mrs. Young gave me the change—I went back to the prisoner, and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., deducting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the taxes, and he went away—on the 21st the note was returned to me, stamped "forged."</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday, 14th Oct., I went to the prisoner, about dusk—I told him I had called for the Queen's taxes—he paid me the house and land tax, which was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he would pay the property tax in one hour from that time—I said if it was not paid I must distrain—I then went home, and left the receipt with my wife—on the 21st I heard of the note being forged, and went that night to the prisoner—I said I had called for the property tax—he said, "I paid your wife with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I said it had come back, branded "forgery"—he went with me to Mrs. Young's, and saw the note there, and said that was the note he had given to my wife, he did not deny it for a moment—he said he would bring the money in three hours, and destroy the note—I said, if the money was forthcoming, that would do—he said at first that he had taken the note at night over the bar—he afterwards said he did not know where he took it from—I went to his house next morning, the 22nd—I met him at the door, coming out—he said he was going to get the money, and he should be at my house at 3 o'clock—he did not come at 3 o'clock—I saw him again next morning, the 23rd, at his house—he promised to send the money up—I do not think I saw him again till the Sunday evening, when I went with sergeant Coppin to a beer</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside at the Endeavour beer house, Penton-street, Walworth. In April last the prisoner came there—he said he had come from the country, and asked me to take him in Aug a lodger—I refused at that time, but next day I consented; he was to pay. me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that arrangement continued for some time—in Aug. last he wished to take the house—I was to have so much from him, and so much from the brewers, and to give up possession—there was no written agreement—the house was to be carried on in bis name, but I allowed him to remain in my licence—I was to remain in the house—he was to pay my taxes, and the brewers were to pay" him back again—I first heard about the forged note on the Tuesday evening, about 9 o'clock—I cannot say the date—it was the same evening as Mr. Claricoats brought the note back—I saw the prisoner go out of the house about 7 o'clock that evening, and I saw no more of him—I spoke to him about the note on the Thursday evening—I cannot tell the date—it was past 12 o'clock, he opened the door to me, and let me in—I said to him, "This is a bad job, Charles, about this note"—he said, "Oh, you need not worry yourself, it is all settled"—I asked him who he took it of—he said he took it of a young man that was in the habit of coming, and who had slept there with him—I told him that had I taken it I should have put his name on the back of it—he saicl he knew his name, but did not know where he lived—I have seen him myself at the house repeatedly previous to that, but not after—I never heard his name men<lb></lb>tioned, though he has been in the house so much—I should know him again—he slept at the house three nights—the prisoner slept in the house till Tuesday, the 28th—he had closed the house on the Saturday night previous—he left on Tuesday morning; the 28th; he bade me good bye, and said he was going away—I said, "Where are you going 1 but don't tell me, for I don't want to know;" and he said, "God knows"—he then left—I remained in the house, and am in it now—I did not open it again; it was let to fresh people, and I remained as a lodger—the prisoner was in the house when Mr. Claricoats called on the Tuesday, but he left directly afterwards—I should say that the endorsement on this note, "George Mean, No. 9, New-street, Borough-road," is the prisoner's writing, as far as my belief goes—I have seen him write, and have received letters from him, and have by those means acquired a knowledge of his handwriting—it is my firm belief that this is his writing, I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I live in Marmaduke-street, Can<lb></lb>non-street-road—on the 29th of April I got drunk and went into the Albion public-house—I saw the two prisoners standing at the bar—I laid my arms on the table and fell asleep about half-past four o'clock—I had a watch in my fob, and about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my pocket—I awoke about half-past nine o'clock—my watch and money were then gone—I saw Thompson there—I made inquiries about my watch—somebody accused Thompson and she began to cry—roy watch has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. About five o'clock that evening I was in the public-house—I saw Thompson go round to the roan who had his head on the table, and was asleep—she searched his pockets, and I saw her take the watch out of his pocket—Williams was standing round, and she said, "I shall have my <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi> in that watch"—they both went out together.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson.</hi> She is taking a false oath; she has been living and sleeping with the prosecutor since we have been here. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is no such thing.</p>

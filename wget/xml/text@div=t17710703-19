I had a five shilling paper of half-pence in my tap-room; I had brought them there to give change; the prisoner and two more came in with glass decanters, and wanted me to purchase some; I found them short of measure, so I would not buy them; they said they must earn their living; after they had taken away the decanters I missed my halfpence; I asked them if they had seen my halfpence; they said they had not; and desired I would send for a friend of mine that had been there, and said he might have taken them out of fun; I sent for him; before he came I found the halfpence in the bottom of the prisoner's coat pocket; he said he took them to play the rogue: The prisoner was, before that, uneasy, and said he wanted to go backwards; I desired him not to go out; he sat down; afterwards he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030020"></xptr> wanted to go out again. Somebody proposed they should stand search; the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and said he would leave them while he went backwards; I examined the prisoner's waistcoat; I felt the outside of the prisoner's coat pocket, and felt the halfpence. I told him he was a bad man to make me send for my friend when he had got the halfpence all the while. I sent for an officer; before he came he took the money out, and said, Here is your halfpence; d - n your halfpence, I was only playing the joke with you; I intended to get a pint of beer of you, and threw the halfpence down; the paper burst, and the halfpence fell about the room. I never saw this man nor the people with him before in my life; he was very sober; though before the justice he pretended to be in liquor; when in custody he offered, if I would make the matter up, to have a meeting, and spend four or five shillings at my house; when I refused that, then he offered to give me a note of 20 l. and I refused it; then he offered 20 l. in money, which I refused.</p>

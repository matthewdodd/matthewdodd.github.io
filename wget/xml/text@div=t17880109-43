               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor; this prisoner and another person came in to take away the dust at half past eight on the 21st of December; I had cleaned my master's shoes and buckles, and set them on the stairs in the back kitchen; the buckles were in the shoes when these men went away with the dust; the prisoner was the last person that went by the back kitchen door, and he shut the door after him, which I desired him not to do, but he did; I thought he was gone up-stairs, but he stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and I presently heard him run up stairs; I was in the front kitchen, and he shut the door of that kitchen upon me; I went and looked on the back kitchen stairs, and missed the buckles out of the shoes; I went out after the prisoner, and found him in a house of Mr. Matthews's, No. 7, North-street, I charged him with taking away the buckles; one of the men was up at the door, and the other was down in the area, and he that was at the door went down to the other and told him, and they both came up stairs together, and I desired him to come to my master's house, and he came very willingly; my master sent for a constable, and he was searched, and nothing was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090076"></xptr>found upon him, nor in the dust-cart; the officer went to the house of Mr. Matthews in North-street, and in searching about, he found the buckles wrapped in a rag, in the corner of Mr. Matthews's cellar, and a shovel-full of dirt thrown over them.</p>
               <p>What became of the other man? - He was discharged at Bow-street.</p>

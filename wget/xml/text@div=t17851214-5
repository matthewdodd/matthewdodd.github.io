               <p>Court. There is one thing that I have observed both you and the last witness have said, that you did not miss them till the 13th, till you counted your sheep? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, if you had so perfect an acquaintance with the faces of all the sheep, I should have thought you might have missed them without counting them; as if a number of men come to a place every day, you might miss two or three without counting them? - We do not so strictly look over them every day as that.</p>
               <p>Now for instance, a captain of a company who sees all his men every day and knows all their faces, will miss four or five of his men without counting them? - I was not constantly with them every day.</p>
               <p>Were you with them between the 6th and the 13th? - Yes I was, but it was towards the dusk of the evening, a lad that we have to assist was with them, a little lad, so that I did not see them much within that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Isaac is your brother-in-law? - Yes, the sheep were in different pens hurdled off, I saw the sheep at Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140015"></xptr> Taylor's, I do not know who took them, I cannot say whether they are the same I saw at the fair, my brother helped to drive them away, I thought I knew them again, I think they were the same by looking at them, as I have been about among them.</p>
               <p>A man who had bred them and tended them would be more likely to know them again than you, would not he? - Very like, Harris asked Layton what the gentleman bid, and he told him nothing, then Layton asked Harris what was the price if he sold them, and he said if he could not get eight shillings apiece he was to go home again.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HARRIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought them of a man, and this man took them to the fair for me, I had them of a young man in the neighbourhood this day five weeks, I know him, he brought them to me to have to the fair, but I was so lame I could not go with the sheep, so I got Layton to sell them for me.</p>
               <p>Who was the man you took them for? - One

            , he lives at Stanwell, I do not know where he is, I had nobody to go for him, Merrick was in custody of the officer and got away.</p>
               <p>Was he taken up on your information? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Harris said he never sent any to Layton to sell, nor he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>How came this other man to be taken up? - This other man went to Layton when he was in the Round-house, and said to Layton, for God's sake do not say where the sheep are gone to, with that I suspected him, and a warrant was sent for to take him up, but they could not find him, he is got off, Harris said he had not them of that man, he said he knew nothing of the sheep.</p>

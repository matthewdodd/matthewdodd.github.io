               <p>I was the man that took the prisoner; I was at work all day, the 5th of July, to assist the cook in the kitchen; I am a servant to Mr. Burden; about half past nine at night, I went to take a walk in the garden, and I put my coat on, and the company were got out of doors by candle light, pitching some silver in a hole; when I went into the garden I see the prisoner come out of the bottom of the garden with these two baskets, one on each side of him; I thought he had got some of the empty bottles that laid about the garden, and that he was going to put them in the bottle warehouse; I stopped to see where he would go with them; I thought they had been empty; and instead of his going to the rack with them, I see him go into the back lane with them, from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go through the house? - No, he did not go into the house at all; he went up the lane, by the highway, into the street, about one hundred yards from the Mermaid, I called to him, when he was going into the street with them, down from my master's premises, and asked him what he had got in the basket? and he gave me no answer; the second time I got up to him, and I said hold of him by the collar, and said that he had got some of my master's property; and he said, no d-mn me, what business have you to stop me? they are none of your's. I brought him down to my master's house, and got him into a room, where the baskets were unpacked; one basket contained ten-bottles of wine of different forts, I cannot say whether there was any spirits; the other contained six knives and forks, four glass salts, and two jelly glasses. They were put into the officer's hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you first take hold of me? - At the top of the lane, going into the highway of the street.</p>

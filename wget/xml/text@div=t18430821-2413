                  </hi>. I live with my father, William Bowden, it Chalk-farm Tavern. I had some fowls and two tame rabbits—Freer had lived with my father as ostler, and left about a month or five weeks ago, to go to live about three hundred yards from our house—the fowl-house was fastened with a latch which could be opened outside by a person who knew how to do it—he had seen me open it—I do not know Kendall—on the 4th of August I fastened up the fowl-house—there were nine fowls and two tame rabbits in it—next morning, about five o'clock, I missed eight fowls and a rabbit, and there was some blood on the ground—I went to the station, and found them—I am quite able to say they were mine.</p>

I was on duty on the bridge leading to Chalk-farm on the night of the 4th of August, about twelve o'clock—I saw the two prisoners coming in a direction from Chalk-farm-—they crossed over, and went down Park-village—each had a bundle—I followed them to Mary-street, Hampstead-road, stopped Freer, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing particular"—I found it contained two fowls and a rabbit—I took him to the station, and left them—they were quite warm, and appeared to have been recently killed—he said he had found them—Kendall was on the opposite side—Barnett took him—I saw him take two fowls from his pocket, and three out of a piece of green baize which he had.</p>

               <p>Q. Presently after did you see Morris and Braid coming up stairs-A. I saw Braid with the poker in his hand; I did not see Morris, but heard his voice. My plate-chest was kept in the back-room up two pair of stairs. I had silver forks, spoons, salt-cellars, and labels in the chest; next morning I found I had lost a considerable quantity of plate, to the value of between 100l. and 200l., among which were the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I was servant ta Mr. Clulow, and had been so for three years. Owen and I were left in the care of the house while my mistress was out. On the 15th of September she and I went to Astley's together, and left the house in the care of the prisoner Dennis, who is my uncle. We both returned at half-past twelve o'clock, and found the house, apparently, as we had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after that did Morris tell you of anything that had happened on the night you went to the Play - A. Yes, a fortnight after the 15th, he told me, in our absence at the Play, he and my uncle had broken open the plate-chest, and I was to ask my uncle what they had taken out-he said they had taken some out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some scheme was laid between you and him, about some future robbery of the house - A. Yes; the next morning we agreed that a false alarm should be given that the house had been robbed; he said there would be no other way of getting over it, than pretending that the house had been broken open. I was to let him in at twelve o'clock at night, to put the house as if it had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of Tuesday the 6th, at what time did you go to bed - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I got up at twelve, and let Morris in, through the area, as he was calling twelve. We went up stairs, brought down the plate-chest, put it on the sofa in the drawing-room, and some blankets, sheets, and a pocket-handkerchief we put some plate into the blanket, and tied it up, to give it the appearance of their being packed up to take away. We also tied up two mirror glasses, put two lights in the drawing-room, one in my master's bed-room, and one in the kitchen. We put a knife, with some bread and cold meat, on the drawing-room table, to appear as if the thieves had been regaling themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a dog - A. Yes; Morris told me to shut it in the scullery, for fear it should bite or bark, which I did. The dog had once bit Morris in the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. All this being done, did you let Morris out - A. Yes, after he had placed a ladder on the wall, to lead up to the balcony of the back drawing-room window, and broken a pane of glass in the window, to appear as if they had entered at the back of the house-we got the ladder out of the back kitchen. I let him out. He was to give a false alarm at half-past two o'clock, which he did, by knocking at the door and springing his rattle; in two or three minutes I let him in. He ran down stairs, opened the back doors, I followed him, and came up stairs with the kitchen poker in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morris tell you to say anything to Owen - A. Yes, he told me to tell her to say that two men came to her bedside with black faces, and threatened to blow out her brains if she stirred or moved. I was taken up when some duplicates of mine were found, and told this story.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You tell it to save yourself from being hung - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are swearing against your uncle - A. I am telling the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any conversation with your uncle-A. Not any.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLULOW re-examined. I saw the dog loose at the bottom of the stairs that night, but did not see it next morning.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS WALLIS. I live next door to the prosecutor. I was alarmed by the knocking, and went to the prosecutor's house. I have heard the account Braid has given of the arrangements that were made, and found every thing as he has said, except the plate being tied up, it lay opon on the blanket when I was there-every thing else is correct.</p>
               <p>EMMA OWEN. I was servant to the prosecutor. I lived one year there. I went to the Play with Braid; we went out about four o'clock and returned about half-past twelve-we left Dennis in the house, and found him there when we came back. We left no person there but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after that did Braid give you any directions about a sham robbery - A. Yes; he said Morris had been speaking to him about the things which had been taken out of the chest, and that I was to say that two men had entered my bed-room, dressed like sailors, with black faces, and pistols in their hands. I told Mrs. Clulow so the night the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Morris about this - A. Yes; the day before the alarm was given I saw him. He said,"Well, cook," I said, "This thing you have been proposing to my fellow-servant I had much rather should not be done." He said, I must be very foolish, for it might be done very easily. I consented to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have now come from the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a patrol of Bow-street. Morris, Braid, and Owen were taken up for this robbery. In consequence of information which I received, on the 15th of October, I went to Chelmsford, and apprehended the prisoner, Dennis. I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Camden-town. I afterwards went with him to the White Hart, public-house, Braid's father was sitting there, and said, to him, "How could you bring my poor boy into such trouble as this?. He then confessed, that he and the watchman, Morris, committed the robbery at Mr. Clulow's, Camden-town, while Joe and his fellow-servant were gone to the Play. He said that he and Morris went all over the house, and opened all the drawers and closets-that at last they came to a box, that Morris got hold of it, found it was very heavy; that

             the nails out of the lock, and said with an oath, "Here is good booty!"-that Morris wanted to take the chest, with the whole of the plate, but he would not agree to that, as he said they would be hung. I said nothing to induce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280041"></xptr>him to confess. After this conversation with his brother, I asked him what plate he had taken? he said, about a dozen silver table-spoons, about a dozen silver forks, five labels, and three salt-cellars with two handles. I asked him what he did with them? he said that next morning he and the watchman went to look for Old Mike, the Jew - They walked for some considerable time, but could not find him. At last, they got into a narrow passage, leading into Whitechapel, and on making inquiry for Old Mike, the man of whom they inquired asked them if they had got anything to sell? he and the watchman said they had, and showed him what they had got, when the Jew they had shewn them to offered 3l. 15s. for the whole-that the watchman refused to take that, and then he gave them 4l. - that the watchman gave him 1l., and that was all he had. He said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you held him out no inducement - A. I did not. He knew I was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he did it from a feeling of contrition - A. When the father said he had brought his boy into trouble, he told this. He did not say he was sorry.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLULOW. My salt-cellars had double handles.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BRAID re-examined. Q. The morning after you returned from the Play did anybody call for your uncle-A. Morris called for him next morning. He went away, and told me he was going to take a letter for Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. After Morris told you what had been done, did you look at the plate-chest - A. Yes, and found the nails had been drawn.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOWSKILL. I live at No. 7, Caroline-street, Camden-town, the prisoner, Morris, lodged with me. I heard of the reported robbery at Mr. Clulow's on the Wednesday morning. On the Sunday afternoon before that, I saw a Jew, called Old Mike, at Morris's apartments, I afterwards saw the same Jew at Bow-street. Braid came in after him, and was with him there - They were altogether in Morris's apartment.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I took Morris into custody. I went and examined the premises, and found nothing to induce me to think they had been broken open-the window was broken. I afterwards took Morris, in consequence of what had happened, about a week after. When I took him he asked me what Joe had said? - (he knew Braid was in custody) - I told him what he had said would be stated before the magistrate. He said he knew bl-dy well who had the plate, that it was the old Jew.</p>
               <p>MORRIS'S Defence. I never said such words to Smith, nor was I ever in the house with Dennis.</p>
               <p>DENNIS'S Defence. I was never up stairs in the house higher than the parlour.</p>

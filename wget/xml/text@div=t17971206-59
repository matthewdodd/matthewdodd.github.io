             sworn. - I was standing at my door; there were three men at work in the warehouse, one of them brought a piece of rope from the middle of the shop, and laid it down by the street-door; after he had laid down the rope, the prisoner was standing outside the door, and he took it up; I followed him about twenty yards, and stopped him; I told him he had stole the rope, I took him by the collar, and he threw the rope down, and then hawled me down; I got up, and took hold of the rope, and called out stop thief, and he was taken. (Produces the rope).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose property that rope is? - A. Yes, Mr. Scofield's.</p>
               <p>Scofield. This is my rope, to the best of my knowledge, I had cut off several fathom the day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Scott was not present when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was the man that took him, with the rope upon him; only my being in another dress, very likely he does not know me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The rope was never in my possession; there were two other soldiers ran past me into the Tower, just before I was taken.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . About twenty minutes after two in the morning on the 16th of June, we detected Spinosoe, a Jew, with a sack of pease on his back: I asked him how he came by the pease? - I don't know. - Where do you come from? - I don't know. - Who employed you? - I don't know. - I said, You must go to the Compter. He said, I am a very honest man: three men came and asked me to carry it, and said they would give me a shilling, and they had his hat; he had none on. In about a quarter of an hour the prisoner and another man came to us; he said the other man's name was Jones: they came from East-Smithfield way, which was quite a different way from that Spinosoe came. When the other man knew they were pease, he said he was a custom-house officer; if they had been worth any thing, he would seize them: then the prisoner and he went away again.</p>

            . I am the master of the barge the pease were worked in; she lay at Queenhithe. On the 16th of last month, my man told me there was a sack missing; and on the 17th the watchman and constable came to Bear-key, and told me they had taken a man with a sack of pease: the sack was Hornblow's. We took Spinosoe before my Lord Mayor; he swore Walters was one of the men that employed him to carry them. My Lord committed him for farther examination. Walters was taken on the Sunday, about eleven in the forenoon, by the description that Spinosoe gave of him. Spinosoe said there were four more concerned.</p>

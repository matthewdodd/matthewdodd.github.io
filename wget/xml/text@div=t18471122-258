               <p>England—there were fourteen 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I put them into a wardrobe in my bed-room, locked it, and put the key into my pocket—I went out next day between eleven and twelve—the prisoner was employed as charwoman that day—I returned between eight and nine at night, the prisoner was still there—about a fortnight afterwards I missed two notes from the wardrobe—I stopped them at the Bank next day—I afterwards accused the prisoner of taking them—she denied it strongly for a long time—I said, "It is no use your denying it, for no one was in the room but you, and I have traced one of the notes to Mr. Gainsford, in the Borough, and you had better own to it—I have since seen the two notes I missed.</p>

I said, "No;" he said, "You are suspected of taking them;" I said, "I did not;" he said, "I shall call a policeman, for you don't seem willing to confess, and I shall have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and take you;" he then said, he would come on Monday, and make me confess more than I was disposed to; I told him; I would confess at the Court; Mrs. King never mentioned the subject to me; the gentleman said, I should be made to confess at the Old Bailey; I denied ever having touched the money; Mrs. King said, "Why are you such a fool Clara, why don't you confess it, think of your children?" she said if I made 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. good to her it should be all secret, and I should hear no more about it; I said, if I sold all I had in my house I would not take it.</p>

               <p>Did you find the locks or any part of them broke? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door locked when you went out? - Yes, it was, and I had the key in my pocket, I tried both the doors when I locked them, to see if they were fast, which I always do, I missed some silver out of the till, four shillings, when I came home I was informed my shop was broke open, and the prisoner was taken to St. James's watch-house; I left a fire and a candle in the parlour, the candle was missing out of the stick, the stick was left, and there was some candle grease about the till, I went out at the parlour door, and locked it, and took the key, and I locked the shop door on the inside; I never saw the prisoner before; I did not commission him nor any one to take care of my shop.</p>

               <p>I came down with the other witness, I called him back, and said I heard somebody in the parlour, and while we went to that door, a man opened the door in the passage and ran away, we then went into the shop, and the prisoner was standing rather behind the door, about a yard within the shop; I asked him how he came there, he said he was left by the master of the shop to take care of it; I asked him to tell me what sort of a man the master of the shop was, but he made no answer to that; the bell that was over the shop door was broke down, so that the other man went without our hearing him; the last witness took the prisoner to St. James's watch-house, the prosecutor returned in about ten minutes, and I took care of the shop till his return.</p>

               <p>The door of the shop was not broke at all? - No, they got in at the parlour door, we found the door open, the scutcheon was broke off the door, but whether that was broke before I do not know, and the lock was picked, and I saw some marks of tallow on the counter.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was the door between the parlour and the shop locked? - No, there is no lock upon it, I forgot to mention the bell that was hung up as an alarm was secured quite down.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. Was the prisoner searched when you took him? - He was not particularly searched.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What money had you left in the till? - There were six or seven shillings, and when I came back there was one shilling and some halfpence left.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, there was an alarm that the gentleman's house was broke open, and I went to see, and they caught hold of me, I was searched all over, even my shoes, and I had not a halfpenny in the world.</p>

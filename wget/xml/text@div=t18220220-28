I stepped back to let them pass, they faced about immediately, and stopped me between the posts, blocking me up between the posts; both put their hands on me, stopped me, and held me while the prisoner laid hold of my seals. I put my hands down and caught the watch, the chain broke, but he got the seals, and the man who was on my right, gave way, for him to go through the posts - he got the seals quite away. I am sure he is the man, it was dark; I turned round, he ran up the middle of the road, calling Stop thief! and kept him in view till he was secured; I have not found them. When I was at the office, I said one turned to the right and the other to the left, the prisoner said,</p>

            . I deal in garden roots, and live in York-street, Commercial-road. On the night of the 9th of February, I was sitting at the corner of York-street with my roots, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw three men running in Marmont-street. I stopped the prisoner, who was the only one that crossed the road, and delivered him to the watchman.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LEWIS. I am foreman to Mr. Macneil, who lives in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital; I was in the counting-house, on the afternoon of the 19th of December, about three o'clock, and saw something go between the carriages, in the front of the shop; I went to the front of the shop, and saw the prisoner with the two cushions under his arm - They were taken out of a landau; he threw them at me, and I secured him. He said he was only looking to see the inside of the carriage, and that I had better let him go, as I was only giving myself trouble, for I could not do any thing with him, as he had not got into the street. I had him secured.</p>

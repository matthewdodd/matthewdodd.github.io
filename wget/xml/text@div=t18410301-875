                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Hutchinson, of Pitfield-street, Hoxton; the prisoner keeps a coffee-shop in the neighbourhood. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the 9th of February, he came and or<lb></lb>dered a pound of butter to be done into four pats—several customers came in, and he said, "You need not wait, but go on serving your customers"—having had notice what had taken place the morning before, I went to the desk at the end of the counter, and had my eye on the prisoner—I saw him take a piece of bacon out of the flat which was standing under the desk, and put it into his apron-pocket—he then went from the flat to the end of the shop—I immediately called my master—I walked up, took hold of his arm, and said, "Clark, you are a d—thief, pull that bacon out of your pocket"—he did so, and handed it over to my master—we let him go home—a policeman came—my master then told me to go and give him in charge—I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the shop. I was called—the shopman stated that the prisoner had stolen a piece of bacon—while I was behind the counter the prisoner handed from underneath his apron this piece of bacon—he said he wished it to be weighed—I said he was a thief, and I would have nothing to do with him—his father came since that, with tears in his eyes, and wished me to serve him, not the prisoner; and after the father pleaded as he had done, I thought I could not do better than serve him—I gave him to understand I was serving the father.</p>

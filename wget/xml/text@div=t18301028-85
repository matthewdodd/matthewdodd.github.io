On the 17th of September, between one and two o'clock, this lead was taken from my shop, during my absence - I came home, and found the prisoner in custody of an officer; the lead was produced, and I am certain it is mine - it was about six feet within the shop, and weighs 40 lbs.; the prisoner is a stranger.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. About two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Warwick-square, and saw through our back door, which is in the square, the prisoner at the gates in Warwick-lane - he was standing there; I walked round, and when I had got round, I saw he had got five or six feet from the shop, and was rolling a piece of lead in his apron - it was a small piece, rolled up; I stopped him just as he was getting out of the shop - I asked what he had got there; he dropped it, without answering - a constable was sent for.</p>

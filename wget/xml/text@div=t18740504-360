I am managing director of the United Club and Hotel Company, Charles Street, St. James's—the prisoner was secre<lb></lb>tary to the company—he had been so since May, 1872—it was part of his duty to bring out accounts before the board and receive cheques, pay them, and reproduce receipts—I recollect a cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being drawn on the 15th October, 1873, for Messrs.

If they do not appear in the agenda-book they did appear in the book of vouchers kept by the prisoner and produced by him to the auditors, by whom they were ticked—those papers have been gummed in and extracted from the book to produce in Court—I have not a distinct recollection of any one of them in particular being produced by the prisoner to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the prisoner.</hi> Mr. Hood had always that voucher-book before him—I had the board's minute-book—I read and he ticked it off—he cannot find it in the agenda-book or in the board's minute-book—the accounts that had to be produced to the board he checked, and another director signed the cheque that had been prepared by the prisoner—it certainly was not customary to draw cheques for bills that did not appear in the usual course on the agenda-book—the bill does not appear on the agenda-book—I cannot tax my memory with any such conduct as having made or caused to be made in the board's minute-book resolutions purporting to have been passed by the whole board of directors, which never had been passed; I never did that I know of—the minute headed "Reduction of interest on mortgage, re-appointment of managing directors," was passed by the board, but it was not entered in the minute-book at the time because the precise wording of it was left to me to prepare, and it would be confirmed at the following meeting—on one occasion I drew a cheque out of the Union Bank with the sanction of the principal director—it was the occasion when a sum of 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken out to obtain possession of jewellery which had been pawned by a customer of our hotel, and which he was going to deposit with the company as security for the payment of a debt he had incurred at the hotel—the company had a deposit account at the Union Bank—at the time the 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out, the company had a deposit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, or two deposits of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—on the 15th October there was a deposit at the bank of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 29th October there was a deposit at the bank of 1.000/.; on the 12th November, 1,000/.; on the 20th November, 1,000/.; on the 10th December, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 14th January it had disappeared altogether—the cheque for 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I believe I have in <hi rend="italic">my pocket</hi>, was drawn on the 20th October, 1873—at that time there was a deposit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out of the current account—no cheque has been drawn for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Shaper &amp; Co., but there is an account from Mr. Shaper for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I drew no invoice out for Shaper &amp; Co.—there was a memorandum drawn out in my handwriting—some six months ago Mr. Shaper borrowed some money <hi rend="italic">from</hi> me, and he gave <hi rend="italic">rue</hi> the security of 50 dozen of wine, and as I had no other police to put it I put it in the hotel cellars; it remained there for some</p>

               <p>months—Mr. Shaper was then unable to pay the money, and he gave me the liberty to consume the wine, and so repay myself out of the proceeds—Mr. Shaper has now given me the bill, which is the amount to be paid to him in order that he may refund the money to me—some of the trades-people who have furnished accounts have done work for me, but that work has not been included in the Hotel Company's bill; most distinctly not.</p>

It is customary to exchange cheques for the club on the endorsement of the secretary—it would not have been paid had it not been for that—that we consider cancels the crossing—it is usual for the secretary to put his initials and pay cash, and that has not been done—he has got his name twice on the cheque, both on the front and the back.</p>

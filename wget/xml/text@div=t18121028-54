            . I live in Well-street, Oxford-street. On the 22d of September, about nine o'clock at night, I was coming up Holborn; I was quite sober. In Holborn, at the end of Bow-street, I slipped down. There had been a deal of wet, and I daubed myself; the two prisoners came up to me. I had never seen them before in my life; one of them said, you have been in the mud. I said I had. They said they had a room at a public-house just by, and asked me to go with them, and if I would give them something to drink, they would clean me. I went with them; they took me to a private house. It was quite dark. I went up a few stairs. There was no person in the room but myself, and the two women. When they got me in the room, they asked me to take my coat and waistcoat off. I took my handkerchief off my neck, and emptied my waistcoat pocket into my handkerchief of some halfpence, a knife or two, and a spectacle case; then I gave them the waistcoat to clean. I had nothing in my coat pocket, but a handkerchief. They wanted to have my small-clothes off. I was not willing. I pulled my shoes off. I then took my watch out, and put into my handkerchief; I then took out four one's, and a five pound bank note, and nineteen shillings in silver. I put that into my handkerchief; as soon as I had done that, they did not want my small-clothes, they wanted me to send for something to drink. I took out a eighteen-penny-piece to send for something to drink. Ghrimes went for something to drink. They drank, and I drank once. She brought some gin in a half pint pot, and a pot of beer. I drank once of the pot of beer; as soon as I had done that, I was knocked on the bed. I cannot say who struck me; Ghrimes had hold of my feet. They took my handkerchief away; and as they went away, they took the candle. I could not find my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told them that you were lame - A. They could see that they could hardly get me along.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you round any of your property since - A. Not a farthing of it. I remained in the room, I could neither find shoes, hat, or coat. I pulled the clothes off the bed, and covered myself as well as I could, and remained there till the morning, Ghrimes came to the top of the stairs. I knew her voice. She came in the dark; she was a good while at the door. She wanted me to let her in. She said, she could get my property again if I would go with her. The landlord came to me in the morning, and took me to his house. I was robbed on the Tuesday, on Thursday I saw Bowyer at Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her again - A. Yes, I knew her to be one of the two women that robbed me. She was committed; the other, Ghrimes, was taken on Thursday night. I saw her at the watch-house on Thursday night. They never delivered up any of my property.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper and constable of the parish. Bowyer was brought to the watch-house by Mr. Hawkins, and in her defence, she implicated Ghrimes. Ghrimes was brought to me the next night; and when Ghrimes was brought to the watch-house, I sent for Lewin. There were a number of people in the watch-house. As soon as Lewin came in, he went to Ghrimes, and accused her of being the other person. Lewin was perfectly certain of the persons of both of them.</p>
               <p>Bowyer's Defence. About half after ten o'clock, me and a young woman were coming up Holborn, that good man fell in the mud; he was very much intoxicated. He told us, if we would go home with him, he would give us some money for us to wash him; he pulled off his coat, waistcoat, and breeches. He gave us money for drink. I brought gin three times, and changed different pieces of money; one in a room at a time, he said was enough, he gave me two shillings to go out. I went out, and did not return till the next day.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. What she says is wrong, they had one half pint of gin, and a pot of beer, that is all. Lewin was perfectly sober the next morning, when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Ghrimes' Defence. I saw him come in the wine-vaults. I was standing in the wine-vaults, he was very much intoxicated in liquor. I never saw any more of the gentleman until I saw him on Thursday night.</p>

On 10th July, about 2.45, in the morning, I heard screams in Devonshire Street—I saw the prisoner in the street—he had a knife in his hand, and he was bleeding from the chest—he gave me the knife, which I produced in the last case—he said "I have stabbed my wife, and myself three times; I don't care for myself; but I hope she will get over it; God forgive me"—the knife was closed when he gave it me; but it had marks of blood on it—I took him to the hospital.</p>

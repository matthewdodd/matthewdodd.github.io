            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 1st of January I saw the prisoners before the Magistrate at Ilford, under examination, and had some conversation with both of them: I saw them in the lock-up room, before they went into the Magistrate's presence, and asked Potter where he got a handkerchief which I took off his neck - he said he had bought it at Deptford several months ago; I found a pair of ancle shoes on his feet - I took them off, and he said he bought them at Deptford, and had had them some months; I said nothing more to him then - I looked into Ralph's hat, and found a handkerchief, which I took from him, and asked where he got it; he said Potter gave it to him - Potter was present, and made no reply to it; I then took a pair of shoes off Ralph's feet, and asked him where he got them - he said they were made abroad - that he had them when on board a ship; I returned them to him, and Palmer afterwards took them from him - I believe those produced to be the same; I have no doubt of it - I asked where they lived; they both said they lived at Deptford - I received a letter that day, and showed it to the prisoners, about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, at the lock-up room at Lambeth-street; I showed it to Ralph, and asked him if he had written a letter to Mary Berry - he said No, he could not write himself, but he and Potter had got one written when they were in Barking prison; Potter was in the lock-up-room, and he was at the door - I cannot say whether Potter could hear our conversation; I showed 
               <persName id="t18310407-2-person115">Ralph</persName>
             the letter - he said that both his and Potter's names were to it: I had received it from Miller, the governor of Barking gaol. (Letter read.)</p>

               <p>MRS. BERRY, - I am sorry to inform you that on Friday last, as we were coming towards home, the patrol took us up, and got us committed to Barking gaol for another hearing on Saturday week; I will be very much obliged to you if you will send us some tobacco - we shall be glad if you will come and see us, and bring Charles' discharge; I hope you will not neglect to come as quick as possible, for we are very unhappy at this time - we had our two copper-strippers with us, and they want to say that they are housebreaking tools, until a man came and told them what the use of them were; then we were remanded for a fortnight, to have another hearing, or else they were going to commit us for three months, under the Vagrant Act. So no more at present, from yours, Cus. POTTER and GEO. RALPH.</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street office. I was at Barking gaol on Friday, the 28th of January, and saw the prisoner Ralph in a private-room, belonging to Mr. Miller, the governor; I was sent there by Mr. Walker, the Magistrate - when Ralph was brought before me, I told him I came down because I heard he wished to make some disclosure; Mr. Miller said that he(Miller) had received some information about some burglaries being committed - I then asked Ralph whether he was willing to make any disclosure to me - I told him who I was; he at first said No; he then said,</p>
               <p>"I have told Mr. Miller all I wish to say;" Mr. Miller said, "Have you any objection to tell this person what you said to me?" he replied, "I have no objection to tell him what I have stated to you;" I then told him that I held out no threat or promise to him, but whatever he chose to mention I would take down, and I took it down as he related it - here is the paper; I have had it in my possession ever since - (reads.)</p>

               <p>"On the following Friday we all met at Smith's house, crossed over the water at Deptford, to the Isle of Dogs; we stopped at two or three public-houses and had some beer and gin, which Smith paid for - we went to Bromley; we got over a gentleman's garden wall - the wall was very high at the top of the garden, we got over the pales; we got over another, to the back of the house - Smith broke a pane of glass and undid the door; Potter and myself then entered - we went through the washhouse into a room, and took a woman's bonnet and an umbrella; in a cupboard in the same room, we took two table-spoons, about eight or ten tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, an old tea-caddy, two or three table-cloths, six cotton handkerchiefs, a copper teakettle, an eye-glass, two half quartern loaves, two eye-glasses,(spectacles) a cake, half a cheese, a small riding whip, a basket, a little glass, hanging in the summer-house, a fustian jacket, and a beaver hat - we got back to Deptford on Sunday morning; I think it was Smith took the property home - on Monday, Smith gave me 1l. 3s., and asked me if I was satisfied - I said Yes; Potter had the same - Smith said, 'I shall have three pairs of boots, and you and Potter may have the other boots, shoes, and handkerchiefs,' we had part of them on when taken from us in the gaol; at this time Smith's wife came in with a lot of duplicates, and threw them in the fire."</p>

I produce a pair of boots and an umbrella, which I took in pawn of a young woman named Harrington, whom I knew - she lived in King-street, Deptford; she said she pawned them for a person named Smith - the umbrella was pawned on the 8th of December, and the boots on the 24th - I did not take in the umbrella, and do not know who pawned it; I have known Harrington several years - she always gave her residence in King-street; I know her mother-in-law lives in King-street - her name is Harrington; here is a tea-caddy produced by Lea - I took that in from a person of the name of Smith, on the 29th of November; I gave it to Prendergass to take before the Magistrates, with a pair of spectacles, in the name of Berry - I did not take them in- I produce the duplicate which was attached to them; I made a further advance on the boots on the 30th of December, to Harrington.</p>

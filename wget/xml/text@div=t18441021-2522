                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliff. On the 17th of Oct. the prisoner came to my house, between six and seven in the morn<lb></lb>ing, ing, he called for half a pint of fourpenny ale, and gave me a shilling in pay<lb></lb>ment—I gave him change, and put the shilling into the till—there was no other shilling there—soon after I went to the till, looked at the shilling, and saw it was bad—I bent it, put it into my pocket, and kept it there till the evening—I then put it into the till—I afterwards took it out again, and never lost sight of it till the next morning—I ultimately gave it to Hunnisett, the police<lb></lb>man—the next morning the prisoner came again, about the same time he had some ale, and gave me a shilling—I put it into my mouth, and, finding that was bad also, I went round and laid hold of him—I said I suspected him, be<lb></lb>cause he passed a shilling so easily on me before—he said I must be mistaken, he had not been in the house before—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge, and gave the two shillings to the policeman.</p>

On the 7th of June I heard Mr. Malo's house was demolishing; I came by with another person whose name is Fitchet, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; the window frames were then out; the prisoner was throwing the furniture out. Fitchet asked me if I knew the prisoner? I said yes, he was a man who carried muffins about the streets.</p>
               <p>Was there a great mob there? - Yes; but I saw no-body in that room but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, very well; he was throwing the furniture out; that which would not come out whole he broke; when I had stood about a minute I saw him bring a bottle to the window; he

             the cork with his teeth and drank a part or the whole of what was in it, and cried out to the mob huzza! then he threw the bottle out and went back to his work to throwing out the furniture; when he had thrown all out, he began to pull down the wainscoting and throw that out likewise.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull any wainscoting down? - I saw him pull it down on the left hand side of the room, after he had thrown some out he brought another bottle to the window, he

             the cork and drank part and then threw the rest out. I stood there in the whole about twenty minutes, after he had thrown the second bottle out he went to work again, and I went away.</p>

               <p>During the time you was there did the prisoner appear to be active? - No man, if he had been paid ever so much for his labour, could work so hard as he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether it was for justice or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280099"></xptr> for the sake of the reward that that man apprehended me?</p>
               <p>Fitchet. I saw him there on the 7th, I never saw him again till last Saturday week in the morning, then I was called off my stand, being a watchman, to take him. I never went a yard to look after him.</p>
               <p>Did you or not go to a magistrate to inform against him? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg your lordship would inspect into this man's character; he bears a very bad character indeed.</p>
               <p>How came you to take up the prisoner? - I was called by Fitchet the watchman to take him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has brought two men to swear against me for the sake of the reward. When they came before the magistrate they could not swear to me.</p>

               <p>To whom did Williams give the information? - He took him and carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Who gave the first information against the prisoner upon which he was taken up? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Pump-court, Moor-lane. I am a carver and gilder.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Malo's house? - I do, I was there at the time the mob were burning and destroying the house.</p>
               <p>What time was you there? - About half after one o'clock, or between one and three in the afternoon. Williams and I were walking together up Moorfields; when we came to Mr. Malo's house, I said to Williams, Do you know that man in the one-pair-of stairs room? He answered yes. Says I he is the man who cries muffins, and uses the Hoy in Red-Cross street. After that I saw the prisoner throwing some furniture out of the room into the street. He took a bottle up and drank out of it, and then threw the bottle into the street.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing else? - He pulled off his wig, a two curled wig, and cried, huzza! Then he began pulling down the wainscoting and drank out of a bottle once more, but whether he threw the bottle out I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Which window did you see him at? - The window next Bethlam.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am sure he is, I knew him before.</p>
               <p>How many people were gathered there? - An hundred or more, I do not know how many.</p>
               <p>You are sure you singled out this man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time were there any other people in the house? - There were three charity boys, in the next room; I saw only the prisoner in that room.</p>
               <p>Were there a great number in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were they doing? - The prisoner was throwing the things out at the window, and they were burning them.</p>
               <p>Where was you standing? - In Moorfields, in the pathway of the upper quarter. The fire had been lighted some time before we came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you bring up Joe Hill before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Fitchet. He heard the words which I mentioned to the prisoner, but he having but one eye, which was dim; he could not swear to the parties.</p>

               <p>I keep a public-house. I have known him two months; he is an honest, industrious, harmless man. At the time they say he was at the fire I know he was not out of my house an hour. I saw him go out and I saw him come in again.</p>
               <p>What time of day was it that you saw him go out? - Between twelve and one o'clock; he returned soon after one; I know he was not gone an hour.</p>
               <p>How far do you live from the prosecutor? - Pretty near a quarter of a mile. I keep a public-house the corner of Three Dagger court, in Fore-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say he went out between twelve and one, how came you to observe the time? - He said he heard there was a riot, and he would go and see what was the matter; he came in again, I asked what was going forward; he said shocking work. He staid but a short time. When he returned I understood that then he went to bed. He lives up the court.</p>

That meeting with a Watchman, he inform'd him, and they went towards them, the Gentleman beginning to cry out; and they perceiving the Watchman and himself coming towards them, they ran away. That the Prisoner fell down, and the Clothes were taken up near the Place where he was, and he was apprehended, but he could not say which of the two had the Clothes; but the other ran up the Hill, and got clear off, carrying with him the Gentleman's Sword.</p>

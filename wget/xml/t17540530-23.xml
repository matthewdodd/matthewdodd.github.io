            . I knew nothing of the loss of these sheets, till the pawnbroker brought them to our house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brewin. I live at the corner of Hosier-Lane, Snow-Hill, and there were two sheets taken in by my journeymanone by my apprentice, and one I took myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring any to you?</p>
               <p>Brewin. Yes, my Lord; on the tenth of May she brought one. which I stopt. The sheet produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. It is, and this is the mark which I know it by (which was an S ); she brought another this day three weeks, which I stopt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend any money upon it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. No, my Lord, but she brought me one on the sixth of May, which I took of her, and lent two shillings on it. That also is here. It was produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300017"></xptr>Q. Look at that.</p>
               <p>Brewin. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. That sheet is marked with an S, and there is none but what belongs to my ward that is marked with an S.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gundry. Is that sheet part of the linnen that was under your care?</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brewin. You say you stopt it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. I did, and sent my servant up to the hospitalhaving heard that many had been lost from thence. Whilst he was gone, my spouse, as she was looking out of the windowsaw Mr. Timmswho is clerk to the hospital; upon which I stept out and called him: he came back, and left the beadle in care of the woman. We went before Alderman Alexander, and he committed her to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gundry. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. She was as a watch in the hospital to sit up of nights.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this sheet belongs to your ward?</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. Yes, and belongs to the governors of the hospital.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

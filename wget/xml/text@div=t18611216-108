                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 328). On 13th November, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, from information given to me, I went, in com<lb></lb>pany with the last witness, to the Queen's theatre—I there saw the two prisoners; they were sitting together in the gallery—I told the female that she was charged with changing a cheque at Mr. Arkrill's, which had been stolen from a lady—she said, "I do not know what you mean; I have not seen any cheque"—I told her she must come with me to the station—on the way she told me she would say all about it—she said she met with a gentleman in Upper Fitzroy-street, Fitzroy-square, who gave her the cheque to get cashed, and he would give her half a sovereign—she took it to Mr. Arkrill's, and got change, and he only gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for her trouble—she did not know him—he was a stranger—on the next afternoon, from information I received from Hamilton, I stopped at the police-court, and about half-past 3 o'clock the male prisoner came there—I saw him outside the court, went up to him, and asked what he was doing there—he said he had come to see Charlotte—I told him I should apprehend him for being concerned with another in stealing a porte-monnaie; that I had got a description of him, and he must go with me to the station—he said, "I will go with you, but I will see Charlotte first," and as I was laying hold of him by the coat he knocked my arm up, and stooped down and ran away as fast as he could—I followed him for about three-quarters of a mile—he was stopped by a gentleman, and I laid hold of him—he said, "All right; I will go with you now, but there is another one in it; if I had had ten yards more start of you, you would not have caught me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 7, Upper Fitzroy-street, Euston-road—this cheque was brought to my surgery on 9th November, by a young woman bearing a resemblance to the female prisoner, but I cannot be positive it was her—I did not give her the cheque with a request that she should get it changed for me—she said she came from a patient of mine, of the name of Simmonds, a laundress, and would I oblige her with change for the cheque—I said I had not change, but probably she would get it at the baker's opposite—I never advised her to go to Mr. Arkrill, or mentioned his name—some time afterwards the witness Warner came to me with the cheque, and asked if I knew it—I said no, I did not know the cheque, but the person the girl said she came from I did know, and she was a respectable woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Flicker's Defence.</hi> I can prove that I was at home at the time of the robbery, working with my father at his business. I went to the Queen's theatre along with this girl, and as I was seen in her company I went down to ask her what she was locked up for. She would not tell me, Next day I went to see if I could hear her trial, and the policeman took me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Beltz's Defence.</hi> I an not guilty of knowing the note was stolen; I am only guilty of changing it.

               <p>his mother, and a few friends came down to see me as well as him. The following week no witness was there; when we came up the second time the policeman said, "I will put you away if I can," and the third week he brings up this old man to swear he saw this young man running with a note in his hand. It is very strange and unlikely that a thief would stop to pick a note out from a lot of money; and if he ran past him quickly it is not likely he should see him so distinctly as to know him again in a different dress at the end of three weeks. My mother can prove that I was indoors all the Saturday till half-past 7 in the evening.</p>

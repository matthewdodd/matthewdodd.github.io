                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Stinton, as linen-dra<lb></lb>pers and mercers, carrying on business in Vere-street, Oxford-street—in Oct. last, the prisoner Simons was in our service, and had been so for about two years and a half—she was saleswoman in the clock department—we make up good from silk, satins, and other materials—it was her duty to cut out those things for the purpose of their being made up—by those means she had access to our general property—we took stock on 20th Feb. last, and then found a large deficiency—we had no suspicion of Simon then—on Tuesday, 19th Oct., in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Brown, one of our assistants, I called Simons into the hosiery-department, where Brown was engaged, and told her I wished to see a dozen pairs of cotton stockings that had been taken from that department a few days previous—she told me she had had none—I sent for Brown, and told him that she denied having had any stockings from that department—he told her he was positive he had given her the stockings—she said, "Oh, yes, I remem<lb></lb>ber them; but I brought them back to the department"—he said he was perfectly satisfied they had never been returned—I then asked her who she brought them back to—she said she did not know, she laid them on the counter—I then told her that I wished to see six pairs of white silk stockings that she had taken from the same department—she stated that she had them to get marked, and that she brought them back to the department—I told her that I was afraid she had been robbing us to a very large amount, and that she was a very bad girl—I was then given to understand that she had taken some property to a Miss Rourke's, and I went there with Mr. Brown—I did not take Simons—she was not then in custody—I found some of my property at Miss Rourke's, which Brown brought back—in consequence of what I discovered in going to Miss Rourke's, I gave Simons in charge—she was searched at the station—I was not present—her boxes were afterwards examined by Alison, the constable, who took her into custody—on searching her boxes I found other articles, which I claimed—she had previously told me that some portion of the stocking she had taken would be found in her boxes, the others she had given to a woman who had the care of her child—that was after I had returned from Miss Rourke's, but before she was given in charge—she had before that begged that I would look over it, in cones<lb></lb>quence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220128"></xptr>
               <p>of her child—I told her I would not—I saw Alison take from her box some letters, and this piece of paper produced, bearing the name of "P. D. Hickman, Esq., 18, Lincoln's-inn Fields, Holborn"—after we had been before the Magistrate at Marylebone Police-court, I went to 33, Welbeck-street, where one of Simons's sisters lived—I then went at 18, Lincoln's-inn Fields, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening—up to that time I had no knowledge that I should find any of my property there—the housekeeper opened the door—I inquired for Mr. Hickman, and was told that he was not at home—I did not leave my name or any message—the female prisoner had then been remanded—I went to Mr. Hickman's again, about half-past ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, with Alison, the constable, and a servant from 33, Welbeck-street—I saw the housekeeper again, but did not see Mr. Hickman—I inquired if they knew a person of the name of Simons, or Simmons—I left my name and address on that occasion, and a message that Ann Simons had been robbing us to a very large amount—I believe that was all I said on that occasion—I did not say I would call again—there was another examination before the Magistrate on the Wednesday—I was at<lb></lb>tended by my attorney, Mr. Lloyd—Mr. Hickman was not there—a Mr. Wathen attended as Simons's attorney—I now know that Mr. Wathen is Mr. Hickman's attorney—Mr. Hickman himself told me so—I went to Mr. Hick<lb></lb>man's chambers again on the Thursday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock—I went with him—I had before that been at the Police-office on that same Thursday morning, and was introduced to Mr. Hickman there, by Mr. Wathen—he told me there was a large quantity of goods that he wished to give up to us, which he had no doubt belonged to us; that he had forced the drawers that morning, and found them—we then called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and myself, Alison, and Mr. Hickman, went to Mr. Hickman's cham<lb></lb>bers—Mr. Wathen did not go—in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, Mr. Hickman told me that the first time he met Ann Simons was in Holles-street, about two years ago, that he afterwards wrote to her and made an appointment with her, and that he had known her since that time—he told me he had paid off a mortgage for her father which had cost him 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and altogether he had paid 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her father—I told him I was surprised to hear that she had a father alive, as she had always given me to understand that she had no father living—he said that she had, and he believed him to be very well connected—I asked him if he was aware she had had a child—he said he was not, that his firm belief was that he had her to himself—when we got to Lincoln's-inn Fields he took us up stairs into his apartments himself, and pointed out the goods, which were in two large bundles on the floor—he pointed to the drawers, and said they had been taken out of those drawers—they were drawers in a wardrobe in the bed-room—there were two bed-rooms—he said Simons had slept at his chambers on the Saturday night previous—he did not say with whom—I asked him if he was aware she was in our employment—he said he was, that she frequently came down there of an evening, and that he allowed her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day for <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire—I asked him if he was not very much surprised at receiving such an immense quantity of goods from a young woman, knowing that she was in a situation—he said that she had always told him that she had paid for them, that she had a salary of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and that her perquisites made it 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—her salary was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a years, and I should say her perquisites were not more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the whole time she was with us—she boarded and lodged in the house—I told Mr. Hickman the salary she had, and he seemed very much surprised—I then recognized a waistcoat that Mr. Hickman was wearing—it has been taken possession of—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said she gave it him—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220129"></xptr>
               <p>asked if he had had any others—he said, yes, he had—I recognised it by the material, and told him I had no doubt that the stuff was stolen from our shop—he said he had no doubt it, that Ann Simons brought it to him, and told him that she had got it from Marshall and Stinton's, that it was a rem<lb></lb>nant and cost very little—that was the first he mentioned to me about any pre<lb></lb>sents; he said she gave it to him—I then asked him if he had any more, and he said he had eleven other waistcoats from the prisoner Simons, which were made up—they were not produced on that occasion—he pointed out a great many things in the room as having been received from her as presents—an easy chair, a bronze dog, a cigar-case, a very handsome plant on a pedestal, and a gold chain—those were the principal things that he pointed out at that time—he afterwards pointed out other things—a list was made of the things he pointed out (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I did not make it out, but I have no doubt this is a correct list of the things he said he had received as presents from her—there was a bird-cage and some birds, a flower-pedestal, a glass-case, some pocket-handkerchiefs; I believe he said eighteen—he produced them—they were cambric, and unmarked—there was a gentleman's short sable boa, a lady's silk dress, and some chair-covers, I do not know how many—he represented the silk dress as being a present from Simons to one of the servants—there were some table-covers, a crimson velvet cushion, and a chintz bed furniture lined with yellow—(<hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER,</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time you ever saw Mr. Hickman was on Thursday, 21st Oct.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came with Mr. Wathen to the station-house—I think it was about half-past ten or eleven o'clock—Simons was not then at the station—I was sent for, and found Mr. Hickman there—Mr. Stinton fetched me—Alison and I were at the house in Welbeck-street—we went from there to the station—Mr. Wathen was there with Mr. Hickman—we went afterwards to Lincoln's-inn Fields in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Alison, I, and Mr. Hickman, were all three inside—part of the conversation I have repeated was while we were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, before we arrived at Lincoln's-inn Fields—it was not while in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that I put any question to Mr. Hickman about giving the girl money—there was a conversation about the father—I do not recollect that I asked him any question about money—I do not recollect how he came to tell me about giving the father money—I have no recollection of what led to that conversation—on arriving at Lincoln's-inn Fields, one of the servants opened the door—to the best of my recollection it was the same person that had opened the door when I was there before—we proceeded up stairs immediately, and went into the sitting-room first—the bed-room opens into the sitting-room—the door of the bed-room is about in the middle of the room, I think—I should say a person could not come in at the door of the sitting-room, and pass into the bed-room, without being seen by a person sitting at the table in the sitting-room—you cannot get into the bed-room without going through the sitting-room—the table was exactly opposite the bed-room door—it would, of course, depend very much upon what part of the table the person was sitting at—we passed from the sitting-room into the bed-room—the housekeeper, Mrs. Burdon, was present—we found one bundle in one room, and one in the other, one in each bed-room—there are two bed-room—the chest of drawers and wardrobe of which I have spoken, were in the first or front bed-room—one bundle was in that room, another in the back bed-room—there was a bed in each room—Mr. Hickman took me there for the purpose of seeing the things which he said had been takes out of the drawers—I did not notice that he had the waistcoat on when he came to the station-house, but he had no opportunity of changing his dress before I noticed it—he did not point the waistcoat out to me—I recognised it, and said to him, "The material of the waistcoat which you now have on came from our house"—he said, "Yes, it was a present from her," and that she said it was a remnant from Marshall and Stinton's, and it cost very little—the price of it is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—it was not a remnant—I do not know how much it would take to make a waistcoat—it might be sold at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—we consider them remnants when they are not of a dress length—the price would depend on the length—it might be one, or five yards—if it were two yards long, we should offer it at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard; that would be the lowest price for that material—I should think there is about three quarters of a yard in a waistcoat; that would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the boxes—(<hi rend="italic">pointing to them</hi>)—this one was locked—I did not see a strap and seal to the other—the things which were in the bundles have been put into these boxes—the things produced were found either in the boxes or the bundles—these brown waistcoats are made of what we call Tassore silk—it is an Indian silk—there are eleven made of that stuff—it is half-a-crown a yard—it would take about a yard to make a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that you had some conversation with Mr. Hickman, about giving Ann Simons money; was not the question you put to him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184711220133"></xptr>
               <p>whether he gave her much money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put that question to him in his room, and he said he did not give her much money—he afterwards stated that he gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for her <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-hire every night she came—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect whether he repeated in the room what he and previously stated in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with respect to the mortgage, or the money he had paid for her father—he might have done so—did not understand that he had ever seen her father—when I called on the Tuesday night I did not leave my name or my business—I called again on the Wednesday, at half-past ten o'clock—Mr. Hickman was from home—I stated what my business was, and about an hour and a half or two hours after, Mr. Wathen called on me—Mr. Hickman did not tell me when I was at his room on the Thursday, that some of the things were at the wash—some things that were said to have been at the wash were afterwards delivered to Inspector Tedman—I should say my observation as to whether he was not surprised at receiving such presents from a girl in Simons's situation, was not made with reference to the things he said she had presented to him—I should say it was made both before and after he had pointed out the presents—he made the observation in the bed-room, after we had taken possession of our stock, and likewise in the sitting-room afterwards—it was made in both rooms—he had pointed out the things received as presents when I made the observation—the bird-cages, birds, plant, cigar case, the bronze dog, and the watch and chain, are not my property—these cambric handkerchiefs are 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—I believe there are eighteen of them—the two pieces of velvet, which he said he had not had made up because he did not like them, were about a yard and a half each, and worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I also found a brown velvet waistcoat made up, which he said she had given him, that is bout the same value—there is about a yard and a quarter in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe that Mr. Hickman gave you every facility for searching every part of his rooms, and assisted you in discovering whatever property there might have been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; he requested me and the officer, on a subsequent occasion, to search every part of his rooms, to ascertain whether there was any other property of ours that had not been produced—I said it was quite unnecessary—I believe that was on the Monday after—I had a glass of wine with him on the Thursday—I do not recollect just as I was going, his calling me back, and saying, "Why, you have forgotten to look in her work-box"—be did not point it out to me—the workbox had been examined long before that—I swear he did not call my attention to it, and say I had omitted to search it—I swear we had examined the box before—he did not say so to any one else in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it that Mr. Snellgrove would have any interest in the losses? Just explain the arrangement at which he is with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has a fixed salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and when we take our stock and balance our books, he has the option of taking 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, or one-eighth of the profits—it is usual to give mangers an interest in effecting good sales, for the purpose of increasing the profits of their principals—if the profits do not amount to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year at one-eighth, then he receives no additional sum beyond the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the profits of the year amounted to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would then only receive the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—persons in our establishment were allowed to purchase goods at cost price—they used formerly to purchase of any of the young men, but during the last nine months, if any person in our employment purchased any goods, it could only be with the approbation of Mr. Snellgrove—formerly a bill used to be made out for them, and it was stamped by the</p>

               <p>clerk at the desk with a stamp which we use as a receipt-stamp—while Simons was in our serviced I was not aware that she had a father living—I have since found out that she has—he keeps a small inn at Gumley, in Leicestershire.</p>

                  </hi> I am in partnership with Mr. Marshall, and have been a member of the firm since its commencement, which is about ten years—neither I or Mr. Marshall reside at the house of business—I live at Cricklewood, beyond Kilburn—the female policeman was taken into custody, on Tuesday, 19th Oct., in consequence of a communication made to Mr. Marshall—she was called into the shop, and some questions were put to her—after she had answered those questions she was taken into custody, and taken to the station—after that the officer returned, and went up stairs with Mr. Marshall and myself, and examined her boxes—one box was locked, and the other unlocked—I saw the things taken out of both the boxes—there were some letters found in one of them—the policeman took them out—this envelope was found among the other things in the box—I did not attend at the police-court on the first occasion, I think that was on the Tuesday—Mr. Wathen called on the Wednesday; I saw him—he called again on the Thursday, and on that occasion I saw Mr. Hickman at the door in company with Mr. Wathen—he remained at the door while Mr. Wathen came in and spoke to me—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I then accompanied Mr. Wathen and Mr. Hickman to the Police-court—on the way, I asked Mr. Hickman if he knew anything of the prisoner Simons having a child—he said he did not believe that she had one, or that he did not know—I first heard of her having a child from herself, on the morning of the robbery—I had never heard it before from anybody—she said it in the shop—no one was present but myself and her; Mr. Marshall had gone out after some of the things—he had not put any question to her before that—I think he did when he came back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What led to her stating that she had a child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said to her, "Miss Simons, I always thought you had some property"—she said, "No; I have none beyond 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week (I do not know which), which is for the support of my child"—I did not make any observation on that; I only expressed my surprise—I made some exclamation, but what it was I do not know—I was perfectly surprised at it.</p>

               <p>a few things, and was in our debt—I think she only had one transaction, after I engaged Simons, I sued her for that money—I do not know what has become of her—it did not then occur to me that it would be prudent to in<lb></lb>quire still farther about Simons, inasmuch as Simons herself said we had better not trust Mrs. Cole—she did not say she was not trustworthy; she said I had better not trust her—that was about a month after Simons was in our house—it did not then occur to me that it would be prudent to inquire still further about Simons—I was present when Simons was first accused, when she was questioned about some stockings, and when she was given into custody—I should say half an hour elapsed between her first being accused and her being given into custody—she staid in the shop in the interval—I was at the desk, and she was close to it—I came away from the desk—I do not know that I was standing by her for any length of time—she was standing there—I do not remember that I stood beside her—I will not swear I did not—I was at the desk, and she came and stood at the door, if I remember right—I went up stairs—I did not meet her on the stairs—I went up stairs because I wanted to prevent her going up—I did not talk to her on the stairs—I went up after her to prevent her going into her bedroom, because whilst my part<lb></lb>ner was out he did not wish her to go up stairs, or to have any communication with her boxes—I went up stairs, to prevent her going to her boxes—I did not follow her into her bedroom—she did not go into her bedroom—I lost sight of her, and I believe she turned into the water-closet, but I cannot say—I came down again, when I found she was not in her bedroom—I should think I was not away from the shop a minute—I did not see her return to the shop, but she was down in the shop when I got there—I had looked in at the door of her bedrooms, which was open, and seen that she was not there.</p>

S." on it—I had seen that for some time standing under the bed—the day Mr. Marshall came, Mr. Hickman took it out—I very seldom cleaned the room, my servant did—I did not call Mr. Hickman's attention to it—I think he pulled it out on the Thursday morning—it was locked, and was forced open by the policeman—it was found to contain silks, and a variety of things—the outer door of the house was always closed on Sunday—there is a back staircase—Miss Simons only went up that on one occasion that I recollect—I showed her up—this black box was brought to the chambers on Sunday, 3rd or 4th Oct.—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man bring it as far as the door—Mr. Hickman was out of town at the time—my servant, Riley, I believe, took it up stairs—I afterwards saw it under the bed—Mr. Hickman dined at his chambers occasionally—he was very punctual and regular in his payments for anything which he had, he never seemed to want money; and, with the exception of his acquaintance with Miss Simons, he was correct and regular in his conduct and habits—after 19th Oct., when Elizabeth Simons came, Mr. Hickman always sent for me, or one of the servants, before he went out of a morning, to say where he was going, and where he might be sent for—he desired me to let anybody that came, search everywhere, whether he was at home or not—he first gave me those orders on the Wednesday evening, after Mr. Marshall had called—he waited at home till ten o'clock next morning, for the purpose of seeing anybody that might call—his usual time for going out was nine o'clock—not a single thing was disturbed in the chambers, or removed, before Mr. Marshall and the policeman came on the 21st—I do not know of anything having been at any time removed from the chambers by Mr. Hickman since I have been housekeeper there—I was pre<lb></lb>sent the greater part of the time When Mr. Marshall and the officer were looking at the things—I saw Mr. Hickman fetch the work-box, I cannot tell where from—the officer had a bunch of keys with him, and he opened the work-box with one of them—they merely opened it; but Mr. Hickman wished them to look further, and they saw some lace—I did not see any of the other keys on that bunch tried to any drawer or trunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say she brought parcels with her at different times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she always asked who was up stairs when she came—I have sometimes told her that there were friends of Mr. Hickman's with him—I have twice carried parcels to the back part of the house by her orders, when I believe gentlemen were up stairs—you can get into the bedroom by the back stairs—when I have taken up things for her the back way, I have placed them on the bed, or on the drawers in the bed-room—the back stairs lead into the back bedroom, and you can get from there into Mr. Hickman's bedroom—if you go up the front stairs, you must go through the sitting-room to get to the bedroom—you pass in at one door and turn into the other directly—I could pass from the sitting-room door into the bedroom without Mr. Hickman seeing me—he always sat with his back to the door, and his face to the fire-place—I did not usually take a candle with me into the bedroom when Miss Simons came—I went in the dark, and the candle usually stood on the drawers—she used to go into the bedroom imme<lb></lb>diately, sometimes she would shake hands with Mr. Hickman, and pass into the bedroom, and sometimes she would pass in without taking any notice of him—I have not seen the parcels put away anywhere—on one occasions I saw her put some diapers away—I have heard her call the drawers "my drawers"—I never saw them open, except on one occasion, and then she opened them herself with a bunch of keys—I have several times tried the drawers, if I have seen anything about, or if I have seen a piece of ribbon hanging out, and found them locked—the boxes were kept under the bed when I saw them—the box that I carried up I laid in the bedroom, and I saw it there next morning—I afterwards saw it under the bed, I think the same evening, I will not positively say—I cleaned out the room, swept under the bed, and saw the boxes from time to time—I do not know who placed the box I carried up under the bed—Mr. Hickman's wardrobe and drawers were always open—no things were removed from the chambers after 19th Oct., except those taken by Mr. Marshall and the officer—Mr. Hickman left orders with me that nothing was to be moved, and if anybody came they were to have free access to every part of the room to search where they liked—Miss Simons' sister occasionally came to see her on Sundays, during Mr. Hickman's absence—she has come the first thing in the morning, about ten o'clock, and her sisters would call sometimes in the evening—they did not dine there very often—they did occasionally, in Mr. Hickman's absence—she had everything that was ordered for her, and I obeyed her as if she had been the mistress of the apart<lb></lb>ments,</p>

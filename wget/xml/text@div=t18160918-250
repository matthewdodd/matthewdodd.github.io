               <p>JOSEPH COTTERELL. At about eleven o'clock at night I was in <placeName id="t18160918-250-crimeloc1272">Long-lane</placeName>

Another man at the same time came behind, and I was shoved down in the horseway; then the prisoner was pretending to help me up, and he held me until the watch was gone. As soon as I got up, I charged him with being one, and he immediately set off; I pursued him, and found him in the custody of a watchman.</p>

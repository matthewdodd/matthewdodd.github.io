I'll rip them open"—I missed them for a minute and then saw a policeman stop the prisoner, and I went home with the prosecutrix—when we got there the prisoner was there drunk and sitting in a chair with a young woman I used to know—I had padlocked the door, but the lock was broken off—I called a policeman and gave him into custody—the next evening the prisoner came to my room and broke it open again; Foley was then with me—he kicked Hannah Foley in the eye—I went for assistance—on the Saturday, about 12.10 at midnight, I was going to my room I saw a light, the prisoner was there—Foley had not come home then—the prisoner threatened me with a shovel—I came away.</p>

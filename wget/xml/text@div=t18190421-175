I made a communication to Armstrong and Gleed, and it was arranged that I should meet the prisoner at the Crown, public-house, in High-street, St. Giles's, at a quarter before twelve o'clock; I told them this, and they took me to the Three Compasses public-house, in Holborn, and searched me.

I said half a score; she said she had got only seven. I asked her how much they came to? she said 2 s. 7 1/2 d. - she gave them to me, and I gave her the money. I put my hand to my bonnet, as a signal to the officers, who came and took her into custody. They searched me immediately, and found the seven shillings she had sold me. I was taken away in one coach, and she in another.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, and have been so forty years. On the 25th of February I met Willis at the corner of Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, my son and Gleed were with me. We took Willis to the Three Compasses, she was searched; I saw my son mark her money. We sent her on and watched her. I saw her join the prisoner by St. Giles's church; they returned into Compton-street - the prisoner went into a house, and staid a few minutes, Willis remained in the street. The prisoner came out, and they joined company. When they had walked about twenty yards the signal was given - we took the prisoner into custody, and found the money we had marked on her.</p>

            . I am officer. I searched Willis, and found two shillings, three sixpences, and ten-pence in copper on her, at the Three Compasses. I marked the silver - she had no other money about her. I told her when she met the prisoner and had dealt with her, to put her hand to her bonnet as a signal. We followed her to St. Giles's church; the prisoner met her; they returned to Compton-street - the prisoner went into a shop, and Willis staid at the door - the prisoner came out, and they walked about twenty yards together. I saw Willis give something to the prisoner, who immediately returned something to her. Willis gave the signal; I ran and caught hold of her right hand - she dropped some silver, which Gleed picked up; it fell through my hand. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" Gleed took a parcel from her - it contained counterfeit shillings. I asked her where she got them from? she said from the prisoner - the prisoner said she knew nothing about them. She would not tell me where she lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you take Willis's boots off - A. No, I felt them, and am certain she did not put her hand to them, as I had her in sight all the while.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the money fall from the prisoner, and picked it up; I also took the shillings from Willis's right hand, and produce them - it is the same money I saw Armstrong mark. I picked up two shillings, a sixpence, and one penny. Willis was never out of my sight - it was impossible for anybody to hand any thing to her.</p>

            , the witness; I recognized the whalebone to be my own manufactory immediately I saw it; it is my own work, I knew it directly I saw it. On seeing this whalebone I went to Thomas Martin, the defendant, and told him I wished him to go with me to the Mansion-house on particular business; I did not tell him for what; at that time I supposed him a respectable man, and did not wish to hurt his feelings; he told me he would go with me in about a quarter of an hour, that I think were his words, he was then at the King and Queen in Distaff-lane. He then went over into his warehouse, and told me he would be with me presently; he then came back again, and told me he would come to the Mansion-house in about a quarter of an hour. Finding him shuffling in that way I desired him to come directly; I went to the Mansion-house, and staid there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and not finding him there I came back again; I then went to the public-house, and not finding him there I went back again to the Mansion-house, and met with Mr. Read, the officer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200079"></xptr>and I brought Mr. Read with me to take him into custody, and he took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing in your presence at the time he was taken into custody? - A. In the presence of James Martyn he did; he owned having sold that bone to James Martyn.</p>

            ? - A. I do, I have known him about eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business he follows? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you met him frequently during that time? - A. Frequently, almost daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting him on any occasion, and when, at the King and Queen public-house? - A. I do perfectly well, on the 13th of November, in Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the house you used? - A. Yes, and the house the defendant used. I went in the afternoon to take a pint of porter as usual; he said, I have got some whalebone to sell, and he immediately took a stick from underneath the bench from where he was sitting, and asked me to look at it; it was twisted up; I immediately took and untwisted the stick; he said, what is it worth; I said, is it all like this, as he said he had a parcel to sell, about half a hundred weight; he said he was no great judge of it himself; I told him if it was all like that, it might be worth a guinea, but I could not exactly tell till I had seen the bulk; he said it was too late that evening to see the bulk, but I might see it the next day at his warehouse opposite. Accordingly I thought no more of it that evening; nor the next day, but I met him the next day, and he said, now you may see the whalebone; I went with him over to the warehouse, and when I first saw it I was convinced of the circumstance; I said, is here fifty-six pounds; he put it in the scale, and it exactly weighed forty-eight pounds; I said, here is not so much as you said there was, it is not worth that, I will give you a pound-note for it; he said, I will take that, and I gave him a pound note for it; he said, if you will go over the way to the public-house with me, I will treat you with a shilling's worth of punch, and we went over the way; he said, I hope you will get plenty of money by it, for I have got plenty, I have got a seven-shilling piece by it; I told him I could not tell what I might get by it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that you bought? - A. I suppose, fairly between the manufacturer and the dealer, about three pounds. I immediately went to the first person in the trade to inquire about it, and afterwards found out Mr. Delvar, and went to him the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to offer so little value for it? - A. I supposed it to be some part of my own stock till I took the outside strings off, as I have had various porters with me at times; when I found it was not my own stock, I thought it my duty to let the trade know. I then communicated to Mr. Delvar what had passed; I told him he had better come and see the whalebone, and there he said it was his whalebone, when he came the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing the defendant say any thing at all about this, in respect of purchasing it? - A. I do not recollect that he said how he came by it; at the Mansion-house he said he bought it for me, he told the Lord-Mayor so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember, at the first time of his shewing it to you, whether he said he had bought some, or whether he could buy it? - A. He said he had it at the warehouse opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether there was any other person present? - A. There were neighbours; there were one or two; in fact, there was a gentleman who does business for me - my attorney was there.</p>
               <p>Q. The worst man in the world to shew such a thing before him, is it possible - there might be some of your neighbours there when you paid him? - A. I do not recollect that there were.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that before the Lord-Mayor he said he had bought it at a sale? - A. I would not have said it without he did; he did say he bought it at a sale, and that it was an article that he did not understand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Delvar.) Q. Is that your property? - A. I believe that to be my property, I have no doubt, I will identify it; in the first place, it is my own manufactory, and worked by my own hands; in the next place, when I saw this bone at Mr. James Martyn's warehouse, I knew it to be mine by the length; every half dozen and every half pound I have divided, so that there is an equal quantity of sticks to every half dozen; I have not the least hesitation whatever in saying, they are my property.</p>

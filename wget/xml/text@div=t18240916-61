A little girl came to the room door, and put a bottle of gin in - we were in a room on the second floor. She poured out a glass, and said</p>
               <p>"I hope you are going to pay for this." I said</p>

               <p>"No, you pay." I however paid, and drank a glass; she immediately knocked and shoved me down, and threw herself upon my right arm; she directly called to the other prisoner, whom I found in the room when we first went up - she was at the window; she said</p>
               <p>"Sally, come here;" she came, and threw herself on my left arm, so that both my arms were secured. Davis then snatched my watch from me. I had a guard-chain round my neck, and felt the tug - it was broken, and the watch gone - she broke the chain forcibly. M'Carty immediately got off me. I seized Davis by the left hand, and said</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me;" she said</p>
               <p>"Go and hang<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160026"></xptr>yourself, I have not." I said</p>
               <p>"There is the watch in your hand now," and snatched at it, but she put her hand behind her, and gave it to M'Carty, who ran down stairs with it. Davis gave me a shove, got from me, ran down, and I after her, calling Stop thief! and saw them both turn into the next house; a watchman who lived next door came down to me. I went to Hatton-garden, and informed Read - they were taken in about a month on another charge. I had been looking for them during that time, with the officer, but could not find them. I was certain of them immediately I saw them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went with this woman at the first invitation - A. It happened so; I drank a little porter at dinner, and nothing after except a glass of gin in the room. I swear that I was perfectly sober. She said there were some young men drinking up stairs, which made the invitation stronger - I found nobody drinking there - she said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, they will be here presently." I went there to drink, and for no other purpose. I thought her a bad woman, but said to myself</p>

               <p>"If there are any men there, very likely I shall be safer." I was not playing with them at all.</p>

            . I lodge next door to this house, and am a watchman of St. Bride's. I was getting up to go on duty, and heard a running down stairs, flew to the window, and saw the two prisoners come out of Day's house, and run into the passage where I live; the prosecutor went down the court, and they went out of the house, into No. 12. I went to the window again before I finished dressing, and saw M'Carty going up the court, and the prosecutor running after her: he caught her just at the narrow part of the court - she said,</p>
               <p>"You - I have nothing belonging to you," and pushed him away. I went to finish dressing and they were gone. I told Ayton that I knew them both - he appeared to me a little in liquor, but very little indeed. I have known the prisoners living in this court three or four years. I never saw them afterwards till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a common house - A. Yes. The prosecutor was rather fresh; it was hardly observable. They were absent for a month - I used to see them going in and out daily before.</p>

I knew the prisoner for a fortnight before Christmas, I took her home, and she lived with me as my wife till the 13th of Feb.—I missed her that day, and found some pictures, ornaments, and furniture broken—I had not quarrelled with her—some water was thrown on the bed, and I missed the articles stated—I met her in Shoreditch, and asked her for the duplicates—she said she knew nothing of them, and I ought to be ashamed of myself for accusing her of the robbery—I went that day to the house of Coleman, in Collingwood-street, Bethnal-green, and found her box there, and in it I found a work-box, and several things in it—she had used the box at my house previous to leaving—I found a gold pin and handkerchief at Paul's—that was under her control when living with me, but the had no right to them—she did not wear the pin—she did not use the work-box—she was allowed to do as she pleased with the things—nothing but the work-box belonged to a woman—she was servant where I was foreman, and I took her home.</p>

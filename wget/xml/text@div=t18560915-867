                  </hi>. I was in the police, but have lately received a pension. On 10th Sept. I went to ft house in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields, with some officers—on entering the street, there were a great number of persons, who called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jack I Jack Sheppard!</hi> here comes the b——<hi rend="italic">coppers!"</hi>—I saw Brown and Langdon put their heads out of the first floor windows of the house, without their hate or coats on—I rushed up stairs, followed by other officers—I saw Langdon leave Brown's room and rush into an adjoining room, and the door was closed—I broke the room door open, and saw Langdon come from a table, and sit down on a chair by the door—the drawer of that table was open, and in it I found two files, with white metal in their teeth, at if they had been recently used—on the table was this little pot, containing sand and water—we secured these articles, and put them into Brown's room—at the time I was forcing the door open, I saw Brown (I believe it was) run up stairs—he had nothing on but his trowsers and shirt and boots—on entering the room, I saw Sullivan sitting near the window, which was open, and two shillings were near her, bearing date 1819—this was the front room, out of the window of which I had seen the men put their heads—I then proceeded up stairs, where I had seen the man run—I found Brown in bed—I called him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and shook him two or three times—I said, "It is nonsense for you to play these tricks with me; you are not asleep, I know"—(this was in the room over the room I had seen them look out of; it looked on to the parapet of the house)—Brown said, "I have been asleep, so help me God; I have been up all night"—I asked him to get up, he refused, and I was compelled to pull him out of bed—at that time he put on his trowsers and boots, and became very violent—after he had been secured he attempted to butt me with his head, and stamped with all his force on our toes—after he was secured he said, "If you will let me dress myself I will go with you quietly"—I said, "That we will do, you have no clothes here"—he said, "No, they are down stairs"—I took him down to the room where I had seen him put his head out of the window, and in that room, on a bed, was his coat and handkerchief, and waistcoat and cap—I addressed Sullivan, and said, "What have you got about you?—she said, "Nothing, Sir, but good money"—I said, "I must have it," and she took from her pocket this bag, which contains 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, consisting of one half-crown, florins, shillings, and one sixpence—the half crown bears the date of 1818, which corresponds with the half crown which will be produced—we secured the prisoners, and took them to the station—there was a mob outside, of I suppose, 2,000 persons—they were very riotous, and began to unharness the horse from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that we were taking the prisoners to the station in.</p>

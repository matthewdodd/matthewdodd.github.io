                  </hi> I have one partner—we are engineers, at Southwark Bridge-road—the prisoner was in our employ occasionally—I missed a quan<lb></lb>tity of property from our premises from time to time, but not lately—this pipe, produced by the officer, is gas-fittings for devices for illuminations—it is drilled with holes—here is where the small pieces have been detached—it is ours—other persons make this article, but I can identify it as made on my premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, M</hi> 9.) On 22nd Feb. I went into a marine-store dealer's shop in Montague-street, Southwark—I saw the prisoner and another man there—the other man made off—I saw a quantity of pipe in the scale—I asked the prisoner where he lived—he said in Spitalfields, and he brought the pipe from home—I said, "Could you not find a marine-store dealer's nearer than this?"—he said, "I was coming this way, whether or not"—I took him, and found in his pockets a quantity more pipe—I found on him his employer's card—I went there, and the pipe was identified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met a man, who said, "Come with me; I have some copper pipe to sell;" I went with him; the marine-store dealer would not buy it; the man said to me, "Put it in your pocket, and come along;" and just as we were coming out, the officer stopped us; plenty more makers make the same as this.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character; and a witness engaged to employ him.)</p>

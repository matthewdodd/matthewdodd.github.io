                  </hi>. I am the widow of a lieutenant in the Navy; I reside in Clifton-road, Old Kent-road. On 22nd March I got into an omnibus in the Kent-road, for the purpose of going, to London—on the way the prisoner got into the omnibus about a quarter of an hour after we started—she took her seat next me on the right band side—at the time I got into the omnibus my purse was in my pocket—I am sure it was safe at that time—my pocket was on the right side, under my dress—the money to pay the</p>

               <p>omnibus was in my glove, in my left hand—I had no occasion to go to my purse between the time of my entering the omnibus and leaving it—I took the other money from my pocket when I entered the omnibus, because I would not take the purse out—on the way from the Kent-road to the City while I sat by the side of the prisoner, I felt a pull at my dress—I looked round immediately, and her band was between us—I then put my hand to my pocket outside, took my glove off, and put my hand inside—at that time my purse was safe, and I am able to say the check was there—I felt it at one end of the purse—I alighted opposite the Royal Exchange—the prisoner got out at the same time, and as we were crossing, she came to me and said, "It is a dangerous crossing, ma'am, take care"—this was the crossing over to the Royal Exchange—I said, "Yes," and crossed—she came to me again when I was opposite the door of the Bank near the Royal Exchange—she said she wanted a Bayswater omnibus—I am not aware that anything induced her to say that—she had not a baby with her then as she has now—I stopped, and put my hand outside my dress, and not feeling my purse, I took my glove off, felt inside, and my purse was gone—I then put my hand on the prisoner's arm, and said to her, "I have lost my purse, and you have taken it; you are the only person that has been near me"—she said, "If you think that I have your purse, you had better go back to the omnibus.

                  </hi>. I was at that time in the City police; I am not so now.

               <p>there is in that passage a door leading to the tavern—it is all connected together—the King's Head Tavern extends to the Poultry, and this is a kind of lobby to it—it is a private passage—there is a door leading to the street, which was open—I took her about three yards from the door, about midway of the passage—none of the crowd followed us in—I believe the passage is about four or five feet wide, sufficient for two persons to pass together—I remained there about three minutes—the prosecutrix charged the prisoner with having taken a purse containing a sovereign and a check for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the prisoner to the station—I was not present when she was searched—she gave the name of Mary Smith, No. 24, Addington-street—I went there, and they knew no such name as Mary Smith.</p>

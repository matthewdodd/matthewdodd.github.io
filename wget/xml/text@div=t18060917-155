On the 31st of July he came to my shop, he said he wanted a ream of writing demy, and a hundred of writing pens.</p>
               <p>Q. On his own account. - A. No, he had been in the employ of Mr. Imber, a long time; I understood Mr. Imber, the auctioneer, had sent him; I let him have them and he took them, with him, he debtored Mr. Imber for them, I believed at that time he came from Mr. Imber.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this paper. - A. Two pound, fifteen shillings, and eight pence. On the 5th of August he came again for a ream of fools cap and an account book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say on whose account he came for them. - A. I cannot say that he said he came for them on account of Mr. Imber, he always when he came mentioned Mr. Imber's name. On the 5th of August he asked me to give him a black lead pencil, as Mr. Imber was so very close a man, he only allowed so many in such a length of time, and he had cut his up. On the 6th of August he came for a ream of thick post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the second parcel with him. - A. He did, and he took the ream of thick post.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Mr. Imber from the 31st of July to August. - A. I had not till some time in the middle of August; it was discovered then, Mr. Imber struck off these articles in his account; about a week or a few days after that I saw the prisoner, he passed my door, I told him to walk in, he did, I accused him of taking these articles, I told him what Mr. Imber said, that he had no authority from Mr. Imber to get those articles; the prisoner was exceeding sorry that he was detected, and requested me to let him go home to his wife and family, said he would return in the morning; he said he had left Mr. Imber's service in March, he hoped I would not take any steps in it, and he would pay me for the articles; I sent for a constable and charged him.</p>

             sworn. Q. Are you an auctioneer in Hatton Garden. - A. I am, I have been a customer to Mr. Grace for several years; the prisoner left my service to the best of my knowledge the 28th of last March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him on the 31st of July last for any order of paper and pens. - A. Certainly not, nor did I receive them. I never sent him on the 5th of August for any fools cap paper or account book, I never gave him any authority for this book or paper.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 6th of August was he authorised by you to receive any thick post paper. - A. No, nor did I receive them, nor know any thing of it till I received Mr. Grace's bill; I never saw him from the time of his quitting my service till he was taken into custody.</p>

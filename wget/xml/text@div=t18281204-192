            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I received this ear-ring and box from Mr. Griffiths; I know both the prisoners perfectly well; they were lumpers employed in stowing ships-holds - they were not employed in the East India Docks to my knowledge; they were first taken in the mouth of September, and brought to the Thames Police, where they were discharged for want of evidence; I took Dillon again on the 15th of November - I told him it was for the jewellery: he said it was a had job; I took Mahoney on the 16th of November - I told him it was for the box of jewellery; he said he saw me the night previous, when I was going to the watch-house with Dillon, and that if I had not apprehended him, he should have come forward at the examination on the Monday; from the list which I received from their employer, (Mr. Wright.) it appears the prisoners were employed as lumpers in the early part of September, but I do not know it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When in September were the men taken first? A.

             - she is no relation of the prisoners, as far as I know, but we all live close together, and sometimes work together; when I went on board the Alfred I was sent on the orlop-deck - after we finished there I was ordered down into the hold; after that I was ordered by an officer, named Hill, to stand in the main-hatchway, and hand the cargo to these men; after we had the cargo down the main-batchway, the officer said there was no more to go down but that in the orlop-deck, and that he did not want that stowed, but put on one side- he called me on the orlop-deck to lend a hand to get it done; I did not see anything of a small box put into the hold, but when I was sent on the orlop-deck Mahoney called me down into the hold again, where he was taking the things down - he ordered me to stand in his place and take the things down, and said he had other work to do; the prisoners both went away - there was a heap of things in the way, and I called to them to come and take them out of my way; they did not come - I looked over the ship's still and saw the box broken open, and Mahoney and Dillon taking the things and putting them into their pockets; I did not see them break the box, but I saw the box which was broken between them - I ran towards them, and asked them what they were doing; Mahoney said he would knock me down if I did not turn back and do my work, and I did turn back to my work in taking the things off the orlopdeck - at the same time Dillon said, "There is nothing in the box but papers;" I did not tell any body that I had seen this - I did not think any thing of it, when the man said there was nothing in it but papers; there was nobody in the hold at the time, but the two prisoners and me - I did not tell the Magistrates of this the first time I was taken, because I was afraid of my life, but the second time I did; after we had taken those things off the orlop-deck, I went over the ship's side, and there was a paper, which I took up and put into my bosom; I did not open it, but I came and took my jacket off, and threw the paper down on the bed - I did not know what was in it, and never saw it open; my wife took it up and put it into her pocket - I never saw it opened, nor ever saw this pair of ear-rings till I was at the Thames Police; the next day my wife opened the paper, and found the ear-rings in it - I did not see any body open it; I cannot say that the paper I saw at the Police-office was the one my wife put into her pocket - I am no scholar, and never took notice; I never knew there was any thing in it - I saw Mahoney in prison; I was the first man that was taken - Dillon and Mahoney were taken afterwards, and a man named Driscoll; while I was in prison with Mahoney I was complaining of being in prison, which had never happened to me, nor to any body belonging to me before, and Mahoney said it was all right, since the owner did not swear to it - I said he must have a deal of money, as I heard he was in it, and I must pay for it - he said he did not make of his own share more than 9l., and Dillon had the most part of the goods; Dillon was not within hearing at this time, as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You are an Irishman, I suppose? A. Yes, I am, and a Catholic; I made the sign of the cross when I was sworn; the woman I call my wife, was here just now - she has had four of five children by me; she is not my wife, but a woman I live with - I have not a wife in Ireland; I never was married in Ireland; I will not swear that - I will not swear any thing; I never was married in my life; I do swear that- I was born near Ross, I came from Kinsale - I was only living there three days, and swear I was never married there; I sometimes put papers into my pocket, when I see them lying about - not always in my bosom; it did not strike me there was any bulk in the paper, if I had known that, I would not have picked it up; I have been living with Johanab Mahoney these eight years; she picked the paper up off the bed - I did not know what was in it; she did not open it in my presence - she never told what was in it before she pawned it, and then she said there was an ear-ring in it; when she told me it was an ear-ring she pawned, I did not give information; I could not have any share of the money, for the article was stopped - I was taken up nine or ten days afterterwards; the reason I did not tell at first, was because I was afraid of my life - but I did tell at last; I had no jewellery in my possession, that I swear - I know a man named

               <p>JOHANNAH MAHONEY. I live in the same house with Hayes - I generally go by the name of Johannah Hayes; when Andrew Hayes came home, between six and seven o'clock on that night, he took his jacket off, and threw it on the bed - I was making the bed, and picked up a bit of paper, with a pair of ear-rings in it; I did not open it till the next morning, about nine o'clock - Hayes was not present when I opened it; I was going to Mrs. Wood's, to fetch a garment; I took the ear-rings, and shewed them to Mrs. Wood - she said they were only gilt, and offered me 10s. and a new gown for them; I said I would not take it - I would go to a Justice, and accordingly I did go to a Justice - I went of my own accord; they stopped the rings, but I went and told the Justice; I took them to the pawnbroker's on the same day I opened them, as I did not understand them; I had not seen Hayes before I took them to be pawned, and he had no opportunity of knowing what they were - he was on board a Scotch steam-boat; I told the Justice I picked them up by Shadwell Church; that was not true - I picked them off the bed, but I was not sworn to it; I said this, because some of the party came and told me to say so - I was kept in prison four days, and then I was to be in prison a fortnight, or pay 1l., and Mahoney paid the 1l. to set me at liberty: I did not see him pay it; (I was locked up,) but he told me he paid it; I was taken up again in about a week, but I was at home from the Wednesday to the next Tuesday; I have not been in prison ever since - I gave this account before the Magistrate after I had been set at liberty, and examined again - the ear-rings were kept by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Hayes ever tell you whether he was married in Ireland? A.No; I never asked him - I went with him for ten months to Ireland - I was living with him there; I never was in prison in my life before, except one night in the watch-house, on account of a woman who sent a waist-buckle for me to pawn; I was taken one night, but she owned to it; I shewed these ear-rings to Mrs. Wood, the pawnbroker, and asked her what they were - I did not offer to pawn them; I swear I did not offer to pawn them; she did not say that I offered to pawn them, but her first-cousin did; the Magistrate committed me, but I never offered to pawn them - I never offered them to

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WOOD OGILVIE. Q. Did this woman offer to pawn these articles with you? A. yes, she did; she came into the shop first, and said"William." and then went into one of the side boxes, and asked if I would lend her 10s. upon these ear-rings -Miss Wood was in the shop, and I think she heard what she asked; I shewed them to Miss Wood - she desired me to stop her; she asked her where she got them - she said she found them by a lamp-post, near Shadwell church; there was no one with her when she came into the shop, that I know of; they are gold ear-rings; I had heard of the robbery.</p>

            . My husband keeps a shop in High-street, Poplar, and sells shells and curiosities of different kinds. A man walked into my house, one Tuesday evening, between seven and eight o'clock - I cannot tell what time it was, nor how long before, I was examined; I should know the man again; I saw him before the Justice, but I do not see him here - he brought three, or four, or five pairs of ear-rings to sell; I did not buy them - I looked at a chain and a pair, which I said if he liked to leave he might, as my husband was not at home, but he did not leave them; he brushed them off the counter where they say into his hat, and went off in a very great hurry; no man came in with him, but when he went away I looked out, and I think I saw two or three men, but I do not know whether they were with him.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he supposed it was about the box taken from the Alfred? A. Yes - the reason I let him go was, because he lived near me, and I have known him these seven years.</p>

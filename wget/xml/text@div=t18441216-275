                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich. In the evening of the 5th of Dec. I was at the Bee Hive beer-shop—I there met the prisoner—I called for a pot of ale, and took out a sixpence, and paid for it—I put my purse again into my pocket—I took a glass of ale, and drank it—the prisoner said, "Give me a glass"—I said, "Yes, take it," which she did, and went out, saying she would soon come back, which she did, and drank again—I saw her put her hand over the third glass I had poured out to drink—whether she put anything into it I do not know, but I drank it, and soon after I became quite insensible, and when I came to myself I had lost my purse, containing the ring and money—I then went to a lodging-house—I was going to pay for the bed, and the prisoner said, "Your bed is paid for"—I went up stairs, and then I missed my purse—I said, "You have got my purse"—she denied it—I said, "I shall give you in charge"—I was going out—she called me back, and said, "If you will not give me in charge I will give you the purse"—she gave it me, with 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I missed the ring and the money stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was at the Bee Hive; he was sitting with two Artillery men; we drank the pot of ale, and then went to the Coach and Horses, and he paid for two quarterns of gin; I left him there talking; I had a half-crown; I went, and gave it to a young woman to take care of; I went back to him; we went to the Bee Hive, and he called for a pot of fourpenny ale; he laid his head in my lap, and went to sleep till half-past eleven o'clock; I called him up, and said it was time to go home; I said, "You know I have got your purse;" we went home, and went up stairs; he then said, "<hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>, I know I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse;" I said, "You can<lb></lb>not expect to have that now, having spent money;" he counted the money, and there was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it; he said, "There is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short, and where is the ring?" I said, "I have seen no ring;" he said, "If you don't give it me I will give you in charge;" I said, "I would give it you, but I know nothing of the ring;" the policeman took me down to the cage, and in going he said, "Have you any money?" I said, "I had half-a-crown, and I gave it to Sarah Williams to take care of;" I asked my landlord to lend me half-a-crown; the prosecutor gave me the purse to take care of.</p>

I took the prisoner—she said she had not taken the ring—she did not deny the money at first; I got her outside the door—she asked the landlord to lend her half-a-crown, Which he did—when she got a little further she said, "There was another half-crown I gave to Sarah Williams; go to her, she will give it you"—the prosecutor was then recovered, and sober—the prisoner did not say that be gave her the purse till the next day.</p>

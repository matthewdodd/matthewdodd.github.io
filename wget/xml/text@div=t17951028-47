On the twenty fourth of September I had some carpenters employed; one of the carpenters looking for a wedge at the top of the horse stall, found a parcel of soap laying there; there was no sugar there; that was on Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there? - To the amount of about three pounds nearly. He made my brother and apprentice acquainted with it that night. On the morning following I was told of it; the apprentice went over to the stable, and he brought the soap into the shop to let me see it. I desired him to replace the soap, to see whether there would be any more taken to it to the same place; it was yellow soap, and on Saturday morning there was some white mottled soap with it. I had occasion to go out of town on Sunday morning, and desired the prisoner to have the horse ready at eight o'clock; and I had some suspicion that he would take away the soap on Sunday morning, and desired my brother and the apprentice to watch that he did not take it away from the time of his getting up to the time that I went out of town. Before I went out, I went over to the stable, and charged him with having things belonging to me secreted in the stable. I said to him, you have some things secretly concealed belonging to me. I did not know of any sugar. I told him I would have a constable, and take him before a magistrate, if he did not tell me what he had concealed there.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what he said after that threat. - He want down on his knees among the litter, and brought some sugar out, about a pound and a half or two pounds. I told him he had some other articles there as well, and he denied that, but he brought the soap, about two pounds; he had the ginger concealed in his pocket, about two or three ounces, which he threw out as he was coming down the yard. I cannot swear to any part of the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any part? - I could not out of the quantity that we have.</p>

I went over to the stable on the twenty-fourth of September, towards the evening, and found only one piece of soap in the stable, and I went over on Friday morning, and I found four pieces. I then informed Mr. Pringle of it, and he went over with me, and between the times that I came and told Mr. Pringle, the prisoner had been over to the stable with the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use to go to the stable? - Yes, three times a day constantly to feed the horse; he had taken two pieces away by the time that Mr. Pringle went over. I went over again on Saturday morning, and there were brought two pieces there of a different kind of soap, white soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people might go to this stable besides the prisoner? - The stable was locked; there was nobody had any business there besides our own family.</p>

Mr. Pringle came to me and beckoned me to come to his assistance. I went with him; he charged the prisoner, that he had property of his concealed. I see him deliver the soap out, and it was delivered into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was it such soap as you told? - Yes, it was. He was a man that I had unlimited confidence in, and if any man had told me of it the night before, I should not have believed him; he was a man that served me, to all appearance, very faithfully, and very industrious.</p>

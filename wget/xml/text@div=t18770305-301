                  </hi>. I am a widow, and have lived at 27, Castle Alley, fifteen years—one Sunday morning, I was going home and lost my way—I met a woman and asked her to direct me to Whitechapel—the prisoner who was standing on the kerb said "Where do you want to go?' I will take you correct"—I said "Be aware young man where you are taking me".—he said "I am taking you correct; this way"—I said "No, you ought to take me that way, or that way"—he said "I am cutting a mile or so off," and he took me down some sort of road which he said was a short cut—he then tried to get the earrings out of my ears, but he found they were fastened and let them be, and then he put one arm round my neck and the other on my throat—I said "I am done now," and struck him twice in the face—he threw me down—I hallooed manfully and he said "Oh, you old sow, can't you hallo?"—I got up and he <hi rend="italic">downed</hi> me again in a, place where there is all brickwork and a wall, and ran away—a gentleman then came to me and I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the station.</p>

On 4th February, about 2.30 I heard cries of "Police," and proceeded towards the spot Fairfield Road, Bow, where I saw the prisoner holding the prosecutrix by the wrist and hand, and dragging her along—he kept hold of her till I got about 20 yards off—I heard her call him a villain and a scoundrel—he could see me as it was a bright night—he gave her a push and said "There go on, that is your way," and walked away from her—I spoke to her and then went after him—he commenced running as soon' as he saw me—I ran 150 yards, caught him, and told him I should take him into custody for assaulting the old <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>, and attempting to steal her earrings—he said 'I will go with you"—she was the worse for drink—the skin was off the side of one of her fingers and off the side of her face, and her clothing was dirty as if she had been on her back—she was the worse for drink but she knew what she was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a staymaker and live in Hunt Street, Mile End New Town—the prisoner has kept company with me for a long while—on this Saturday night when he was committed, about 6 o'clock, he came to our warehouse and took me to a place of amusement where we met Mr. Pope, his foreman—we all three remained together some time and parted with Mr. Pope about 12.30, at the corner of Great Garden Street, White<lb></lb>chapel—the prisoner then saw me home and got to our place about 12.30 as near as I can say—he was quite sober—he came—into our house and remained there an hour—my mother was there—she knew of our engage<lb></lb>ment—it was 1.30 when he left—it would take from three-quarters of an hour to an hour to walk from our house to Fairfield Road, Bow—he bears a very respectable character and is admitted by my father and mother as my sweetheart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He took me to the East London Theatre, which is ten minutes' walk from our house—we stopped to the end, which was about 11.50—we then went into a public-house nearly opposite, with Mr. Pope and stood talking till nearly 12.20—I am quite sure of the time when I got home, because I was scolded when I got in about the time—the prisoner</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. What I have told you occurred on the night that he was locked up—I knew on the Sunday morning that he was locked up, his sister came round and told me, and I went to Worship Street on Monday, but did not get in—I was outside—the prisoner's solicitor said that if we were wanted he would come out and fetch us, and when he came out he said that the prisoner was committed for trial.</p>

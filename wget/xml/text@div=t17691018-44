               <p>William Green. As I was walking in Blackheath fair on the 11th of October, I saw this gelding. I knew him; for I sold him to Mr. Beecroft. I said to the man that had him there, named

I said, Do you think he will sell the horse? I know a man that would be glad to have him. If you will go with me to the person, I'll treat you with a bottle of wine. I took him to Mr. Beecroft's yard, and said to him, Here is your horse. I asked the man if he could give any good account of himself; he said he hired the horse of Mr. Heath; which we found to be true; and when we saw Mr. Heath, he said, he bought the horse of

I said, What is the other? He said, A bay mare, and described her. Then I said, I know who she belongs to. The next day, Mr. Heath had got the prisoner in the parish of Shadwell. I asked him how he came by the horse; he said he bought him in Smithfield, and that he had him in a raft two or three days before he sold him to Mr. Heath. Mr. Heath said he bought the horse on the 22nd of September, and he was stole between the 18th and 20th, which we thought could not be true, because there was no market-day between. I asked the prisoner if the horse had any shoes on before: he said, No. The horse had a tender foot, and I think he could not be had up and down bare-footed, as he was at Luisham, without hurting him.</p>

I have seen him since, and it is the same horse that Mr. Beecroft owns. I bought him of the prisoner on the 22nd of September, and I bought another horse.

               <p>Q. Was the horse shod when you bought him?</p>
               <p>Heath. He was. At first, when the prisoner was charged, he said he bought him in Smithfield; then he had him in exchange; then after that he said he bought him in Bedfordshire. I paid him eleven pounds and six-pence for the two.</p>

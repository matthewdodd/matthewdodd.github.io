                  </hi>. I keep the Star and Garter, Woolwich. A man named Brown was in the habit of using my house—I had a copper pump in my stable, worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not seen it for some time when Gladwin came, and in consequence of what he said I found it was not there—Brown was apprehended by my direction, and I went on 17th May with him and Gladwin to the prisoner's shop—Gladwin asked Bryant if he had brought any copper or pump—he said he had brought some copper—Gladwin asked how much—he said, "2lbs. or 31bs."—he produced this, and said, "That is it" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that has nothing to do with my pump—this metal is much thinner—my pump weighed 6lbs. or 7lbs., and had a sort of cylinder, or basin, at the top.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) On 16th May I took a copper pump of Mr. Hammond's, about three yards long, and broke it into three pieces—each piece remained a portion of a pump—I took it to Mrs. Ford—she refused to buy it, and I took it to the prisoner's, who is a marine-store dealer—I asked whether he would buy it—he said, "Yes"—he weighed it, and said it came to 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know what it weighed—he did not ask me any questions at all—I was half tipsy—he went out of his shed to his house, got the money, paid me, and I left—we had to go into the street to get to his house, leaving the copper in the shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a marine-store shop, in Union-street, Woolwich. On 16th May, Brown brought a big round piece of copper, like a spout—he was tipsy, and I refused to have anything to do with it—I saw him go to Bryant's shop, and come out again with him—he then had no parcel—they went to Bryant's dwelling-house, and then Brown went away—he had nothing with him then.</p>

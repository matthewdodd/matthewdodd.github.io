                  </hi>. I am a painter of Robinson's-place, Stockwell. On Monday, 15th Aug., a little after 12 o'clock, I came out of the Sportsman beer<lb></lb>shop, with Charles Hook, Edward Goldspink, and the prisoner—I and Hook left and went home, leaving Goldspink and the prisoner standing there by Mr. Fenton's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Ingledon-street, Brixton, and am a labourer. I came out of the Sportsman with Hook and the prisoner, we stood by Mr. Fenton's shop—Hook and Rhodes left, and I remained with the prisoner—I was looking at the Vauxhall fireworks, and in a few minutes I heard a window smash, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Fenton's window alone—he came towards me, and told me that he had put his handkerchief round his fist, took his cap in his hand, and thrust it into the window—I pasted on, he walked by my side, and when I got into Ingleton-street, where I lift, he said, "If I take the things I wish you to shift them, to take them of me"—I said, "No, John, I will not have anything to do with it"—I then went borne—I saw the prisoner again next day, and told him that an officer was after him to take him into custody—he said the things were at his own home, and directly after that he left the beer shop and went away—I had not seen Rhodes, or a policeman, or made any communication; as the next day I had to go to Blackwall, I did not come back till evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me break the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but there was nobody there but you—I would not swear you broke it—I did not tee you take anything from it—I did not stay till the prosecutor came home and give information, because I did not want to have anything to do with it whatever—I was not taken into custody on 16th Aug.—I went to the station with you, and denied knowing anything about it, that was because I did not wish to harm you—I did not appear at the first examination, at Kennington-lane, because I had got too much drink overnight—I was compelled to state what I knew in order <hi rend="italic">to</hi> clear myself.</p>

On 15th Aug., about twenty minutes past 12 o'clock, I passed the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner and Goldspink a short distance from each other—the prisoner was nearest to the prosecutor's house—he was close by the front of the window, and Goldspink was about five yards from him—the Vauxhall fireworks were going off, and Goldspink was looking at them—the prosecntor's window was then quite safe—I went round again, about twenty minutes to 1 o'clock to see, and found it broken, so as to give access to the things in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of No. 29, Robert-street, Brixton. I went out on this night, leaving my window safe—I returned a little before 1 o'clock, and found a pane of glass broken—there was no shutter up—I missed several brooches, a pair of hair bracelets, and other common jewellery, which had been in a glass case in the window; a person putting their hand in could lift up the lid and take them—I have not found any of them—it is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of Lambeth—I lost some shirt studs and waistcoat buttons, and some of the same description have been shown to me by the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you examine the shop that night, to see whatyouhad lost? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because I considered some person had fallen against it—I put the shutters up—I remember your coming to the shop next day, to ask me something about a pipe—I did not say anything to you about the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If Goldspink was standing at the short distance of three or four yards he must have seen me break the window; but when he was taken to the station he strongly denied all knowledge of it, and of me as well; he never appeared at Kennington-lane, and I got a remand for the opportunity of getting him to state what he stated at the station, and when he came he stated a different thing altogether; he is rather a light character, and has been sent to Wandsworth, and there is a man in Court who can prove that he was found early one morning at the back of a gentleman's house for an unlawful purpose.</p>

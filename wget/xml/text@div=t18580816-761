                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the General Post<lb></lb>office. In consequence of something which had occurred, I made up a letter on 10th July, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is in the same state now as when I made it up—I put inside a half-sovereign and a sixpence in a piece of card, (<hi rend="italic">the witness here opened the letter</hi>,) here is the half-sovereign and sixpence, this is just the state in which it was when I sealed it up—it is addressed "Mrs. Johnson, 4, Pink-row, John Vrow, St. Luke's, London." I put it into the letter box between 1 and 2 in the day—I then went inside and obtained it again from the person who had taken it from the letter box, and locked it up till the next morning—I then gave it to Green, the sorter, to place with the letters for Bartholomew Square, that was about 10 minutes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160034"></xptr>
               <p>to 6—the prisoner was one of the letter-carriers for the Bartholomew-square district; Tilson is the principal of the walk, and Carter is the third. In the ordinary course, this letter would have been amongst those which Tilson had to deliver—Tilson went out with his letters about 10 minutes after 7—I stopped him and searched his bundle, but found no such letter there—shortly after the letter-carriers had left, I sent Green after the prisoner, and he was brought back to my office—I asked him if he had seen a letter addressed to Fink-row, John's-row, St. Luke's—he said "I don't deliver Pink Row, but I have a letter for it," and he pulled this letter out of his coat pocket, and said, "Is this it?"—it was still sealed, but the address had been erased, and it was re-directed to Gee-street—the prisoner does deliver in Gee Street—I asked him how far he had delivered his letters when he was fetched back by Green—he said he had delivered Gee-street, Willow-street or Willow-row, and Noble-street—I am quite sure he said Gee-street—I asked him who re-directed the letter—he said, "I do not know, it came to me the last thing."—I have a memorandum here of the words that passed, which I made at the time; the prisoner saw me write it—what he said was, "I do not deliver Pink-row, but I have a letter for it—it is re-directed—I do not know who re-directed it—I had finished Gee-street, Willow-row, and Noble-street, before Mr. Green told me I was wanted." I then gave him into custody—he was searched—a letter was found on him that did not belong to him; it belonged to the Aldersgate-street walk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter directed to Pink-row I suppose had a fictitious address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner has been in the Post-office upwards of 2 years, and bis father for nearly 30 years. I have not charged him with stealing any letters but this, but there was another found in his pocket which did not belong to him, and that contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when it was delivered—I have not preferred any charge against him in respect to that letter; it is a rule if a letter-carrier discovers that he has in error taken out a letter belonging to another district, that he should go with it to the proper address immediately after he has finished his own delivery—supposing this letter, re-directed to Gee-street, came into his delivery for Pink-row, it would be his duty to deliver it in Gee-street—I am not aware that there is such a person as Mrs. Johnson at 15, Gee-street—if he ascertained there was no such person, it would be his duty to put it in his pocket and bring it back to the Post-office. He told me he did not deliver Gee-street, but it came to him the last thing—that means as they were just going out—sometimes when the letter-carriers are going out letters keep coming to them up to the very last minute, after they have got their main bundle; they are perhaps letters that have been overlooked in the sorting—the prisoner did not tell me that he had been to 15, and found no such person there—he did not tell me that there was a letter-box at 15, and that he was in the habit, when he delivered there, of putting the letters through the letter-box in the inner door—I don't remember his saying so in my presence—it might have been said in my presence, but I don't remember its being said in answer to any question that I put.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendant of the sorters at tho General Post Office. On the morning of 12th July, Mr. Clare gave me a letter—this is it. At that time there was no erasure on the envelope; there was no "Gee-street" on it—in consequence of Mr. Clare's instructions, I put that letter into the tray containing the letters for the Bartholomew-square district. I saw the tray placed on the machine, and drawn up into the letter-carrier's office—I immediately went up into the letter-carrier's office,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160035"></xptr>
               <p>and gave some instructions to Mr. Roberts, who was the inspector on duty there; that was about 3 or 4 minutes past 6—a little before 8, in consequence of directions, I went after the prisoner—I found him in his district—his ordinary course was to go to Gee-street first, then to Willow-row, Pear-tree-street, and so on. I found him in Pear-tree-street; I brought him back to Mr. Clare; I saw him take this letter from his coat pocket—I then saw the address had been altered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers—on the morning of 12th July, shortly before 6, a communication was made to me by Mr. Green; I was at that time in the letter-carriers' office. In consequence of that communication, I paid particular attention to the prisoner's movements; after a short time, I observed him go to Tilaon's seat, and divide the letters into three parts; the letters were lying on Tilson's seat—I had seen the letters placed there by a letter-carrier named Jones, when they came up by the machine—it was the prisoner's duty to divide them. Tilson not being there—I saw him divide them into three bundles. I had previously been shown this letter—whilst the prisoner was dividing the letters I saw this letter; I saw the prisoner place it amongst his own letters, instead of placing it amongst Tilson's—before that, I saw him, as he had got it in his hand, turn it over and feel it—no one was assisting him in dividing the letters; he was occupied at it for about a quarter of an hour—he then took the letters belonging to his own walk to his own seat, this letter being amongst them—I then saw him writing; I could not see what he wrote; he was writing long enough to have re-directed two or three letters; he then tied up the letters, and went out for delivery. I was in the solicitor's room, when he was brought back; I believe I asked him if he had delivered letters at 15, Gee-street; he said he had, he thought three; he delivered them by knocking at the door, and placing them in a box, in an inner door—he saw no one. I saw Tilson come in and go to his seat before the prisoner went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from where the prisoner was sorting the letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five yards. I was in a gallery where you have a good view of all the letter-carriers—I had a perfect view of all that was going on—I did not keep my eye upon him wholly—there is a passage underneath where the letters are occasionally sorted, and he went there to fetch some; with that exception, I had my eye upon him the whole time—I have mentioned before to-day, that I saw him feel the letter and turn it over—I mentioned it to the solicitor; I did not mention it before the magistrate—this was a test letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the principal of the three letter-carriers of the Bartholomew-square district—on 12th July, my letters were all sorted when I went up—before I went out with my letters, Mr. Clare looked over them to find a letter addressed to Mrs. Johnson—there was no such letter in my parcel—a letter for Pink-row ought to have been in my bundle—I believe the writing on this envelope to be the prisoner's, it is a sort of disguised hand; I have seen him write, dozens of times—he has been in my department for two years, backwards and forwards—from my knowledge of the character of his handwriting I believe this to be his.</p>

The prisoner came into our service on 21st Jan.—my sister-in-law and our potman also lived in the house—on 24th March, I saw some lace of mine on a cap which the prisoner had been making—I called in the police; her box was searched, and I found this lace collar in it, which is mine, I know it by the peculiarity of the pattern, and there is a place where it was torn with a pin, and has my work on it—this habit<lb></lb>shirt is my make—this piece of linen is mine, and this ribbon—I have had it since last Aug.—it was found in her box, and some under the bed—this white ribbon is mine, I have had it many years, and know it by this little piece hanging to it—this chemise is mine, and has my initials on it, done by myself, it was found between her bed and mattress—the prisoner de<lb></lb>clared the articles were her' s, that she bad brought them into the house, and she could bring persons to prove it—she saw the lace collar at that time, and at Marl borough-street, but not before the Magistrate, she ad<lb></lb>mitted that the collar was mine, but she did not know how it got into her box, and said the things between the bed and mattress were there when she came into our service—the brown ribbon I found in her box had been wrapped up with the two old chemises which I found under the bed, and I had seen them together in a drawer in my room about 15th or 16th Jan.; the drawer was not locked.</p>

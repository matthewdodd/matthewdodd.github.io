About the 5th of March, the prisoner met me, and asked for employment - I had employed him before. I said I had no work for him; he said if I gave him only his victuals, that would satisfy him. As we went along, he said he knew where to sell the coals - he took me near Saffron-hill, and told me to stop at the end of the street, and he would go to an old lady, and ask her to buy them - he returned, and said she wanted two bushels, but she had no change - they came to 3 s. I gave him three half crowns, a sixpence, and nine shillings; he told me to measure the coals while he went and fetched the sovereign. I waited about an hour, he did not return. I saw him twice about a week after, but he ran away from me; I met him a third time; he stopped, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, but he would bring the money on Monday. I let him go, intending to give him in charge when he came on the Monday, but he never came. I gave information, and he was taken.</p>

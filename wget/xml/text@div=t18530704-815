                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bowen, of Charlotte-street, Plumstead. On 24th June, I employed Amelia Dible to assist in moving my goods from one house to another—I was changing my residence, my things had to be carried three quarters of a mile, or not quite so far—I had amongst other things, this hand basket—there were some gloves in it, and in one of the gloves there were three sovereigns—I had put them in the glove about a quarter of an hour before in the front room in the house which I was moving out of—there was nobody in the house but my husband and me, and this girl—when I came out I had this basket on my arm, and a clothes basket with some crockery in it—I put both the baskets down in the street, and took them up again after we had changed hands—Amelia Dible helped me to carry the large basket—when we got to the new house she said she was ill, and must go home—she had had plenty of opportunity of taking the money out of the small basket, when I put it down at the corner of a street—she had opportunity of taking it without my knowing it—my arm ached, and I was not looking at her—after the basket had been about a quarter of an hour in the new house I then looked, and missed the glove and money—I went to see if I could find her—I found her in the street, near her own home—I asked her for the money, she said she had never seen it, and knew nothing about it—I took her to my own home, and sent for an</p>

               <p>officer—I again told her she had got my money, and she said again that she had not seen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before she said any more, did you hold out any expectation of mercy to her if she would tell you the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I sympathised in that way; I told her I only wanted my money—she then pulled the glove out of her bosom; there was no money in it—it was the same glove I had lost, and that the money had been in—it was about half past 1 o'clock when I missed the money.</p>

I was sent for by the last witness between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, and took this child into custody—I afterwards went to where her sister, Lavinia Dible lives—Lavinia was not at home, she did not return that night—I went about 8 or 9 o'clock at night; I searched her boxes; I knew Lavinia Dible lived there, because Amelia Dible said that she lived with her sister at No. 23, Taylor's-buildings, and that was where I went to—I searched some boxes there, and found 3 bonnets, I pairs of boots, 1 pair of stays, 2 dresses, and some other articles, which I have here—the next night I found Lavinia Dible at this No. 23, and took her into custody—I told her it was on suspicion of receiving a sovereign of her sister, knowing it to be stolen—she said she knew nothing about it—she said she heard that her sister bad found money and bought some clothing, but she was not with her when the articles were purchased.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a bonnet shop, in Powis-street, Woolwich. On 24th June, the two prisoners came to my shop—I do not think I ever saw them before—I am quite sure they are the persons—I think it was between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—there was another little girl with them—Amelia Dible asked for a mourning bonnet—I served her with one—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the price of it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she paid me a sovereign; I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—Lavinia Dible then asked for a mourning bonnet—I showed her one, and she purchased it—she then purchased a small bonnet—her own bonnet was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the small bonnet 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., these are them—this cap front, and this flower she purchased afterwards—the front was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the flower 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign, I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—while they were buying the bonnets, there was a conversation between them—one of them said in presence of the other, that they had received a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into mourning, on account of the death of an uncle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure who paid for the bonnets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of them paid for one bonnet, and one for two, but I am not quite sure which—there was a pair of stays purchased, I believe, by Amelia—I dare say they were in my shop a quarter of an hour—these are the bonnets and stays I sold.</p>

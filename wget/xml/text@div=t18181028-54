I marked them and left them there. He returned to work. At eight o'clock as he was leaving work, the clerk called him into the counting-house, I took his hat off, and found four bells, all muffled to prevent their making a noise. They were those I had marked.</p>
               <p>CHARLES DARKIN. I am in the prosecutor's service. I was desired to stop the prisoner, and I took the four bells out of his hat. They were muffled. He said he had drilled them, and was afraid his master would be angry, and he was going to throw them away.</p>

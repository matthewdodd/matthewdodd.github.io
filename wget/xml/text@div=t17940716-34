I am quite sure it was the prisoner that took my hat off.</p>

               <p>Sunday before last, about nine o'clock in the evening, as I was standing by my door, I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran to it, and I found the lad had lost his hat, and I was determined to see him righted,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160057"></xptr>to get the hat again, and Mr. Tipper had the prisoner, taking him to the watch-house at the same time, I said to the prisoner, where is the boy's hat? says he, what more do you want of me, if I shew you where the hat is? I had not spoke it a minute before a woman came up and brings me the hat, therefore Tipper and I considered of it, to take the prisoner at the bar and the hat to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>On Sunday, the 6th of this month, I was coming over Stepney Green, and I saw the prisoner at the bar run, or walk away very sharp from the little boy, and the little boy calling out stop thief! I desired my wife who was with me to walk on, and I ran to the boy, and asked him what was the matter? he told me that that person had robbed him of his hat, and I ran after him, and took him, I searched him and found no hat; as I was taking him to the watch-house he wanted sadly to stop, or go down a turning that he thought; he could find the hat, if I would let him go down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have no concerns with the hat, I was looking after my jacket on the green, I did not belong to the other two.</p>

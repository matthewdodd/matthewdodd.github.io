                  </hi>. I know the prisoner, she is the wife of my son Charles Samuel Tucker—they had a little girl, four months and a few days old—on Saturday night, 8th April, I was very poorly, and my son gave me an asylum in his house; I went to bed at 8 o'clock—the little girl, whose name was Catherine Sarah, was then in her mother's arms, and in very good health—the prisoner appeared sober—I had seen her husband go out, and heard him tell her she was not to go out, only to buy two or three things—I went to sleep, and was awakened by a great noise in the house—I partly dressed myself, went down stairs, and saw the prisoner lying on the mat, and a policeman and several people outside the door—I spoke to the prisoner, but she made no answer; I said, "Emma, where is your baby?" a woman in the passage said, "The baby is outside, in a woman's arms"—it was after<lb></lb>wards given to me by some one, and I took it up to bed, leaving the prisoner on the mat at the foot of the stairs; she seemed to be asleep, but I suppose that was from liquor; I did not perceive she had been drinking—my son came home about three quarters of an hour afterwards—I heard him say to his wife, "What are you doing there, go up stairs"—I did not hear what she said in reply—about twenty minutes after that I was called into the room, and found the prisoner there—my son said the baby was very ill, and he thought it would die, and begged me to fetch a doctor—I took the baby to Mr. Roberts, and had it on my lap while he examined it—I have never heard the prisoner threaten the baby; when she was sober she was very fond of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at 15, Norfolk-street, Southwark Bridge-road. On Saturday night, about half-past 11 o'clock, I saw a baby in a woman's arms in Norfolk-street, at the person's door—I do not know the number—she asked me if I knew the person the baby belonged to—I could see the prisoner sitting in the passage at the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the parish constable. On Monday morning, 9th April, I received information and went to 19, Norfolk-street, about 10 o'clock—I saw the prisoner; she told me that she went out on the Saturday night, about 9 o'clock, with the child; that she walked about in different places, went in one or two public-houses, and got a little <hi rend="italic">fresh;</hi> that when she came home, in trying to undo the street door the key went rather stiff; the child either fell out of her arms or she dropped it, and she had no further recollection of what took place after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, surgeon and apothecary, of 40, Bridge-street, Borough,—on this Sunday morning, about 10 minutes to 3 o'clock, the child was brought to me by Mrs. Tucker—it was in a state of collapse; I found a swelling on the right side of its head with discolo<lb></lb>ration of the skin extending from the right to the left side—it died in about three quarters of an hour; in my opinion, from concussion of the brain—a blow on the side of the head of a child of those tender years would be sufficient to account for the concussion of the brain—if it had fallen out of its mother's arms it might have received such a blow as I saw; or if the mother and child had fallen together and it same in contact with any blunt object, it might produce it.</p>

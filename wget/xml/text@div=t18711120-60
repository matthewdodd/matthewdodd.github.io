                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of militia—on 1st November, about 5.30, I was going into the North Pole, Greenwich Road—the prisoner and another man went in with me—I then felt a hand in both my pockets, and found my wrists pinned from behind, by I think, the man not in custody—it was the prisoner who had his hands in my pockets—the landlord had just gone from behind the bar—the prisoner withdrew his hands and some money fell on the floor—he and the other man scrambled for the money and ran away, I ran after them, I stopped the prisoner, he got away, but I did not lose sight of him—the landlord asked me to step back so that he should not see my uniform—he then caught him and I kept him.</p>

               <p>that day except the Prince Arthur Inn, next door where I live—I had passed ten recruits that afternoon—it is not usual for a sergeant to have a glass of beer with a recruit—I had taken perhaps two glasses of ale that day—I was not the worse for drink, if anyone gets into the box and says that I was he will not speak the truth—there were only those two men present and a French-polisher who was decorating the upper part of the bar—the man left go of me and he and the prisoner scrambled for my money, and then went out together—I pursued the prisoner two or three hundred yards, and did not lose sight of him—I did not know the men before, but they got me to go there to recruit some man.</p>

I am a French-polisher, of 6, Garden Bow, Deptford—I was in the North Pole public-house polishing a cabinet behind the bar—the sergeant came in with the prisoner and another man much bigger—they drank together, and seemed as if they had finished, when the prisoner suddenly ran behind the sergeant, seized his hands behind, and held them crossways—it was the prisoner who did that—the sergeant screwed him<lb></lb>self about, and put on a little more energy, and the other one dived his hands into the sergeant's pockets—they, shook him this way, and the money fell on the floor—the prisoner and the other man picked it up and ran off, and the sergeant and Mr. Gordon ran after them—I have not the slightest doubt of the prisoner.</p>

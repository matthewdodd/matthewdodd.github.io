                  </hi>. I am Secondary of the City of London. On 23rd May an election took place at Guildhall for the office of Chamberlain, which had become vacant by the death of Mr. Brown—the Sheriffs, Messrs. Carter and Croll, attended at Guildhall—Sir John Key was one of the candidates—the show of hands was in favour of Sir John Key—a poll was demanded by both parties—the poll clerks were appointed and sworn—I have been secondary about twenty-two years, and at all elections I have attended for the Sheriffs—the Sheriffs are the presiding officers at the elections—I am their officer, and have to conduct the management of all elections—I swore the poll clerks, and the Sheriffs were present on this occasion—the poll clerks were sworn about 10 minutes before 3 o'clock—amongst the clerks sworn there was a Mr. Walkinshaw—he was not sworn on that day—we had only one hour's poll that day—he was sworn on the second day, and was No. 10.</p>

At the late election for Chamberlain I acted as one of the poll clerks—I was appointed by Mr. Secondary Potter, on Tuesday morning, 24th May—Mr. Potter administered the oath to me, which I took—during that day I acted as poll clerk—in the course of that day the prisoner came to my polling place—I asked him his name; he said, Matthew Cartwright—I asked him his Company; he said, "The Girdlers"—I asked him his place of abode; he said, "No. 31, South-villas, Wands worth-road"—this is my poll book—having made that statement, I administered the oath to him, "You do swear that you are a freeman and liveryman of the Company of Girdlers, and so have been for twelve months; and the place of your abode is 31, South-villas, Wandsworth-road; and you have not polled at this election; so help you God"—I asked him for whom he voted, and he said, "Sir John Key—I entered it in my poll book—he was then going away—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I gave the same information I have now—I cannot be under any mistake about his person.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 174). On 10th Dec, about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in St. George's-street and heard the noise of some shutters falling on the opposite of the road, and saw a man passing about a dozen yards from the shop, but did not see who it was; I was not near enough—I then went up to the shop, and saw the prisoner about five yards from where the shutter fell—I saw that the window was broken, followed the prisoner, and saw him stopped—I had lost sight of him for three or four yards, but am sure he is the person—I asked him what he did there at that time in the morning—he said, "I have come from Bethnal-green workhouse"—I asked where he lived—he said, "No. 19, Manchester-street, Waterloo-town"—Gibbs, who took him, pointed out a place in Den<lb></lb>mark-street—the prisoner had ran by that spot, and had an opportunity of dropping anything there.</p>

I was on duty in the neighbourhood of St. George's-street, Bethnal-green—Jones called me, and I saw the prisoner walking in Denmark-street—I asked him what he did there at that time of the morning, and he ran away—I pursued him for about fifteen yards, and caught him—I then went back into Denmark-street and found this spice box and spittoon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I pointed the spot out to Jones—Howland pointed out to me the street where he found some spoons, it was within five or six yards from where the prisoner ran.</p>

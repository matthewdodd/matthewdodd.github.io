                  </hi>. I reside at Zurich, and am a merchant, carrying on a provision store—I remember the defendant coming to Zurich about three years ago—he first carried on business hi the Rennwieg—he had an office, and some kind of store opening into it—I saw Henry Tueski there at the same time—I did not see him in the office, but I saw him once or twice going in and out there—the prisoner carried on a kind of commission busi<lb></lb>ness—he afterwards removed to the Bahnhoff Strasse, where he carried on the same kind of business—Tueski was with him there—the name of the firm was Heymann and Tueski—they were there during 1869, 1870, and 1871—Heymann lived with his wife and his mother-in-law at Safelt Strasse—Henry Tueski was living in Hottinghen—I remember them leaving Zurich quite well—it was on the Sunday before Christmas—down to that time the office in Bahnhoff Strasse had been open, and business apparently going on—the office was open on the Saturday—I know that they left on the Sun<lb></lb>day, from the police—I did not go there on the Monday; I did on the Tues<lb></lb>day morning—I think I had last seen the office open on the Friday—on the Tuesday I found it shut—the defendant owed me 525 francs—he did not pay me before be left—he still owes it me—I attended a meeting at Zurich, at which a number of persons attended who represented themselves to be creditors—there was no stock at all upon the premises on the Tuesday—I went into and examined the premises with the public prosecutor of Zurich—there was nothing in them except some furniture, which was afterwards sold—I was present when it was sold—it realised about 2,000 francs—a portion of it was claimed by a maid-servant; and there were 600 francs for rent—I saw these books there on the Tuesday (<hi rend="italic">four books were produced</hi>)—they are in the same state now as they were at Zurich—the public pro<lb></lb>secutor took them in my presence—I put myself in communication with Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Overman &amp; Sohon, merchants—I had not known the prisoner until I saw him in London, but I had dealt with the firm of Heymann &amp; Co. of Zurich, for eighteen months—during the last four months of last year, I had supplied them goods on credit to the amount of from 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have never been paid for—the exact amount the prisoner's firm was indebted to us at the time of the bankruptcy, was 1657<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received this letter from Heymann &amp; Co., dated the 16th November; it is in German; I will translate it: "In respectfully replying to your favour of the 13th instant, we think we ought to make an observation to you, that the information respecting us, which you had the kindness to give to Messrs. Stewart &amp; Macdonald, is rather insufficient, and therefore we are not astonished that the firm has hesitated to execute our order. Our working capital is beyond the sum of 150,000 francs, our own money, which Messrs. Delias &amp; Co., to whom our position is pretty well known, might confirm. Mr. Thomas Delias has only recently called upon us, and these gentlemen must also state to you the fact that in Switzerland one must give six, nine, and twelve months' credit, so as to be able to compete with other houses"—that letter is in the same writing as nearly all the letters we received from Heymann &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">The letter referred to was also read.</hi>) There was a remittance for 231<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods supplied before the four months, and is not to be deducted off my account—I believed that statement that he had a working capital of 150,000 francs—on the 30th November we supplied him with goods to the amount of 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on the 29th December, 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the last invoice we stopped the goods in <hi rend="italic">transitu</hi>, and he is not accountable for them—I was in the chair at the meeting of creditors, and I eventually concurred in the prosecution of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master carman, and have carried on business about seven years—my waggons stand in Bishopsgate Street for hire—I have known Heymann about five years—I first knew him in White Hart Court, Bishopsgate Street—I know a Mr. Seckell—the prisoner was ac<lb></lb>quainted with him—that was four or five years ago—they carried on busi<lb></lb>ness,</p>

               <p>together with others, as Welbon &amp; Co., the "others" were his brother and Jacob Tueski—they might have carried on business about two years—that was at London Bridge; and in Great St. Helen's; they carried on busi<lb></lb>ness as Tueski &amp; Co.—at the time they traded as Welbon &amp; Co. the pri<lb></lb>soner called himself Welbon—I understood him to be George Welbon—there was a firm of Glasson &amp; Co. in Water Lane—I am not aware the pri<lb></lb>soner was connected with that—the members of that firm were Seckell and Jacob Tueski—I know a firm called Wilson &amp; Becker, of 96, Leadenhall Street—that consisted of Seckell and Jacob Tueski—I dare say they carried on business for about nine months before the bankruptcy—I remember Jacob Tueski calling upon me on the 2nd January, about 10 o'clock a.m.—he directed me to bring a van with a strong man to Upper Thames Street—I went there at 2 o'clock, and Jacob Tueski came there at 2.45—they are offices—I saw a quantity of bales and cases there—perhaps ten or twelve—we took a bale and a case out of the office, by Tueski's instructions, and put them in the van—it might weigh four or five cwt., or more—we were directed to take them to 12, Woburn Place, where we saw Heymann along with Henry Tueski—Jacob Tueski went with us from Thames Street to Woburn Place—Heymann saw the van—I do not know that he saw the bale of goods in it—we received ten or twelve packages from Woburn Place—Heymann saw those packages put in—he spoke in a foreign language, and I could not understand him—Heymann and Henry Tueski directed Jacob Tueski where to take them to—Henry Tueski told me he should want me the next day about the same time, and Jacob would call upon me—Heymann was there at the time—we were all together, and he might have heard it—when Jacob Tueski came to me at 10 o'clock he said would I have a van in Thames Street about 2 o'clock?—I said I would—He said "You must bring a van without any name on it, with another man to help you—there are some things very heavy, and you cannot do it by yourself"—he gave me the di<lb></lb>rections at Upper Thames Street, and he and Heymann gave me directions at Woburn Place—the boxes I took from there seemed travelling boxes—there were some small and some large, and some very heavy—we went from Woburn Place to the Brecknock Arms—at Woburn Place I noticed we were being watched—I told Jacob Tueski so on our way to the Brecknock Arms—we had seen a man take a cab and follow us—he said he did not know what to do, and he asked my opinion what to do—I told him he had better take me into the Brecknock and give me something to drink, and go out of the side-door and see whether they would have the things in—by "they" I mean Heymann and Henry Tueski—he would not tell me where they were going to—he went into the Brecknock, and out at the side-door, and up the Brecknock Road—in about twenty minutes he returned, and said I must take them on to Jewin Street, as "they" would not have them in—we went to Jewin Street, being still followed—Jacob Tueski then said "We must go to Tottenham"—I said my horse was "<hi rend="italic">licked</hi>" and I could not do it; he said "You must do it; have something to drink, and I will pay you well for it"—we went into a public-house, and afterwards drove on to the Green Lanes, Tottenham, and went to 17, Albert Villa, Brownswood Park—we pulled round to the first door in the King's Road, and Jacob Tueski said "Wait there; I will go and make all preparations for the goods to be taken in"—we took them through the passage and put them into a side-room on the left, like a parlour—I have taken a quantity of goods from the Custom House Quay for Seckell and Tueski within two or three months of the bank<lb></lb>ruptcy</p>

               <p>—those goods I took to Wilson &amp; Becker's; of Leadenhall Street, by the direction of Seckell and Tueski—I have done that sometimes once a week, and sometimes two or three times a week—they were the same sort of cases as I took in my van—I am sure they all came from the Continent—I have also taken goods from Wilson &amp; Becker's to Lebeau's, in Billiter Square, and to Atkins', to Southgate's, in Bloomfield Street, and Rother<lb></lb>ham's, in Shoreditch—I have unpacked some of the cases—they were shawls, curtains, and other things—on the 8th March I saw Seckell at my place—he asked me if I had been subpœnaed; I said I had, and I did not know what I should state—he asked me where it was adjourned to, and I told him—I met him the next morning at 10 o'clock—he told me that if I said that Jacob Tueski had come and engaged me, the same as he had done many times before, and paid me in the ordinary way, and that I knew nothing more about it, he would give me half-a-guinea, and more the next time we came up for hearing—he also said it was impossible for them to know anything about the things coming from Thames Street—I told him Farley had stated he watched us from Thames Street—he said it was im<lb></lb>possible; they could not know anything about Thames Street—he told me I was to say nothing at all about Thames Street.</p>

               <p>I Was fined 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as I could not pay they sentenced me to six months—I appealed to the Custom House, and they let me off with four months—this is not the first swindling job I have done for these people—I have taken things to the pawnbroker's for Wilson &amp; Becker—I cannot say I have done so more than once—that was to Attenborough's, in Greek Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 12, Upper Woburn Place—I let apartments—somewhere about Christmas, the defendant, his wife, and family came to my house—he brought several boxes—he remained about a week—he left as it were yesterday, and did not return the next day—his wife asked me to make out my bill, which I did, and she left with the maid and children—the same afternoon an empty cart came and took away the boxes—I saw the cart drive up to the door—it was an open cart, and there was not a thing in it—the carter said he had come for the family's luggage—there was no bale of goods, or anything extraordinary about the boxes—they were put into the cart and taken away—Mr. Heymann was not there on that day, nor did I see him until a month afterwards, when he called at my house, and invited me to dinner—Mr. Ditton came to me and said a great deal against Mr. Heymann, and he wanted me to give such evidence as would convict him—he said so in the drawing-room, and he said I should be paid handsomely, but no sum was named.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ditton said that you would be paid handsomely for giving your evi<lb></lb>dence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Ditton said Mr. Heymann was anything but what he ought to be—he said words to the effect that he had robbed his creditors, and was a swindler—I do not remember his saying anything about "creditors," but he said he had swindled people in Switzerland—Mr. Ditton said "If Mr. Heymann is convicted you shall be handsomely paid," to which I made no reply—I have never been to the prisoner's house at Hildrop Road, or to any other house of his—he called at my place this morning and yesterday morn<lb></lb>ing—that was to bring me here—those were the only times he came—I did not accept his invitation to dinner—I told Mr. Ditton that he left suddenly, and did not return—I have nearly always someone in the house who speaks German—I did not tell Mr. Ditton he left the house because he found there were persons there who spoke German—Mr. Ditton told me the prisoner was keeping put of the way to avoid being arrested—I do not remember telling Mr. Ditton that I would invite the prisoner to my house in order that he might be arrested—I gave information to Mr. Ditton about his movements, because Mr. Ditton requested it—I sent this telegram to Mr. Ditton, at his clerk's request: "Come at once. He has been here. Will call again. Come alone"—I considered I was doing a public duty in send<lb></lb>ing that, but I found I had been misled—I had no definite meaning in say<lb></lb>ing "Come alone"—he came in consequence of that—it was on a Saturday, and that was the time he said I should be paid handsomely—Mrs. Friestadt does not lodge with me—I know the name—I have not seen her lately—she has not called upon me—I know Mr. Friestadt—he has lodged at my house—also Madame Friestadt—they were there at the time Hey-mann was—the name of Tueski is familiar to me, but I make mistakes in these German names—I know two young gentlemen who used to come there, and I think their name was something like that—I have not seen them lately—this post-card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—it is addressed to Mr. Ditton, and dated February 4th: "Dear Sir, Are these people ar<lb></lb>rested, and when?"—I wrote that purely out of a woman's curiosity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had not known any of these persons previously to Hey-mann coming there to lodge—my husband was an eminent physician and my father was a distinguished officer during the time of the first Napoleon.

               <p>Did they strike you, or use any other violence? - No other.</p>

               <p>In what manner? - I do not know, because I was not fairly myself at that time; I was in so much pain, that I do not know, by their keeping my hat down so over my eyes.</p>

               <p>So that you do not very well know what happened? - No; I lost my money, and as soon I came to myself, I found they were endeavouring to get my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>You perceived that? - Yes, I did, I helped them to take it out; they got the watch, then they grumbled among themselves; one of them wanted me to be dispatched; I think that was the term they made use of; however, the rest prevailed, and they went away, and I returned home.</p>

               <p>Was your watch ever found? - I heard of it two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Had you advertised it? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you hear of it then? - One of the officers of East Smithfield came and acquainted my brother of it; my name was on a paper in the inside; I went in the evening to the Justice's office, and the watch was then produced, and I swore it was mine.</p>

            ; Justice Smith's man, Mr. Dawson, came to my house with the prisoner Bead, and asked for a watch pledged for one guinea, in the name of Bead; I went and looked for it, and found it; I immediately recollected that Bead was not the man that pledged it; I never saw him before; I attended at the Justice's, and described the man that brought it; Bead and Fitzsimmons were in custody be fore the Justice; but neither of them were the man I took the watch of; I do not rightly know the man; he was remarkbly tall; I do not think it is any one of these prisoners; two or three days after it was pledged, Bead was brought in custody to my shop; he asked for the watch in the same manner as if he had pawned it himself; he said, I want the watch that was pledged a day or two in the name of Bead for a guinea; I looked for it, and found it, and said, I was positive I did not take it in of the prisoner, for he was a much taller man that brought it; and when I went to the office, there was another man in custody, but it was neither of these men; about a week or eight days after, the officer came and told me, he had taken the other man; and I attended at the Justice's again to see if I knew him; and I am not able to swear to any of them; the man that was at the second examination was that tall man; he appeared to be very much like the man that pawned the watch with me; but I have a doubt about him, for he was not in the same dress.</p>
               <p>Was it that tall man or not, are you able to say? - I do not think it was; I believe it was not any of them; Bead made a kind of confession in my hearing.</p>
               <p>In the first place was there any promises of favour made to Bead if he did confess? - I understood from himself from what little conversation he had with me that he had been promised; but I did not hear the officer say so; I only heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Did the officer admit or deny his intimation of having a promise made him? - He denied it before the Justice.</p>

             put her hand under my hoop and pulled off my pocket, which had some few halfpence in it, and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment, and they ran away. I don't remember I heard a word from either of them; I called out, watch, and murder! two watchmen came, and I told them the affair; then I met Roe and laid hold on her, and charged the watchmen with her; we took her to the Roundhouse, where I told the watchmen the other woman had a particular cast with her eye, and I should know her in the morning. Roe said, I don't believe but it is Grace; then the woman of the Roundhouse told me, if I would give her maid two-pence she should go for the key, so she went and brought the pocket and the key. (Produced in court and deposed to.) She lived near the place where they robbed me, and was taken up. I am positive to the two prisoners.

On the 23rd of March I lost the bacon out of my shed in my yard; I had seen it safe at nine on the night before; on the next morning the neighbours called me up, I found the bacon gone; they cut the lath under the tiling, and got the door open; I picked up a handkerchief that they had left behind them. On the 11th of April I went to the prisoners house, in Twickenham Town, the constable and beadle were with me; the old prisoner was not at home, I went in, we found some bacon in the necessary out of doors, some in the chimney, and two pieces in the cellar; I know the piece of bacon I found in the cellar, that I have swore to. The old gentleman said to me; there George, you are satisfied now you have found the bacon; this was after we had found all the pieces.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In September last was the prisoner in your employ - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the month of March last, a debt of nine pounds five shillings and a penny due from Mr. Booth at Louth, for goods that you had furnished him with in March - A. Yes; it stands in our books now.</p>
               <p>COURT. What discount do you give - A. Five per cent for six months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That would reduce the debt to eight pounds sixteen shillings, supposing the money to have been paid to your rider - eight pounds sixteen shillings would have been your demand - A. That was what would he expected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On what day in September did the prisoner come to town - A. I believe the prisoner arrived in September, our cash book will tell.</p>
               <p>Q. First look at your own ledger - A The article in the ledger is only to goods nine pounds five shillings and a penny; that remains undischarged in our ledger now.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your rider goes out upon a journey does he take with him a pocket journal - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now hold in you hand any pocket journal that the prisoner took out with him on that journey - A. I do; it is made from the general ledger that we have in our accompting house; it is extracted from the general ledger, to take out the general cases in the journey he is going to; this pocket lodger is all his hand writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. It gives him instructions what to do - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Turn to Mr. Booth at Louth, in that ledger - 
               <persName id="t18090412-53-person536">A. John Booth</persName>
            , Louth March the 31st to goods; nine pounds five shillings and a penny; this is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner had received that money from Mr. Booth, was it his course to make any entry in that pocket ledger - A. It would have been this course to have made an entry in that ledger after he had received the money, and he has a pocket journal to enter it in.</p>
               <p>Q. In other instances, in that ledger has he acknowledged of receiving the money - A. In some he has, and some he has not; there is a column there to write down debit and credit.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned from his journey was it his course to make the entry of that cash book into the ledger - A. He generally made that from the pocket journal of his own. That pocket journal of his last journey we have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now give me the cash book - has he in that cash book accounted to you for this eight pounds sixteen shillings - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he accounted for any money received of Mr. Booth - A. None whatever; on the 22nd of September 1808, he returned home and commenced accounting with me on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first learn that this money had been paid by Mr. Booth, how lately - A. I believe somewhere about the latter end of March, this year.</p>
               <p>Q. To this moment you have never received that eight pounds sixteen shillings - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted the only way for accounting was by putting an entry in the cash book - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you write to Mr. Booth to ascertain the fact which you have stated in this court, or did you not know it from my information first - A. We discovered it by writing to other gentlemen in that journey; they stating that they had paid Mr. Spender on such a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not I previously stated that I had received this money from Mr. Booth, before you knew it from any other source - A. I have some delicacy in answering that question; Mr. Spender after being taxed with Mr. Bullman's money, admitted that he had taken up other money, among which was Mr. Booth's; it is imperious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120040"></xptr>necessity, calling upon me as prosecutor, to divulge that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not I offered to account for the balance - A. You have written several letters to me since you have been in custody, wishing me to take it as a debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. That cannot be allowed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was it not the prisoner's duty, as your servant, to collect money and receive orders for you, if so, was it not his duty to render an account of the money he so took - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever allowed to him to conceal money from you which he had received of your customers, and without your knowledge to apply the money to his own use - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say in consequence of finding some of your customers in arrears you wrote to them, and finding they had paid, you charged the prisoner - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon that account he first confessed - A. It was; one of the letters was laying upon the desk, when he came into the accompting-house from the last journey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he upon that occasion give you this list of of money he had received - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bullman 12 l. 10 s. - Mr. Booth 9 l. 5 s. 1 d. he gave that to you as a sum he had received - A. He did, that was lately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Mawhood had no knowledge of my receiving the money from Mr. Booth till I informed him of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then he had the best information, that of your own confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Consciously knowing that I had no intention feloniously to appropriate any private money of my prosecutors to my own use, I rely upon the jury's verdict - whether it shall be for or against me I shall be perfectly submissive. I have other vouchers - are we not to go forward? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Hughes. When you came to me at Liverpool, did I not press you to call upon all the customers - A. You certainly did.</p>
               <p>COURT. When - A. In the latter end of last March.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When we left the Swan and Two Necks. Lad-lane, did you at that moment suspect my honesty - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not inform you that I had received the sum in question before you knew of it - A. Yes; that was after receiving Mr. Bullman's letter you delivered me this paper; there is Mr. Booth's name, and several other names, stated on the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, Mr. Hughes, come and asked me to give security for this sum as a debt - A. I certainly have asked you to give security for the debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was that - A. A week ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon that you received advice that that would be improper for you to do - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would be compounding of felony - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Greasley. Did not you, in company with Mr. Hughes, say; it was no more than a debt, and asked security - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not then say, I could not negociate security while charged as a felon - A. You did.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you considered it a debt, and I was placed so, I was ready to negociate - A. You did so.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was all this conversation - A. Last Monday, after he was finally committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. After you had done all this, you found it was very improper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did it without Mr. Mawhood's authority - A. I did.</p>

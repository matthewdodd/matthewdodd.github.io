               <p>BENJAMIN HORTON. On the 26th of May I was passing through <placeName id="t18260622-223-crimeloc1141">Clements-lane, Lombard-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220076"></xptr>some other person as near you as the prisoner? A. Yes - I did not see him touch me - this was about eleven o'clock in the open day - there might be other persons about - he dropped my handkerchief in my presence.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was about a hundred yards from Mr. Horton, and saw him pick up the handkerchief - I ran to him directly - I saw him take hold of the prisoner, and I took charge of him - this is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there any other people in the street? A. There might be about half-a-dozen - some of them were nearer than I was.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. HORTON. Q. Is that your handkerchief? A. I think it is, but am not certain - mine are not usually marked - it is like them I have - I had eight of them, which I brought fairly - I do not know what became of the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my sister's - there were three boys - I never saw them till I got into Clements-lane - they took and threw the handkerchief by the side of the truck - the gentleman was walking on - they came behind me, and said "Have you seen any thing of my handkerchief?" and said it was me, or one of my companions.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. HORTON. Q. Did you mention to the prisoner about his companions? A. No - I said to the officer, afterwards, that he had another with him, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from you when you took him? A. Forty or fifty yards - the second person ran away. I had not observed him, so as to notice him.</p>

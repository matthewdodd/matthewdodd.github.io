On Thursday, the 10th of March, about a quarter to two o'clock, I went up stairs to dinner; I left nobody in the counting-house; the street-door is usually barred inside. I went out afterwards on business; we enter by the private door. Mr. King, another clerk, was at dinner with me - I returned to the counting-house in about half an hour, found my desk broken open, and missed a tin cash-box which was locked. I found the box in the cellar about eight o'clock that evening; the lid of it was broken, but the lock, which was a very good one, was not broken; bills amounting to about 200 l., and about 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. in money, were left in it. I missed 18 l. 9 s. 8 d. in gold, silver, and copper; I believe there was seventeen sovereigns, sixteen shillings, four half-crowns, six sixpences, and 8 d. in copper. - It was Mr. Young's money. I went to the Mansion House; and went again on the 11th, and went with Martin to the prisoner's lodging, about three o'clock in the afternoon; he had not been to the counting-house after the robbery was discovered; he lodged in George-yard, at the end of Fenchurch-street. I went to the door with Martin, who asked at the door for Mr. Williams; I heard the prisoner's voice answering.</p>
               <p>"I don't know him." I stepped forward, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." I observed a pistol in his right hand; he held it down by his side: I cried out,</p>
               <p>"He has got a pistol;" the officer then seized him. He did not attempt to fire - I cannot say whether it was loaded - he had a dark great-coat on, which was not usual.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Lowe to this house, and inquired of the prisoner for Henry Williams; I did not know him, as he was dressed different to what he had been described. He said he did not know him: Mr. Lowe then called out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God, he has got a pistol." I then seized him, pinioned his arms, and he dropped the pistol on the bed which was in the room; I examined it - it was loaded with three small balls, but a very small quantity of powder, not sufficient to discharge it. I have the cash-box, which was found in the cellar; the lock being very good, it could not be forced; the lid has been wrenched up, and the cash shook out; but the inner box could not be got out, so that the bills, which were under it, did not come out. While he was on the bed, he begged for mercy; I neither threatened or promised him: he said he had robbed his master, that he was very sorry for it, and, if I would suffer him to get up, I might do as I pleased with him; he appeared very penitent at that time. I let him get up, and was in the act of searching him, when he stooped down, and, while he was stooping, I heard him cock a second pistol; I again seized him, threw him on the bed, and wrenched it from his hand; that was loaded with powder and wadding, but no ball, I searched him, and found three sovereigns, seven shillings, eight sixpences, and 7 d. in copper on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - as to the robbery. I have nothing to say for myself, but about the pistols, I have a good deal to say - they were found in my possession, when in a state of intoxication; I bought them when I was intoxicated, and knew not whether they were loaded or not; I testify to you, that I did not know the three balls were in the one - I loaded the other with powder, but did not know how it was loaded, being in a state of intoxication; I have a doctor who will prove that when the least in liquor, I am not in my right reason - I am deranged in my mind - he has attended me for a week in that state; he is not here, nor have I any person to give me a character unless I write twenty-one miles for it; I did not present the pistols to any one but myself, to do myself an injury, being convinced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070078"></xptr>that I was guilty; I have been married seven years.

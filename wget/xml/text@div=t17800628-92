               <p>Please to confine your evidence to what you know relative to the prisoner? - I will go to the circumstance of the first remark I made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280215"></xptr> upon the prisoner at the bar. From the situation I was in I formed a sort of distinction between the mob and the spectators. I observed the prisoner among the people within the circle, appearing to me to incite and instigate that part of the mob, to the best of my recollection, it might then be about half an hour after seven o'clock, which was about half an hour after the mob assembled. I observed him several times changing his situation, and lastly, I think about nine o'clock, I saw some of the keys, which were said to be the keys of Newgate, in the hands of a person, but I cannot identify the person who had the keys; there were four or five together who were genteelly dressed; the prisoner was amongst them; the keys were held up, but by whom I cannot say; but amongst those persons was the prisoner; the keys were carried through the crowd by those people who appeared to draw off towards Smithfield, among whom was the unfortunate black (Bowsey) whom I considered to be the servant of one of those people, and the prisoner; and then I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - I think about nine, rather before than after.</p>
               <p>Did you observe in what clothes the prisoner was dressed? - A dark coloured drab, as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>The same he has on now? - They appeared darker I think.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where did those keys come from which were in the hands of some persons? - They seemed to come from towards the felons door.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner doing any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear that you can so draw the line between the guilty and the innocent spectators as to say who were guilty and who were innocent? - I can in this way, the persons who are innocent stood inactive the others were in action.</p>
               <p>Where those keys came from you cannot say? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was not a mischievous spectator? - No; I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>You did not see him take up the keys? - No, he was in company with one of the persons who had the keys.</p>
               <p>You did not see him do any mischief? - No.</p>

               <p>Was you in the Old Bailey at the time Mr. Akerman's house was destroyed? - Yes. I was at the dining-room window all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any person with large keys? - Yes, I did; I saw a man held up some keys in one hand and his hat in the other huzzaing.</p>
               <p>Did you see that person do any thing else? - No; before I saw him with the keys I saw that person, whom I take to be the prisoner, poking something to the fire with a stick, but I could not see what it was.</p>

               <p>Did you observe how the person was dressed? - In a lightish brown coat, a cocked up hat with a blue cockade in it.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner do you believe that to be the person? - I saw the prisoner come with the mob when it first came; and when I saw the man hold up the keys at the fire and poke something with his stick I thought it was the same man, but I am not certain; I am certain the prisoner is the person whom I saw come with the mob.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you saw the prisoner come with the mob at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see the person who had the keys go into the jail? - I saw a man go into the jail at break of day; I believe it was the person who had the keys, but I am not certain that it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You cannot positively swear to the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>The man you saw with the keys go into the prison at break or day you believe to be the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Every body had cockades almost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The idle, the busy, the wicked, and innocent, all had cockades? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw a great many persons there who were not doing mischief? - I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of were they? - One was a large br key, brighter than the rest.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280216"></xptr>Where did they come from? - I cannot say, I did not see them till the man held them up.</p>

               <p>I keep a wine vault in Market-lane. The prisoner lodged at my house.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on Tuesday evening? - On the night the fire was at Newgate he came to my house in an hackney coach and brought something in his pocket, between six and eight o'clock I believe.</p>
               <p>Are you positive as to the time? - It was about that time, it could not be later than that.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was light; he rattled them in his pocket when he came in and said I have got the keys of Newgate; he put them down upon the top of the table, and after that they were given to the servant, and she carried them up stairs into his own room; what became of them afterwards I do not know. I said, I did not like to have any thing to do with the keys; he desired me to lock them up; he said it was very possible that they might be advertised. He said, Mr. Smith, Mr. Akerman's brother, gave him the keys; I think that was the name.</p>
               <p>You are not sure as to the name? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he said he received them from Mr. Akerman's brother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you certain to the time he came to your house? - Yes; it was between the hours of six and eight; he was very dirty about half way up his leg; he went up into his own room, put boots on, and went out again; the keys were carried up into his own room; I do not know what became of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long did he stay at home? - Not above ten minutes I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did he go out in the coach again? - No, on foot.</p>
               <p>What part of the town is your house in? - Market-lane, the back part of the Opera-house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You seem to say he came home dirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did curiosity never induce you to go out in the time of these riots? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you go out without getting your shoes dirty? - There was no need to dirt one's shoes unless one was amongst some water, where one ought not to be.</p>
               <p>Did he lie at your house that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did he come in? - I cannot tell, I was a-bed.</p>
               <p>What time did he get up in the morning? - I cannot tell, I was not up; the servant can tell you.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it strange of this man if he was gone to burn Newgate, that he should tell you he had the keys of Newgate? - I did think it strange.</p>
               <p>Did not he shew these keys to other people? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Did he not want you to keep the keys till they were advertised? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it strange if he had been concerned in burning Newgate that he should want a person to keep the keys for him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What size were they? - They appeared to me to be large keys.</p>
               <p>You would not touch them for fear they would contaminate you? - I would not come near them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was it after you would have nothing to do with the keys that he said he would advertise them? - No, before.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Akerman; I saw the prisoner come up to the prison gate just after Mr. Akerman's house was broke open. While the mob were burning the goods he reached his hand over with the key in it, and said, D - n your eyes, here is the key of Newgate, open the door. I refused to open the door. He went down and I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where were the keys kept? - In my master's house.</p>
               <p>Are you certain it was the prisoner? - I am positive to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Can you guess what time in the evening this was? - I believe between seven and eight o'clock, it was just after they begun burning the goods, but I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was a very terrible night? - Very terrible.</p>

               <p>There were a great number of people? - A great number.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before in your life? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>A person came up and said here are the keys of Newgate? - The prisoner came up with one single key, the main key of the gate.</p>
               <p>Were these keys thrown out, or how did they get at them? - I cannot say how they were got out of Mr. Akerman's house.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner do any thing else? - No, he demanded the gates to be open; he said he had got the keys of Newgate and he would have the prisoners out.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the gates opened afterwards? - Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock we opened them; the prisoners were all out then. We opened them to get out ourselves.</p>

               <p>You are one of the magistrates whom the prisoner was brought before to be examined? - I was. The prisoner on the first examination was committed solely on account of what passed respecting his having the keys of Newgate. On his second examination the other matters came out relative to what the prisoner said. As to the keys, as far as my memory will serve, he said, he picked them up. He said when he found them to be keys of consequence, he went to Westminster Bridge and flung them into the Thames. I then mentioned to him that I thought that was acting exceedingly wrong, because the reason he gave for flinging them into the Thames was the very reason why he should have kept them, for he might make the parties they belonged to very uneasy on account of the loss of them. He did not say much to that. I asked him whereabouts he threw them in, and whether he threw them in together or singly; I think he said he threw them through the ballus-trades on the right-hand side into the middle of the stream, and he thought that they fell singly. There was a talk of endeavouring to find them, but I believe they have never been found.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner these eight years; he was a fellow-servant with me; he has a very good character, he always conducted himself very well when I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman WOOLDRIGE sworn.</p>
               <p>You was I believe, at the time the riots happened, at Newgate? - I was in the Old Bailey from eight o'clock at night till half after two in the morning. I recollect the prisoner's face and some others who made way for me as I came into the Old Bailey from Ludgate I was at the other end of the town, and heard of the fire at Newgate, I immediately drove to the Old Bailey; as soon as I came to the end of it I saw the prisoner with some other very peaceable, decent looking men. Some said that is Alderman Wooldridge. I desired them to make way for me to come up to Newgate; I remember the prisoner with others taking hold of persons who had sticks in their hands, and making way for me to come up to the prison. Some of the mob, among whom was the prisoner, Desired me to ask the keepers if the rioters were out, that the engine might play against the building. I said I will ask that question and will give you such information as I receive. Then the prisoner called out, Let the engines play, let the engines play against the building. The prisoner and some other men, whose faces I knew, were the persons who made way for me up to Newgate, and walked before me up to the prison door.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me understand you about the enquiry for the engines to play? - One of them, I believe the prisoner, called out That is Alderman Wooldridge, and desired they would make way for me. When I got facing the door of the lodge of Newgate, the prisoner with some others who had conducted me up to the gate, desired the mob to suffer the engines to play.</p>
               <p>They made some enquiry about the rioters being out? - When those persons were conducting me to the prison door, there was a general voice, Let the Alderman go and desire to know whether the rioters are out. I understood by that, that they wanted to know whether the persons were in Newgate; I promised the mob I would go in and come out again, and give them a fair answer; upon that the prisoner with two or three others said that if I would go in they would guard the door (the door at that time was fast) and see that no mischief should happen to me.</p>
               <p>The purpose you were to go in for was to enquire if the rioters were out? - Exactly so. Whilst I stood upon the steps, before the turnkey had opened the door, I heard the prisoners with some others cry out for the engines<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280219"></xptr> to play, and they did so before I went in.</p>
               <p>This was before you brought out any answer whether the rioters were out? - It was before I brought out any answer. I went in; the prisoner with others called out, let the engines play. I only desired the mob to suffer the engines to play that I might go in. In the course of eight or ten minutes I came out again and stood upon the steps of the door and told them that the rioters were all out; in the mean time I desired Pitt to secure the arms in the right hand of the lodge before I would I suffer the door to be opened. When I came the prisoner at the bar with others was standing on the steps telling them the rioters were out I saw the prisoner and the party that conducted me up going quietly away. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Mr. Alderman Wooldridge, I did not want this long story, I only meant to ask one single question, did you at all see the prisoner active or doing any thing in the mob? - If I have not declared the contrary, I do not know what I have said; for I have said that he was a peaceable person, who made way for me through the mob up to the door, and protected me while I was there; I thought him the most peaceable spectator that was there. I shall never think any story too long in any information that I can give for a man in his situation, nor too tedious for a court to hear.</p>

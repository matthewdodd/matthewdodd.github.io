                  </hi>. I am a timber merchant, at No. 36, Windmill Street, near Golden Square. On the night of 2nd Nov. I went to bed about 11 o'clock—my staircase window was one or two inches open—I have a yard in front of my house, in which were two or three ladders—between 3 and 4 o'clock on the following morning I was awoke by what appeared to be a single knock at the street door—I listened and heard a noise below—I got out of bed and opened my bed room door—the sash of the staircase window was thrown wide open—I waited about a minute, and saw a light come on the wall, which disappeared again—I went to the head of the stairs, and saw two men in the kitchen on the ground floor—I called out to them, and then there was a shuffling noise—I stepped back, expecting they would come up stairs, but instead of that they went out of the street door and out of the yard—I ran down, and ran across the yard—when I got into the yard, they had just got outside the gate—they ran down the street; and when I got to the gate they had come back, and were exactly opposite me, and one of them dashed something to the ground—I then ran after them up the street—when they got to the top of the street they divided—one ran one way, and one the other—I followed Jones down Silver Street and down Great Pulteney Street, where he was stopped by a policeman—I never lost sight of him—I went back to my house, and when I got back to where I had heard something thrown down, I saw a tobacco box found—it was not mine—I searched my premises—the key had been taken out of my parlour door, and a desk in the parlour had been broken open—I missed some postage and receipt stamps, and a pair of sugar tongs—two other boxes had been broken open, and a wooden door in front of my safe—I saw a candlestick picked up in the yard; that had been stolen also—a pair of steps was placed against the staircase window, which had been in the gateway the night before—a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was shown to me—I compared it with marks on the iron safe and other things, and they seemed to correspond.</p>

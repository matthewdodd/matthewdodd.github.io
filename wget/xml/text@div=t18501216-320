                  </hi>. I am the minister of Surrey Chapel, and reside in the parsonage attached to it. On a Saturday evening, about the middle of the year 1849, the prisoner came to me—Miss Neale, who lives with me, came up with the prisoner to my study, and she took me off my guard by saying that she had just seen my children at Miss Peek's; that Miss Peek was a particular friend of hers, and had given her a guinea for the case of Miss Elliott, who she was deeply interested in, and wished to get into the Governesses' Benevolent Institution; that Miss Peek had sent her to me, stating that I would assist her in the case by subscribing a guinea to the institution—I said I had wished to subscribe to that institu<lb></lb>tion, and gave her a guinea, which was a subscription from me to be paid by her to the institution—I gave it her, believing what she said was true—she said that Miss Elliott had been her governess, and she had had to support her for a long time, and she was very anxious to get her in at the next election—I then gave her a sovereign for her own case, because she said Miss Peek had sent her to me, and had given her a guinea—she then said she understood I was interested in getting a child into the Orphan Working School—I said I was very much so, and she said she had a great number of proxies at her disposal, that the Lord Mayor had given her his; and she mentioned a great number of individuals, whose names I now forget, whose proxies were at her disposal—she said that if I could assist her with more money in getting this governess into the institution, having these votes at her command, she could ensure the election of the child at the next election, and promised me 2,000 votes for the purpose; and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of the statement she made about the proxies—I went to the election of the Orphan Working School, at the London Tavern; I did not find the prisoner there: I heard her name called by about twenty people I should think—some correspondence took place between Miss Neale and the prisoner previous to the election, but the letters have been destroyed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Ben Johnson, in Shoe-lane. On 26th July the prisoner came there about five minutes before 2 o'clock in the morning—he called for a pint of porter, and gave me a shilling—I gave him a sixpence and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in change, and laid the shilling on the shelf—the prisoner went out, and in about five minutes he came in again, and brought a female in, and he called for another pint of beer—he gave me another shilling, and I gave him in change another sixpence and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, but while the shilling was in my hand I said, "This is a bad one"—I put it on the counter, and bent it—he said, "Is it?" I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me look at it"—I gave it him back, and I said, "You will oblige me by paying for the pint of beer," and he gave me a good shilling—I then said, "Just let me look at that again," and he gave me the bad one back again, and I laid it on the shelf—he said, "Give it me back," but before doing so, I felt the first shilling, and found it was bad, and I said, "They are both bad; I shall give you in charge"—I gave him and the shillings to the constable.</p>

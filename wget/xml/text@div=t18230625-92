            , assignees - many creditors proved under the commission.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINGS. Q. Were the defendants examined before the commissioners - A. Several times, as appears by the proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the assignees go down to Worth, at any time and seize the goods in question - A. I have no knowledge of that, except as communicated to me as a solicitor. I was present at a trial at Horsliam, between Thatcher, against the assignees and the messenger's man, and was a witness. I gave directions after the trial for the goods to be delivered up, in pursuance of an agreement, between Mr. Lee, the defendant's attorney and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not on the trial agree, on the part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250039"></xptr>assignees, that if the verdict was in favour of Thatcher, you would deliver up the goods to him - A. I have no recollection that I did, and do not believe that I did, for it was left as a question for the Jury to say, whether the goods were to be given up, independant of the trespass; I do not believe, that I made any arrangement at the time of trial. Mr. Lee's clerk called on me at the inn, after the trial, and stated that as the Jury had found a verdict for the plaintiff; he presumed I should not detain the goods. I said I should not subject my clients to another action for trespass, but intended to move for a new trial, and instructed a man who had possession of them, to demand them the moment he gave them up. Mr. Baley passed his last examination, on the 1st of March, 1823.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If Mr. Lee's clerk had come to you before the trial, would you have directed that the goods should be delivered up - A. Certainly not. I did so after the trial with a protest,</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that no arrangement took place previous to the verdict - A. I will not swear it, it might; but I do not believe that it did. A broker named Piper was employed to take an inventory of the goods, and he was afterwards employed by Baley, to make up his accounts. I was present at a meeting, when Piper gave some explanation to the accounts, but believe it was not on oath; I was only present part of the time. I asked Baley some questions relating to these goods; the Commissioners said they were not satisfied, but the question of property must be tried elsewhere. I believe my partner paid Thatcher's expences for attending the examination.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you call a witness to attend before the Commissioners, are you not obliged to pay his expenses - A. Certainly. The goods in question were at Worth, at the time of the trial, the messenger under the commission, was in the house with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Are you Mr. Stratton's brother - A. Yes. Mr. Groom the assignee, lives nearly opposite Gerrard's Hall tavern, Basing-lane, which Baley kept. I was at the inn repeatedly doing business on my own account. I went down to Worth one morning by coach. I was not present when any of these goods were packed. I saw a waggon at Worth, on Monday night and assisted in unloading them. I apprehend that some of it was wine by hearing bottles shake. I told my brother of this a week or a fortnight after. Worth is twenty-nine miles from town. Thatcher came down with the caravan, and said he had bought the goods of Baley. I told him to let me know when he paid Baley, because he owed me money; he said he had paid him, and could not help it - the goods were not concealed from me. I said I wanted to get the money paid, which was borrowed of my brother William. I went there to take dimensions for goods at the inn at Worth, of which Thatcher appeared the landlord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you sleep at Worth that night - A. Yes; Baley was a debtor of mine at the time. I went there to measure for goods, and merely lent a hand to unload - the waiter of Worth and the waiter of Gerrard's Hall, were there; it was about eleven o'clock at night. I told Thatcher at the time, that I was a creditor of Baley's, and he said he had got a few articles for his opening dinner. It was a newly established inn. I have signed Baley's certificate - my debt was 107 l. there was no piano-forte in the caravan.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The caravan arrived at eleven o'clock at night - A. Yes; it contained a good many hampers and boxes.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Baley, at Gerrard's Hall inn, before, and after his bankruptcy; he was a tavern keeper, wine and brandy merchant, and traded in wine and brandy. On Friday, the 18th of October last, about eleven o'clock in the morning, he desired me, if any person called, to say he was not within. Mr. Stratton and Mr. Walter called that morning; I knew they were creditors, and denied him to them; he was at home at the time. I informed him I had denied him; he did not blame me; he had told me to deny him, saying, he was ashamed to see so many people enquiring for money. The first time I saw Mr. Thatcher was in September last, when he came to Gerrard's Hall to enquire the character of a bar maid who had lived with Mr. Baley. They appeared then not the least acquainted; he called again in a few days, and resided at the house a night or two, and then went into the country again. When he first came he told me he had taken a new inn at Worth on the Brighton road, and shewed me a plan of the road; he staid at the house two or three days, at first as a guest, and had his meals in the coffee room; he afterwards had his meals in the bar; guests did sometimes dine in the bar. On Sunday evening, the 11th of October, I came home after eleven o'clock; Mr. Baley and Mr. Thatcher were sitting in the bar; the servants went to bed shortly after; I was called into the bar almost as soon as I came in; they seemed glad that I had come; Baley said they had a job they wished me to do for them; I went into the kitchen to supper; the servants went to bed, and Baley called me into the bar about twelve o'clock; they desired me to stay there, for they should want me bye and bye. They went up stairs for an hour or more, then called me up, and desired me to pack some china; there were things packed up before and after I went up; three or four dozen knives and forks, and a great many plated spoons and forks, dishes and covers, sheets, table cloths, crockery, and a silver punch ladle; they were all marked "Gerrard's Hall." The linen was marked with permanent ink. The packing continued till near three o'clock; the things were brought down into the passage leading to the coach office, which was the common passage of the inn. Baley said to Thatcher, "Here's a punch ladle, you may as well have that." Some writing paper was packed up among other things. A van was hired to convey them all to Worth; it was at the house by nine or half past nine o'clock. I and Thatcher went down to Croydon in a return chaise, and joined the van there about two o'clock, and went on with it to Worth; I saw the van call at Mr. Green's, in Bread-street, and know that it called at another place for goods which were never in Mr. Baley's possession. I assisted in taking the goods out of the van at Worth. Mr. Stratton and I returned to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250040"></xptr>town together next day. The piano-forte and wine did not go down with these things.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday morning did any money pass between the defendants - A. Not at that time. I saw money pass between them once - I believe it was on the Wednesday following, or about that time. When I came to town on the Tuesday, two men were packing wine; there were several hampers, and it was sent off in a caravan to Worth. The piano-forte was taken away in Messrs. Clementi's caravan. I do not know where it was going; it was after I came from Worth, that I saw money pass between them - I saw twenty sovereigns at a time, on the bar table, and Thatcher had some more in a bag by his side. On the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday after I came from Worth, I was desired to send for some stamps; a printed pattern was given me to get some like it, but I think plain ones were got. I sent for them - two or three were got I think, but cannot say how many. I took them into the bar - (looking at some stamped receipts,) one like these was shewn to me as a pattern. I know these to be in Mr. Baley's hand writing. (Looking at a letter) this is also his writing. (Looks at a tin cash box;) Mr. Baley had a box like this in pattern and form.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Thatcher first came to enquire about a bar-maid for the inn he was going to start at Worth - A. Yes. I went out at eight o'clock on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not said that Thatcher wanted crockery, wine, and linen to open his inn with - A. Yes. When I first came in Baley was writing in the bar; they ordered more paper twice. They appeared to be taking an account of what things they were packing.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it not be very inconvenient at an inn, to be packing in the day time - A. Yes. The things were all taken up into the room on Saturday - the servants assisted in taking them up. The defendants might have packed them themselves if they chose. The hampers were placed in the passage, which was the most public part of the tavern. The servants and guests must have seen them, and persons in the street might have seen them. Mr. Groom lives nearly opposite. I saw Thatcher pass money to Baley. I was at the trial at Horsham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever ask Thatcher to buy wine - A. When he came about the bar-maid, he waited an hour before Mr. Baley came in; I asked him to take a glass of sherry - he said it was very good; I said I knew my master had a great quantity, and as he was going into business, he could serve him well - at that time my master had not seen him. Mr. Dibbin, the landlord was a creditor; the passage the goods were in leads to the coach office. I dare say the caravan stood before the door two hours being loaded; it might have been done in half an hour if they liked - it was in sight of Mr. Groom's house; two strange men packed the wine. Mr. Baley was at the London coffee-house six years with me; his general reputation was as an honest upright man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The goods were carried up on Saturday - A. I helped to carry some crockery up myself, and put them in the private dining-rooms. Nobody could tell what was in the hampers by seeing them; they were tied with strings. Baley kept a wine book; he merely kept the accounts of tavern dinners in it; it was intended for a wine book, but was not used as one. If I received orders for wine I entered them in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not a permit book kept - A. Yes. Wine going out would be entered there by Baley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever know a caravan hired to convey goods away before - A. No, my Lord. I have known wine sent out two or three hampers at a time. The wine was directed to Thatcher - I cannot say how many hampers there were; there should have been permits for all of it, or it is liable to be seized. The Excise officer comes once a fortnight. Some wine was sent to the West end of the town about the same time as this. I have seen wine sent in a cart to Mr. Clark, beyond Croydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Baley leave himself materials to carry on his business without these - A. Yes; there was a large quantity of things. I have carried it on for the last seven months with what was left.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is not Mr. Dibbin ill - A. He has been ill along time, but was about when this happened; he always slept at Gerrard's Hall; the van was loaded in the street, not in the yard. It was common to load things in the street, but this was a private spring van - nothing is ever loaded from the waggon yard through the passage, except on Sundays, and after dark - the inn gates were open at the time.</p>

            . I am an ironmonger, and a creditor of Baley's; my brother managed the business with him. After the commission was issued, I went to his premises, and found the stock of wine materially reduced. I went down to Worth on the 7th of June, to the tavern, by the coach, with Mr. Groom and Clisby the messenger; we went into the parlour, took some refreshment and stopped there, and found Mrs. Thatcher, there - we called her in, in the evening and made a search, and found several dozens of wine in the cellar - we also found some table cloths marked. "Gerrard's Hall," at full length in indelible ink - the marks on the knives had been ground out - a double branch plated candlestick, and some spoons were all thrown together in a cupboard in the bar, some of them papered up and others not - they were not locked up. Mrs. Thatcher did not like to give up the keys, while Thatcher was out; the sheets we had on at night, were marked in the same way, and the pillow cases; some of the sheets had holes picked in them, as if there had been an attempt to pick the marks out - we found some French wine, and some soy and Noyeau, in a room at the top of the house. Mr. Groom brought a trunk which was opened in my presence, and in it was the tin box produced, these receipts, and this letter (looking at them) were also in it - we left the messenger in possession of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINS. Q, Your brother had informed you, of these goods going down to Worth, a long time before - A. He might say something about it, but I do not think he knew what they were - he did not tell me of it till just before I went down, not till after the commission was issued. The waiter took us into the cellar by Mrs. Thatcher's order; she would not let us go into her own bed-room - I think she said somebody was in bed there, and was very reluctant in admitting us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250041"></xptr>to the room where the French wine was. I saw different goods in different rooms, marked "Gerrard's Hall." There might be twenty bottles altogether of French wine, Noyeau, and some soy. The house was furnished with new furniture - some linen in a washing-tub was marked "Gerrard's Hall;" there were two or three dozen knives in the room where we were; some of the marks were quite effaced - they all appeared to be rough ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Mrs. Thatcher knew perfectly well what you came about - A. Yes. The sheets we slept on were marked; we told her our business about seven or eight o'clock, and went to bed about nine or ten. The pillow I slept on had the mark picked out.</p>

            . I am a creditor of Baley's, and went to Worth with Mr. Stratton and Clisby, on the 7th of January, to the King's Arms, inn, kept by Thatcher; he was not at home. Clisby and I went to the house of one Whitehead, and found the tin box produced, in a box there - we brought it to the inn; Mr. Stratton forced the lock, and found these papers in it. We dined at the inn. The knives and table cloths were marked "Gerrard's Hall;" there appeared to have been an attempt to grind the name off the knives. In the evening we told Mrs. Thatcher our business, and searched the house, and found some plated goods and linen in the bar. We slept in a two bedded room; the bed linen was marked "Gerrard's Hall," and on other beds we found linen marked the same - some marks appeared as if an attempt had been made to take them out. I saw a grand piano there, which I had frequently seen at Gerrard's Hall. We left Clisby in possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did Mr. Stratton remark the table cloth being marked - A. I dare say we talked about it. Some people who came in the coach lunched in the same room, and went on with the coach. I do not recollect seeing any linen not marked Gerrard's Hall; some of the marks were picked out, but part of the letters left left; several appeared torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. At the trial at Horsham, was it not agreed on both sides, that in the event of a verdict for the plaintiff the goods should be delivered up - A. I believe there was something of the kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your house is nearly opposite Gerrard's Hall - A. Yes. I was a creditor at the time the goods were moved.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You was only a creditor a few months before - A. No; he only commenced business in March, and never paid me any money. I do not recollect seeing the caravan at the inn; I was told of it about the time that he became bankrupt. He owed me 140 l. for repairs of his house.</p>

            . I am messenger under the commission. On the 7th of January, I went to Worth, and found the principal part of the linen marked "Gerrard's Hall," and about ten dozen knives and forks, the marks in which had been ground down, but were visible. Some of the table linen appeared to be scraped. I found a quantity of plated candlesticks and branches thrown in the corner of the cupboard, like rubbish; I found a vast quantity of wine in the cellar, principally port; some wine and sauces in the top-room. I was left in possession a short time. Thatcher came down on the 9th, and on the 11th I was succeeded by another messenger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINS. Q. Did you take an inventory of the goods - A. No. I had no authority to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you know Gerrard's Hall goods - A. By the marks. There were no marks on the sheets or pillow I slept on.</p>

            . I was waiter at the Kings Arms at Worth from the time it opened. I remember goods coming down in the van early in October. Thatcher was not at home when they were opened; they contained crockery, plated goods, knives, forks, hard-ware, and a basket of linen was taken up stairs. "Gerrard's Hall" was stamped on the knives - there were some plated dessert forks; a very handsome castor stand, egg stands, two dozen tea spoons, ten candlesticks and branches, four plated dishes and covers, a dozen and a half of cups and saucers, a breakfast service, articles of china, and five or six dozen plates and dishes. I saw the linen afterwards - it was marked "Gerrard's Hall." I saw some of the table linen afterwards, smeared, so that I could not discover the mark as before. Thatcher saw them unpacked, and told me that they came from Gerrard's Hall. On the Thursday after that fifteen hampers of wine came down in the same van - I should think there were three or four dozen in each hamper; there was no wine in the house besides that, either before or after. Thatcher told me it came from Gerrard's Hall. A piano-forte afterwards came down in Messrs. Clementi's caravan. There were two or three pair of very coarse sheets, which did not come from Gerrard's Hall. There were no plated articles but what came from there. An opening dinner was proposed, but it did not take place; at the time it was to have been a quantity of knives were sent to a blacksmith, to erase the marks. Mr. Baley was at the King's Arms, inn before and at the time the piano came, he appeared at first as a guest, but afterward had intercourse with Mr. Thatcher, and did not at times conduct himself as a guest, particularly on the 9th of November, when he assisted in getting up the dinner - he used the piano-forte himself, and nobody else. I believe he kept the key; he was in town when the assignees came down. I saw a trunk brought from Whitbread's, who was Baley's servant; he lived a little below the King's Arms, inn. I directed the assignees to his house. I have seen the trunk they brought away in Baley's possession, at the King's Arms, (looking at a letter,) I have seen Thatcher write, and am sure this is his writing. I had known him about a fortnight before I went to live there; he wished me to deposit 150 l. in his hands, and take a share in the posting business. I had not the money, but deposited 20 l. as security for glass and my good conduct about three weeks after I entered his service, which was in September. I never saw any large sum in his hands; he was not an opulent man - quite the reverse. I was with him nearly five months, and got my 20 l. back, by three or four different payments, the last of which was 6 s.; I have lent him a pair of small clothes and a handkerchief at times, and particularly to wear when he went to take out his licence; application was frequently made for small sums of money, and not paid. Baley was at the house for two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250042"></xptr>days together - a bill was made out for him, the first or second time of his coming, but was never paid. I received all bills, and never heard of this being paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. He dined in the bar - A. Sometimes. I never recollect customers dining in the bar, they have had bread and cheese there, and paid Thatcher for it; the goods were all used publicly at the inn - when I went into the house, there was nothing there but what was mine; some upholstery afterwards came down, and furniture from different people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Gerrard's Hall, was a well furnished inn - A. What rooms I have seen were; no furniture came from there except the piano. I only saw eight or twelve dozen of knives, all of which had the name erased. I frequently asked him for money before the assignees came, as I wanted to leave, as his situation did not suit me. I only waited to get my deposit. I never quarreled with him particularly. He once set Whitbread to carry a tub, and having hurt himself, I said he did not treat him like a christian.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether you quarreled or not, did he produce you as a witness at Horsham - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith, and live at Worth, at the latter end of the last year, I ground the marks out of about a hundred and fifty-six knives, for Thatcher; the marks were "Gerrard's Hall Tavern." I was told to grind it out; it was so deep in some, I could not, my charge was 3 s. 6 d.; I applied for it two or three times, but could not get it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CUMMINS. Q. Was there not a dispute about your account - A. Yes; my account was 2 l. 16 s.</p>

            . I was formerly proprietor of the King's Arms-inn, at Worth. Thatcher took it of me without a premium. I saw Baley there when the piano arrived. I helped to carry it up; Baley said it was a fine piece of music and cost him 150 l.; he took the key from the man who brought it. I saw him about the house three or four times, and thought him a guest at first, but afterwards he appeared more like a master; he had fowls there, and bought corn of me which he paid for himself. Thatcher appeared to have no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You gave the place up to him - A. Yes; he had tap and all, and I became hostler. Thatcher was not present when Baley took the key of the piano.</p>

            . I know Thatcher; he had a farm in Berkshire, which he left at Lady-day, 1822; he told me his stock was taken for the rent; and when he took this inn, he said if somebody would lend him 500 l., he thought he should do better than at farming.</p>
               <p>The documents found in the defendant Baley's box were here read. There were three receipts to J. Thatcher, signed T. W. Baley, for the sums of 46 l. 11 s., 61 l. 4 s., and 30 l., for the various articles mentioned in the evidence, and another for 106 l. 10 s. for wines, with the bills annexed; also the following letter, proved to be in the band writing of the defendant Thatcher, the post mark of which was 11th of October, 1822, addressed to Mr. Baley, Gerrard's Hall, Basing-lane:-</p>
               <p>"White Horse Cellar.</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - Not having the pleasure of seeing you before I left, I shall feel obliged to you or John to send thirty cards by Pearson's man, he will call for them, for the Gloster Coffee-house. I hope to see you by Monday morning, and hope you will, in the interval, get what cash you possibly can together, as every day is a great loss to us, as on Monday next I wish to have some refreshment ready for the coach, and if you have any thing you can send, Steadman calls on Tuesdays and Fridays: but whatever you do, for God's sake, keep it to yourself, and not let John or any one know our concerns, as it is for your own good hereafter, as you will always find I do every thing for the best interest of both parties, for if one do bad the other does the same, for it is like man and wife. I think I should tell John's wife, when you have done with her, she may go and see her friends for a few weeks, for the more strangers about us at first the better; they know nothing, and then there is no talking, and so you will find it.</p>
               <p>Yours, amp;c.</p>
               <p>"J. THATCHER.</p>
               <p>"P.S. I wrote this last night for the waiter to put in the post to-morrow, and destroy it as soon as read. Excuse haste: the ladies I shall employ are steady, middle-aged, and most respectable."</p>

               <p>MR. CUMMINS to MR. STRATTON. Q. When you went to Worth did you take possession of these goods on the supposition that Baley was in partnership with Thatcher - A. Not exactly so; we took possession of them because we found not only the bills, but the receipts in Baley's cash box, and therefore concluded if he had been paid for them he would not be in possession of the bills and receipts. I told the messenger to seize only those things marked "Gerrard's Hall," but he said he knew his business better than I did.</p>

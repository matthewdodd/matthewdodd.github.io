               <p>Q. Were you at home when your house was broken open and the property stolen - A. I was, my son was at home, my wife and servant. On Thursday the 8th of March, between the hours of twelve and one in the day time, I was in my accompting-house adjoining my shop backwards; I was there writing; there is a glass door between the shop and the accompting house with a curtain, the curtain was half drawn; my son had just come in before and shut the shop door after him, my wife had been sitting in the shop untill about two minutes before this business happened; I thought I heard a noise in the shop, I turned my head, I saw the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the man you saw was the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I saw him in the act of folding up the goods as they lay on the counter. I was surprized within myself, thinking whether I had sent for the cloth-worker to come and dress them, I recollect and had not; the prisoner left the shop, I followed him into the street, he walked very deliberatly up the street, I do not think he saw me; I did not speak to him untill I got up to him he had not got more than fifteen yards, he was just going to turn into the gate of the Church-yard when I came up to him; my intention was to knock him down; he just saw me, and dropped the goods in the street and ran off; I gave the alarm, he got a little the head of me; he escaped across the Church-yard, and ran into Rose street: he there came in contact with a man and was throwed down, he got up and went up Bird-in-hand-court, there he was stopped; I was not in sight, I came up about three minutes after he was taken. I laid hold of him, and insisted upon his going to Bow-street; he said, do not hurt me, Sir, he was secured; my son picked up the cloth.</p>

            When you went back did you find any of your premises broken - A. No, the latch had been lifted up, it is a common latch, he must have opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. However you were not in the shop to see it was actually closed - A. No, nor do I know the latch was actually closed, none of the windows were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of cloth was it - A. Twenty-two yards of superfine blue cloth, I value it at 35 l. I set it down 32 l. It cost me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner carry away the cloth from the shop - A. I did, and I knew it was blue cloth, it come in the shop only the day before. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

            Yes, I was in the accompting house when the prisoner came into the shop, I saw him going out of the shop with the cloth in his hand: I am sure the prisoner is the man; my father walked gently after him, when my father came up to him the prisoner turned round and looked at my father, and his countenance changed, he dropped the goods and ran off; I picked up the cloth and took it home; I went out again and saw him in custody, I knew the cloth to be my father's.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SMITH. I am shopman to Mr. Roberts, a linen-draper opposite of Mr. Attwood's house. On the morning mentioned in the indictment I was with Mr. Roberts in our shop, we noticed the piece of blue cloth in the prisoner's arms; Mr. Attwood followed him, we thought all was not right; I heard him cry out stop thief; I immediately ran out, and pursued the prisoner until he was stopped, and when I came up to him I took charge of him; I lost sight of him in the court, and at the turning of Rose-street; I am certain he is the man, I saw him come out of Mr. Attwood's shop with the cloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the cloth, it is mine, I have had it ever since, I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cloth has grown, has got four yards bigger since I came from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. That is very impertinent of you, you are tried upon a capital charge; the question is whether you stole it all. - A. No, Sir, I did not.</p>

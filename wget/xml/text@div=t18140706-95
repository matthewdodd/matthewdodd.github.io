On the 30th of June, from suspicion, I marked some silver, three three-shilling tokens and a eighteen-penny token. I gave it to Mr. Hook to lay out at the shop to try the prisoner's honesty. I waited in Burr-street for Mr. Hook to come to me, and tell me what money he had laid out. Mr. Hook went to my shop, returned, and said he had laid out ten shillings and sixpence.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060050"></xptr>I then went to my shop, and examined the till, and found only an eighteen-penny token and two three-shilling pieces I went to the police office with Mr. Hook, got an officer, and after that saw the prisoner at Mr. Nicolls's, in the Highway I said, William, there is a three-shilling token missing, I suspect you have it. He said, no, I might search him. He was searched; the three-shilling piece was not found He then said, I will tell you the truth; the three-shilling piece is not about me; I gave it to a friend of mine in Nightingale-lane In consequence of what he said I found the three-shilling piece at a house kept by a man of the name of Dickons, the corner of Old Gravel-lane. Dickons went up stairs and fetched a three-shilling piece down that had not any mark on it. The prisoner then said, bring the three-shilling piece down that I brought to you. Dickons went and fetched the marked three-shilling piece, and gave it me. He said the prisoner gave it him that evening to save for him. The officer has the three-shilling token.</p>

His master came to me in about twenty minutes afterwards; I delivered one to his master that was not marked I did not know there was any mark upon it. I brought down another; that was claimed by Mr. Whitbread. The prisoner asked me to bring down the three-shilling piece that he gave me.</p>

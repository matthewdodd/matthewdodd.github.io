The witness gave me the shilling—I saw the prisoner in the shop—he was the person who gave the shilling—after my young man was gone for a policeman, the prisoner told me he took it at Hungerford-market, for carrying oysters—I said, "Have you got any more?"—he said, "No"—he then threw the thread on the counter, and said, "I don't want your thread," and tried to go out of the shop—I said, "You are not going," and I took hold of him—he was very violent, and I think would have got from me, but one of my young men jumped over the counter, and pushed him some distance up the shop—he then threw himself on the floor—I saw him put his hand to his mouth, but I did not see any thing in his hand—the young man who had hold of his collar said, "He is swallowing something, sir"—the prisoner then began to kick, and was very violent—I said, "You had better take him into the bonnet-room at the back of the shop"—they took him there till the officer came—I then marked the shilling, and gave it to the officer.</p>

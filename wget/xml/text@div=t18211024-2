On Thursday last, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went out, leaving nobody in the house. It was not quite dark, but nearly so. I have a family, but my wife was in the country. I locked and bolted both the back and front doors, came out at the front door, and took the key with me. I went to the Duke of Clarence, public-house, and went home at a quarter before eleven o'clock; I put the key in the door, gave it one turn, and found it on the single<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240004"></xptr>lock, but not doubly locked as I left it. I am quite sure I doubly locked it. I found the back door unbolted, and on the latch - I am sure I did not leave it so. I missed a timepiece off the mantle-shelf down stairs. I went up stairs, found four drawers quite empty, and pulled out - they had contained sheets, gowns, and other things, which were all gone.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I had left home the night before this happened. I never saw the prisoner before. When I went away I left seven cotton gowns, two pair of sheets, two pair of cotton stockings, four shifts, and other things, all safe - the timepiece was worth 30 s. - I had had it about a year, my father gave it to me - it was an old watch which he had put into a pedestal. I should think all the property was worth 10 l. I lost twelve napkins, my husband's coat, a silver tea-spoon, and some petticoats and frocks.</p>

            . I am a constable. About a quarter before twelve o'clock last Thursday night, I and Wright, the patrol, met the prisoner and another man in the New-road, between a quarter and half a mile from the prosecutor's, coming from that way; after they had passed we observed the prisoner had a bundle under his coat, Wright ran and caught hold of him, the other ran off; I asked him what he find in his bundle, he said shirts and sheets that he had from his little brother at the corner of the square (he did not say what square), and he was going to take them to his mother, at Bermondsey - he was not in the road to Bermondsey. I took his hat off, and found a gown and child's frock in it. The other man was taller than the prisoner. He said he did not know the person whom we saw with him - that he was a stranger, and was not with him. I have no doubt of their being together; one of them was singing, and the other as close to him as possible - they nearly touched each other. We took him to the turnpike-gate, and examined the bundle. He had the coat on. I did not find the timepiece.</p>

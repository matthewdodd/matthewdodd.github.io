                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Clark, and live in Castle-street, Leicester-square. The prisoner lodged there for three years with a man who passed as her husband—they slept there last on the 26th of July, and left the door locked—I had it broken open, and missed the articles stated—I met the prisoner, on the 29th, in Plumtree-street—she asked what was amiss, and said she had left the place as she found it—she owed me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when she left—her husband was a shoemaker, I believe—I have known her three years—I have heard her say she has a daughter, but I do not know her—I have since heard the prisoner has a husband in the piano forte line—she says now it was not her husband that she lived with in my house, but I did not know it before—she gets her living by going out to wash and clean—they slept there the night the things were taken.</p>

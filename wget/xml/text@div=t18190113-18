            . I am shopman to Mr. Turner, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Brydges-street, Covent-garden. On the 14th of November, the prisoner brought sixteen yards of sarsnet, which he wanted to pledge. I asked him who it belonged to? He said to his aunt. I told him to go and fetch her. He went away and did not return until the Tuesday following, and then brought a woman who he said was his aunt; she wanted to know why I stopped the sarsnet. I said I was sure it did not belong to him. She said she would go to Bow-street, and make us deliver it up to her - they both went away. I heard nothing more until the prisoner was in custody - I kept the silk, and have had it ever since.</p>

I employed Bishop to make the sarsnet for me, it is my property, I have no doubt but that produced is part of the same, it corresponded with the part at home where it had been cut; sixty-two yards had been cut from it - it cost me 2 s. 6 d. a yard.</p>

            . As I was going off the Change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175809130011"></xptr> about the 29th of June, Mr. Barnes took hold of the collar of my coat, and told me I had lost something; I put my hand into my pocket and found I had lost my handkerchief; Mr. Barnes had hold of the prisoner with his other hand, and said this person has got your handkerchief; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and pull'd out a handkerchief, and said this is all I have; and my handkerchief was then at his feet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barnes. On the 29th of June, I saw this gentleman going off the Change, with another gentleman; the prisoner put his hand, or part of his hand into his pocket, and took it out and then put it into his own. I took the liberty to take Mr. Fenwick fast by the coat, and likewise the prisoner; I asked him if he had lost any thing, he after some little time, said he had lost his handkerchief; then I said, this man, (meaning the prisoner ) has got it. Soon after we saw it lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner time enough to have taken it out of his pocket and drop it down, before you saw it on the ground?</p>
               <p>Barnes. Yes, he had time enough to have dropped it and more, before I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, he took his hand out of Mr. Fenwick's pocket, and put it in his own so quick, that I did not see any thing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker and engraver, of 4, Upper Smith Street, Northampton Square—on 17th June the prisoner came to my house, accompanied by a man named Zelman—I had never seen the prisoner before—I have known Zelmau for three or four years perhaps—I am not perfectly certain of the time; he introduced the prisoner to me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230035"></xptr>
               <p>I am referring to some notes which were made at the time, at least two or three days after the prisoner first visited me; they were made under the instructions of Inspector Foulger—Zelman said, "This is a friend of mine, who I think I can introduce to you to do some business"—I asked him what description of business it was—he said it was some engraving—I said, "It is perfectly uncertain whether I can do it or not without you explain yourself more fully and thoroughly"—he said it was to engrave a plate—I asked what for, and Zelman, I think, said, "Show him the note"—the prisoner then handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of the Union Bank of Scotland—(I afterwards gave it back to the prisoner)—I said, "It is a very serious matter, a thing of this sort, not to be undertaken very lightly"—he said there was very little chance of detection in the affair, in fact none, and it was a very good chance of making a deal of money; he said I was to receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for engraving the plate in the first instance if I agreed to do it, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the plate was finished—he said the reason there was such a slight chance of detection was that there were only four persons in it; they were himself, Zelman, the banker from Australia for whom the notes were intended, and myself—I asked him how many notes he thought of printing if he procured the plate, and he said 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would be impossible to find it out for twelve months, as the voyage to and from Australia would take that time before it could be detected—I told him I could give him no answer then, but I would see Zelman the next day if he would call at my place—Zelman introduced him by the name of Johnson; at least he was not exactly introduced by name, but it was mentioned incidentally during the evening that his name was Johnson—Zelman called him <hi rend="italic">Charlie</hi> at the time—next day, Tuesday, the 18th, I saw Zelman, but not the prisoner—on the 19th Zelman came to my house and told me I was to meet the prisoner in the City Road, near the Eagle—he went with me and we met the prisoner—he asked me if I would engrave the plates—I said, "Yes"—he asked how long it would take to do them—I said about six weeks, I thought—he said that was too long, I must do it in less time—I said I did not think I possibly could—he asked me if I could get the paper for the notes when the plate was en<lb></lb>graved—I said I was not quite certain, and he gave me then the size of the sheet required for a double note—they are printed in twos, of which he seemed to be aware—he asked me if I should want some money before I started on the plates—I said yes, and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold; at the same time he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch note for the purpose of engraving the plate, as a pattern to work to—(that note was afterwards changed by the engraver at a money-changer's at the West End for another more legible)—he asked me if I could do the printing myself, or how it would be best to arrange about the printing—I said it would be dangerous, of course, to employ an ordinary printer in a thing of this sort—he said, "Well, then, we must try and do it ourselves"—I said I could give him no decided answer then whether or no I could do it; that would be an after consideration—I gave Zelman half of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—next day, Thursday, the 20th, I met Zelman at half-past nine in the morning, and we went to the Moor Lane Police Station—I inquired for Inspector Foulger, and was referred to Bow Lane—I went there and saw him, and he gave me directions how to act in this matter—since that time, until the prisoner was apprehended, I have acted entirely under his directions—during that period I saw him nearly every day, and also Mr. Mullens, the solicitor engaged in this case—after leaving the inspector I went to Hughes and Kiraber's, copper plate and printing</p>

               <p>material manufacturers, in Fetter Lane—Zelman was with me, but I forget whether he went into the place or not—I there bought a copper plate, the size of the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I saw the prisoner afterwards that same day in the neighbourhood of the City Road, close by the Eagle—I showed him the plate and arranged to meet him again on the 22nd—I did not do so—it was afterwards arrauged that I should give Zelnun notice when I wanted to see him—I next saw him on the 24th with Zelman, at my bouse—I showed him the plate, which then had a portion of this ornamental scroll engraved on it—he showed me a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch note on that occasion—he thought the signature of the cashier of the bank was more distinct and easier to copy than that on the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, it being very dirty and rather obliterated—I have not got that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it was impossible to have copied that, as it was a different size from the one on the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him for some money and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards gave Zel<lb></lb>man 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I saw the prisoner on Tuesday, 25th June, and on Saturday, the 29th—on 3rd July I saw him again, I then had the plate with me; Zelman was with him—I showed him the plate—it was further advanced not completed—he asked me if it was necessary to have a press for taking the proofs off, and afterwards, of course, for the printing, and I said, "Yes, as soon as possible"—he said he would put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwell News</hi> for one—he asked me if I could get the paper, and I said most likely I could get it at Birmingham—afterwards, on that same day, I went again to Hughes and Kimber's for another plate to engrave the front of the note—this is the plate I bought (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>),—on 4th July I saw the prisoner again—I showed him this plate and the other as well, and he found some fault with the scroll ornament—it was not quite correct, not perfectly agreeing with the pattern note—on 5th July I saw him again in the evening, and he said I was to go to Birmingham the next day, Satur<lb></lb>day, and he said I was to write to Zelraan's address, 57, Herbert Street, if I wanted to write, and he would hold himself in constant communication with Zelman, and would get the letter immediately—on 6th July I went to Birmingham; the prisoner came to my house with Zelman, and accom<lb></lb>panied me to the station and saw me go—he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave Zelman a portion of it—I stayed at Ballivant's Hotel, Carr's Lane, High Street, Bir<lb></lb>mingham—I wrote a letter to the prisoner, addressed to Zelman, from Bir<lb></lb>mingham—I have a copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">Read; notice to produce the original had been given</hi>:—"7th July.—I enclose a sample of the goods you require, but I think they are a little too heavy. They were made for the Russian market. The price is higher than I thought; the party thinks they would be 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 2000 pieces, the quantity you require, but I have induced him to do them for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the time they will take will be twenty-four days to get the quantity you waut.

I received this telegram purporting to come from Zelman—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"Please apply National and Provincial Bank for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

On Friday, 13th July, I went with the prisoner to Mr. La Riviere, in Clifton Street, Finsbury—that was in answer to an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerke<lb></lb>nwell News</hi>, and in the prisoner's presence I selected a lithographic press and a copper-plate press—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner paid a sovereign down, and said he would pay the rest when he fetched them away—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Simpson—Mr. La Riviere asked me what name, aud I said Simpson—the presses</p>

Inspector Foulger—this is the letter, it is not my writing—I don't know whose it is, it was given to me by Mr. Foulger—I enclosed it in an envelope directed to myself, inside another envelope, to a person in Birmingham, for the purpose of putting it through the Birmingham post. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Handsworth, Birmingham. Sir,—Please come and see me as soon as you possibly can, as the goods I am making for you are a deal of trouble, and I want your advice about them; there would have been part of them ready but for this difficulty. Yours truly, N.") I showed that letter to the prisoner; he said the delay was very inconvenient, and I had better write again immediately and try and ascer<lb></lb>tain what the difficulty was—I afterwards wrote another letter to the same person in Birmingham, under Inspector Foulger's direction, to be put through the post in the same way; it was returned to me in the same way, and it was shown to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "23rd July, 1867. Dear Sir,—I think a personal interview would-be better, as I can hardly explain by letter what the difficulty is. Hoping to see you soon, I remain, yours truly, N.") I afterwards saw the prisoner at 76, Gray's Inn Road, where the presses had been taken, several times, nearly every day—I saw him take some impressions off the copper plate—I got the engraving of the front plate done—I engraved neither of the plates myself, I got them both done—I last saw the prisoner on 3rd August at 76, Gray's Inn Road, where the presses were—the plates were there then—he was taking some proofs from the plates when I left the room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Inspector</hi>). On 20th June the witness Smith came with Zelman to me at the Bow Lane Station—Smith made a statement to me, and I gave him instructions how to act—I afterwards saw him and Zelman on the 26th June, and frequently since, and have communicated throughout with Mr. Mullens, the solicitor—I was present when the prisoner was apprehended—he was searched—he had these two copper plates in his breast pocket—I heard Moss examined at the Mansion House—he then gave a correct account of what passed.</p>

I am a coffee-house keeper at the corner of Cross Street, Westmoreland Place, City Road—I have known the prisoner three or four months, as a customer merely—I did not know him by any name in particular; we called him "Scotch Charley," because we did not know his name—on the 8th July he came there and I went with him to the New North Road, and took a bus to the Bank—he spoke to a constable, and then went to a telegraph office in Cornhill—we then went to a tele<lb></lb>graph office in Founder's Court, Lothbury—he went in and I waited outside—when he came out he told me he had remitted some money to Birminghnm, and if I saw Sam (<hi rend="italic">that was Zelman</hi>) I was to tell him he bud remitted the money—it was either 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

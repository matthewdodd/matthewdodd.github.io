                  </hi>. I am clerk in the Parlia<lb></lb>ment office of the House of Lords—I have a room communicating with Lord Shaftsbury's room, and by another door with an anti-room. On the 2nd of April, a little before five o'clock, I left my room—I am not certain whether I closed my door, I generally do so—I noticed my coat in my room the day before, hanging on a peg—in half or three quarters of an hour I returned by the anti-room to my own room—as I was going in I saw the back of a man going out by the door leading to Lord Shaftsbury's room—I went to that door—I heard the handle of Lord Shaftsbury's door, leading to the anti-room, move—I returned through my own room to the anti-room, an met the prisoner as coming from Lord Shaftsbury's room—I am not able to say whether he had a coat with him, it is possible—he met me and said, "Do you want a lamp, sir?"—(it was perfectly light)—him there before—I told him, "No"—he left the anti-room—I then went to my own room, and found the coat was gone—I communicated my loss to Moyes—I then went into the passage of the house, and met the pri<lb></lb>soner coming from the direction of the coal-cellar—the coat now produced is mine, and the one which was hanging in my room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Father and Joy, contractors for lighting the Houses of Parliament. I have the superintendence of the men there—the prisoner was employed as a labourer, to assist in cleaning the lamps—about five o'clock in the evening, on the 2nd of April, a com<lb></lb>munication was made to me—I had some business to attend to, after which I went into the general lamp-room, which is at a different part of the house to Mr. Adams—it was the prisoner's duty to bring every night three lamps to the general lamp-room—on going there I found them—it was earlier than they are usually brought—I then went towards Mr. Adams's room—there is a coal-cellar near there—the prisoner has business there between one and two o'clock, after that he has very rarely any busi<lb></lb>ness</p>

               <p>there—it is usual to have a lamp at that door, but I found no lamp—I called out, "Halloo, who is there?"—in a minute after the prisoner cane running up the stairs and said, "It is me, Mr. Perry"—he appeared con<lb></lb>fused—I asked what he was doing there—he said he had merely come in to see if they wanted any assistance—I asked him where Scrivener was—he said in the lobby—I and the prisoner came out into Palace Yard—I let him go on, and returned to the coal-cellar—I got a light, and found the coat lying on some coals or coke, in a corner of the cellar—I took posse<lb></lb>sion of it, and then went to the general lamp-room, and found the prisoner and two or three more persons—I asked him if he had been into Mr. Adams's room about a lamp—he said he bad—I said, "You know very well you have no business, to go there, how is it?"—he said the lamp wanted cleaning, or something, I could not make out—I then told him a coat had been stolen, and he was suspected—he said, did I think him a thief? and many other observations, which I cannot recollect—I told him I had found the coat, and I found him in a place where he ought not to have been, and it appeared very suspicious—he still denied it—I did not think myself authorized to do any thing—I saw him afterwards in company with some other men, who were saying, "You must have taken the coat, Mr. Adams saw you in his room"—I heard him say, "Well, I have stolen the coat, and who can," or "they can't prove it against me, for no one saw me take it"—he said he took it to pay for some liquor which he had lost in a skittle-ground—previous to that I had told him to go away, and not show himself again—he claimed his wages—I did not pay him—I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Mr. Joy.</p>

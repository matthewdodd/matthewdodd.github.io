               <p>Q. Did she live with Smith - A. I have seen them together frequently; she asked me to be so kind as to get a place to put them in. I asked the people of the house, they gave me liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. You got leave to put them in the public house - A. Yes; at the Northumberland Arms, Old Artillery ground.</p>

About 2.15 on Saturday afternoon, I saw the prisoner Hooper go to a broker's shop, and I watched him—he remained there some time, and when he got a little way from the house I stopped him, and said I should take him into custody—I found on him six teaspoons, with initials on them corresponding with the initials on the ether property—he made no remark at the time—I took him to the station—he afterwards sent for me to the cell, and made a statement to me which I took down in writing, and he signed as a voluntary statement—I read it over to him and he said it was correct (<hi rend="italic">Statement read</hi>: "Robert Hooper, 7, Adams' Mews, Grosvenor Square. Molyneux Street Police-station, April 5th, 1868. A young man called <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> came in on Saturday morning, about 9.30, and sent up for me. I was in bed at the time. I sent for him to come to me. He asked me if I had got a bag to lend him; I gave him one. I dressed myself, and we went out together. He went away, and I waited till he returned, and we went home together. He asked me to take charge of the bag, and I put it under the bed. He then took six spoons from his pocket, and gave them to me to sell. I was then taken into custody. The bag and contents is now locked in my room, but I do not know what it contains. The man is suspected to live in North Row, on the left side. This statement is made by me, Robert Hooper.")—I then went to the room of the prisoner, and found all the property now produced in a bag under the bed, with the exception of the six spoons—they were identified by the prosecutor—I went to Pembridge Gardens, and examined some footmarks with the prisoners' boots—I found four different footprints, and I made an impression on each side with the boots of both the prisoners, and they corresponded exactly—they were the footprints of two persons.</p>

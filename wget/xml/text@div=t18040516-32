               <p>Q. He is indicted for stealing a quantity of penny-pieces and half-pence, did they belong to you? - A. They belonged to me; it was not property that was taken in the trade; I have one partner; there was a pair of shoes that belonged to me, and and a paper of pins; the money was taken out of a caddy.</p>

               <p>- DEWELL sworn. - I am a neighbour: I heard the noise about eleven o'clock at night, and went to Mrs. Lucas; she informed me there were some thieves; I took a candle and went into the shop, and could find no one; I went up stairs into the second floor, and found the prisoner under a half-press bedstead; I took him from under it, and put him under my arm and carried him to the watch-house; I saw him searched, and there was about 7 s. 6 d found upon him.</p>
               <p>- HAWTHORN sworn. - I was constable of the night: I searched him in the presence of the last witness; I found 3 s. 6 d. in penny-pieces in his coat pocket, and 4 s. in half-pence; I found one shoe in his pocket, and a parcel of pins in papers; the watchman, when it came to be day-light,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160025"></xptr>brought the other shoe out of Grafton-street to the watch-house.</p>

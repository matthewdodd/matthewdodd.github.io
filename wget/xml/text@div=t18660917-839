                  </hi> (City Police 572). On 30th August, about half-past one o'clock, I was on duty at the water-side, Upper Thames Street—I saw the two prisoners, the prosecutor, and about five or six more people—the prisoners were standing on each side of the prosecutor—the prosecutor said he had lost his watch, and believed one of the prisoners had it—the prosecutor handed me the watch, and said, "This man gave it to me, saying that he didn't know how it came in his pocket"—that was Cotton—the prosecutor said that one of them had taken it and. passed it to the other—he pointed out the other prisoner—I took them to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, John Street, Adelphi, and am secretary to the Operatives' Housebuilding Company—on the 30th August I was near the steamboat pier—I saw both the prisoners—Cotton was on my left hand—he did not give the name Cotton at the police-station—Jackson was in front of me, with his back turned to me—I was looking at a man selling pictures—there was a crowd of about twenty people—nobody, was on my right hand—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I felt a slight tug at my watchguard, and looked down and saw the guard hanging down—the watch was gone—Cotton was near to me—I charged him with taking my watch—as I charged him I saw his left hand pass in a secret manner in front of me—if he had moved his hand from the shoulder I should not have called it a secret manner—he moved it forward from the wrist—when I saw his hand move in this way I said, "You must have passed it to some one else if you haven't got it"—I insisted upon having the watch—Jackson turned round on that, with the watch in the palm of his hand, and said, "Is this your watch, sir? I found it in my pocket, but I am sure I cannot tell how it came there"—he had said nothing before—he had stood unusually silent—a few minutes elapsed before he turned round with the watch—when Cotton saw it given to me he went a little way towards the steamboat pier, as if going away, and he came back with the crowd with a policeman—I then gave them both in charge.<hi rend="largeCaps">JACKSON</hi>.**—<hi rend="smallCaps">

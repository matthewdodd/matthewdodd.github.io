I am a collar maker at 5, King Street, Finsbury—Carter is my apprentice—in consequence of information, he was taken into custody, and I went with Miller and Inspector Maynard to Shaw's premises, and saw in the cellar about 10 collars, and identified six—they were all new except one, which appeared to have been on a horse about twice, and not fitting was returned—I also identified some leather with my mark upon it, and some hemp which had been made expressly for me by Mr. Henry Cox—I had not sold the collars, the leather, or hemp, or given Carter authority to sell things or take them away—I had missed property of this description it various times—I did not know Shaw personally, and had no dealings with him.</p>

               <p>I was going home from spending the evening, about one o'clock in the morning. I was in liquor. I met the woman (prisoner); she picked me up; I consented to go to her lodging. When I went there, I wanted her to get a light: she said she could not get one: we went up in the dark: she undressed, and asked me to undress; I pulled off my breeches and shoes, and laid down on the bed. Then the man (prisoner) rushed out of another room, and asked me what I did with his wife? He threw me out of the room without my breeches, and only one shoe on; then my breeches and shoe were thrown out after me: there was a guinea and some silver missing. I gave her 2 s. when I went up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110138"></xptr> and am sure the rest of the money was in my breeches.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I had been at a hard day's work: I was kept out late. This gentleman was with some woman in Petty-France, Westminster. He followed me, and said, How do you do? I have known you seven years. I said, No, Sir, you never knew me in your life. He said, Where are you going? Said I, Home to my husband. He asked, where could he lay? I bid him not follow me, or I would call the watch. He walked by the side of me. When I came to my door, he said I was his wife. My husband is not a man that is out of nights. I went up; the gentleman followed me, and pulled off his clothes. I asked him, what he was doing? he was in liquor: he said, he was going to bed to his wife; what did I think he was doing? Hearing a noise, my husband waked and jumped up, and said, Who is this? I said, A man has followed me home; I cannot be quiet for him; and he is very much in liquor. The prosecutor cried out, Give me my things. I was not used to such company, getting my bread honestly; I flung his things out of doors: he picked them up for what I know. Some time after, he brought a watchman: he said he had been robbed of some money and a silver watch. The watchman searched the place, and cut the bed and chairs to pieces, thinking, I suppose, that the property was there: I never saw any thing of it. He asked me, if I had seen his money? I said, I had never seen any: in my flinging out the things he might lose the money, or the company he had been in before might have taken it.</p>

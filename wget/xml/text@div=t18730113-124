                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember whether Perry accounted to me for money on 18th November—there is nothing in this book to show the jury that the amount was paid in by May and not by Perry—I have nothing to show the Jury of Perry's payments on 18th November—I receive a good many accounts in a day—I am positive it was May who paid the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and not Perry—I cannot tell you any sum that Perry paid in on 18th November or 14th December—I recollect the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. because May paid in several other amounts at the same time—I have not got the list to show which was May's and which was Perry's collection, but there is such a list.</p>

On the 21st of August I had been backward into the yard; when I returned, I perceived the prisoner going out at the street door; I seeing both my parlour doors stood open, I missed my tea-chest; I looked out at the street door, and saw the prisoner running cross the way; I called to a man that was by her, to stop her; he did; she told him she had only been quarrelling, and he let her go; she ran down a place where was no thoroughfare; I went to her; I took my two gowns out of her apron, which she had taken from my back room; I took the tea-chest from her, with the canisters, spoons, and strainer in it. She owned to the taking the things, and swore in a very bad manner, and said she would have taken every thing she could lay her hands on, had she had time.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner you saw in the house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am; I never lost sight of her till she was taken.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Bewley and another, who carry on business as "The Gutta Percha Company," in Wharf-road, City-road—I have been in their service between nine and ten years—I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—I first became acquainted with him at his shop in Gray's-inn-lane—it is a gutta percha shop, and he sells boots as well—I went to his shop first, with four pounds weight of gutta percha—that was about eighteen months ago—I had obtained that from the masticating room of the Gutta Percha Company's Works, where I was em<lb></lb>ployed—I had no authority to take it; I stole it—I asked the prisoner whether he bought it—he said, "Yes," he gave 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I sold it to him—I think he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then—that was the first time I saw him—I did not tell him who I was or where I lived; nothing was said by him as to that—nothing was said about my returning to the shop again—I went there again, about a fortnight afterwards, with sixteen pounds weight of gutta percha, which I obtained in the same way—I sold it to the prisoner for the same price—after I had been there once or twice more, the prisoner said to me he knew where I worked, because he had seen me come out of the factory gate—I had some gutta percha at the time he said that—that was some time last summer—I did not see him till about three weeks after that, I think, when I met him accidentally at the corner of Edward-street—that is about 250 yards from the gutta percha factory—he asked me if I had got anything by me—I told him no; I would get him some—I afterwards went to his place again, with about eighteen pounds weight—my lodgings were at Vaughan-terrace, Shepherdess-walk—I lodged there two years ago—I have left about four or five months—I saw the prisoner near my lodgings after I had sold him the eighteen pounds—he asked me again if I had anything by me—I told him no; I would bring him some down—I afterwards went to his shop in Gray's-inn-lane, and took about twenty pounds that time—that was before last Christmas; at the latter end of October or the beginning of November, I can't say which—I went to his shop twice after Christmas—the last time was in April—I then took eighteen pounds of gutta percha—I sold that at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I sold it all at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was all stolen by me from the factory.</p>

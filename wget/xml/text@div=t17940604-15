               <p>Q. How soon did you see them after they were missing from the barge? - About six hours after they were missing; I see it in Brentford, in Robert Usher's barge, that this man worked in.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body in the barge at the time? - No, not when I see them there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they belonged to you? - I laid on them every night when I was on board; I know them two flannel blankets, they had got a place, a hole where they had been mended; the coverlid was mended in several places;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040027"></xptr>the tarpaulin my father made, and the bed I had mended myself, in several places; when the things were missing my man pursued after them, and found them in this same barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge that man with taking them? - I know the man, it was the man that I had suspicion of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the barge his? - No, he laid his barge along side of ours, and my man had some suspicion that he would take something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him with the barge along side of your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the things out of the barge? - I did, the officer commanded me to take them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about them? - I told the officer to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between him and the prisoner at the time? - No, not that I heard, he told me to take the bed out of the barge, and he would take the prisoner, and while I was taking the bed out, the prisoner ran from him, and he took him again.</p>

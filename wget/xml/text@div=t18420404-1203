                  </hi>. I live at Ormsby-street, Kingsland-road. On Tues<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of March, a few minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Black Horse-fields at the end of Ormsby-street—the prisoners overtook me—Price was carrying something in his arm—they rather ran past me in a direction from Cloake's house—I followed them into Kingsland-road, ran round in another direction, and met them—Price still had the bundle—it was quite dark—I and John Smith followed them into Mill-row—Price ran, and dropped the bundle when he found he was pur<lb></lb>sue—I seized Glover, and took up the bundle—it contained a coat—they were both together till Price ran off.</p>

               <p>of him—they got before me again in the Kingsland-road, but not out of my sight—I do not know how far Price ran before he was stopped—Glover did not run at all—I was behind the policeman—I did not take hold of Glover at the time the policeman passed—I was at the Camel public house three or four days ago—I did not take some gin with the waiter—I do not know him—I did not tell him I was uncertain about Glover, but certain about Price—I said nothing of the sort—all the conversation I had was about what sort of a character he bore—I heard that Glover was suspected of being one of a party who broke in at the back of the Camel—the land-lord told me so—Mill-row is not very well lighted, nor the Kingsland-road—there is a gas-light close to where this took place—I had light enough to see them.</p>

I was on duty in the Kings-land-road—Tubbs pointed out the two prisoners to me—they appeared in conversation together, and were on the opposite side of the road—we fol<lb></lb>lowed them—when Price saw me he dropped a bundle wrapped up in an apron, containing this coat, and ran down Mill-row—I told Tubbs to take up the bundle, and I pursued him calling "Stop thief," and never lost sight of him till I ran him down—he said, "Why I have been here half-an-hour asleep"—he had stopped just in a door-way in the Canal-road, and was stand<lb></lb>ing crouched up in the door-way—I pulled him out and said, "You must go back with me to where you dropped the bundle"—he said, "What bundle, I know nothing about any bundle"—I said, "Well, go back, you perhaps will know it when you see it," and asked why he ran—be said he was in a hurry—I took him back—he denied all knowledge of the bun<lb></lb>dle or of Glover.</p>

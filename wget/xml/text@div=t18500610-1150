               <p>am a creditor of Kealy and Co. for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I declined to take the compo<lb></lb>sition—on 9th or 10th May the prisoner called on me and said he was re<lb></lb>quested to call from Mr. Scott, linen-merchant of Dublin, who was security for one of the instalments of Kealy and Co., to know whether I had accepted the composition, and that the funds were in the hands of White and Co., of Cheapside—I did not then know his person—I said I would not take anything less than 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, I would rather increase my loss by as much more to punish him, I considered I had been swindled—he said he thought 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was much better than perhaps not getting anything—he said Mr. Scott was very anxious for the creditors to come in; he was security, and that would enable him to be released from the obligation—I said my solicitor had been endeavouring to serve a copy of a writ on Kealy for some time, and he was keeping out of the way, and if he did not <hi rend="italic">show up</hi> shortly, I would endeavour to get him outlawed; and he out a caper on the floor, and said it made no difference to him, he did not even know Kealy, he was merely following out the instructions of his employer—I further stated, that one of my reasons for not accepting the composition was that they had sent me am order for a further quantity of goods a few days before they dis<lb></lb>honoured my bill—(I do not know what the order was, I made up my mind not to execute it)—he said, "If they did do so, they were indeed rogues"—he asked me whether I was aware Kealy's sister held a bill for upwards of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "His brothers are not partners, and if you take any proceed<lb></lb>ings against them they will have the law upon you"—I had said I meant to proceed against them—I had the greatest difficulty to get rid of him, and was obliged to go to the end of the warehouse, open a private door, and go out.</p>

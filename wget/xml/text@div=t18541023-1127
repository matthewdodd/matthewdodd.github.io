                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Morton Eden, of William-street, Lowndes-square. Baker came into our service as Butler in March last—I gave him the key of our plate, and gave him charge of it—I am a niece of Sir Hyde Parker; it was arranged that we should occupy his house during his visit to the North—we went to the house in Onslow-square on 18th April—Sir Hyde Parker left in July, and we continued the occupation of his house—our plate was removed to the house of Sir Hyde Parker, and his plate was there also when he left in July—I left town on 12th August, and left Baker in charge of our own plate and Sir Hyde Parker's also—I left two female servants in the house, Priscilla Abbott and Jane Hyam—there was amongst our plate silver tea pots, a mustard pot, forks, spoons, and other articles—the value of the whole was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was about the same kind of things belonging to Sir Hyde Parker; a silver dish, a gold goblet, and other things—his plate was of more value than ours—Sir Hyde Parker had a man in his service as groom, of the name of Ricketts; he went with him to Scotland in July—the news of this robbery reached me on 19th Sept.—I was then living at Penshurst, in Kent—I did not come to London till Baker was found, on 24th Sept.—Baker did not give me any intimation of his intention of going away.</p>

                  </hi>. I now reside in Castle-street, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square. In the early part of this year I was in the service of Sir Hyde Parker as groom—I accompanied him to Scotland in July—I left his service in Scotland on 16th Aug.—I arrived in London on the 21st—I went to Sir Hyde Parker's house, in Onslow-square—I had left a box there, and went to fetch it—I found Baker in charge of the house, and Priscilla Abbott, the housemaid, also—Baker allowed me to stay in my late master's house—I staid there from Monday, the 21st, till Monday, the 28th—during the week I was there, Hyam was away from the house—I did not see her—on Sunday, 27th Aug., Priscilla Abbott went out for the day, and I and Baker were alone in the house—I had sometimes had my meals in the house during the week—there was one jug of wine the first night that I came there; it was sherry—I did not see where it was got from—I assisted Baker in getting some wine out of the cellar—I believe that was on the Friday—Baker sent me to borrow a turnscrew, which I borrowed at No. 9, Onslow-square—that was used in opening the door—I did not take the turnscrew back—I had before lived at No. 9, Onslow-square—I got some wine out with the turnscrew—I and Baker drank part of it—some of it was left on the Sunday, that we had taken out on Friday—a great part of it was sherry—there was another sort, but I do not know what it was—on the Sunday morning after Priscilla Abbott had gone out, Baker made a commu<lb></lb>nication to me about 1 o'clock—he said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I intend taking off every bit of that plate"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he repeated the expression, adding, "We intend to emigrate to New York or America; if you will join us, you shall have your share of it"—I said, "No, I will have</p>

               <p>nothing to do with It"—shortly after 1 o'clock, Crossley came—I did not expect any body—I had not seen Crossley before that day—Baker let Crossley in—I was in the hall with him—Crossley looked at me, and Baker said, "I think <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> is all right"—we then proceeded to the pantry, and Baker opened the closet door and showed Crossley the plate belonging to Sir Hyde Parker—he also showed him General Eden's plate chest, which was outside the closet—he did not open the chest, he only showed him the chest, and told him that was General Eden's plate—after Crossley had looked at it, he said, "I think we had better have a bit of dinner first"—we went and had some dinner in the kitchen—Baker said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, this scamp has been in two or three robberies before, and one murder"—Crossley said, "You fool, it was no murder; the man was only shot"—we drank some of this sherry with the dinner, and after dinner we went into the pantry, and the whole of the plate was then weighed by Crossley, Baker, and myself—I took account of the weight as it went on—I believe the weight was 75 lbs.—Baker asked Crossley what he thought the value of it was, and Crossley said he thought about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Baker then suggested giving me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., wishing me to emigrate to New York or America—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, we will give you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you like, at once, as your share, and you can emigrate to New York, or America, or Australia, or where you like"—I said, "No, I will have nothing at all to do with it; I plainly see what your intentions are; you would have me take this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then you will say that I was a thief, and had run away with the plate"—Baker said, "We did not intend you to take it; we only suggested it; if you like you shall have a third part"—I said I would consider; and let them know on the morrow, which was Monday—Crossley was present during the whole of this conversation—the plate was all put back again, and we went back to the kitchen, and resumed the drinking of Sir Hyde Parker's sherry—Crossley stayed till about half past 8 o'clock in the evening; he was then quite drunk—during the weighing of the plate, aqua<lb></lb>fortis was applied to anything that was doubtful, whether it was silver or not—I purchased the aquafortis from a chemist in the neighbourhood—Baker gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—when Crossley was drunk, at half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I took him to Brompton <hi rend="italic">cob</hi> stand—I spoke to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man there, and lie refused to take him—I was in conversation with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man for some time, and I told Crossley, "I will pay this <hi rend="italic">fellow's</hi> fare"—the caiman said, "I am no <hi rend="italic">fellow</hi>, I get my living honestly"—the cabman was offended, and refused to take Crossley—Crossley was not able to stand; he fell down—I picked him up again, and took him on to Knightsbridge cab stand—I there found a less scrupulous cowman, and he took him—I paid his fare to Bermondsey-street, and Crossley gave the cowman his address—when the cabman drove away, I went back to Sir Hyde Parker's house; I found Baker there—Priscilla Abbott had not come home—I think she came home about half past 10 o'clock—the next morning I went with Baker to Crossley's house, in Bermondsey; he keeps a beer shop—he was at home, and we all three went to a public house, at the corner of Tooley-street—I do not remember the name—I had in the course of that morning, before we got to Crossley's house, said to Baker, "I will have nothing at all to do with this affair, Baker, and I would advise you not either;" Baker said, "Tom, I must; for I cannot make my plate right"—I said to him, "That is a bad job"—while we were at this public house in Tooley-street, there was a note written and signed by each of us—I had that note for some time—I am sure I do not know what became of it afterwards; I have</p>

               <p>sent home for it, but they could not find it at home—Baker said at the public house, that the reason he could not carry out the robbery at once, was because he wanted time to get his discharge from the army—he said he could get his discharge on 12th Sept.—it was said that Baker and I were to take a portion of the small plate in our pockets the next day, which was the Tuesday—I had agreed in the note to do so, but previously to that, I had employed a man to take my box from Onslow-square, telling him to be sure to say nothing to Baker, as I intended to go away by the first train the next morning to Bristol—I did not intend to have anything to do with this affair—Baker and I then left Tooley-street, and I went to an office in Austin Friars, to inquire about vessels sailing to America—after making those inquiries, I returned to Onslow-square—I did not sleep there that Monday night, but in a room that Jones had got for me at No. 13, Pond-place, Brompton, where my boxes were, and the next morning I went off by the Great Western, to Bristol—my father lives about twenty-five miles from Bristol—I went afterwards to Cheltenham, and got employment as an omnibus conductor—I returned on 24th Sept. by the night train—what brought me back was a letter which I received from a friend in London—on my arriving on 24th, I went to No. 73, Onslow-square—I found a Mrs. Stone there, who had been a former servant of the family—I made some communication to her, and she and I went to the nearest police station—I there saw Serjeant Whicher, and made a communication to him—I accom<lb></lb>panied him and another Serjeant the same evening to Crossley's, No. 5, Bermondsey-street—I went in alone, leaving the officers in the street—Crossley was not at home the first time I went—I went a second time, and met him in the street—he said to me, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how are you? I said, "Quite well, thank you; how are you?"—he said, "I have something to say you;" I said, "I have something to say to you too"—I said, "Of course you have heard of the robbery; have you seen Baker?" he said, "No"—I said, "Well, he has run away with every bit of plate, and they suspect me"—he said, "They cannot do anything with you or me, unless they know about the Sunday job;" I said, "No"—I then said, "I want to go and see General Eden about it; I expect he will come home this evening"—I then went as far as the top of Tooley-street, and got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Cross<lb></lb>ley said positively that he has not seen Baker since the Sunday—he went with me to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, half way up Tooley-street, and I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was passing, and went to the top of Tooley-street—I am not certain whether Crossley went up or down the street—when I got to the top, I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to walk back, as there was somebody I wanted to speak to—I was looking for the officers; I found them, and made a communication to them—I then went home to No. 2, Bury-street, Brompton.</p>

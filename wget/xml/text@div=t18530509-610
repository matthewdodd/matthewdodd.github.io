                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker; I reside and carry on business at No. 25, Westmoreland-place, City-road. In the month of November last I was favoured by a visit from the prisoner for the purpose of taking apartments in my house—he said he came from Dorking—he said, "You may perceive my vision is bad; I have come to remain in London for four or five months under Mr. Alexander"—he said he had property at Dorking and Leatherhead, and elsewhere over the water; Ireland, in fact—he took my apartments—it was about three weeks before any conversation took place between us about money matters—that would be in December—there was a letter came to the house, and he told a daughter of mine to open it—there was a promissory note in it—he showed me the letter and the promissory note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the promissory note—he said it was all right, it came from one of his tenants at Leatherhead—he said he should be short of money till the turn of Christmas, till he received his rents—he asked me whether I could let him have the money for the promissory note—he had before that shown me some papers or documents; I think it was two or three days after he came to my house—the next day after he came to my house he asked me to write a letter to his agent, Mr. Rickerby, of Stamford-street—I wrote the letter, and the next day a person came, representing himself to be the clerk to his agent, and the prisoner said, "What is the reason Mr. Rickerby did not come?"—that was addressing the young man, who made answer, "He is very unwell, sir, but he will wait upon you in a day or two"—the prisoner then said, "Tell him to let me have all my title deeds; send my title deeds"—nothing else passed between the prisoner and this person in my presence at that moment—I saw that person again the next day—he brought the title deeds—I was present—he handed them to the prisoner—they were sealed parchments, with the name of "C. N. Rattan, Esq." upon them—he represented that those were the title deeds of his property, and he had sent for them for my satisfaction—I did not think really a blind man capable of acting so—I did not take the trouble to look at the contents; I merely looked at the outside, and said, "I have no reason to doubt"—it was after this that he presented the bill—this was the introduction to the bill transaction—the bill was drawn on the 4th, and it came on the 6th—he asked me for the money, and I told him I had not sufficient money in the house, but that I was going out, and I would see what I could do—I parted with the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon the faith of his representation of being a man of property, that those title deeds represented property, and that the bill was drawn by one of his tenants—if it had not been for that representation I</p>

               <p>should not have advanced him money on the bill alone—soon after this occurrence a dinner was ordered by the prisoner—he said the 27th was his birthday, and it was proposed there should be a party—the dinner was not to his tenants—he said he had a nephew, whom he had articled to a solicitor, and that he was coming to dine with him—the dinner was prepared, greatly at my expense—the guests were principally my own friends—he made friends with them, and invited them—my friends came, but his did not—after dinner he made some excuse to go out—he was very much annoyed at his friends not coming—he asked my wife how the wine was, whether it was not almost out—she said, quite, but there was no necessity for any more, we had plenty—he said, "Oh, leave that to me," and almost instantly made his way out of the room, called a little boy of mine to go out with him, and went out—he never came back—he left me and my friends enjoying wine at my own expense.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was it on 17th Nov. that I called and took your lodgings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not recollect whether it was a very calm day—the first arrangement you made was for a sleeping room—I believe it was the second floor back room—I forget whether I asked for any reference; you were so fast in giving the reference of your agent—you said your agent was a Mr. Rickerby, of Stamford-street—my wife was presenton that occasion—she is hens to-day—this was on the Tuesday—nothing transpired respecting any property on that day—the next day you asked me to write a letter—when it was agreed about your apartment for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, you proposed that you should dine in the kitchen with me—this conversation took place from time to time—you produced a watch, and proposed that you should have board and lodging for it for that week—you did not at that time tell me you should not be able to pay for your lodging for three or four weeks—you first produced the bill of exchange on 22nd Dec.—it had six days to run when I cashed the bill—it was drawn on the 4th; it came on the 6th, and on 28th Dec. it became due—on 22nd Dec. I had tin's bill to get discounted—I did not have the bill in my possession two hours—you certainly asked me for the money—I gave you the money on the 22nd—the gentleman who discounted it was a friend of mine—I asked him to oblige me with the money for it—it was not on your account; he would not have done it for you—I took it out of the house to serve you—I have paid the bill—when I returned with the money to hand over to you, Emma was in the kitchen—nothing to my recollection transpired on that occasion respecting the day on which my elder son's birthday came—you asked me to purchase a dozen stamped envelopes for you—I also deducted two half-crowns for getting the bill <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, for discount—I gave you the rest of the money—I received two guineas from you for two split rings to a chain, and a set of studs—I was present when my wife came into the kitchen, and received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the Christmas eve following, on Friday, I did not take a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note out of your pocket—I will swear I never had it—I had not been out to market the following day, Christmas day—I was at my business—I did not go to Mr. Blower's to purchase a piece of meat—I did not whisper in your ear, and tell you J had no money to pay Mr. Blower, and you did not give me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—f did not pay Mr. Blower with a 5J.-note—I never had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in my hand—I did not receive out of your hands on Christmas eve one of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes I gave you—they were all my friends who were at the dinner—I dare say they were twenty-two in number—I was present at the time Mr. Robinson, the wine merchant, came in—I know nothing of my son's birthday," which was on 3rd Jan., being kept at your expense, on the 27th.</p>

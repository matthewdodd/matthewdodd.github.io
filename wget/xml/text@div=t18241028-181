            , page 632, the facts of which case are precisely the same as this. The defendant had at the same time, and by the same means, decoyed Miss Johannah Cooper (aged 15 years) to town, in the same post chaise with her sister, and married her at the same church. The affidavit made to obtain the licence was that both parties were of age, and that the defendant had lived in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, for fifteen days previous, which was contradicted by the like evidence as in the former case.</p>

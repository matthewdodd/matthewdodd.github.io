                  </hi>. I have been a special constable for the City of London, and live in Crescent-street, Euston-square. On the 9th of September, about ten o'clock, I was in Tottenham-court-road—I saw the prisoner with another man who I knew something about—the prisoner crossed the road towards me, and had a great-coat on his arm, and a shawl in his hand—I followed them to the New Inn-yard, where they turned down to gether—the prisoner there put the great-coat on, and tied the shawl in a handkerchief—I crossed the road, and saw a constable—I told him my suspicions, and we went together—they came out of the road together—the prisoner's companion looked round and saw us—he pushed the prisoner, and they both ran off—the prisoner threw down the shawl, which I took up; and afterwards he threw down the coat, which I took up—a gentle man stopped him—a policeman came up, and he took him to the station house—he denied having seen the coat or shawl—I am certain he is the man who had them, and threw them away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton. On the 1st of October the prisoner came to my shop, he said he was recom<lb></lb>mended to me by his master, and he wanted a watch—I asked him what sort of a watch—he said one about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he should not like to go higher—I said I had not one that would suit him, would he like a second-hand one—he said he did not care which it was—he said, "I don't want it to-night, but shall leave a deposit, and call again"—I opened a glass case, and took a watch out at four guineas—I held it in my hand and said, "Is it any thing of that sort you like?"—he said, "Yes," and in a mo<lb></lb>ment the watch was gone from my hand, and a tremendous blow was struck on the side of my head, and the prisoner was gone—I called out "Stop thief," the witness joined me—the prisoner dropped the watch—he is the same person—I was talking to him some minutes—this is the watch now produced.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my house, on the 24th, and asked me if I belonged to the yard? and I told her I did; and asked her what she wanted? and she said that she and her daughter had had a few words, and that her daughter had thrown something into the yard; and she wanted it out. I told her to come when my husband was at home, but before she came, a boy of mine brought a bit of bacon into the room.</p>

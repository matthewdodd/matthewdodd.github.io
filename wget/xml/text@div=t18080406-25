On the day before this transaction happened, I had three five pound notes in my pocket book. On that day I went to London, I returned between eleven and twelve at night; I unlocked my door and went into my own room, and directly I went into my own room the prisoner called me. I went into the prisoner's room to get a light, I sat down and she asked me if I would sleep with her; I thought as it was very cold and her bed was warm, I would; she got out of bed and untied my things; I went to bed. The prisoner untied my pockets and put them in the chair, she went across the room and shut my door; in the course of the night I awoke, I might have been asleep two hours; I always put my pockets under my head. I felt for my pockets and missing them, I asked her where she had put them; the prisoner said they were very safe, they were in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say for what purpose you wanted your pockets. - A. Not then, afterwards I said I would get a little water, or a little tea; I had a bad cold and sore throat; she said I should not get out of bed she should get it herself; she got out of bed and gave me a little water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make tea for you. - A. Yes; after that I asked her to get an apple out of my pockets with an intent to get my pockets; she said I should not have the apple it would hurt me, she would get up and make me a cup of tea. I desired her not, but she would she lit the fire made tea and gave me two or three cups of tea; after that she came to bed again. I did not sleep at all afterwards, I said I would get up and go into my own bed, on purpose to get my pockets; the pockets were then on the chair by her bedside where she had put them, she told me to compose myself and go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not say any thing about your pockets. - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Q. Did you go to your own bed. - A. No, I said I had got a very sore throat, I would have half a pint of raisin wine; she laid a bit and said I will have coffee for breakfast, she said she would get me the raisin wine; a little after seven o'clock in the morning she got up; I said I would get up too, then I asked her to give me my pockets; as she sat by the side of the bed she gave me my pockets. I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my book and three five pound notes; she got off the bed and catched her own pockets and put them on, she said do not make yourself uneasy you will find them again. I had them in my pockets when I come here; then she pulled the clothes off the bed with a pretence to look for the notes. I told her they could not come there out of my pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your pocket book or were they loose. - A. In a small pocket book; I went into my own room, the prisoner came in after me, she took a half pint bottle from the shelf, she went to the oil shop at Islington, opposite of my house, for some raisin wine; she came out from there and went to the grocers shop; I watched her out of my window, she went to the oil shop again and brought home the raisin wine, and two ounces of coffee; she made breakfast and drank two cups of coffee. A gentleman came out of the country, I told him I was very uneasy, I had lost three five pound notes; the gentleman was going to take the number of the notes, he thought I recollected the number of the notes, I did not; it frightened the prisoner, she went out; I sent for a constable, I followed her with the constable and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060017"></xptr>he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was apprehended what did she say. A. She had not got them; I was present when she was searched, there was five pounds fifteen shillings found upon her; I asked her as we were going down the street to our home, how she could say she did not take them, when she had changed one at the grocer's shop; she told me, if I would say nothing to any body she would tell me all about it; she begged to me in my own room; I said tell me what you have got to say; I sent to the grocer's, I found she had changed one five pound note at the grocer's shop; she told me she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the number of that note. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot distinguish that note to be your own. - A. I cannot; she told me she had taken the liberty of taking my notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you come home very much intoxicated in liquor, you said you had been with a gentleman in a coach. - A. I did not; I came home with my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you came home in a coach with a gentleman, and you had been to the Circus coffee house. - A. I said so out of a joke.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live. - A. I live nearly opposite of the prosecutrix in High street, Islington; the prisoner was served by the young man, with sugar and coffee to the amount of four shillings and four pence; I was out of doors, I was called in the shop to change a five pound note; she gave me the note; I asked her what name I was to put on it; she said Roberts, over the way; I put down Mrs. Roberts High street.</p>

I wish you had been with me, she had been to the Circus with a gentleman, but there is no harm; I sat upright in bed and helped off her peliffe; I said Mrs. Roberts will you go in your own bed or will you lay down here; she said I will come to bed with you; she took her pockets off, wound the strings round, and laid them in the chair; she said her husband always knew when she was in that state because she talked so much; she said she could not go to sleep; at half after one I gave her some cold water; she laid down again, then she said she had a pain in her stomach; I asked her if she would have some tea; no, she said there is an apple in my pocket I will have that; I said you have the stomach ache, do not have that; I got up, made a cup of tea, and gave it her; she laid down again, she said she wished it was time to get up, she would have a little raisin wine; I said when you get up a cup of coffee will do you good; when we got up she said I have lost my pocket book; I said surely the person you was with last night has not taken it from you in a joke; no, she said he was too much of a gentleman; she laid down sixpence and I got the wine, and I made breakfast for her, and before we had done breakfast a gentleman came in; she asked if I was going to town; I said I was going to Wormwood street. I went to town and on my return Mr. Lack met me,</p>

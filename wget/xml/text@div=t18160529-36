On Friday evening, the 10th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I happened to go to that part of the shop where the prisoner was at work, and found some metal concealed under some iron plates. I asked my apprentice if he had put it there, and he denied it. Accordingly I marked the metal, and left it where it was. I went into the shop between nine and ten at night, and it was there then; but it was gone the next morning between seven and eight; I got an officer, and as the prisoner was going to breakfast, I stopped him, and accused him of robbing me, which he denied. I told him, I would take him up on suspicion, and he went, and looked under the iron plates, and said, there is none there. I told him he knew that as well as I did. Then I ordered the officer to take him into custody, and then he said, I will find you the metal; he then went down stairs, and the officer and I followed him, and in the shop, under the stairs, where there were several casks of sand and rubbish, he brought the metal out from where he had concealed it. I then told him that was not all, and we went to his house, and found the plates mentioned in the indictment on the shelves in the kitchen, and the teapot on his premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at No. 1, Nelson-street, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey. On Saturday, the 10th of December, I was going home, about half-past eleven o'clock at night—I was not tipsy, I had been drinking a little, I cannot exactly say how much—I was drinking with a few of my shop-mates—I met two men in Nelson-street, who stopped me—one pinned my arms behind, and the other thrust his hand into my trowsers pocket—I did not know them before—the prisoner was one of them, I have not a doubt—we were between three gas lights—one at the observatory, One at the corner of a lane, and there was another—the furthest was four<lb></lb>teen or fifteen yards off—I saw the prisoner, for he came right in front of me and put his hands into my pocket—I have not a doubt of him—it was done momentarily—he had a flannel jacket, and a dark cloth cap, which I believe was blue, and a white apron round him—I did not observe his neck<lb></lb>cloth—I had a purse in my pocket containing a sovereign, three half-crowns, and two sixpences—I misted my purse after they left me—I gave an alarm, and saw Nicholls—they used violence to me—I said, "You ras<lb></lb>cals, you are robbing me"—and then the prisoner struck me, and I fell down on the ground—he knocked me down.</p>

I was in Nelson-street on Saturday the 10th of De<lb></lb>cember, and saw a scuffle between some men—I saw the prosecutor thrown violently on the footpath—there appeared to me to be three men with him—the prisoner ran by me—I called to him—the prosecutor got up, and I recognised him as knowing him—from what he said I ran after the prisoner and secured him—I lost sight of him for perhaps a second, just in turning a corner, but he was conspicuous by his flannel jacket which came un-twisted—I overtook him and caught hold of him—I called the policeman,</p>

Nicholls delivered the prisoner to me—I heard something drop as he called me, and found it was half-a-crown and sixpence, which Nicholls took up, and gave to me at the office—I searched the prisoner, but found nothing but a knife—I afterwards returned to the place where Nicholls delivered him to me, and picked up the purse with a half-crown and sixpence in it—I found the other half-crown close to the purse.</p>

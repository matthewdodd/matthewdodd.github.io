Mr. Gambier paid me 48l. on the 13th of February; there were two 20l. notes among them. On the 14th of February, about half-past five o'clock, I left my apartments to go to dinner, leaving my writing-desk locked, which contained my notes, in the room - I do not know whether I locked the door. I returned at eight o'clock, and missed the desk. I applied to Gambier for the numbers of the notes. Next morning my desk was brought to me at a public-house near Oxford turnpike on the London road; it was broken open, and the contents gone. I gave information at the Bank, and in August I received information that one of the 20l. notes had come in. There were 75l. in my desk in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I made my loss known immediately. I received information from Crapper about three weeks ago, and not before. He was employed about the college at the time.</p>

            . I am a mason, and work for Mr. Knowles, of Oxford. On the 14th of February, I was employed at Merton College, cleaning a drain; it was necessary that I should work later than usual to finish it. About five o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner come out of the right-hand staircase of the College with the desk under his arm - I had known him several years, he is a cabinet-maker; that door leads to Mr. Preston's room. He put the desk on his shoulder, and passed the quadrangle of the square very quick. After that, I saw him standing by the lodge without the desk. I asked him if she was at work in the College? he said, No, but he wanted to fetch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170050"></xptr>some goods from a gentleman's room, and did not want him to see him. I asked if he was moving for any person? he said, No. I asked him what he was doing with the desk, when he passed the quadrangle? he said, he had seen no desk; "did I want to have him transported?" I asked what he said, pretending not to hear; he said, "Never mind," and went away into the left-hand staircase. I went to the lodge, but could find no person. As I returned, he abused me for going to see for any person. He heard me call the porter. I left him, saying, "If that is your temper, keep it." I went out of the College. As I returned, I met him by the hall-steps with the desk on his shoulder. I asked him if he was going to repair it? he seemed agitated, and dropped it nearly to the ground - He recovered it, and put it between two buttresses at the end of the chapel near the staircase, he left it there, and went towards the gate; he returned and pulled it about. I asked him what he was going to do with it? he left it, and said, "D-n the man, why don't he come?" I went away, stood behind a pillar, and saw him go out of the gate; in five minutes he returned and took it away. I did not know of the robbery till the prisoner was detained. I afterwards saw an account of his examination in the newspapers, and told what I knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was at work at the College the next day, and have been in Oxford ever since. I never heard of the robbery. I heard a desk had been lost from Corpus Christi College on the Sunday after, and supposed it must be the same. I did not know the prisoner had stolen it. I never said a word to any person about what I had seen; I had a little suspicion that he was after no good. I knew it to be the 14th of February, because I had bought some lead that day, and referred to the plumber's book.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you not said, at a public-house at Oxford, that although you had mistaken the day, you would come here and swear to it, as you should be well paid for your trouble - A. Never, that I know of.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Bedford-square. I accompanied the prosecutor's father to the prisoner's house, and took the 20l. note, No. 13,229, with us, and asked him if he had not paid it for goods coming from Oxford? He said, he had paid a 20l. note, which he received of Claring, a coachmaster, at Oxford. He afterwards said it was at Woodstock. I asked him to find him out. He said he was a gardener-and next that he was a coachman. He afterwards said the note was lent him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He went to Bow-street with us - He was not in custody; the magistrate was not sitting. We told him to appear again.</p>

On Saturday night, the 28th of December, the policeman came, and drew my attention to the shop-window—I found one pane of glass had been broken, and nine silk handkerchiefs taken out—I went with him to the station-house, and found the prisoner in custody with the property.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I was on duty on the evening of the 28th of December, about six o'clock, in plain clothes—I observed the prisoner, with two others, near the prosecutor's shop—I watched them for nearly half-an-hour—they were walking backwards and forwards—I stood in a dark court, and saw them all close up to the window, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner bring some glass from the window and put it in the kennel—it was part of a pane—they then walked backwards and forwards—then one stood close to the window, and the other, with the prisoner, was there—I saw the prisoner take the handkerchiefs out of the window, and go round Spital-square—I followed and collared him, just putting the handkerchiefs into his hat, having taken them from his coat—I took him to the station-house with the property—I went and gave in<lb></lb>formation to Johnson.</p>

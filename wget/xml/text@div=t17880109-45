               <p>I was robbed in the street, on the 2d of January, of a purse and a guinea, a crown and two shillings, and two handkerchiefs; I was in a house with the prisoner; she brought me into the house; a public house in this street; I went with her to another house; we were in company all the morning from seven till nine; I was not sober, nor I was not drunk; there were a good many people in the publick house, besides her and me; I paid for what I drank; she took me out of that house, and she wanted me to go into other houses; I would not go; I knew her about ten days before; she lived with an acquaintance of mine; the house I went into with her was an acquaintance of mine; she hauled me and pulled me till she got me into this house; I was strong enough to keep myself out.</p>
               <p>You had an inclination to go with her? - I did go with her; I did not give her any thing.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - I was doing to sleep, and as I lay on the bed, I found her hand on my pocket; I asked her what she wanted there, and I dropped to sleep again; and she stole away from me; I searched for her, but I could not find her; I could not make her off, till she had brought her clothes out of pawn with my money; I felt her going down stairs, and I thought it was somebody else, and I started up, and put my hands in my pockets, and I found it gone; I could not make her off for some time; there was no other girl in the room at the same time; I was out of my mind when I found my money gone; I ran backwards and forwards, and up stairs at the publick house, and every where; I could not find her till day-light; in the evening I was obliged to give nine-pence to know where she was, and a girl told me she was in Litchfield-street, at the office, getting a warrant for herself; a girl told me so; that was her partner that used to lodge in one house with her; I went to Litchfield-street; I found her in the office, and gave her in charge to the constables, and found my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090078"></xptr>property on her head, with one of my handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Did you find no purse? - No, nor nothing; she was after taking out her clothes with my money; the constable has got the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were there not plenty of people that saw him take the handkerchief off his neck to lend it to me to put it on my head? - Not to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that you did not lend her, or give her the handkerchief? - Not to my knowledge, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at the Cock you believed I was the person who had your money, but was not sure? - I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, if I would give you a guinea, you would go about your business? - I heard nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - I did not, to my knowledge; I never heard it.</p>
               <p>That will not do? - I did not say so; I told her, if I got my own money, I should be willing to be quiet, for I did not want to go to law with her at all; I was willing to drop her at the same time if I could.</p>
               <p>Was your purse and the other handkerchief ever found; that you know of? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>I saw her take a handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket at the publick house; they went away together; she had it in her hand or a considerable time after she took it; they were not there a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell him that she was picking his pocket? - I told him of it; not long after they went away; it was the same day that I saw them going together; I did not mind it; I knew he did not know it at the time.</p>
               <p>Then why did not you tell him? - I cannot say; he was drunk; he was not very sober.</p>
               <p>Did not you come into the house with him, and was drinking with him all the morning? - No, it was after eight when I came there.</p>
               <p>What pocket did she take this out of? - Out of his jacket pocket; there was another man with his back turned to us as he was going out of the room door.</p>
               <p>Were not there a number of people drinking in the ale-house? - There were some women in the tap-room; we were in the parlour; he was a bricklayers labourer; I am a farmer in Essex, with Mrs. Fox; I came to an acquaintance in town.</p>
               <p>Do you live with Mrs. Fox now? - Yes, till this man came for me; I knew the prosecutor before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had the purse when I went into the house with her, because I took nine-pence out of it to give this young fellow to bring in beer, and this young fellow forgot to come back with the beer; he did not bring the beer nor the money.</p>

               <p>When the man came down to the office, he found the prisoner there; he said she had robbed him of a guinea and a crown, and half a crown and two handkerchiefs; and he thought that was his handkerchief round her head, and he said, if it was, it was torn down one side, and sewed up with brown thread; Mansfield took it off her head; he has the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>- MANSFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of this month I went into Litchfield-street office; the prisoner was there; she was very much in liquor; it was between twelve and one; the man said he was robbed; this is the handkerchief I took off her head, and he said it was his property, and according to his description, it proved to be what he said; she was very much in liquor; the Magistrates desired me to put her into St. Ann's watch-house to get her sober; when I went to take her out she was as much intoxicated as before; I took her to St. Giles's watch-house; there were three other girls that came with her; the prosecutor said at the Cock he only wanted his money back;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090079"></xptr>he did not wish any prosecution; there were three girls; this man had been in bed with her, and there were two beds in one room; and six women in the two beds; the money was gone, and the prosecutor took the handkerchief off his neck, and lent it to her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief; here are the stitches of a needle that I put in it; I mended it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw any of his money; he said he would go to bed with me; there were two beds in the room, and five women, besides me and him; I went to look for the beer, and when I came back he said he was robbed; since that the landlady of the house gave him his purse last Monday, and said she found it underneath the door; Brine told me so at the prison.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She gave me a purse, but if she did I could not take it, because I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any money in it? - No, there was not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Was it like the purse you had lost? - It was.</p>
               <p>Who was the woman that offered you that purse again? - The woman that keeps the house we went into.</p>
               <p>Not the publick house? - No, I know that woman.</p>

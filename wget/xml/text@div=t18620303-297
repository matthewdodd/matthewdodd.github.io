                  </hi>. In consequence of information I received, I went to 1, Pimlico-walk, Hoxton, on 27th February, at 7 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by my son and other officers—we broke the outer door and the parlour door—there is a parlour and a back room—I broke the front parlour door in first, and directed the officers to go in—the two Youngs were there with a baby—the other officers went there—I and my son went into the back yard to the back door leading to the kitchen—I did not go through the parlour—there is a door into the back-room from the yard, and also a door between the back room and front parlour—I broke open the door from the yard into the back room—it was partially opened by my son when I got there, and he was held in the door by the prisoner Pitt, who resisted vio<lb></lb>lently, and was assisted by a bed which was thrown across the door—before I got in I was seized in the private parts by Pitt, from within the room—he put his hand out—he was naked—I was halfway within the door—he and Close were both undressed—Sergeant Brannan said, "She's breaking the mould"—at that time Inspector Webster pushed in behind me, and assisted me to seize the male prisoner—Sergeant Brannan and Inspector Bryant seized Close, and took from her hand these fragments of plaster of Paris moulds (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had hold of Pitt by the hair of the head and he said, "Leave go of my head, Mr. Brannan, you will find all you want on the shelf; there is a galvanic battery, and all you want"—he was then secured by Inspector Webster—I went to the shelf and found in this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) a cylinder jar, and another jar, both containing acid, a copper wire which has been dipped in solution, and all that forms a complete battery—on the mantle-shelf in that room I found in a little box, two 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces and a sixpence, counterfeit—we then proceeded with the prisoners into the front room—I pulled down the blind—one of the Young's was on the bed, and the other one lying on another bed on the floor—on pulling down the blind I saw Margaret Young put her hand underneath the clothes of the child which the elder prisoner had in bed with her—I said, "You have passed something to your mother; I am not going to be done in that way; let me have it"—they both posi<lb></lb>tively denied that there was anything passed—I said, "Don't let's hurt the baby; I am determined to have it"—I seized the elder prisoner Young by the wrist, and in it I found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which contains two shillings, two groats, and a counterfeit 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I then said to the prisoners that I had received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after them as dealing largely in counterfeit coin—I said, "It appears the im<lb></lb>prisonment you both have had has not had the desired effect"—the younger prisoner said, "I did pass it, Mr. Brannan;" and the elder prisoner said, "That is all we have got; you will find no more, Mr. Brannan"—previously to that I addressed Pitt and Close and told them I had had them under observation for some time—Harriet Young said to her daughter, "That is the fruits of acting kindly towards others"—I produce the whole of the articles I have mentioned—the baby is the illegitimate baby of the younger prisoner—it was born in prison.</p>

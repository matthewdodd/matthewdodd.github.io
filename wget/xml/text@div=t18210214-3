            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner when I was bringing him from Southampton. He said he knew what I came after him for, it was for robbing Mr. Cerf of his plate; I told him to say nothing to convict himself. He said he hoped he should see his brother in his place, as he was the person who stole the plate and gave it him, but he kept the money because his brother kept his wages. His brother is gardener to Mr. Cerf.</p>

I used to pay his brother his wages, as he lived with his brother. About a fortnight after he went the plate was missed; I heard the prisoner was seen in the pantry, dressed better than usual with a watch in his pocket. I took out a warrant against him immediately I missed it; his brother is still in my service as a labourer, but not as a gardener. I have a quantity of plate, this might have been taken some time without being missed.</p>

             re-examined. I missed the plate in the month of August, the prisoner had not left the service a fortnight when it was lost; I think I missed it about ten days after he left. He left on Saturday night, came again on Sunday morning and on Monday, and helped me clean the plate in the pantry; next day I missed it - he was in the pantry alone for four hours. It could not all be taken away at once without my missing it.</p>

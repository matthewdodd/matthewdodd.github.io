                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old. I am in the employ of William Betts—her son employed me on board her barges—she has one called the <hi rend="italic">William Henry</hi>—Long went on board that barge on Wednesday, the 11th of March—he did not say any thing to me—it was lying in the road opposite Mr. Nash's, at Pickle Herring-wharf—some clover and straw which belonged to Mr. Vandervorde was in the barge—Long came on board shortly after me, and took her up to the <hi rend="italic">Giraffe</hi> steamer—about three o'clock in the afternoon we got to the <hi rend="italic">Giraffe,</hi> and took in thirty-nine quarters and four bushels of tares—we had finished the lading about half-past six—I did not see any thing of Vandervorde at that time, but soon after I saw him come on board to Long—he said to Long, "If I come and help you, don't you think we could get her up there, for the horses have not a bit of straw to lie on"—Long said, "Yes, if you come and help me I think we can"—the straw was to be delivered at St. Mary Overy's dock—I was behind the barge in the boat—Long brought the barge to Pickle Herring-wharf—(this was on the Wednesday night)—I went to another part, leaving them both on board, and they took her up to St. Mary Overy's dock, and left her there to un<lb></lb>load the straw—that is on the same side of the river as Pickle Herring—that was about half-past seven o'clock—I came away in the boat—I saw Long again next day on the barge, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and the straw was then out of her—I said, "Why don't you bring her off?"—he said, "Because she is aground"—(there was plenty of water then to have brought her to Mr. Nash's wharf)—he then said he was not going to the wharf, he had to go over the water to fetch some seed—he took her over at flood in the afternoon—about ten o'clock that night I was on Pickle Herring-stairs, and I saw Long in the barge—I said, "Why don't you bring her in?"—he said, "You can see there is such a tide on her head, I can't get her head in; I must let her lie alongside of the roads"—when I found he would not bring her in, I got a man in a boat to give me a cast-off to the barge—Long was then bringing her round to Vander<lb></lb>vorde's barge—he then went on board of Vandervorde's barge, and took the chain with him, made her fast to one of the timber-heads of the stern of Vandervorde'e vessel—Long then went on shore, and left me on board the barge all night—the next morning, about seven o'clock, Long came again on board, and he said to me, "Jump up, and let us haul the barge a-head, I ought to have been here before"—we hauled a-head, and laid alongside of Vandervorde's barge, and Long told me to hold on, which I did with my bands—there was a man in a smock-frock on board Vandervorde's barge—Long said to him, "Come and give us a heave up with, this," which was a sack of tares—the man came and lifted it on to Long's back—he carried it off the <hi rend="italic">William Henry</hi> barge, and put it on to Vandervorde's vessel, close to the fore hatchway—Long then came back to the <hi rend="italic">William Henry</hi>—when Long hauled her round he went across the other vessels, and went on board Vandervorde's vessel again—I then saw Vandervorde and him quite close together, and they appeared to me to be talking—this was after he put the sack on board—I did not hear what passed between them—Long came on board the <hi rend="italic">William Henry,</hi> and took her to Mr. Nash's wharf—he got there about a quarter to eight o'clock—he then went away</p>

               <p>—he said he was going in the lug to get some trefoil seed—he said, "If William comes, and asks where the barge was last night, tell him she was here; I don't want to hare any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> with him, and when I come back I will give you a penny; but if he don't say any thing to you, don't you tell him"—he went and left me in care of the barge, and went home to breakfast.</p>

On Wednesday, the 11th of March, I ordered some tares to be lightered by her—on the Friday morning I saw them landed at my wharf between ten and eleven o'clock—when the last sack was landed I spoke to Mr. Scott and examined the tares, and found one sack deficient—I said to Mr. Betts, in Long's pre<lb></lb>sence, "There is a sack of tares short, how is this, William?"—he turned to Long, and said, "How is this, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>?"—I saw he wanted to say some<lb></lb>thing to him in an under tone, and I turned away—I did not hear what passed—I looked round almost immediately, and observed Long shoving off in a lug boat towards the road where Vandervorde's barge was lying—I got into a skiff and desired William Betts to row me under the stern of the road, and observed Long in the act of having a sack of something hove on his back—I saw him carry it from abaft the rigging of the barge, and throw it off his back—by this time I was on board Vander<lb></lb>vorde's barge—I went to the fore part and asked Long what he had done with that sack of tares—he said, "I have it here, it is all right;" and I saw the sack, which I supposed was the tares, lying in the lug boat, which he had shoved off—he had hove the sack over the head of Vandervorde's barge into the lug boat, and he shoved the lug boat from the road to the <hi rend="italic">William Henry,</hi> and with the assistance of a man on board, he got it to the head-sheets of the <hi rend="italic">William Henry</hi>—I then went to the cabin hatchway of Van<lb></lb>dervorde's</p>

Evans then went, on board Vandervorde's, then came and told me something, I afterwards went to the corn-market, and saw Vandervorde there—I said, "Mr. Evans, the inspector, has been looking for you, and he will be here at two o'clock—Vandervorde said, "Very well, I will see him," or "I will be here at the time"—I sent my own sacks for the tares, and the sack produced is one of mine—the tares that were in it on board Vandervorde's vessel are the same kind as those I had—I have a sample from them and from the bulk—I cannot identify them, but I believe them to be the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my mother keep these barges. I was at Nash's-wharf on the Friday morning when these tares were delivering—there were about ten quarters in the barge when I came down at the end of the delivery—Nash said to me, in the presence of Long, "William, there is a sack short, there ought to be thirty-nine quarters and a half"—I asked Long how it was—he said, "I have got the sack, it is all right, I will go and fetch it"—he jumped into a lug-boat, went ahead of the road, and Mr. Nash told me to row him off in a skiff, which I did—we rowed round the stern of Vandefvorde's vessel, and Long went ahead—I observed him go and take the sack of tares from abaft the mast, and Mr. Nash walked forward into the sailing barge—I saw him go up to Vander<lb></lb>vorde—the sack was put into the lug-boat—I heard Vandervorde say, at I was going to the police-office, be hoped Mr. Nash would not go any fur<lb></lb>ther with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-meter, and live in Red cross-square, Tower-street—I was on board Vandervorde's vessel on Friday morning, the 13th of March, I had to master some corn there—I got, there about seven o'clock in the morning—I saw Long come on board about half-past seven—Vandervorde and I were speaking together relative to the corn that I was about to deliver—Long came and said, "I have got the sack of tares," or "brought the sack," or "a sack of tares"—I saw nothing particular in his manner—Vandervorde replied, but I did not hear what—Long did not remain on board more than a few seconds—about nine o'clock in the morning I saw Vandervorde on boarde Long's barge, which was lying alongside Vandervorde's vessel—he was in the act of up-ending a sack of tares which was on Long's barge—Vandervorde said to me, "Brother Fellowship, tend me a hand," meaning me to assist him in get<lb></lb>ting the sack on board his own barge from Long's—I was on board Van<lb></lb>dervorde's barge from the lime of Long's coming, and saying he had brought a sack—I did not see any sack removed from Vandervorde's barge to Long's—I was measuring corn below, and a sack of tares could have been removed without my seeing, it—a man assisted Vandervorde with a kind of pulley, and I assisted in getting it on board Vandervorde's barge—I hooked it on—there was a small rent in the bottom of the sack—I can swear to the sack—soon after the sack was hoisted on board Vandervorde's vessel, I heard him call for a sack, and one of his men replied to it—the man asked him what sack—he said, "Any one of ours"—then one of his own was brought to him—he held it up, and I said it was as bad as the one they were going to shoot it out of—they were shot out of one sack into the other—Vandervorde was standing by the side, assisting in holding up the sack—the sack they were in before had the name of Nash on it—about an hour after Long came on board, and inquired for the sack of tares—he said, "Where is that sack of tares? it is wrong; for God's sake let me have them, or there will be such a piece-of-work about it"—I do not know to whom he said it—Vandervorde was there—I did not hear him ask for any thing—that sack could not be found at first, it was afterwards found and brought—I did not see the re-shooting of them—I went down soon after—I heard Mr. Nash on board.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellowship porter and fisherman, living in Pitt's-place, Bankside. On Friday morning, the 13th of March, I was on board Vandervorde's vessel with the meter—I saw a sack of tares hoisted on board the vessel from Long's barge—I lent a hand to get it on—after it had been hoisted on to his vessel I heard Vandervorde ask for his own sack to shoot them in, because the one they were in was a very old one—he said, "Throw up one of our sacks"—the tares were shot into his sack, and the empty sack I threw into Mr. Long's barge—while they were being shot he said, "These tares are very dear, they come to a great deal of money, and there are as many small peas among them as tares"—I said that sack was almost as bad as the other, I could see daylight through it—I went down below.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the Thames Police. On Friday morning, the 13th of March, I was spoken to by Nash—I went to Horsleydown, and found Long there—I said, "Mr. Nash charges you with stealing a sack of tares out of his barge, and putting it on board Vandervorde's vessel"—he said, "What a fuss they are making about no<lb></lb>thing; I will tell you how it was; I went off to Vandervorde's barge with him; I took in thirty-nine and a half quarters out of the <hi rend="italic">Giraffe</hi> steamer; I thought Mr. Hilditch had given me one over, and I put it on board Mr. Van<lb></lb>dervorde's barge"—I said, "Does Vandervorde allow you to take things to his vessel?"—he said "No, Vandervorde knew nothing about it"—I said, "This boy says one of his men assisted you"—he said, "There was a man, but I don't know whether he was one of Vandervorde's men"—I then</p>

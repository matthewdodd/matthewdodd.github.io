               <p>HENRY CATTLEY. On the 21st of June, I was in an alley leading into <placeName id="t18270712-224-crimeloc1228">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

I turned round and saw the prisoner turning away from me - I took hold of him, and at that moment saw it drop, apparently from him; another boy was in front of me, but the prisoner behind - it was a narrow alley; there seemed to be nobody else from whom it could fall - the alley is dark. I saw nobody else; the prisoner said he did not take it, and the boy in front also said so.</p>

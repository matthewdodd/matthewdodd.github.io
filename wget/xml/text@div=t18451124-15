About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st of Oct., I was going in the direction of Sibbley's bouse, and saw the prisoner Messenger lying on the green, about twelve yards from Sibbley's house, with a dog by his side—he had no bundle—I saw Marss run from the back of the house down to the bottom of the field, take up a bundle, and give it through the hedge to Edward Hodges, who took it over the field—I then saw Messenger going towards the turnpike in an opposite direction—Hodges and Marss were in the opposite field—I did not see Messenger join them—I did not see him do anything.</p>

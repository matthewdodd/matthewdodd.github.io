                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cocking. I keep a shop in Woolwich for butter, tea, and chandlery—I supplied the soldiers in the barracks—I recollect, on 2nd April, the prisoner coming to my shop—he asked me for half a pound of butter and a quarter of a pound of cheese for Capt. Cox's company, 45 room—I supplied him with the articles, and he left the shop—he came again at 8 o'clock the same night, and asked for half a pound of butter for the same room—I let him have it—on 5th April he came again for a pound of butter for 46 room, for Capt. Cox's company—I did not supply that—after he left the shop I sent my servant directly to give him in charge to one of the guards—at the time I supplied him with the goods I believed he came from 44 room, Capt. Cox's company.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich. I had charge of 45 room—it is for Capt. Cox's company, and 46 also—I do not know the prisoner—he had no authority to order goods for 45 room—I know he belongs to a company, but not Capt. Cox's; he has nothing to do with 45 or 46.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Crocker, and Co. Watling-street. I was walking with Mr. Fuller, and noticed several persons lurking about, and about two doors from St. Paul's, I saw Mr. Fuller's handkerchief go from his pocket - the prisoner was close by. I turned round, and saw him drop it in the road, and seized him; he said he had not had it in his possession, but had just come from his master's - the persons who were lurking about were gone then.</p>

I was about six yards behind the gentleman, and two young men before me; as I crossed over, the gentleman turned round and took me, and said I had the handkerchief, searched me, but could not find it - he afterwards found it on the ground, and said he saw me drop it.</p>

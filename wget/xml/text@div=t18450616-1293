I live at Kennett's Wharf, Thames-street, and am in the service of Sir William Magnay, and his brother—I knew that the prisoner had been acquitted last Sessions—I had a communication from the prisoner's son, and I desired that the prisoner should have his things, whatever he chose to fetch away, if he asked Mr. Magnay—I saw the prisoner the day after he was acquitted—he said there were some packages in the loft belonging to him, which he would fetch away—he said one of them contained a lot of sweepings of the loft, and some hay-seeds; and another had some tubs—I went with him to the stable, and delivered to him these packages—I had before communicated with Mr. Magnay—I delivered the whole of the articles to the prisoner—I did not see any paper-wrappers at the time I delivered them—I have seen them since—they were in one of the packages that I delivered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Sir William Magnay—I have examined these wrappers—the outer one of them is the only one that is defaced amongst them—the defacing of the wrapper shows that the paper has been fairly sold—if we break a ream we deface the wrapper—if we leave the wrappers without being defaced we are liable to a penalty of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the wrappers not being defaced shows that the paper they contained has not been sold—the prisoner would not have any right to the wrappen or the paper—if there had been any waste wrappers they would have been in a state of defacement—I am able to say that these are not waste wrappers.</p>

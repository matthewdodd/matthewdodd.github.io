The prisoner and two others came to my shop on Friday evening, the 10th of March, between five and six o'clock. One of his companions asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs, and I produced some - they all stood together. One of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120019"></xptr>them asked the price? they did not suit, and as all three were going towards the door to leave the shop, I saw the prisoner putting something under his jacket, near his arm - at that time I did not perceive that any thing had been taken from the counter. I followed them out, laid hold of the prisoner, and took from under his jacket four black silk handkerchiefs in one piece. I took him back, and sent for an officer, who took him into custody; they cost me 17 s. I saw nothing to induce me to suspect them - nobody was in the shop but myself.</p>

After paying for them, as I considered, they left the shop, and told me to bring the handkerchiefs away, as they had paid for them, which I was doing when I was stopped. I expected they had paid for them, or I should not have attempted to take them.</p>

               <p>Kent Road—on Sunday morning, 8th November, I was in Eltham Street, Kent Street—a woman came up and spoke to me—she went away, and I was attacked by three persons—one seized me behind, placed his knee in my back, one hand was put over my mouth, another round my neck, and I received two violent blows in my face—I don't think I was knocked down—I was nearly so, but I recovered myself—I had on this waistcoat, and in it 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pair of silver-rimmed eye-glasses—when the men left me, those articles were gone—the prisoner is one of the men—I cried out "Police!" and "Thieves!" and went after them when I recovered my hat—I met the constable, Hunt, with the prisoner—I saw his face at the time I was attacked; he stood in front of me, on the right side—I have not the least doubt about his being one of the men who attacked me—I had been drinking a little, but was perfectly sober after that choking sensation—I saw the prisoner while the hand was placed over my mouth; and the moment the hand was released I began to shout out, "Police! thieves! murder!" and within a minute the constable brought back the prisoner, and asked if he was the man—I said "Yes," I was sure he was one of the men.</p>

I heard cries of "Police!" and saw the prisoner running towards me—I stopped him, and took him back towards Kent Street, where I met the prosecutor—he said he had been robbed by three men, and the prisoner was one of them—the prisoner said he knew nothing about him—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a purse, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he knew what he was about.</p>

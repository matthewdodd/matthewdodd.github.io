                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Rogers, a baker, of No. 111, Chancery-lane. I remember a boy coming to the shop with a letter some day in January last—I think it was from seven to eight o'clock, I cannot tell the date—it was not sealed, I think, but I am not certain—I opened it—this is the letter—there was a cheque enclosed in it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mr. Rogers, baker, Chancery-lane.—21st of January, 1841, No. 171, Fleet-street.—Mr. Charles will feel obliged to Mr. Rogers if he can cash the enclosed cheque for him in any possible way, being in immediate want of change, or else he would not trouble him." I am quite sure this cheque</p>

               <p>was in the letter at tlic time—Mr. Charles, of No. 171, Fleet-street, was a neighbour and customer of ours—I had my doubts it was not all right, and told the boy I could not give him the money, but I would send it—I kept the cheque and the letter—I sent five sovereigns in a bag to Mr. Charles by my servant, Harriet Duke—I gave her also the letter and the cheque, and told her to take it to Mr. Charles's shop, and not to deliver it to any one till she got to his house—my husband banks at the London and Westminster bank.</p>

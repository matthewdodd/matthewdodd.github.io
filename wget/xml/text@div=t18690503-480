                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 282). On Sunday evening, 25th April, about 8.30, I saw the prisoner Sheen in Charterhouse Street—she appeared to have something heavy under her shawl—I stopped her, and asked her what she had got—she said, "Come home with me and see," and tried to pass on—I placed myself before her—she said several times, "Come home with me and see," but she afterwards said it was flour, which she had got from a girl at a baker's shop in Warwick Lane—I asked her if she knew the name of the person keeping the shop; she said, "No"—I asked her the name of the girl who gave it her, and she said, "Mary Barry"—I took her to the station, and found that she had 27lbs. of flour, in a bag—I then went to 13, Warwick Lane, and saw Barry, in the presence of the housekeeper—I took her to the station, and took her into Sheen's presence—I said to Sheen, "Barry says you are a stranger to her, and she has not given you any flour to-night"—Barry then said, "I do know her, I gave her eight quarterns"—she said, "Six of the quarterns I shook out of the paper bags, and two of the quarterns are in the paper bags, as I placed them"—I found that was so—I found two paper bags amongst the flour, with Mr. Adamson's name and address upon them—I asked what she did with the six empty bags, and Sheen said, "She burnt them"—Barry said, "I meant to pay for the flour"—I said, "What did you mean to pay?"—she said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I asked Sheen if she had any flour or paper bags at her lodgings belonging to Mr. Adamson—she said, "No" repeatedly—we gave me her address, "13, Tindal Buildings, Gray's Inn Road—I went there and searched her room—I found another bag similar to the one she was carrying, 24lbs. of flour, and amongst that a paper bag with Mr. Adamson's name on it, and also two half-quarterns of flour under the bed, with Mr. Adamson's name on the bags—I went back to the station, and told Sheen what I had found, and she said, "I bought the flour at a mill, I forget the name of the mill, or where it was"—I said, "There are some paper bags with Mr. Adamson's name and address upon them"—she then said, "I may as well tell you the truth: Barry brought it to me last evening"—I found at Sheen's lodgings the materials for six new dresses—I told her of that, and she said they belonged to Barry.</p>

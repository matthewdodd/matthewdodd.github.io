            . My father is the prosecutor; he lives at Hillingdon. On Saturday the 8th of January, the sheep were all right, at four o'clock; they were all safe in the field; there were forty-two altogether. It was a field belonging to Mr. Boddy, in <placeName id="t18140112-33-crimeloc176">Hillingdon parish</placeName>

We found the head and skin and neck and breast also; We found them near a brook which runs through that field, where the sheep had been skinned; it laid apparently where the sheep had been killed; the entrails and blood laid there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's house on Sunday morning - A. There was snow upon the ground; there was a track of a shoe upon it; I thought I knew it by having the shoes to mend at the shop before. I concluded it was the marks of

               <p>COURT. In your tracing these footstep, was it in the public-road - A. Yes, in the public-road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You thought you knew the foot from the appearance of nails in the shoe - A. Yes, and shoes. I had mended the prisoner's shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the nails in the heels - A. No; I mended the shoes; I thought it was the marks of the prisoner's shoes. I went to Read, the officer; he and I went again to the footsteps, and afterwards we went to the prisoner's house. We came to the prisoner's house about two o'clock on the Sunday. When I came there I saw the prisoner; we said we came to search for some mutton that was there; he said he had no mutton in the house. We were going to search in the cellar; the wife said they had got no mutton but what they got from Dorley. Dorley, that is the name of a farm at some distance. We searched the cupboard, and found some mutton. The cupboard was in the back room, over the fire place. We searched the cupboard; we found part of a loin cut up into steaks. From that we searched in the cellar; we found two legs, two shoulders, and a loin. They were in separate pieces, suspended with a string to a beam. The necks and breasts were left on the skin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Both breasts were remaining on the skin, were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had the mutton the appearance as if cut up by a butcher - A. No, it is haggled; it had the appearance of having been cut up by some person not used to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep had you in the field - A. Forty-two on Saturday night, and the next morning forty-one; we lost one sheep. The skin was found in the same field where the sheep were in. The prisoner lived about a mile from me, from Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. There is a market there on Saturday - A. No, on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. The prisoner is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the sheep in the field your father's - A. No, only four of them; they were all under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120017"></xptr>care of Mr. Fowler, the shepherd. I can swear that the sheep that was lost was my father's sheep, because there was a mark of a W upon the skin.</p>

            . I am a shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the sheep in the field on Saturday - A. Yes, on Saturday the 8th, at four o'clock, I saw them; I had forty-two sheep under my care, four of them belonged to the prosecutor, he bought them of me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you found the head and skin were you able to say the sheep that was killed was Mr. Weedon's sheep - A. Yes, it was; I found the skin and the remainder part of the mutton. I was present when the mutton was found in the prisoner's house, we compared it to the other parts in the skin. We compared the shoulders; they seemed to fit very well according to the cutting them off; they were cut off very bad indeed, irregularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply the parts so as to compare them, and they fitted, did they - A. I have no doubt but the parts found at the prisoner's house were cut off that sheep. I am sure that sheep was the one I sold to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You compared the fore quarters with the parts on the skin - A. Yes, and they fitted; we could not compare the hind quarters, they were cut from the loin; we could not compare the loin, they were cut in steaks, all in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner - A. Yes. I sold the sheep in September to the prosecutor. The field is Mr. Boddy's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the sheep the night before - A. Yes, on Saturday, at four o'clock.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock the prosecutor applied to me, I accompanied him into the field where the sheep had been slaughtered; I saw the blood on the snow where the sheep had been stuck. I afterwards accompanied the prosecutor's son to the prisoner's house; on my going into the house I told 
               <persName id="t18140112-33-person345">Jones</persName>
             I had suspicion there was mutton there; he told me there was none, I was welcome to search the house. I then asked him what place that was; he said it was the cellar. I said we will look in the cellar first; we opened the door to go down, Jones's wife hallooed out Jones, we have no mutton but what you got from Dorley; that is about three miles from the prisoner's house, a farm-house belonging to Mr. Hammond. I said, where was the mutton; he said, up stairs; that was after his wife said he had no mutton but what came from Dorley. I went up stairs, there were on two plates the fat caul and kidney fat of a sheep, and in another plate was part of a loin or loins, and two kidneys of a sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. To the parts of the sheep in the field were both kidneys gone - A. Yes. I said, is this the mutton. I thought the prisoner was upon the move, then I secured the prisoner. In searching the further part of the cupboard I found the middle of the loin of mutton covered over with a cloth in the same cupboard. I went into the cellar, it was dark; I got a candle; I found two legs and two shoulders suspended with pitchnettle string. On searching the prisoner I found some Pitchnettle string, pitchnettle is what they tie sacks with. The mutton was very badly butchered indeed, nor was the sheep skinned as a butcher would skin it; it was very badly skinned indeed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the meat fresh - A. It was very fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge how long it had been killed - A. I should have thought recently by the appearance of the mutton. I went then and saw the skin of the beast, and the young lamb that was cut out of the sheep, with Fowler, the shepherd; I put my hand to the dug of the yew the dug was full of milk, as it was so near lambing. I compared the parts with what we brought from the field about the middle of the loin where it comes off the neck, it exactly tallied in thickness. In my own opinion they were the same parts of the same sheep, only seperated with the knife. The fat on the skin matched with the part in the leg; in the corresponding part of the leg I found a deficiency in fat, they fitted. There was part of the udder of the yew left in the skin; the udders were taken from both legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do butchers commonly sell cauls - A. Not usually at one time, as we found; both kidneys had been taken from the sheep, and we found two kidneys.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

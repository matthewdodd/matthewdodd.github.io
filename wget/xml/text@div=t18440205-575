                  </hi>. I am a picture-dealer, and live in Southampton-row, Russell-square, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Bloomsbury—it is my dwelling-house—on the evening of the 19th Jan. I was at the back of my shop, and hearing a noise I went into the shop and found the outer door open, which had been before closed—I am quite sure the latch had caught—I missed two oil paintings, worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, from the window close to the door—they had been safe just before—nobody had gone out of the shop after I left the door secure till the dog barked—I have not recovered the paintings.</p>

About six o'clock on the evening of the 19th Jan., I saw the prisoner, and watched him—I saw him lay hold of the handle of the prosecutor's door, open it, and go in he came oat with a picture in each hand, and went towards Bloomsbury-square—there is a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> rank there, and I lost sight of him—I went to the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner again on the Monday following and took him—I had such a knowledge of him before as to be quite positive he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer, of 9, Oxford Street, Stepney—on 22nd October I gave McKee a letter with a money order in it—I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it on the table—I went into the yard at 4.30 and returned and missed the order—I stopped it at the post office—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this "William Mann" on it is not my writing—I did not give the prisoner permission to sign my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McKee.</hi> I asked him to lend me some money and said "I will pay you on Saturday night;" he put the order in an envelope and said "There you are my boy, do as you like." I don't deny doing it, but he told me to do it, I asked them to let me have some money in advance and I would send my wife in the morning; they said no. I met Fireman and he lent me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is false from beginning to end; he had been two days in my employment; I did not know him before—I showed him the letter because I could not read it myself, and I wanted to know who it came from; he read it to me and I put it down on the table—I drank with him on the Wednesday and I gave him drink on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McKee.</hi> Did not I make out invoices for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they were made out, but not by you; they are at home, and they are not in your writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a post office at 148, Mile End Road—McKee came there on 22nd October with this order and asked me to cash it—I did not do so for two reasons, one that it was past the time, but principally because I had not the advice—he returned with Firman, who he said was willing to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it; Firman said that he had known him some time—McKee said it was from William Mann, and I saw him sign William Mann on the order—the prosecutor came at 9 o'clock the same night and asked me to stop the order—I received the advice by the next morning's post, and on that morning Firman came and presented the order; I paid it to him in the presence of a constable who I had sent for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">McKee.</hi> I did it under the knowledge that he threw it over to me.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother keeps the Coach and Horses at Ealing, and I live there. On 19th March, the three prisoners came in for some tobacco—itwas past 12 o'clock at night—Thompson had a pint of beer, and paid with a good sixpence—Wood then called for another pint and a screw of tobacco, and paid with a shilling—I gave him change, though I fancied it was bad, but being busy, I put it in the till, where there were only a few other shillings, as I had not long cleaned it out—I kept it in my hand some time first—I went there afterwards and marked it; it had a peculiar head on it—I found it at the top of the till—there was a half crown or two, and two or three shillings and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces there—I marked it and gave it to the officer—about half an hour afterwards Callaghan offered me a shilling for a pint of beer; I found it was had and gave it to him back—he put it in his mouth, pretended to bite it, and then put it in his pocket, and paid me with copper—they all came together and left together.</p>

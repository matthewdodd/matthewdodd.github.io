               <p>Court. Did you know this was the skin of one of the sheep you had? - I had nine more left of the same mark, I am sure it was one of that ten; the contents of the entrails was the small guts, and the liver without the heart, and the melt, they were the only things that were missing of the entrails, the head was with the skin not skinned, after I had taken them out of the pond, I went and found the place where it had been killed, it had been killed in the other field where I found them, and there lay the melt, this was on the Saturday, on Sunday a man came and asked me if I had lost a sheep, he said we have taken a man with a sack full of mutton, he brought the meat to me and I compared the neck with the head which was wrung off and not cut off, it was twisted off.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it a difficult thing to twist off the neck of a sheep? - It is often done in the butchering way, if they have a mind to make it a short neck, I compared the mutton with the head.</p>

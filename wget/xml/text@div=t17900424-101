               <p>Mr. Garrow. Were your dealings with the prisoner to a considerable amount? - They are to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>To what amount in a year? - I cannot recollect; they may be two or three hundreds a year.</p>
               <p>What was the nature of your transactions? - He purchased goods of us; linen and cotton.</p>
               <p>Had you any regular stated time of credit? - Yes; we gave him four months upon some; and on others, six.</p>
               <p>In the course of two years, of course the time of payment came round more than once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he ever made you a payment by bills before? - Yes, Sir, repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you before, to have an acceptance of Mr. Syratt's? - I have searched our bill-book, and I do not find we have.</p>
               <p>Did you know Syratt at all? - No, Sir; I never saw him before this business.</p>
               <p>When the first bill came into your possession, which is dated the 14th of January; and the letter, in which it is inclosed as the 26th; and at three months date; and had about ten weeks to run, did you on receiving it, make any enquiry who the acceptor was? - We did not.</p>
               <p>You took it upon the credit of Mr. Baert, relying on it, that it was a good bill, and that it would be paid in course? - Relying on the prisoner: as to the acceptor, we knew there was such a person.</p>
               <p>At what distance of time, after the 20th of January, did the prisoner become a bankrupt? - I believe, about a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>At that time, did the prisoner owe you any money besides thirty-six pounds eleven shillings? - Yes, about four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240207"></xptr>Did you hold any other securities besides this bill? - No other.</p>
               <p>After that time, it was, I take it for granted, you then set yourselves to enquire into the solvency of the acceptor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On your enquiry as to the solvency of Syratt, I believe your hopes of payment were not increased? - No, Sir, not from what we learnt concerning that bill.</p>
               <p>As to the general credit of Syratt, did it stand high, or otherwise? - High.</p>
               <p>Did your house purchase some goods of Syratt? - Some person by my order.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Hamilton.</p>
               <p>You never had any dealings with Syratt before? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>To what amount was Hamilton directed to buy goods? - To about the amount of the thirty-six pounds bill.</p>
               <p>Then you did not make application to Syratt, to know whether it was his acceptance, or not? - No, Sir, because we had no doubt at that time, but it was his acceptance.</p>
               <p>You did not tell Syratt that your house had a bill for such a sum, and that you wanted to take goods for that sum? - No.</p>
               <p>You never questioned him as to its being his acceptance? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt, like all other insolvent men, did not like to be paid in his own coin? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>He then denied the acceptance for the first time, as far as you know? - He did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt is not yet a bankrupt, that you know? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prisoner and Syratt were in the habit of accomodating one another with their acceptance? - I do not know; I never gave any accommodation before.</p>

            ; we are linen-drapers in Whitechapel: I know the prisoner perfectly well; this letter Mr. Tapp gave me; it is the prisoner's hand writing; the conversation mentioned in it, was on Sunday, the 24th of January; the prisoner came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240208"></xptr>house; I told him I would not give him any farther credit, unless he paid some of the old account, or gave some further security; I went from home on the Monday morning, and returned in a week or ten days; I received this (the second) letter; it is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Baert? - Two or three years; he has paid us four or five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you give him considerable credit, to the amount of four or five hundred pounds; did not you view him in the light of an honest man? - At first we did, or we should not have trusted him to that amount.</p>
               <p>Do you remember sending Mr. Hamilton to apply at Syratt's for some stockings? - Certainly; I sent him myself; I desired him to purchase to the amount nearly, or something more, of the bill appearing to be Syratt's acceptance, which I held of his.</p>
               <p>Where did you wait till Hamilton came to you? - At the Queen's Head in St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>And when Hamilton came, was there any goods brought? - Yes; Mr. Syratt's shopwoman, and a young man, came down with the goods; I know the young man.</p>
               <p>What passed? - I offered the acceptance, to the best of my knowledge; whether Mr. Hamilton did it, or me, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>When the acceptance was offered, what did the maid say? - She said she should not leave the goods for that acceptance; and Mr. Syratt was sent for.</p>
               <p>Did she want the cash? - She said she would not leave the goods without the money.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire Mr. Hamilton to offer cash for them, in the shop? - Not to offer cash; because he was not to pay for them till they came; I certainly meant to offer the bill for payment; the young man who came down with her, was dispatched back again for Mr. Syratt; and he took the bill with him; and Mr. Syratt came down, and denied the acceptance.</p>
               <p>Was you afraid Syratt would not stand his ground? - My reason was; I certainly wished to get the amount of my bill, when it was doubtful; I did not know it was good.</p>
               <p>Did not you consider it as a doubtful bill? - I did not know whether Mr. Syratt's affairs would turn out good or bad; I was not satisfied with Mr. Syratt's acceptance, certainly.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Syratt is gone out of the way since that time? - Yes, he told me so; that he was at a lodging within the neighbourhood of Charing-cross.</p>

               <p>I have been servant to Mr. Syratt, three years almost; I have often seen him write: (looks at the acceptance:) I do not believe this to be his hand writing; I said so the first time I saw it: Mr. Aldred shewed it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Aldred shewed it to you at the Queen's Head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that the R. S. is not his, or that the whole is not his? - There is no part of his writing on the face of the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not at all like his writing, I dare say? - It must resemble it a little, or else it could not pass.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Syratt's shop, perhaps, when Mr. Hamilton came for some stockings? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton did not tell you he had any bill of your master's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Syratt at home, himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who dealt with Mr. Hamilton? - I reached down some of the goods; and Mrs. Syratt served him.</p>
               <p>So you was to go with the goods, and take the money? - Yes, Sir; I was to take a bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Syratt was sent for on this? - Yes.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Baert? - Yes; I have seen him at his house, and spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Do you know much of your master's dealings in trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had Mr. Baert been acquainted with him; can you tell me? - Indeed, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Where does your master live now? - In Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>And always continued to live there ever since? - Yes, always lived at home for the last three years, unless his business called into the country.</p>
               <p>Had he ever a country lodging at Charing-cross; it is a rare atmosphere, especially when the fogs from the Thames arise; how long is it since he had that lodging? - I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Try, try; at the time, I suppose, when every body goes into the country, in the middle of winter? - Every body is liable to go into the country.</p>
               <p>Now, did not your master go into the country in dog days, in January last? - I cannot recollect that he was in the country in January.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, has he not had a lodging some time since, at Charing-cross? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happens it now, that your memory was so frail, as to fancy that he had lived at home always, the last three years? - I did not know what you said; I believe he was down at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>How long had he that lodging? - Indeed I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How many weeks was he absent from home; from Berkeley-square? - I am sure I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Try, try; I would not hurry you for the world; but I must have an answer; why you used to go backwards and forwards to him? - I am sure I cannot tell how many weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240211"></xptr>When did he first take that lodging? - Indeed I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after last Christmas? - It was after last Christmas.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after Mr. Baert became a bankrupt? - I believe it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it before, or after these stockings were bought at your master's shop? - I believe it was before.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the 14th of January? - I believe it was afterwards; I think so.</p>
               <p>How long was he there? - I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>How long was it after he was arrested, that he went to live there? - He went there directly after he was arrested.</p>
               <p>In the verge of the court? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Who arrested him? - I am sure I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - I have heard, but I do not remember.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the debt? - I have heard, but I forgot; it was not a large sum.</p>
               <p>Do you know how that debt arose; whether it was upon his acceptance, or not? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>After your master had been arrested, he went into the verge of the court: how long did he continue there? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>He used to come home of a Sunday, did not he? - Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>And go back on a Sunday night? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many Sundays did he come to his family, and go home at night? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>About how many? - I believe it was not more than a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Had he any reason for going there, but for the benefit of the air? I believe this is the gentleman that took the action out? - He was not arrested.</p>
               <p>Then he smelt powder, and went away without being shot; does your master live at home now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he been returned to Berkeley-square? - I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>Have any of his bills been presented, that have not been paid? - Yes, I believe they have.</p>
               <p>When, for the first time, did he begin to have his acceptances refused? - Soon after Mr. Baert became a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>How often, think you, have you been obliged to deny the payment of your master's bills, since Mr. Baert could lend him no longer his acceptance? - I can't tell how many; but Mr. Baert was the cause of it; because Mr. Syratt has lost a great deal of money by him.</p>
               <p>What bills were refused payment? - I cannot tell; nor to whom given; or for what sums; he has had no more but these two.</p>
               <p>Let us hope not: how long has he been come home? - Indeed I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>How long is it since he got a letter of licence from his creditors? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long is that to last after he has hanged Mr. Baert? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Baert accepted any bills for your master? - I believe so; I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he accepted several bills without money being paid to him? - I do not know; but I heard so; I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he accepted to a great amount for Baert; and that Baert accepted for him? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>How long has your master left the verge of the court, to come home? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You have been a witness before? - It is a new thing.</p>
               <p>Was you never a witness before? - I once was a witness; only once (a man bought a pair of gloves) to prove a stamp was not in, before a justice: I cannot recollect any other time.</p>
               <p>Try; within these three years? - I do not recollect; I never was a witness to any thing but that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - To the best of my knowledge, I think I was once<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240212"></xptr>a witness for Mr. Syratt; that was about these glove stamps.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago? - I cannot recollect; I believe it is more than a year ago; I am sure I never was but twice a witness before.</p>
               <p>Positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Any of them earlier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the earliest? - There is another last month.</p>
               <p>None in January? - I cannot tell, without I look; the first is the 18th of February, for forty pounds; I paid it away; it came back to me, and I was obliged to take it up; the next is the 18th of March, for forty pounds; that has been through a good many hands; the next is April, for forty-three pounds, seven shillings, and threepence.</p>

            ; it is to Mr. Syratt, of all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240213"></xptr>claims that these two persons have, and ever had, down to the 17th of April, against Mr. Syratt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I was to follow the instructions I have received, in the hand writing of the unfortunate foreigner at the bar, containing a great number of very important subjects of cross-examination of Mr. Syratt, undoubtedly I should wave the objection I am about to state; but standing here in any case, but peculiarly in a case of a man unacquainted with the jurisprudence of this country, it seems to me, I should very much disgrace the situation to which I belong, if I did not object to Syratt's testimony. The page of the law of England speaks it in every line; he is the acceptor; he is, and he always must remain, liable to pay the whole: his being prepared with a release, in order to establish the competency, marks that he was not before, a witness; how then can this release alter the objection? first, on the face of the release I insist on my objection; then supposing it to have contained any thing that the ingenuity of man can devise, and to be couched in any form of words; I say, that without other parties, and particularly without the prisoner at the bar, it is impossible to make him a competent witness: first, Mr. Syratt has released all claims against him; but this bill still continues, and still has a binding force. The two parties, Tapp and Aldred, have released their claim; but the assignees have not; this bill appears to have been proved under the commission of the present prisoner; the acceptor remains always liable; and in the hands of the bankrupt's estate, is liable against Mr. Syratt; which as long as his name and his signature continues, is binding against Syratt: take the case to be (as I am bound to take it) that this is the genuine acceptance of Mr. Syratt; that this is a good and bona fide transaction: in the first place, the estate of the bankrupt has a right to recover, as against Mr. Syratt, where that estate should have released; but the prisoner has an interest superadded, which no power upon earth can force him to release; I should contend to day, he must release; you know the bankrupt is intitled to his share of the overplus; therefore, till he does receive his certificate, unless he has released that acceptance, this paper, for the benefit of the bankrupt, continues to be liable to Mr. Syratt. It may appear strange, that I, who am an advocate for the prisoner; and have to take care of his life; and that although mine is not a long experience, yet it has been a busy experience; and I have seen much of the practice of others much abler than myself; and I have practised a little here also; and I have had the good fortune, I thank God, to do it with some success: and I remember a case before one who is intitled to rank in the list of judges, of great experience; I mean your lordship's late predecessor. I remember a case, in which Mr. Jacques was the defendant, for forgery; it was imputed to him, that he had forged the acceptance of a bill of exchange; the name at full length, standing prominent in the face of the paper; I remember, in that case, there was no bankruptcy intervening; and he had the hardiness to deny, that that which was written at full length on the paper, was his hand writing: I know that very accurate and able judge put it to my learned friend and me, whether under all the circumstances of that case, we thought it decent and fit to ask for a verdict? My lord, shall it be said, in courts of justice, that upon the initial letters of an insolvent man, pressed and borne down by his own insolvency, obliged to abscond; shall it be said, to the disgrace of the laws of an English court of justice, that a foreigner shall be doomed to death on the testimony of a witness who can only say, I believe this was his hand writing; if so, those will be the safest, who are the poorest; poverty will be the only security; because, every man who has the acceptance of a bad man (if he will alter, flourish, or write the letter of his name differently) any man may be doomed to death on testimony like this: I know the jury are above it; I know their minds are superior to the taking in any such suspicion:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240214"></xptr>but you, gentlemen, for the sake of this man, who is by and by to go abroad, though a bankrupt, not a forger, I know, will decide as the impression of your honest minds tells you, the law calls upon you to decide. If my learned friend has the means of telling you he shall be a witness, I have no objection; if my learned friend can in-trench upon me; if he can raise a doubt in your minds, I desire, against the ordinary course of proceedings, that the prosecutor may have the benefit of it. I know Syratt will swear that it is not his hand writing; and I know that jury believe he will: if I dealt in bills, I dare say there are people who would be willing enough to bring me into that place; I am not anxious for the decision.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I scarcely think that the Court will think it necessary to answer the position I contend for, which is, that the acceptor of a bill is a good and proper witness. As to the prejudice of the jury; no prejudice has appeared: as to observations, by way of inference to the jury, my learned friend is perfectly right in that, though not perfectly regular: the observation I mean, is, that it is argued, that no man can, or ought to be convicted on the testimony of the belief of mankind; that I take to be a fact to be left to the jury. In all cases of proof of hand writing, it can only be to the knowledge and belief of the party: if a person comes to swear it is no more than I have seen him write; and I believe it is not; but it must depend on the belief of the party, and the similitude it has to his usual way of writing. Now in regard to the objection which is made, that Mr. Syratt cannot be a witness; I should be glad to know how he is interested in this business: it is a bill of exchange drawn by Baert on Mr. Syratt; and accepted by him; but this is a bill paid by the prisoner into the hands of the prosecutor; he therefore parts with his whole title and right in it, by paying it over to the prosecutor of this indictment; he, therefore, has no claim whatever on any person; because he gives up all right and title to Mess. Aldred and Tapp, by paying it over to them; they being in possession of it, have a claim upon whom? upon the acceptor; that is his interest; because it is a promise by him to pay to the holders of this bill, Mess. Aldred and Tapp; these gentlemen say, knowing this to be a bad bill, we release you; we have no right, no title, no claim whatever on you, Mr. Syratt; then who can sue Syratt? would you apply to him? no person can; the holder of the bill has given a release to the person who is bound to pay it: having released the bill to the acceptor, he has discharged the bill to every other person; and another objection is, they, themselves have proved it under a commission of bankruptcy: say they, we admit this is evidence of a claim which Baert ought to pay. Mr. Jacques was tried here for forgery; and Mr. Griffin was produced here as a witness; but it turned out, that the ingenuity of Mr. Jacques had got another bill of the same date, of the same tenor and force; then it became a doubt which of the two bills were forged; and upon the witness saying also, that he would not say it was Mr. Griffin's hand writing, there cannot be a doubt in your minds, that this man is as clear and independent a man as can be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, my learned friend has asked two or three questions which he thinks to be important; and which is the best way of argueing; he asked, how is Syratt to be interested? Is not he interested, if this is a genuine acceptance? is not he bound to pay it; he supposes that, which I press on the Court, as the foundation of my objection. We are entitled to say that this is a solvent estate; we are entitled to say that this gentleman may tomorrow receive his twenty shillings in the pound: there is no point more settled in the law of England; that as long as the bill continues in England, so long the acceptor of a bill of exchange must continue to be liable; though Baert's estate pays the bill, the assignees become intitled to receive the bill, to carry the produce of it to his estate; and he is interested in the surplus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240215"></xptr>of that estate; if not, undoubtedly the assignees of the estate would have released it: therefore the prisoner has an interest which is to attach after every other interest is satisfied; and which attaches not only on twenty shillings, but fifteen shillings in the pound. My learned friend says, the release of the acceptor releases every body else; I agree to it; but he must attend to the date; as if the holder of a bill, before it becomes due, will give a release to his acceptor, I shall never be able to recover it: but if after it is due, Baert demands to have this against Syratt, can any man say he shall not have the opportunity; the liability is not altered, only removed to a greater distance: first, the creditors must have their shares out of this; the next liability will rise after the claims of these creditors have been satisfied. And now with respect to Mr. Griffin's case, I am sure my friend's memory has failed him in that respect; my learned friend's memory has failed him in the forgery of Jacques; I think it is extremely probable that his accurate memory may mistake. Old Mr. Griffin swore positively it was not his son's hand writing: but that learned judge said, it is possible that a bad man may now and then alter his signature, in order, if he foresees a storm coming, he may deny his signature wheneever it shall be convenient; therefore, it was, that accurate judge put it to us, whether there was evidence to go to a jury: in this case I agree there is evidence to go to a jury: but the only question is, whether Mr. Syratt can be examined.</p>
               <p>The Court was of opinion that the witness was competent.</p>

            , since July last; we have had dealings together, and acceptances, since November.</p>
               <p>When was it you left off accepting any bills? In December.</p>
               <p>Look at that bill and acceptance? - It is not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Did you accept any bill of his on that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What way of business are you in? - A hosier.</p>
               <p>In a very large way of business? - Not in a very large way.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - I was not acquainted with him till the beginning of July last.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a bill book? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have you got it with you? - No, I have not the regular bill book; I have an account of those bills.</p>
               <p>Have you a bill book? - Not a regular bill book.</p>
               <p>Have you a good many acceptances? - Yes, I have; I keep a small bill book, but not a regular bill book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This paper is all the hand writing of Mr. Baert? - That bill is not mentioned in this paper; he delivered it to me as his account.</p>
               <p>When did he deliver this to you? - I think it was about the 10th or 12th of January.</p>
               <p>Is the whole of it his hand writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before, or after you refused accepting any bills for him? - It was before.</p>
               <p>It was before this bill of the 14th of January? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the dates? - I think they were regular with my account; that account was delivered from the 10th, to the 14th or 15th, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And this closed all your transactions? - He had a parcel of goods on memorandums, which he fairly swindled me out of.</p>
               <p>Now, at the time he delivered you these papers, there were none of your acceptances out-standing? - Yes, there were; they are all in that account.</p>
               <p>I observe there are acceptances here, down to the 27th of April: is that so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you always give value for Mr. Baert's acceptance, or did you sometimes exchange your favour? - We never regularly exchanged: Baert had goods of me, but I never had any of him, except one parcel of candles.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240216"></xptr>To what amount, in your whole transactions, did you lend Mr. Baert? - I do not know exactly; I know what I am now liable to.</p>
               <p>What is the extent of your transactions? - I cannot possibly tell.</p>
               <p>Nor about how much? - About one hundred and eighty pounds (I think I come within twenty pounds, when I name that sum) there were, but not bills fairly accepted by me: Baert has accepted for me as much as one hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Have you any other bill book at this time except this? - Yes, I have, but not with me; because Baert's bill nor any accommodation bills were entered in it.</p>
               <p>Were you never asked about it before the magistrate? - I was; that book is not here.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never say you had destroyed it? - Upon my oath, I never did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say you burnt it? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor that the children had destroyed it? - No, Sir. I said, that I apprehended that the book was mislaid, and the children had got it.</p>
               <p>Was it this book; when was this book made? - I cannot tell; in the course of the last year; I have the book.</p>
               <p>How long have you had the book? - Rather more than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>You began to enter into it, I suppose, as soon as you had it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You never entered any thing in it since Mr. Baert became a bankrupt? - Nothing but some bad debts.</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - This has been written very lately; that sum in 1784; I took them from another book.</p>
               <p>And I see you was so pinched for room, that at last you was obliged to write on the cover of it, though there are a great many blank pages. How came you to begin your account with Mr. Baert in the middle of the book? - I cannot tell exactly what reason I had for it then.</p>
               <p>You never make any mistakes in your accounts? - I might sometimes.</p>
               <p>Here is a bill, at the bottom, of the 29th of December, twenty-five pounds ten shillings. - I scratched it out afterwards, because it was never used.</p>
               <p>Whose bill was that of the 29th of December, for twenty-five pounds ten shillings, which was never used? - That I cannot tell, whether it was my acceptance or Baert's.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you to accept any other bills for him which were not used? - No, I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>You continue still to live in Berkeley-square, and have done ever since? - Not entirely without interruption.</p>
               <p>To what amount may your acceptances be in the world? - I cannot tell; there may be bills to the amount of five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>How long have you left your house, and lived at Charing-cross? - I lived there eight days; I went on the 12th of March.</p>
               <p>Was that after Messrs. Aldred and Tapp had got some stockings from you? - It was after Mr. Baert's bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know a person of the name of William O'Brien? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give him any writing for his master of any sort? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>The bills have been sent by

             for acceptance to Mr. Baert, and you have sent them back to him? - None of my acceptances since the end of December. William was there one morning with two bills; I returned them by William, and said, I shall see your master in the course of a day or two.</p>
               <p>That was since the delivery of this account? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe that this forged bill is one of them? - I cannot say; I did not take any notice; I believe it might be one of those that Mr. Baert sent to me by his porter O'Brien: I was determined not to accept any more; I do not believe I did give O'Brien any answer to them.</p>
               <p>You did not send him a written answer by O'Brien? - No, I did not; I did not write any thing in his presence.</p>
               <p>You have seen the other bill on which the other indictment is? - I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240217"></xptr>Was or was not that the other bill that was inclosed to Mr. Baert? - I cannot speak to a certainty; it is very probable it was one of the bills.</p>
               <p>It was some time after that before Baert became a bankrupt? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>When did you first see the bill in question? - On the 6th of March, when it was sent to me in payment by Messrs. Tapp and Aldred; at first sight of the bill I took very little notice, but judged it to be a bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings; and if it had been that bill, I should certainly have given the goods for it.</p>
               <p>What did you first say about it? - I said I had been swindled out of a bill; I took very little notice of it; I had been very ill.</p>
               <p>When did you first say it was a forgery? - I did not say to any body that it was a forgery till I went down and saw Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Aldred; I just spoke to Mr. Walker, I cannot recollect the conversation; then I went back and compared it with Baert's account, and found it was not the bill I intended to pay; but when I looked closely at it, I found it was not my acceptance.</p>
               <p>At that time, upon your oath, had not you this bill in your hand? - I believe I had; I went back to my own house to compare it, and then I was well satisfied that it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Did not you add to it, that the only security you had for this bill was a dozen of candles? - I believe I told that to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Hebden of Ironmonger-lane? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you make any application to him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you not, in February last, apply to Mr. Hebden to accept a bill in which Baert was to be concerned? - I asked him if he would take Baert's acceptance; that was the 5th or 6th of February.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Hebden agree to accept it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did you or not apply to Mr. Baert to give you that acceptance? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did Baert accept a bill for you in February? - He refused to do it, saying, I had refused for him; Hebden was to take it as money to the amount of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>At the close of this account, how many bills were in Baert's hands unprovided for? - Three bills, to the amount of eighty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>At the time you talked about swindling, did you suppose it to be this bill in question? - I supposed it was the bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings. This twenty-five pounds ten shillings was drawn upon Baert.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, and examined with the indictment.)</p>
               <p>"36 11 s. - London, Jan. 14, 1790.</p>
               <p>"Three months after date, please to pay</p>

               <p>"Accepted, R. S."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This bill of thirty-seven pounds six shillings was drawn in Mr. Syratt's shop, the 8th of December, in exchange of his; I accepted one for him of forty pounds, due on the 10th of March; it was on account of that bill that Mr. Syratt insisted I should accept another bill, to have Manchester goods.</p>
               <p>So it could not be on his thirty-six pounds eleven shillings, for the other? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>To Syratt. Upon your oath, did that forty-pound bill, which he gave you, include that thirty-seven pounds six shillings? - I cannot say positively, I think not -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is in my books.</p>
               <p>Syratt. I believe it might be given in exchange of thirty-seven pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Look in that paper, you will find the forty pounds and the thirty-seven pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How could you conceive this thirty-seven pounds six shillings to be a swindling bill, when this forty pounds was set against it? - Baert was a bankrupt at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to tell the jury that you was swindled out of it because the man was a bankrupt? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>I was a servant to the prisoner, Mr. Baert, about seven months; I know Mr. Syratt; I used to go on business respecting bills for my master: on the 6th of January, which was Twelfth-Day, I went to Mr. Syratt, carried a note sealed up; I cannot say whether he opened it, but he gave me an answer. I saw him at a distance writing; he was four, five, or six minutes; then he returned it me, and I carried it to my master.</p>
               <p>Did he put what he wrote into the note? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I understand you can neither read nor write. - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Syratt: all I know of this business is, that on the 26th of March a servant of mine was called on by a servant of Mr. Syratt's, to carry some goods; and when my servant came in, he was telling me a story about that sum: I was working in my shop: I happened to look up, and saw Mr. Syratt pass; he saw that I saw him, and stepped back; says he, Mr. Walker, what shall I do with this affair? What affair? says I; I know nothing of it. Why, says he, it is a bill I am swindled out of.</p>
               <p>Had he the bill in his hands at that time? - No: says I, I thought you had been long enough in the world not to put your hand to a bill that you have not value for: says he, I have but a few pounds of candles for it.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time suggest any thing of the kind that it was a forgery? - Not in the least; I never learnt it from him at all; I heard it by mere accident: my man went into the shop, and they told him.</p>
               <p>Was that the bill? you have been looking at the bill that was offered for the stockings.</p>

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Walker: I went with Mr. Syratt's servant to the Queen's-head with some goods.</p>
               <p>When you came there, there was some dispute about a bill, and you came back again? - Mr. Syratt said nothing to me; but he said, this is the man whom I have lost so much money by: he said no more to me then; he did not say it was a forgery. I remember Mr. Syratt's coming in while I was at my master's; before I could tell him he came in and said, What must I do in this case, Mr. Walker? Says Mr. Walker, I do not know any thing about it. He said, It is a bill I have been swindled out of. Mr. Walker said, I thought you had been too long in the world to set your hand to a bill, and not receive value for it. The answer he made was, I have only a few pounds of candles for it. He never pretended it was a forgery. I heard of it about two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You did not see Mr. Syratt after that to speak to him? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see that bill of thirty-six pounds eleven shillings? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you present it to Mr. Syratt? - Yes: he said nothing more than what I have said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Frith-street, Soho: I remember the time when the prisoner was committed: I heard Syratt say, after he was committed, (I stood at his back, and he was in conversation with a friend of his, whom I do not know; his friend said, it was a pity this business was brought to such a pitch as this, and that it had not been made up); he said, in return, if I can get rid of this, I can get rid of the whole. I did not know Mr. Syratt before that. That was the expression, as far as I can recollect, or to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say any thing more about the prisoner? - I did not pay much attention; but that I heard (Mr. Vernon, a gentleman of Mr. Baert's acquaintance, who is a wax-chandler, whom I saw at the Office, and knew), I mentioned the circumstance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240219"></xptr>to him: I did not know I was to be subpoena'd upon it till I read the subpoena.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - A refiner of spermaceti and wax.</p>
               <p>You did not know Mr. Baert at all? - I did not know him personally.</p>
               <p>What had you to do at the Office? - Mr. Freeman, a tallow-chandler, said he would go and hear an examination at the Office, and I went out of curiosity; I did not know Mr. Syratt, nor the person whom he was talking to; I did not hear any reply; the Office was in an uproar.</p>
               <p>Then you just heard those words? - I did hear those words: there had been a good deal said before that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was the conversation before that? - The conversation that was between Mr. Syratt and his friend: there appeared much dissatisfaction about the magistrates, and the people seemed to think Mr. Syratt as much to blame as Mr. Baert.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation between Syratt and this person whom you do not know, and the words that passed previous to the words you have mentioned? - The conversation I did not pay attention to; but the beginning of it was,</p>
               <p>"it is a pity this business should come to this, that it was not made up."</p>
               <p>Then that was a friend of Baert's? - I do not know: they said, it was a pity this business should come to this, and that it was not made up before it came to this. Mr. Syratt's reply was, If I can get rid of this, I can get rid of the whole. I did not know what he meant by that. That is all I heard. I mentioned those words to Mr. Vernon immediately at coming out: says he, that is material. I said it was, certainly.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person besides you that heard this? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it after Baert was committed? - I will not positively say.</p>
               <p>Was not the examination over? - The Court was not cleared. I went into the Office with Mr. Freeman, and saw Mr. Vernon and some other friends, or I should not have staid. The magistrates were examining Baert: the bill was produced; I did not touch the bill, nor had any business with it; the sum was between thirty and forty pounds. Mr. Syratt was afterwards called, and he said, among other things, that the bill was forged. Mr. Syratt was blamed by the magistrates, that he did not produce before the magistrates an account of those things that he said the day before he had. They examined them alternately; they examined Mr. Baert, and they examined different persons: Mr. Baert was committed. This conversation was before the commitment, I think: I did not inform the magistrates of this; I informed my friend Mr. Vernon; I had not got twenty yards from the door before I informed Mr. Vernon of it: the prisoner was committed then.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Vernon go back to the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor you neither? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you say that Mr. Syratt was the man that used that expression positively? - I do swear that Mr. Syratt was the man.</p>
               <p>And not the other person speaking to Mr. Syratt? - Not the other person, I am sure of that; Syratt was standing with his back towards me.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Syratt's voice before? - Never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>As to the prisoner, you never saw him before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>At Mr. Vernon's, nor any where else? - I have heard of his name; his wife has been at my house once or twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The magistrates had, after the examination was over, blamed Mr. Syratt very much, and that drew this observation? - The magistrate blamed Mr. Syratt, I thought much, as I said before, as being the worst gentleman of the two, but said they were under the necessity of committing him: I believe it was Mr. Bond said, that they could not try a case where there was a positive oath.</p>
               <p>My learned friend heard you say another thing, which he did not like the jury should hear, which was, that Mr. Syratt had been examined the preceding day? - Yes, they were angry because he did not produce the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240220"></xptr>book: he said he had lost it, or burnt it, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about the children playing with it? - I recollect that, now you mention it.</p>
               <p>Was you there the preceding day? - I think I was the preceding day.</p>
               <p>One would think we had picked you up in the street; nobody had ever heard of you; where do you live? - In Compton-street: I have lived in that parish twenty years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Syratt. Did any such conversation pass between you and a friend of yours? - I was in conversation with the attorney; I said, Now, if I bill this, I must bill all the rest; and another thing I said, I am determined to make the bill-holders to come in for a composition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall be ashamed, after this, to keep it up any longer certainly.</p>
               <p>Jury. My lord, we cannot agree; we beg to withdraw.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for above half an hour, and returned with a verdict,</p>
               <p>

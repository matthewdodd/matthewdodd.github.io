               <p>(Produces the articles) I produce the things; they have been in my custody ever since the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were these things delivered to you? - I was sent for November 26, about the hour of nine in the morning, and when I came to the prosecutors house, he told me he had been robbed of them two different articles; he gave me charge of his porter for robbing of him; as such I conveyed him to the magistrate, and he had a hearing. The things were given to me in Mr. Hoffstetter's house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the things I delivered to Pinner; they have no mark on them, but the remaining part is in our possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you had not entrusted the prisoner at the bar with the delivery of these things, to carry home to some customer? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? Did he give any account how he became possessed of them, and for what purpose? - He said he found them in the warehouse, and thought they were of no use.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place, Mr. Hoffstetter, how lately had you seen these arms before? - They might be, perhaps, six months in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any other person besides the prisoner at the bar had taken them out, and then they had got in the prisoner at the bar's possession, you would not have known any thing at all about it? These arms that I see they would suit any other commodity of the same sort, if they fitted? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you do not mean to state that there is any particular mark about this, peculiar to the thing itself? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the same commodity in other peoples possession, that would fit your's, you would equally swear to as these? - It might happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean is this, that you have such a commodity, which these things will correspond with, and which any other thing of a like specie would correspond with? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 26th, I was in the warehouse, in the morning, and I found these things up stairs; I did not know what they were, and I put them in my pocket in order to look at them, and I did not know what they were, and he supposed I was thief, and which I did not like, so I offered to run when he stopped me. I was a weekly porter; I lived almost five years with my master.</p>

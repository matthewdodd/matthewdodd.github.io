On Friday evening, at about six o'clock, I was in Cloth Fair; I had a parcel, I was bringing it from Mr. Harrison's, at Smithfield Bars; I was going to cross to Mr. Gadnay's, a man came behind me, and put his hand on my mouth, and threw me down, and took my parcel from me; I gave the alarm of stop thief, and he ran away with it, and he found it was too heavy, and he dropped it. I am sure it was the prisoner. I ran after him; I saw him with the bundle, as he ran away, and as I was running after him. I saw him drop it; he was stopped very soon. I had lost sight of him just before he was stopped; he was taken directly. I am sure he is the man who took the parcel from me; there was a light that I could see him; throwing of me down, I could see his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What had I on?</p>

               <p>JAMES CUNNINGHAM. I am a milk-man. On Friday evening, I went into Cloth Fair, with intent of buying a milk-walk. I was sitting down for some time, and I heard the cry of stop thief; I got up, and went to the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar run; I pursued him; he turned round a corner, and I caught him there; I lost sight of him just whilst he got round the corner; I caught him immediately; not two hundred yards from where I was sitting down; I brought him back to the house I came out of; he had no hat when I caught him; he had a light coloured coat on. I ordered a light to be brought to the door, that the boy might be sure; the light was brought, and I asked the boy if that was the man, and he said he was. I asked the prisoner where he lived; he said in Whitechapel. I asked him, had he come from Whitechapel without a hat, but he made no reply. He said, he had been seeing a friend of his named Long, home. He stood behind a shutter when I caught him.</p>

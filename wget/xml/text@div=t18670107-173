Silk, and asked me to give him twenty-five boxes of cigars—I said I would not trust him, but if he paid for them he should have them—he said, "I have no money about me; as soon as I get the money from the gentleman I'll pay you"—I went with him as far as the door of a public-house in Cheapside—he said, "Stop here at the door, and I will bring you your money"—upon that representation I let him have the cigars—five minutes afterwards he came out and said, "It is all right; I have spoken to the landlord about your diamond ring; lend it me to show him, and I will bring it back with the cigars"—I had said I had a diamond ring—he said, "Do you want to sell it?"—I said, "No, I wear it myself"—he took it and went in—ten minutes afterwards, when I saw he did not come back, I went in and asked the landlord—he said, "No one has been here with cigars and a diamond ring; perhaps he has gone out the back way"—I have never got the cigars or the ring back.</p>

About the 3d of August my wife missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). My wife said she had them in her hand the day before, and that they were taken from a room which was locked, and she had the key. I then said there must be some false keys. I called the servants together and searched their pockets ; I found four pieces of silver lace in the prisoner's pocket. I said she had better confess the whole robbery. She said she found it in the garret. I said she could not, for the door was locked. Then she said she knew nothing of the robbery. I sent for a constable, and he found twenty keys in her bosom, a silver buckle of my child's, and a razor. I desired her then to tell of the rest of the robbery; she would not tell any thing. Then I took her up before his majesty *. The constable has got the keys and property in court; the sacque and petticoat, and some lace, were found in a box of her's at the Compter. It was sent to his majesty *, and I was sent for. It was my property. I asked her, when I saw the sacque and petticoat, what she had done with the cloak. She said she had pawned it with Mr. Bunn, in Houndsditch; we went there and found it, and then she owned committing the robbery.</p>

               <p>I was called by the prosecutor. I came into the house, and saw some lace lie on the dresser. The prosecutor said he had taken it out of her pocket. I asked her, had you this in your pocket? She said yes. I asked where she got it. She said she found it in the garret. I found a buckle, twenty-two keys, and a razor, in her bosom.</p>

               <p>I found the sacque and petticoat in this box (producing it) at the Compter. The box was brought from the prosecutor's house. There was nothing in it when it was brought to the Compter; they were conveyed to her privately, after she was committed. Upon finding them she confessed where the cloak was in pawn. When she was taken before the magistrate she asked what shall I say? I said, what can you say when things are so clear against you. We went to the pawnbroker's, and found the cloak pawned in the name of

               <p>I was but five nights in the prosecutor's house; the first night I was there he sent his wife and family into the country. There was nobody in the house then but him and me. In the night he came to my room, and behaved rude to me. The next day his wife came home; he desired me not to tell her, and asked me to accept of these things; he said he had got them from Holland. He gave me the stuff, and desired me to have it made into a sacque and coat, and meet him at Vauxhall. I went, but he was not there. He said his wife was out of her mind, and would not miss the things. He said he dealt in lace, and would give me some, if I would let him be free with me. He said he would take me a lodging, and the things were sent to Bishopsgate-street, to go to Clapton. He said afterwards, if I would return the gown and coat, to prevent uneasiness between him and his wife, he would give me 20 l. There is a prisoner who saw him come every day to me in the jail to give me money.</p>
               <p>To Hyman. You have heard what the prisoner has said, is there any truth in it? - When she came to me my wife was ill; my wife went out of town. There was another servant with her; she was not alone. I never offered her any thing. I advertised the things, and offered four guineas reward.</p>

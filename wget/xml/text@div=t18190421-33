On the 13th of February, he brought me some work home, which came to 10 s.; he was in the pantry. I gave him a note out of my box, and he gave me 10 s. in change - I believe it was a 1 l. note that I gave him. About a week or ten days after he brought me some more work home, which came to 10 s. I paid him another 1 l. note - I looked at it of course - I had several other notes in my box of different amounts. There was a 20 l., a 10 l., and a 5 l. He went out for change, and gave me 9 s. 6 d., or 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was paying him this last note, were you called away - A. I am not certain whether it was the first or the last time that I was called away by the ringing of the bell. I went up, leaving him in the pantry, and my box open. I returned in about five or six minutes, and he was still there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the 20 l. note between the first and the last time - A. I am not certain; I often went to this box, as it was my clothes box. On the 4th of March I missed it, and got the number of it from Messrs. Pagets, the bankers; it was paid me last May. I went to the prisoner, and told him of it; he said he had not seen it, nor had he got it. I asked him if I had made a mistake in giving him a 20 l. note instead of a 1 l.? he said No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at that time you doubted whether you had given it to him or not - A. I looked at the note that I gave him, but I thought he would not own it if he had stolen it. I asked him what he did with the note that I paid him? he said he did not know, he might have paid it to his currier. I went to a person named Hill, a tailor, in Regent's-mews; after that I went with my master to the prisoner. My master asked him if he knew any thing of a 20 l. bank post bill? he said No, he did not. My master questioned him more closely, and told him that he knew he had been out with Hill one evening to buy some things, and asked him if he knew what money Hill changed? he said at first that he did not exactly, but it might be a large note, and that he did not receive any part of the money. He continued to deny it until he got to the office. He said as he was going to the office that Hill had said that he had taken the note of a coachman or a groom, and mentioned the name of the lady the person lived with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You missed the note about nine days after he had been to you - A. Yes, I only know the number by what was told me at the bankers - I got the number of six notes which they paid me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know which of the six it was - A. By the other five coming in before - I never dealt with Hill. I paid no money to anybody but the prisoner, or opened my box in the presence of any one else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never leave your box open - A. When I missed the note my box was locked, but the asp not put in; it was in that state two or three days. I traced the note to Hill.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in South Moulton-street. I went to the prisoner's stall, which is next to Hill's stall, in the Mews. I asked him if he had not changed a 20 l. post bill? he said he never saw any such thing. I asked him if he had not lent Hill 3 l. or 4 l.? he said some month or two ago he had lent him money. I asked him if he had not been out with Hill to make some purchases? he said he frequently went with him. We then asked him if he had not been to Vigo-lane with him? he said he did not know where Vigo-lane was. I told him where it stood; he then recollected, and after persisting that he had not been present at the passing of a 20 l. bank post bill, I told him I was certain he had been at Bedward's shop, and had changed a 20 l. bill. He then said he was present, that Hill changed it, and he purchased a waistcoat-piece, and Hill purchased several articles, and took all the change. I then gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bedward, woollen-draper, Vigo-lane. I know the person of the prisoner, and believe it was him that was with Hill on the 25th of February - Hill laid out 2 l. 17 s. - there was a waistcoat among the things. I tied them all up together. Hill took the parcel, and gave me a 20 l. bank post bill, which I believe he took from his pocket, but I am not sure.</p>

            . I got this note from the Bank, it has my late mistress's hand-writing on it, by which I know it has passed through my hands; she endorsed the six notes, and paid them all to me, I paid the others away at Penzance. I went to the Bank on the 10th, but did not get this note there then.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EVANS re-examined. It is the note I received from Hill, the prisoner was close to him when he paid it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210018"></xptr>said he would have a waistcoat - Hill ordered me to cut one off - I had seen the prisoner with him before. I gave him seventeen 1 l. notes, and 3 s. in silver. I had received them all at French's, whose name I put on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I generally change notes at French's. Bishop brought me a note which has French's name on it, in my writing - I will not say it is that I paid Hill.</p>

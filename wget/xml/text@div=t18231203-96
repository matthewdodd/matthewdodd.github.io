On the 6th of November, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop window, with another boy. I had seen them looking in at the window - they stopped there for two minutes, then went on, and in a few minutes I received information, and came outside, and there was a broken square of glass, with a cap drawn through. I took it away, came to the door and in about five minutes, they came by again. I seized the prisoner, took him into the shop, and asked him where the gloves were, which had been in the window - he denied all knowledge of the cap or gloves - turned out his pockets, and there was nothing in them. I told him to pull of his hat, which he did very slowly, and the gloves were in it: they are my masters, and have the shop-mark on them, and were on the cap in the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fish salesman at 99, Lower Thames Street—I have employed the prisoner about fourteen years—I employed him on the 3rd of March to bring dried bloaters over from the smoking yard in Kent Road, where I cure the fish, to 99, Lower Thames Street—they were packed 50 in a box—he should have brought 154 boxes—he brought 156 down to me, and eight he left on the bridge—I account for there being more than was ordered because it depends how they are packed, sometimes there are one or two short in the boxes—I did not count the number of boxes at the shop—as soon as my son came I ran up to the bridge to stop the 8 boxes—I had not sold the prisoner any, and had given him no authority to sell them for the last two years—he has sold them and given me the money, though J</p>

               <p>have never given him orders to do so—during the last two years I have stopped him selling or giving a bloater to anybody—I stopped him two years ago when I heard what was going on—I am not aware that he has done it within the last two years—the boxes are put on barrows, and there should be a tarpaulin over them—I have spoken to the prisoner several times about the tarpaulin—I have said, "What is the reason you don't put the tarpaulin over it I" and he said, "I have only just undone it"—I gave information to the police on the 3rd March—I was not with the policeman when the prisoner was taken—the prisoner came to my shop with the first load, I was not there then—he came a second time, and I was there—this was the second load—my son was on the bridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I swear the prisoner has not bought fish from me within the last two years—a person named Anderson is in my employ—he was working in the yard—he spit the herrings in the smoke-hourse, Kent Road—he did nothing else—he might load them, I am not there, to see—it was his duty—I heard him give evidence at the police court—he never told me that the prisoner before he took them away said he would pay for the eight boxes—he said at the police court "He asked me to pack eight plain boxes of her<lb></lb>rings for the country belonging to Mr. Nash; he said,' 1' ll settle with the governor'"—he was my servant—I paid him a halfpenny a box as a carrier for all he brought over—I paid him no wages—he could not come and deal with me when he liked—he fetched all my goods from the market—at the shop he could come and deal if he chose, but he was not obliged—I never sold him anything in the yard—he could do as he thought proper—he had to come to the shop if he wanted to buy anything—I have not permitted him to sell anything for the last two years—he did not give me the whole of his time—he worked about three hours a day—he never worked long—I have known him about eighteen years—he has been acting for me in this way about fourteen years—I cannot say if he dealt on his own account—he bought some things to send to Maidstone—he was a dealer and sent things to Maidstone, nowhere else that I am aware of—I do not know where he sent—Maidstone was the only place I am aware of—he did deal—I do not know who he dealt with—I have heard him say he dealt at Maidstone, but 1 do not know with whom—I do not know that he has bought things or sent for them from me and paid for them within the last two years—nothing was said of it in the yard—I was on London Bridge on the 3rd, about 7 a.m. I was not with my son Henry when he took them off the barrow, I was afterwards when I went to get the herrings—I got the herrings and went, back to market—I got the prisoner first—he came with the second load—the eight he put on extra for himself were in the second load—then he came back with the second load less the eight boxes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I told him two years ago not to sell anything—from that time I have occasionally employed him to take the herrings—if he had bought them and had not had the message from me that he was net to buy, 1 should have had the money and could have done nothing—he knew that would be the usual practice—he said nothing to me about buying them—he bad only to take them from one place to the other—he has done it for years and knew what his duty was—he also know what to do if he wished to buy them—I have never had the money for them—he came twice with bloaters from the New Kent Road—he brought 80 boxes with the first load, about 5 a.m.—he would have to go back again with his empty barrow and load</p>

               <p>again—he brought 76 with the second load—that was two over the proper number—the eight that were left on the bridge were the same lot of boxes as the others, but were not marked—they were my boxes—it is unusual for people buying them to leave them with some one on the bridge—my boxes are always marked—the eight boxes were not marked because they did it between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son—in consequence of instructions from him, on the morning of the 3rd of March, about 6.45, I watched the prisoner—I first saw the prisoner coming over London Bridge, towards my father's place, with his barrow and some boxes of herrings upon it—no one was with him—he stopped by the steps on the City side and called a man, who took off eight boxes from the barrow—that is one of them—they were all plain—the man put them down and stopped with them—the prisoner went on—I did not follow him; I waited on the bridge to keep the man in sight—I saw a constable and told him of it, and then went back to my father's place—I saw the prisoner unloading the boxes—my father was there—I spoke to him but not in the prisoner's hearing—I said nothing to the prisoner—I went back to the bridge with my father and saw the eight boxes, and the constable had them brought away—the other man was there.</p>

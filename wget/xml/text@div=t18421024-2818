                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I am a member of a society called the Recbabites—there are other members—in March last I was steward of the Rose of Temperance Tent—what other societies call a "Lodge," we call a "Tent"—the money is the money of all the members jointlyl—there is a district of the society called the "London District," of which a gentleman named Russell was secretary last March—the prisoner applied to me in March respecting a sum of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which it was necessary to pay Mr. Russell from the funds of the club—I have a book in which an entry was made of it in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"District return, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 30th March."—At the time that entry was made I huded him over that money with other money—it was his duty subsequently to produce a receipt for the money, if he paid it—he handed me this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at one of our meetings—I cannot say exactly the date—he gave it me as the receipt for that money—he did not state whether he had paid the money—he only produced the receipt—I did not observe the sum at the time, but, on looking over the book, I saw that it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and asked why he had not produced a receipt for the whole of the sum—he said he must have another receipt at home, for goods, or something, to ac<lb></lb>count for the difference—I asked why he wanted two receipts for the pay ment of one sum of money—he could not account for it—he said it out be for goods, or something.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Broadway, Westminster. In March last I was acting as secretary of the London District of the society of Recha<lb></lb>bites—the prisoner was secretary of the Rose of Temperance Tent—in April last he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of that tent—it is a fund in which Fowler is interested as a partner—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid on re<lb></lb>turns due from that tent to the district—I have here the return made up by him—it is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a mistake of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that reduces it to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is in the prisoner's own writing—I gave him a receipt when he paid me—this receipt is not it—it is not my handwriting—it is written on part of a letter which I addressed to the prisoner in the course of business—here is "Mr. Buchanan, 19, Durham-row, Church-yard, Hackney"—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I should say this receipt is his writing considerably disguised.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you any recollection of the day the money was paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the exact day—it was early in April—I know of no cor<lb></lb>rected or supplementary returns being given in—I have not heard of any given to Mrs. Russell—this letter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by the prisoner</hi>)—is my writing—I wrote it to inform you that you had paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for one Baker's over-age money—that is all—I know of no other corrected return.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a long defence, stated that other members of the tent made entries in his book during his absence, and that money was frequently paid to Mrs. Russell; that the receipt in question would not have been pro<lb></lb>duced to Mr. Fowler at all, his office having expired, but to his successor; and that he had written to the chief ruler of the tent, and Mr. Russell, beg<lb></lb>ging that if there was any error, he might be allowed a meeting, to make things correct, which had been refused.</hi>)</p>

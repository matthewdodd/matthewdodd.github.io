I was at St. Dunstan's church, and saw the prosecutor come in; going out at the door, I heard him say he believed this young man, (meaning the prisoner) had got his handkerchief, and he would have him searched; I being a constable, took him in charge; he owned he had got the handkerchief, I did not hear him say he took it out of the prosecutor's pocket; he said he took it up from the ground, but I was behind, fearing he should drop the handkerchief; (the handkerchief produced in court.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman butcher, and lodged in St. John-street. I lost these things from there from the 1st to the 5th of March—I employed the prisoner as a charwoman—she was with me till the 5th of March—she did not sleep there—she left without notice—I never saw her from the time I missed my clothes till five or six weeks ago, when I found her in Whitechapel-road—she told me she had found my clothes, and if I would go to Hackney, to her brother, she would give me the duplicate—I walked on the road till I met the policeman, and gave her in charge—I had quitted that lodging on the very evening that I missed my things, and cannot tell whether she knew the lodging that I had gone to—she told me she would bring the duplicates to my house if I would tell her where I lived.</p>

He gave me his things to wash on the Saturday—I took them home on Monday for him to put on—I asked him to pay use—he said he could not, for the young woman he lived with had fallen out with him, and she had taken his money—I took the coat to pay myself. Wit<lb></lb>ness, I never gave her any thing to wash.</p>

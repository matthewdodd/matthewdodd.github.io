               <p>GABRIEL FERRY sworn. - I am night beadle of the Hamlet of Ratcliffe: Last Thursday morning, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming up the Butcher-row, near Ratcliffe, with a sack upon his back; I asked him what he had got there; he eased it off his shoulders on the payement, and seemed in great agitation of mind, and at a loss for an answer; I told him it was my duty to see what he had; after a little time the sack was opened, and he said, well then, hang me for a little small beer; I said, his agitation of mind, and evasive answer, made it necessary for me to stop him; in the sack was a pin, which contained four gallons of two-penny; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find to whom it belonged? - A. The prosecutor heard, before I was up in the morning, that I had taken a man with a pin belonging to him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MYER sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Crotchrade Whissing, <rs id="t17961130-59-viclabel317" type="occupation">brewer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17961130-59-victim517 t17961130-59-viclabel317"></join>, Queen-street, Ratcliffe-cross; (the pin and sack produced); that cask belongs to Mr. Crotchrade Whissing, there are the initials of his name in four places; the sack belongs to William Burgess, a lighterman, his name is upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss such property? - A. From the number we have in the brewhouse it is impossible to tell exactly; the prisoner was directed to attend the brewhouse, as watchman, that night, they do it in turn when there is not a regular watchman; we had not a regular watchman at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has that man been with you? - A. Three years; he had a very good character, we had not the least suspicion of him; we have lost the liquor out of the cask carrying it backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. This cask I found just by the brewhouse, between two and three in the morning, going home from my work; I met the constable of the might and he stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-police-inspector</hi>). On 22d Nov., about a quarter-past one o'clock in the night, I was in a police-galley, off Bermondsey, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I rowed to White's coal-wharf, and heard a scuffling among the barges, and a boat rowing in—I jumped into a barge, and Simmons, one of my men, caught hold of the prisoner; I secured another man, and several others got away—Simmons called out, "He has got an iron bolt"—I went up, and the prisoner struck me several times over the head with this life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it is loaded with lead, and was fastened round his wrist—I became insensible—I was very much bruised about the temple—I could not get my mouth open for several days.</p>

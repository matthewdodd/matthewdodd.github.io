               <p>I lost a pair of shoe buckles on the 16th of May; they were taken out of my shop; I had seen them in the shop at about two o'clock. I missed them between that and four o'clock. I found the buckles at a pawnbroker's, in consequence of the prisoner's confession; he was taken up on the 17th, when he stole another pair. I then sent my man after him when he went out of the shop; he brought him back and a pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280052"></xptr> my buckles were found upon him; he then readily confessed taking these.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing for himself? - I said I had enough to convict him, and begged he would tell me what he had done with the others, as I suspected him to be the person that had taken them. He confessed immediately he had taken them and pawned them for twelve shillings, and he told us the place. I asked what induced him to take them? He said, to pay his lodging. I said then, I will provide you a lodging.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any promise or threats to induce him to confess? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>To Heslep. Where do you live? - At No. 61, St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Heslep; between five and six in the evening, on the 16th of May, my fellow servant asked me if a pair of buckles had been sold? I said no. Upon looking on the side-board I missed this pair. I went immediately backwards to my master and informed him of my apprehension that the buckles were stolen. My master said they must be found. I saw the prisoner in Cheapside. I do not recollect seeing him in my master's shop before I took him. I next day missed another pair of buckles. I had a description given me of this man by a lady; I went into Cheapside after him, that was on the 17th. I found him near Bow-church. I was cautious of accosting him as a thief, because I had never seen him before. I tapped him on the shoulder and said, Sir, a gentleman in St. Paul's Church-yard wants to speak to you. He hesitated a moment and then asked me if I knew the gentleman's name? I said no; but if he pleased I would conduct him to the person. He said no more but immediately came along with me; I had not then charged him with the fact. I took him to my master's shop; going along I was doubtful whether he was the man or no; I watched his hand and thought if he was the man he would try to shuffle them out of his pocket, accordingly when he came near to St. Paul's Church-yard I saw him move something out of his pocket and clap them into the waistband of his breeches; he shifted his hands several times out of one pocket into another, I was then thoroughly convinced he was the man I wanted. I brought him to the shop, the lady was there waiting. I asked her if she had seen that man in our shop before? She said yes. I said you are very right, Madam, he has got the buckles in the waistband of his breeches; and I told him he might as well give them me out, on which he loosened his breeches and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any questions asked about the buckles which were lost the day before? - When I took the buckles from him I looked at him and saw he was an elderly man; I thought he had lived better than he does now; I shook my head at him and asked him what induced him to do it? He said it was distress. I asked him then if he did not come to our house yesterday? He made no reply. I said I believe you are the man; did not you come to our house yesterday and take a pair of silver buckles? He said yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was your master present at this examination? - No.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to him to induce him to confess? - No; only I importuned him several times to tell me if he had not been there the day before and taken a pair of buckles, and that it would be better for him to confess. He said he had been there and taken a pair of buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any particular promise made to him? - Not by me.</p>
               <p>By your master? - Not that I recollect.</p>

               <p>He promised if I would confess he would forgive me. I am an attorney at law. My friends are not in town.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Heslep. Did you promise to forgive him if he would confess? - No, not at all. I asked him what he had done with the twelve shillings; he said he had paid his lodging with it. I said I would take care he should not have lodgings to pay again for some time, that was all the promise I made.</p>

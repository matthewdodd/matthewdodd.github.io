                  </hi>. I live in Weymouth-street, Walworth. On Tuesday evening, the 7th of Jan., I came home a little before eight o'clock, and knocked at the door—nobody answered—I heard footsteps inside, and noticed a light in the passage—I knocked again, and the light was put out—I heard a rush towards the door, which was immediately opened—three or four men rushed out, and knocked me down a few yards from the door—as soon as I recovered from the reeling position I was in I laid hold of the prisoner—I was standing close to the gutter, three or four yards from the door, and he was'on the pavement—I held him till a policeman came up—he asked what I had hold of him for—I said, "I believe you are one of the party who came out of my house"—he denied it—I gave him in charge—when the men rushed out I heard a fall of keys, and as soon as I gave the prisoner in charge the parties outside picked up some keys, and deli<lb></lb>vered them to me—on going up stairs I found the bed-room all in confu<lb></lb>sion, the bed-quilt taken off and spread on the floor, several drawers broken open, articles taken out, and placed in the quilt, to be taken away—when took hold of the prisoner he said he was only passing in the street—I was too confused positively to swear he was one who came of the house—I did not notice anybody else passing by—I seized him the instant I had done staggering from the door—my house is in a very public thoroughfare—I</p>

I was in Prospect-place on Tuesday, the 7th of Jan., about ten minutes to eight o'clock—the prose-cutor lives at the corner house—I was a few yards from his house—I heard him call "Police!"—I went up and saw him holding the prisoner, who was trying to get away—the prosecutor said, "Take him in charge"—I asked what for—he said there were four of them came out of his house when he came home—after we got a light in the house, he said that he had thrown something down in the street like keys—he went out with a light, and got four skeleton keys in a small bag—the prisoner denial throwing them down—the prosecutor did not express any doubt of the prisoner being one of the four men till he got before the Magistrate—he looked at the prisoner and said, "D—n you, you might as well bare gone to somebody else, instead of coming to me, I thought I should have been the last you would have come to"—he said he knew the lot of them—I said, "I suppose he is one of the <hi rend="italic">New-streeters</hi>—(there is a bad lot in New-street)—he said, "He does not come far away"—the prisoner said it was a d—d lie, that he was passing by at the time—I found some matches, a small knife, and box-key on him—I told Wade to appear next morning but he did not—I went to his house, and was told he was gone to Wales—this large key opens the prosecutor's door with the greatest ease.</p>

I was in the Walworth-road, and received information—I went to Wade's house—I found the prisoner in the back parlour in custody—I, Clark, and Wade, went up stairs, leaving the prisoner in charge—I saw a quilt on the floor, and a quantity of wearing apparel in it—Wade did not intimate the least doubt of the prisoner being one of the party who came out of his house—Wade told the prisoner he ought to have been the last person he should have come to—I asked if he could describe the other three—he said, "The fact is, I know the gang of them, but I should have thought they should have left me alone."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Eglin, and live in Mather's-court, Upper Whitecross-street, St. Luke's. I took the prisoner for a few days—she went away on Thursday morning, the 24th of October—I missed a shirt, a towel, and a pair of stockings that day—I have seen them since—they are mine—she did not come back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City constable. The prisoner was given into my custody on the 26th of October—when she was brought in custody she was in a most destitute condition, and had only been discharged by proclamation on the 20th of that month—she had attempted the life of her child—I took her into custody and implored her to tell me truth—she declared most solemnly she knew nothing of it—I said in going along, "Why did you give way to drink?"—she then told me, that this article, which is a foreign towel, she had got a man to pawn, and if I went to her lodgings I should find a duplicate on the mantel-piece—on the day of the second examination she called me and said, "It is useless to disguise the fact about the shirt, it was pawned for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; if you go to the prosecutor's room, you will find the duplicate behind a box "—which I did, and got it.</p>

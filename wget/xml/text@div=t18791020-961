                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant of Ipswich, and have several branch establishments—in May, 1878, I advertised for an agent for Cole<lb></lb>chester, and in consequence got into communication with the prisoner, which resulted in this agreement being signed—I wrote it myself, and Mr. Chap<lb></lb>man, my accountant, witnessed it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th July</hi>, 1878, <hi rend="italic">between the prisoner and prosecutor, by which the prisoner transferred his coal business at Walthamstow to Mr. Mellonie, whose agent he became at a, salary of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, and half the net profits after payment of all debts and working expenses, the prisoner to keep the books, and not to retain more than</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in hand, but to pay the rest of the receipts to the bankers, and to enter into a bond for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">with the Guarantee Society.</hi>) I paid between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the plant used in his business—there was an execution in, and part of the price was paid to him, and part to to the Sheriff's officer—he was to give me the whole of his time, and was not to work for any one else—I permitted the arrangement to go on as R. T. Giles and Co., though he was only my servant, because I believed there was a goodwill in the name—he had not then told me anything about other means, except what he got from me—he was to send me a daily sheet, and to keep a ledger and cash-book, which he arranged with Mr. Chapman—the day sheets came irregularly—they were posted into the ledger at Jpswich—he had to supply me every day with a ledger summary of the amount and delivery, the names of customers, and the amount of coal in stock—on 19th September in consequence of something happening I went with Mr. Chapman to the prisoner, and told him that Mr. Breeze had told me he had received money, and had not accounted for it—I mentioned a customer's name, and asked him how he could do such a thing when I had been kind to him, and put him on his legs again, and that he ought to be ashamed to do so—he looked very cast down, and I said "I should like to know the full amount of your defalcations, and be careful for once in your life, and let me know the worst, because it is assuming a very serious aspect"—I took a sheet of paper, and said "You write it down," and as Mr. Chapman turned it over I said "You insert that"—I went out for a walk, and as I came back I met Mr. Chapman—I afterwards saw Giles again, and said "This is a shameful thing of you; I have now no alterna<lb></lb>tive but to inform the Guarantee Society, and I suspend you from any further duty on my behalf; take away anything which is your property"—he opened his desk, and took out a memorandum book and a child's book, and went home—he said that he had paid some money for commissions which he had not entered, and I said "You are not allowed to employ com<lb></lb>mission agents"—I afterwards saw this list signed by him—he has never accounted to me for the 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. specified here—this letter is in his writing—I received it, I think, on the Sunday morning following the 19th at my private residence. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was signed R. T. Giles, begging the prosecutor to have mercy on him for the sake of his wife and children, offering to work for him for</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week till he had paid back the money, and stating that he had not had all of it, as he had paid Gray and Eaton</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a ton.</hi>) I did not know of his allowing Eaton and Gray 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton.</p>

               <p>which he had not entered, but he said-nothing about deficiencies—he did not say that if I would allow him to go through the books I should find that the whole of that sum was covered by commissions; nothing of the kind—he did not tell me he had paid a number of commissions; this list was not in the office then—he did not say when I came back from my walk that the whole sum would be found to be amounts which he had allowed to customers or agents; nothing of the kind—this letter is in his writing (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st September, stating</hi>, "If you cannot trust me I can at once make other arrangements, and give you your money ")—after hearing that letter read I still say that I had not told him before that that he had embezzled, but I did on the 19th—that was after I had received his letter of the 1st—I was at Walthamstow two or three times between receiving that letter and the 19th, and I took steps to get the amounts collected by Mr. Breeze—I suspended him on the 19th; I was not aware that I could give him in custody; I was under the impression that a warrant was required, hence the delay—I took no steps that day to get a warrant—he was not arrested till 2nd October; that was the day I went to the police—I had suspended him on the 19th; I did not ascertain meanwhile that he was taking orders to rival coal merchants; I did not know that before 3rd October, when we were at Worship Street—that had nothing to do with my giving him in custody—by the 4th Article of the agreement I was to send him a cheque for his weekly expenses, and I did so for a long time; but it was discontinued last May or June—I did not send them, it was Mr. Chapman; but I signed them, and to the best of my belief they were sent regularly up to that time.</p>

Dear Sir,—I beg to withdraw my letter of 1st September, as it was written without due consideration"—after he was suspended he wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th September, requesting to know how long Mr. Mellonie intended to keep him suspended, as his wife and children were starving, and requesting to be allowed</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">commission on all orders given to Mr. Breeze</hi>)—I said that I had never heard such impudence in my life, and went and gave him in custody as soon as I could; I did not lose a train.</p>

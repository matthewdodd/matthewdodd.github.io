In consequence of suspicion Latham, the officer, searched her boxes, and found my hat-brush and gloves, which I had seen about three weeks before, in my box up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever dress in that room? A. Yes, and my brother-in-law also dressed there; her box was brought into our room to be examined; my brother has a nephew in the house.</p>
               <p>SUMNER ELSDEN. The prisoner was three weeks in my service, but slept at her home. On Sunday night, the 9th of December, I counted six bags of flour in the shop, and soon after I missed one; I sent the prisoner up stairs, and went and looked in the kitchen, and in the head of the cradle I found this bag of flour and two loaves, tied in a tablecloth; I brought them into the shop, and when the prisoner came down stairs from her mistress, I said, "Betsey, what a shocking thing it is for you to rob me in this way," and showed her the things, she said she hoped I would forgive her; there was a young woman there who came to see her, but I did not know that before: she bears a good character, and her friends are respectable.</p>

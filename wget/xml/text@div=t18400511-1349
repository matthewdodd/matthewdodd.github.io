                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, New North-street, Curtain-road. The prosecutor came to my house with the prisoner—there was a young man and woman with them, friends of the prosecutor's—four people came together—the other man and woman sat in my parlour on the sofa—the prisoner and prosecutor went up stairs—I went to bed, leaving them toge<lb></lb>ther, one party in the parlour and the other up stairs—I afterwards found the prisoner was gone—I found the party in the parlour there in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I did not perceive that the prosecutor was particularly intoxicated—I do not think he was sober, but I did not think him so very much the worse for liquor as I afterwards found he was—I saw him with gold and silver—he took out his purse and "gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his night's lodging—I do not recollect seeing him give the prisoner any thing—I went to the bed-room where the prosecutor slept—his pockets were turned inside out—he was asleep, and I could not wake him—I went into his room to awake him in consequence of an alarm that the prisoner was gone out—I found 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. lying on the table—there was no appearance of two persons having been in the bed—the prisoner went away directly, she never went to bed—I afterwards saw her in Finsbury and told her of this—she used very abusive language, and said, "Nothing found on me, no catch me, no half-penny, and they may go and be——at the time she went up stairs she asked me to lend her a bed-gown, which I did, and it lay as I left it.</p>

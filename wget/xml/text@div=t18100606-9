               <p>Q. Is Charlton field a field belonging to Mr. Morton - A. No, he bought some turnips there, and the sheep were there all hurdled round. On the evening of the 1st of March I counted them, there were two hundred and seventy; I went away from them about six o'clock when it was dark, they were all right when I left them. On the 2nd of March I let them out in the course of the day, counted them, and missed one; when I missed the sheep I looked round the hurdles, I saw one hurdle had been opened, and hard by that there was a gap in the edge, and the sheep had been drawed through there.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any marks in the edge by the wool that the sheep had been drawed through there - A. Yes. I went to the other side of the edge, there was an appearance upon the ground, that I could see; it had been drawn plain about fifteen rods; it was loaded on a poney then and carried away; I tracked the feet of the poney up the field and down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone when you tracked the feet of the poney - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you track the feet of the poney to - A. I tracked it about eighty rod that night, it was in the evening, I could not track it any more that night; I went home to my landlord, I told him that I had lost a sheep, and that it was carried away with a poney; I got some information from my landlord.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060009"></xptr>Q.The second day how far did you track the poney - A. I had to go across the road and up a little meadow's; we tracked the poney close to the prisoner's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You traced the poney quite back to the prisoner's house - A. Yes, where the prisoner lodged; the house belonged to Mr. Saunders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this poney - A. No, I was a stranger there, my master sent me there to look after the sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you traced this poney close up to the hedge as far as it could go - A. And the sheep was drawed over there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you suppose the poney to be unloaded did you see any marks there - A. I saw marks on the paling by Saunders's house.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know how far it is from where you saw the marks on the hedge to Saunders's house - A. About twenty rods, he could not go any further with the poney.</p>
               <p>Q. How far where the pales from the hedge - A. Close by.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no marks on the other side of the hedge A. No, the poles were close by.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed this what did you do - A. I went down and got a search warrant; and the constable went with me to Saunders's house; we searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the second day after you missed it, was it - A. Yes, Mr. Saunders was not at home, I saw the prisoner and his wife, they were at home when we searched; the prisoner is a taylor; upon searching the house we found all but the liver and the head; we have got the skin and wool here. The sheep was cut up into joints as well as he could cut it, and all hung up over the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does your father live - A. At Upper Alliford Sunbury.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was the sheep brought to your father's house - A. On Friday the 2nd of March; my father returned on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a mother alive - A. No, I have a sister, she is nine years old, there were only us two left in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his bringing this sheep in your father's house - A. No, only I saw it in the back-kitchen on the Friday morning about five o'clock, the prisoner was just coming in at the back-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheep dead - A. Yes, but the skin was not off; the prisoner asked me to help him up stairs with it; I did, and his wife helped it up too. When he got it up stairs he began skinning it; he asked me to help him, I helped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got it from - A. No, did not ask him. I thought it queer to see it in the house. He skinned it, and about three o'clock on the Friday afternoon he cut it into joints. At night I saw him pulling the wool off the skin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him hang up the joints - A. Yes near about his bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Recollect, you are going to take my life away. Was not part of the wool off the skin when you saw it in the house - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The wool been seen in that place, there were some sheep in the field adjoining to the house, they come backwards and forwards into a garden this lad turned them out - A. Some of Mr. Collin's did the week before, none of Mr. Morton's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This poney has been in these people's field; it was apt to break into gentlemen's fields which is well known to the neighbours all round.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to Saunders.) What poney was this - A. My father's poney, he would sometimes run into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this poney on the 2nd of May - A. In my father's stable. It was in the stable that morning when I got up at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ESSOM. I am a constable of Sunbury, I searched the prisoner's house on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the month it was - A. Yes, the 3rd of March, I searched one room, and when I went to search another the prisoner ran away. I and another man went after him and brought him back. Then I searched the upper part of the house and in his bed-chamber I found very near the whole of the sheep cut up in joints in a very bad manner. We brought some of it down stairs, then we perceived there was something buried in the garden close to the back door and there we dug up the entrails, we found the skin at the top of the stairs in a bag, I took the bag with the wool and the skin in it home to my house; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any trace of the owners name on the skin - A. The wool was all plucked off the skin and the skin was underneath the wool in the bag, the wool being plucked off we could not trace the owners mark. This is the skin it was wet then, it is dry now, and this is the wool.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor) Look over the skin - A. I have done it before there was a mark on the wool provided that it had not been plucked off it was mark'd WL on the near side.</p>
               <p>Q. In the situation that you found the skin and the wool you could not discover any trace of that mark - A. No I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there several people in that neighbourhood that had sheep as well as you - A. Yes; not fat sheep, it was a very large sheep, I suppose it weighed thirteen stone, the neighbours flock of sheep were chiefly lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not weigh the different joints of this sheep did you - A. No, it was a wether sheep and by the skin I could perceive it was a wether sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will have a feeling for my wife and children. I am innocent of what I am brought here for as a child unborn. On the 29th of February as my wife was going home from Kingston to Alliford she saw a man standing close by the river with the carcase of a sheep, the head was missing, my wife having a horse and cart the gentleman told her she might take it home for her family, he told her it would be a pity for the sheep to lay there the tide would wash it away, the gentleman looked for the mark and finding no mark he told my wife he would help it into my cart which he did, my wife thanked him kindly, the gentleman told me I might take it without fear, I thought him to be my friend, the boy knows that I did not bring the sheep in, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Witness. He brought it in his own self.</p>

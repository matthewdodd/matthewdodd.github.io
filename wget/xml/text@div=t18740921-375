               <p>Office I made up, on the 19th August, this letter addressed to Mr. W. Watts, 3, Elliott's Row, Much Adam, Ware, Hertfordshire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I enclosed in it a sovereign and a ten franc piece—I marked those coins, and having enclosed them, fastened the envelope and took the letter to the Post Office in Chancery Lane—I registered it in the ordinary way at 6.45 in the evening—it would be collected at Chancery Lane that evening and would be taken to the Western Central Office where it would lay till the following morning and be despatched and received at the Head Office about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was on duty at the Head Office Registered Letter Branch he was employed there on the 25th August—after the letter was received at the Head Office a receipt would be sent from the Head Office with the letter and that receipt would be sorted instead of the letter—the tab would be torn off the receipt and it would be the prisoner's duty to present that tab to the officer who held the letter, and upon the production of that tab the letter would be handed over to him. and finally despatched in the letter bag for Ware—the receipt and tab are made out at the Western Central Office, and sent on with the letter to the General Office—the letter is retained by the head officer there and the slip is sent in to be sorted by the ordinary sorters and the prisoner would bring it to the head officer who has possession of the letter, and gives up this tab as the receipt for it—the would then enter it on the letter bill for Ware and he should enclose the letter with others in the registered letter bag for Ware—it would be his duty to see the bag properly tied and sealed, and take it to the Inland Branch—it would be the prisoner's duty to make up the bag. that morning—about 7.30 that morning I went to the Inland Branch of the General Office, and examined the Ware registered letter bag—it had been made up and sealed at that time—I opened it and found this letter torn in the way it is now, with the exception of being cut open at the top—there was an opening in the side the same as there is now, which was large enough for a coin to come through—I opened the letter in order to ascertain what was in it—the ten franc piece was still in the letter, and the sovereign was missing—I went into the Registered Letter Office where I shortly afterwards saw the prisoner come in—I took him into a private room and said "Did you make up the registered letter bag for Ware?"—he replied "Yes"—I said "I wish to speak to you about a letter," at the same time producing this letter—"I said, "Did you make up this for Ware this morning?'—he said "It looks like the one I had"—I said "This letter is mine, I enclosed a sovereign and another coin in the letter before it was registered and upon examining the bag and taking the letter out I find the sovereign has been abstracted from this letter, do you know anything about it?"—he said "<hi rend="italic">No"</hi>—he was then searched by Police Constable Moore—I saw him take the sovereign from one of his pockets—it was loose—he also took other monies which were in a purse from another pocket—I then said to the prisoner "Where did you get that sovereign?"—he said "I brought it from home this morning to pay 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for which I have been summoned at Guildhall"—I said "How long have you had the sovereign?"—he replied "Three or four days"—I then took the sovereign from the desk where it had been lying, and examined it and said "This is the sovereign which I identify as the one which I enclosed in the letter which I have spoken to you about, it bears my private marks—he replied "I know nothing about any marks, as I do not examine coin when I receive it"—the prisoner was then given into custody—he said "I hope you don't think I stole the sovereign,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> A letter posted at 7 o'clock in the evening in Chancery Lane would pass through the hands of two or three persons t hat evening—the address of the letter is entered in a book and the letter is kept till the next morning, when it would pass through another officer's hands at the West Central Office, and at the Chief Office, before it came into your possession it would pass through another officer's hands—it would be his duty to check the address of the letter and see that it was secure—it was your duty to sign the tab, and on the production of the tab the letter would be handed over to you—after the letters were enclosed in the bags you were responsible for them, and you would use your own discretion whether you would pass them to an assistant to seal them—it is your duty to see that they are sealed—for your own security you would do that—I received the bag about 7.20—I don't wish to swear that the contents of that letter were safe when it went into your hands—you would have an opportunity of mutilating a letter, as you have done in this case—each officer is looking after himself and has his; own duty to do—the assistant superintendent was in his desk when I went in to see you—you did not hesitate when I asked you whether you despatched the letter for Ware that morning; you hesitated about the letter and said it looked like the letter—you said you could not swear to that letter, but you had despatched one to the same address—I directed the officer to search you and you did not object in any way—I took the sovereign up from the desk after you had said you had had it in your possession three or four days, and told you I identified it as the coin I had put in that letter—I said the sovereign was marked, and you said when you took money you did not look to see if it was marked—I did not show you the mark—I did not tell you the letter contained marked money until I took possession of the money—I showed you where I expected the sovereign had come out of the envelope—many letters pass through the office with envelopes broken, but it is the duty of each despatching officer to examine those letters and see that they are intact before they pass through his hands—you asked me just now, with regard to mutilated letters, in each case those letters had passed through your hands, they had also passed through the hands of other people.</p>

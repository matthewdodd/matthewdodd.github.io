            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was taking my children a walk in <placeName id="t18231203-60-crimeloc322">Fleet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18231203-60-crimeloc322" type="placeName" value="Fleet-street"></interp>

Coates hit Herman over the elbow, and said, "Come along." They went up to the gentlemen. I saw Herman put his hand through Coates's arm, into the gentleman's pocket - Coates spread his frock as wide as he could, to hide Herman's hand, and in about two minutes, I saw Coates shove something into his coat. I immediately hallooed out Stop him! and put my child out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030033"></xptr>arms, but it screamed so; I returned and lost them, and in about twenty minutes, I saw them again in Fleet-street. A gentleman passed with his handkerchief hanging a little out, and in a minute it was gone. I gave my child to a woman, and followed them, but lost them again, and next night, when I was on duty, I took them in Shoe-lane</p>

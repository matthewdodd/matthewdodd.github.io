On the afternoon of the 9th of September the pri<lb></lb>soner came to the stable a little before two o'clock, and asked if I could let him a saddle-horse—I said, "Yes"—he wanted it out in a great hurry, and asked me what it would be—I told him, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he paid, and went away with it—he said he should want it about two hours, and 1 could get it at No. 14, Suffolk-street, Haymarket, and he would pay me if I would fetch it—I said I could not, but I would send for it but I had no opportunity of sending for it—it is worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the saddle and bridle 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—somebody brought it back to the stable afterwards.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of September, in the after<lb></lb>noon, the prisoner came to me and said he had got a grey horse down it Mr. Worrow's, and he wanted to borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I told him I had not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to lend, and said, "Besides, I know nothing of you"—he said, would I come down to Mr. Worrow's in ten minutes—my son said, "If my mother is not there in ten minutes she will not come at all"—he went away, then came back, and asked if I would be there in half-an-hour—I said, "I don't know"—(Worrow is my farrier)—I went to Worrow's, but the horse was brought up to my place, and put into my stable—when I came home the prisoner asked me what I could lend him on it, and to-morrow, at twelve o'clock, he would come and fetch it—I told him I had not got more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I lent him on it—he said to-morrow he would come and pay me, and take the horse—it was in my stable two nights—I was not it home when they fetched it away.</p>

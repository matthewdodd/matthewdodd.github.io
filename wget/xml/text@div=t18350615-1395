                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker. I first saw the prisoner about a fortnight afterwards—I applied to him for the chaise for a gentleman, who wanted it for three weeks—I should not have applied to him, had I not wanted it, as I thought it perfectly safe—he said it had been broken by a bullock, but it was repaired, and I should have it home in half an hour—I saw him again in a day or two—he made some excuse—he said it should come home, but I have not got it yet—he said he had got an uncle who would give him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to defray the expenses—I saw him in prison—he said he had left it with a person—he said he had not sold it, but had had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced on the broken chaise.</p>

I have bad transactions with the prisoner in business—he said he had met with an accident and broken the chaise—I suppose this was about the 15th of August—he said he could not afford to repair it, and asked me what I could afford to give him—I went and saw it—he wanted 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said I thought 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the value of it—I gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I bought it—he went to my shop, and my man gave him the remainder of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in goods and money—I had it repaired, and sold it to Mr. White for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

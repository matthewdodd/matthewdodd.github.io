                  </hi> I am foreman to Mr. James and Mr. David Boyd, of Marylebone. The prisoner was in their service—on the evening of the 7th of Oct., I saw the prisoner come out of the shop—he appeared to have something round his body, under his jacket—I followed him to a marine-store shop, in Southmoulton-passage—I looked through the window, and saw the marine-store shopman bend this lid, and throw it under the counter—it is a copper soup pot-cover—I went into the shop, and asked the prisoner to come with me to Mr. Boyd's—he asked me to forgive him—I told him I could not, he must come back to his master—the lid was given into the constable's hands—this is it, it is my master's property, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can swear to it by the private mark—when the store shopman gave up the lid, the pri<lb></lb>soner ran away with it—Iran and overtook him—I found an officer in Oxford-street—the prisoner asked the officer and me to let him go—I gave him to the officer, and told him to bring him back to Mr. Boyd's—he no away a second time, and I caught him and gave him to the officer again—at the time I saw the prisoner, I said to him, "What do you do here with this lid?' and he said, "O God forgive me, God forgive me," and then he said be found the lid in the rubbish."</p>

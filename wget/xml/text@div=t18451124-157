                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Lewisham—on the 28th of Oct. the prisoner came to my house, between three and five o'clock—he called for a pint of beer and a roll and cheese, and afterwards for a screw of tobacco—he eat the roll, and then called for another pint of beer—I served him with that—I was then called out, and before I went I asked him for payment—he got up, searched his pockets, and said he had lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said he could not have lost it there—I then went out, and while I was out I expect he placed this pint pot in his hat—I came back again, and asked him for payment—he said he had no money, but he would leave his waistcoat and handkerchief till the next Friday—I told him to walk off, and the next morning I was informed he was taken, with this pot of mine in his possession.</p>

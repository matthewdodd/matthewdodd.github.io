             sworn. - I came from Ireland to see my daughter; the rest of my family are in Ireland: On the 25th of September, I went to a play, and about half past eleven o'clock, I came home to my lodgings, the Hare and Hounds, in Puckeridge-street; I found the door locked, I began to cry; the prisoner at the bar came up to me, she said, do not be afraid, I will take you to an honest lodging; she took me home to where she lodged, in Puckeridge-street; she asked the man of the house if he could accommodate me, he said he could. In the morning the man came up, I asked the price of the lodging, he said a shilling, I took the bonnet off my head to get money to pay him. I went to get my cloak, and I could not find it; I asked the prisoner at the bar where my cloak was, she said, she never saw my cloak, I said, you could not be blind you must see my cloak.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - Q. Mrs. Brown, you live in the same lodgings in Puckeridge-street? - A. Yes, I lodged in the same room as the prisoner; on the 26th of September, this cloak was lost; the prisoner went out in the forenoon, and came home in the afternoon, and laid down on the bed, as she was laying down on the bed, her bonnet fell off, and a duplicate fell out of her bonnet, I had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300077"></xptr>curiosity to take it up, I saw it to be a cloak pledged in her name for 14 s. I laid down the ticket at the same time the woman came up that belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the ticket drop from her bonnet? - A. I did.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker. I produce a cloak pawned on the 26th of September, in the afternoon, by the prisoner at the bar; I lent her 14 s. upon it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure this is my cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutrix came and laid in the room where I was; she was out in the street; I go out to clean houses, or any thing I can do; she was locked out of her apartment; I said there was a lodging in Puckeridge-street. In the morning the landlord wanted her to make up the money for him, she had no money to pay for the lodging; in consequence of that she left her bonnet to be pledged for the money, and the cloak was left to pawn, to give me something for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the whole fourteen shillings? - A. I spent sixpence of it before I came home, I was very much in liquor; I left the remainder of the money till she called for it, the duplicate might be found on the bed for what I know.</p>
               <p>

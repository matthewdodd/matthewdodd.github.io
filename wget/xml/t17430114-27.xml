            . I live in a little Alley in Carter-Lane , by Doctor's-Commons. On the 26th of December I was waked by the Watchman a little after two in the Morning, who found my Door open. When I came down, I found I had been robbed. The Prisoner had lain at my House two or three Nights to make some Linnen for my Wife, and she was gone. I went in search of her, and found her in Kent Street the Monday was se'nnight following: She came quietly with me; and when I came within the Liberty of the City, I secured her. She had get on a white Cambrick-Gown, a Lawn-Cap, Stockings , Shoes, and Garters of my Wife's. She did not leave my Wife a Pair of Shoes to put on. (It appeared that part of the Goods were pawned at several Places)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would have gone away, and she would not let me, for she had been away two or three Days from her Husband at that Time; she gave me Leave to take them. - Says she, Molly, there are such and such Things upon the Shelf, tye them up in a red Handkerchief, and take them away: I will come to you on the other Side of the Water either To-morrow or Monday.</p>

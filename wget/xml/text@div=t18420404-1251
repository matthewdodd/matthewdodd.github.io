I am seventeen years old, and live at Old Brentford On Thursday, the 17th of March, I was in Heston-lane, between five and six o'clock in the evening, going to my master's, Robert Fox, and saw the prisoner coming towards me with a stick in his hand—he came, and told me to stop, and caught hold of my collar—he said he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer—I said I had it not for him, and tried to run away, but he stopped me, and knocked me into a ditch with his hands—he pushed me in—I, got up again—he pushed me down again, and snatched the handkerchief off my neck—he put his hand into my pocket, and took out another hand<lb></lb>kerchief—he put his band into my side-pocket, and took out a direction where I was going—he then ran away—that was all he did to me—he did not beat me—he hurt my back when he pushed me down, but not much—I felt it a little afterwards—he threw me into the ditch twice.</p>

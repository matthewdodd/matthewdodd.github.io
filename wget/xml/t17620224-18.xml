               <p>S. Kennon. I had never known him but for the neighbours. Last Wednesday se'nnight I was turning <placeName id="t17620224-18-crimeloc100">down Dias-street , near St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long had you seen this cart before the accident happened?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. But just before I expected it was going down St. Giles's, and it turned short, and I cried out to the young man, for Christ's sake, to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the cart from you when you cried out?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. About two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses were there?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the foremost of the three horses was two yards distant from your husband?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Yes, and if he had stopped then, my husband had been safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When you called out to this man to stop, did you observe at what rate he was coming?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon hesitated, and seemed not to understand.</p>

               <p>S. Kenning did not answer the question, but said he whipped his horses twice, and the fore horse beat him down, and the wheel ran over him in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man see your husband fall?</p>

               <p>S. Kennon. I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was between 6 and 7 o'clock, how was it as to light?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. I could see from one end of the street to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the corner that your husband was thrown down?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you called out to the carman to stop, and, instead of that, he drove on?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. Yes, he drove faster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband speak after he was thrown down?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. No, his brains were beat out in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>S. Kennon. He went on; I had enough to do to take care of my husband.</p>

            . About six or seven o'clock in the evening I happened to be coming down Dias-street, about five or six yards from the bottom of it, and I saw a man, and a woman leading him by the hand. I was on one side of the way, and they on the other, where there was a lamp, and they seemed to be both in liquor, but afterwards I thought otherwise. for the man, I understood, was almost blind; and I observed an empty cart turning down the corner of the street, the corner where the man and woman were.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the way was the carman? was he on the side where the man and woman were. or on the other side?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. He was on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the horses go between the carter and the man that was killed?</p>

               <p>J. Steward. Yes, my Lord, and the man gave the horse a lash, and I called to him, for God's sake, to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out to him before or after he had given the lash?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. After he had given the lash.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. The horses drove on, and I called out again, for I thought myself in danger, and he gave the horse another lash after I called.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first called out, for God's sake, to stop, how long was it before he gave another lash?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the man was run over?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave the second lash, can you say whether the deceased was then upon the ground?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I believe, to the best of my knowlege, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the carter had hold of the thill-horse, or otherwise?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I cannot say; he stood near the side of one of them, and I ran to the other side; and when I was at some distance I looked about, and saw the deceased lie on the ground, and the wheel go over his head or neck, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant was that?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. About five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cart drive on?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. Yes, at a very quick rate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an outcry?</p>
               <p>J. Stewart. I think there was, but I was too confused to know from whom.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak very cautiously; how long afterwards? before the man was taken was taken up?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240019"></xptr>J. Stewart. The next day, and I was at the coroner's inquest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen the cart before it turned the corner.</p>
               <p>J. Steward. I never saw it till it turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. At what rate was it going before the accident?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. At a quick pace, before any lash was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took up the deceased from the ground?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar drive on the cart, and take no care of the man?</p>
               <p>J. Steward. He did not stop to take any care of him.</p>

            . I was going to fetch some candles and oatmeal in Broad St. Giles's, and this man's cart stood at a stationer's about three doors from Dias-street, and he came out of the shop, and said Gee-ho? to the horses, and they went on, and were going to turn into Dias-street to go home; and as he turn'd a quick pace, I said, Jack, stop your horses; and he said directly, D - n your eyes Gee-ho? and gave them either two cuts or three, and then they went a full gallop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you call'd out to him, whereabout was the cart?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The fore horse had just turn'd the corner post.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you call'd out to him?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I had just cross'd the way, and was oblig'd to keep up very close to avoid danger: then Icried out to him, for god's sake, to stop; instead of which, he made use of that expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the stationer's?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I saw the horses there. I saw him come out of the stationer's and heard him say, Gee-ho: and they went on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar is the man?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. My Lord, I am very sure of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again after the accident?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The same evening; he came up stairs into my room, to ask me a question; I answer'd him, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nothing said concerning the misfortune that had happen'd?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes, my Lord and he said he hoped I would not appear against him; and I said I would not say any thing about it, unless I was oblig'd.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observed whether the man had hold of either of his horses?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. No, my Lord, he had no hold but was pretty near the side of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all in liquor at the time?</p>

               <p>D. Jolly. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you call'd out?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I call'd out before the man was run over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any endeavours to stop upon your calling out?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he heard you call?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the man that had fell down?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. I believe he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the farthest wheel from the carter, or the nearest that run over the man?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. The farthest, so that he could not see the accident happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he driving a good pace?</p>
               <p>D. Jolly. Yes, a great pace.</p>

            . I am a plummer, and employed his master to do all my business; and this man has always been so careful and sober, that I chose to have him before any other carter I ever knew; that he was never drunk at all, and would even refuse to drink a dram, if offer'd to him; and he was of a mild temper, no way severe to his horses.</p>
               <p>The judge, in summing up the evidence to the jury, remarked, that in the course of the evidence no proof had been attempted of his seeing the person, which is a circumstance that hath been deemed necessary to constitute it a capital offence; but that notwithstanding his conduct was attended with many other aggravating circumstances, which he presumed their candour would properly regard.</p>

             M'SELLAN. I am a bookbinder. I live at No. 11, Poppin's Court, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Steel, a cheesemonger - A. Perfectly well for many years; he keeps a cheese-monger's shop in Cloth-fair, West-smithfield. I went there on the 17th of June, in the evening to purchase some bacon. I observed Mr. Steel take from his counter a sheet of printed paper to wrap this bacon up. I observed some more sheets on the counter. On examining them I saw the last sheet of volume 21. I observed Strahan and Preston printed at the back of it. I knew then that it was Ree's Encyclopedia. I asked Mr. Steel if he had any more sheets; he said, yes. On the next day, I waited upon Mr. Steel, and told him it was my intention to inform Mr. Longman, who was the publisher of that work. I requested Mr. Steel to shew me the rest of the work: he shewed me some sheets in volume 22 of the same work. There were about four or five bundles. I took one of the sheets to Mr. Longman, the bookseller. They sent to Mr. Spottiswoode, who is the manager of Mr. Strahan's concern. I took Mr. Spottiswoode to Mr. Steel's house; there he recognized the property to be Mr. Strahan's.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STEEL. I am a cheesemonger. I live at 29, Cloth-fair, West-smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do. I have known him a twelvemonth at least. He has been in the habit of coming to my house for that time. He came to offer me waste paper. I gave him five pence per pound for it. This is the same paper I bought of him. Mr. Spottiswoode came to my house and claimed it. It was afterwards put into the hands of the constable. I went to Mr. Strahan's warehouse. I pointed out the prisoner, as being the person that brought the paper to me. I knew his person very well.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received, did you go to Mr. Steel's shop - A. I did. I found there some paper of Messrs. Strahan's and Preston's. The paper I saw there was their property. The work has never been published. We publish it in parts. Some parts have been published. They are waste sheets of vol. XXI. and vol. XXII. of the Encyclopaedia by Rees.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of this the perquisites of any of your men - A. None. The prisoner was an apprentice to Mr. Preston, in that house. He had been engaged in printing this particular work between five and six years. I appointed Mr. Steel to come to me. He came, and pointed the prisoner out as the person from whom he had bought this paper. Upon that I ordered the constable to take him in custody. The prisoner desired I would not be hard with him: he had a wife and child; and that had induced him to purloin this property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Has Mr. Strahan a concern in another printing-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you receive a profit from what is sold - A. I am not a partner. I do not receive a regular salary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you receive a profit or loss upon the work, more or less, done - A. Yes: and I have some capital embarked in it also.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you answerable for this. Does it add, or diminish - A. Diminish, certainly. My profit is in proportion to the profit of the whole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you are a partner.</p>

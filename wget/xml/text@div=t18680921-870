                  </hi>. I am a widow—until very recently I carried on business as a coffee-house keeper, at 77, Old Kent Road—on 17th August, about 7 in the evening, the prisoner came with her father, Mr. Jennings, to ask if I could accommodate her with a bed for a night—I said, "Yes"—they had tea there—her father sat with her for some time, and left about 10.30—the prisoner went to her bed room about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards—after she had been in her room some time, she opened her door and called three times "Madame"—I went to see what was the matter, and she said a man was in the chimney, or secreted in the room—the bar parlour chimney runs through the room, but there is no fire-place in the room—I stayed with her from seven to ten minutes, and then left, and she promised to make herself comfortable and go to bed—she believed the house was really respectable—she had been drinking for a week, and she was afraid it was the effect of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—she appeared quite sober then—she asked if I would allow her a candle to burn all night, as she was very nervous, and I allowed her to have one—I then went back to my sitting room—shortly afterwards, as I was putting out the gas and going to my bed room, the prisoner opened her bed room door, and stood with a revolver, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210125"></xptr>
               <p>threatened me—she said, "You wretched woman, this night you die!" or words to that effect—she pointed the revolver direct at me—I was standing in the door-way of my sitting room, which was nearly opposite her bed room—there was a light in the sitting room, and also in her room—I had just time to run on to the second or third step of the stairs when the bullet passed me—I heard it strike the cornice of my sitting room, just above my had—I heard the report—the bullet struck the cornice, and lodged in a chair beneath—I rushed up stairs, and screamed "Police!" and "Murder!" from my top room window—the police came, and I asked them to break in at the door, for a woman was shooting at me—the door was burst open, and a witness with the policeman rushed in—the prisoner rushed down stairs with the revolver in her hand, declaring she was a desperate woman, and she would blow out the brains of the first who approached her—I rushed down behind her, put my hand on her shoulder, and pushed her into the street, and screamed to the policeman to secure her, as she had a pistol—the policeman had gone outside, and stood behind the door, so as to catch her as she came out—he took her into custody—I found the bullet next day in the padding of the chair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had never seen the prisoner before that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, nor her father—we were particularly amicable together while at tea—she did not go out of the house after tea—her father did, and he returned some time after, and the prisoner asked my servant if he might bring her something to her bed room; what it was I do not know—she retired to bed about 10.30—it was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards that she said a man was in the chimney—she seemed excited and alarmed—I endeavoured to pacify her—nothing passed but what was civil and kindly—as near as I could, guess, it was from 11.15 to 11.30 when she presented the revolver—there was a hole in the lining of the chair where the bullet lodged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As the prisoner stood at her door with the revolver, were you on a level with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was a little below me—her father left and returned while I was talking to her in her room—he was not with her above two minutes then—she was perfectly sober when I left her—she said she was suffering from delirium, and it was nothing but nervousness on her part.</p>

I am a shoe maker, and live in 24, Park Place, Lock's Fields—the prisoner is my daughter—she is married to a seaman—on 17th August she came to me—I had not seen her for fourteen or fifteen months—she appeared very much excited—she said she had a pistol—I begged her to give it me—she was labouring under the idea that somebody was following her to rob her—she repeated that several times—I went with her to Mrs. Pilbeam's.</p>

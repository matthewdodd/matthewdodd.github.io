               <p>On the 6th of June I caught the prisoner at the cart's tail, between two and three in the afternoon, I caught him pulling the staves open and taking the tobacco out of a hogshead, he was doing it with his hands, I saw him take this, and he put it under his arm, and he had it under his arm when I took him; he might have about a couple of pounds, as near as I can guess, it was leaf tobacco; I said, come my friend, I have had many a run after you, but you have got off; says he, I hope you will not hurt me, and I gave him in charge to the Compter; I never lost sight of him, I am sure he is the man, I left the tobacco at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunter. I had the tobacco, there were about seventy hogsheads, there were three hogsheads laying on the ground, it is American tobacco; I was there two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290151"></xptr> three times that day, I had the care of all the tobacco that came by this ship.</p>

               <p>I was at work, and this tobacco was laying on the ground, and I stooped and was taking it up, and going to put it on the cask, and this man came and took me; and said I was going to steal it.</p>

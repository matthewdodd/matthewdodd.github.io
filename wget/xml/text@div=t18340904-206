I was in bed, and I got up and put on the prisoner's stockings - she was tipsy, and she let a sovereign fall - I asked her if it was hers - she said, "Yes," and I gave it her - I could not make the prosecutor understand any thing - when the prisoner was at the foot of the bed, she said, "I have got the young man's watch"- I cannot tell whether he gave her the sovereign.</p>

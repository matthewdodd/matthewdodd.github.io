            ; the prisoner at the bar came up to me, and said, your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. The prisoner is the man; I got up from my seat, being very much alarmed; he then said, in a loud tone of voice, you hesitate; upon which I turned round, I was going to run away, and he presented a pistol at me; I said, stop, Sir, and I will give you all I have got; I gave him my purse containing a seven-shilling-piece, some silver, two or three shillings, and there was a little gilt clasp in the purse; he then ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the size of the pistol which he presented to you? - A. It was a small pistol; half of his face was covered with a white handkerchief, the lower half; the prisoner was brought to me in about a quarter of an hour afterwards; the children had raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was brought back, did you, to the best of your belief, think he was the person that had robbed you? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner, who now stands at the bar, the man who was brought back to you? - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. How long had you seen him before he came up to you? - A. I had not seen him till he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one half of his face covered during the whole time he was with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under much alarm at the time? - A. I was not at the first.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that you are enabled to say that he is the man, one half of his face being covered? - A. I attended very particularly to the other part of his face; for as I knew I had but very little in my purse, I was afraid what he might do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any particular observation upon his dress during the time he was with you? - A. Yes; he had on a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had his own hair, or a wig? - A. I did not observe that; he was without powder.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you enabled to judge with certainty - do you speak from his features? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled, from the observation you made, to speak with certainty? - A. I can speak with certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the garden was it? - A. Near the Bayswater-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back to you did you hear him speak? - A. Yes; and I knew his voice immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Sarah Vale at the time? - A. She was sitting opposite to me; one of the children was sitting by me.</p>
               <p>Q. What age was that child? - A. About twelve.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Newbolt. I am nurse to Mr. Mills's children: On the 9th of May I was in Kensington-gardens with Miss Nation, I was sitting on the grass opposite to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you turned towards Miss Nation, or from her? - A. From her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time observe the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear to him; I only saw the colour of the coat, it was a brown coat, I saw him running; just after that, I saw him take a dirty handkerchief from his face and put it into his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man that was brought back to Miss Nation the same coloured coat on that the man had on that you saw run? - A. I think he had, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far might you be from Miss Nation? - A. About an hundred yards; I then rose my head up and saw him running; he was then about as far from Miss Nation as I am from there,(the bench); I was very much alarmed for the children; I think he was a man about the same size, but I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>- FAIRCLOUGH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Newbolt. I am a surgeon, in Queen-street, Portman-square: On the 9th of May I was in Kensington-gardens; I saw Miss Nation about three hundred yards from the Bayswater-gate, or between two and three hundred yards, she was sitting upon the first bench from the gate; I heard the alarm of the children, and immediately saw the prisoner running down the gravel-walk, I immediately pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the bench where Miss Nation was? - A. About an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar the man that you saw running? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else running at the same time? - A. No; I pursued him till he came to Grosvenor-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Grosvenor-gate from where Miss Nation was sitting? - A. About a quarter of a mile at least; I saw what direction he took when he got into Hyde-park, and called out, stop thief;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280007"></xptr>other persons called out, stop thief, also, and he was stopped, I saw him laid hold of; I had him in my eye all the way, except as he passed through Grosvenor-gate; when I cried stop thief, he slackened his pace very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - A. No, I did not; I beckoned to the people, when he was laid hold of, to bring him to me, and he was brought to Grosvenor-gate, where I stood; and when they brought the prisoner to me, I desired them to lead him on to Miss Nation; I went with them, and she positively identified his person; I did not see the pistol found, but I heard the prisoner say that he picked up the pistol.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you perfectly sure, that the person who was brought to you at Grosvenor-gate, was the person that you had seen running in Kensington-gardens? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him stop for any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What was the cause of your pursuit? - A. The children gave an alarm, and Miss Nation pointed out to me that that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any handkerchief found in his hat? - A. Yes; there was a white handkerchief, a coarse cambric handkerchief, rather dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it found? - A. No; the Duchess of Dorset's servant told me it was found in the hat; after he came to Bow-street the handkerchief was found in his pocket.</p>

            : I was walking up the Park, and met the prisoner at the bar, he was walking, but seemed to be spent with running; I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw nobody else running, and there fore I stopped him; I did not see him drop the pistol, I saw Doan pick it up; we then took him back to Miss Nation, and she recognized him immediately; I found a dirty white handkerchief in the crown of his hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, with regard to the pistol, the evidence that saw me pick the pistol up is now at Bath; it is true I had it in my possession; there was a review in the Park, both of horse and foot, I went into the Park to see it, and kicked this before me; I picked it up, and with a bit of stick I tried it, and found it was not loaded; I looked at the lock, and found there was but one screw in it; as to Miss Nation, I am perfectly innocent; it was a very hot day, and the people were drove about very much, and there were a great many people glad to put handkerchiefs in their hats to keep the sweat from running down their faces; I dare say there were fifty people in the Park with handkerchiefs in their hats; I have lived with Lord Howe, and some of the first families in the kingdom, and am now in the Custom-house; there were several people running in Kensington-gardens; I offered to be searched when I was stopped; but as to Miss Nation, the great Searcher of hearts knows I never saw her purse or money, and we shall be judged by-and-by; I know I had this pistol about me; I thought it would look black against me, and I threw it away.</p>

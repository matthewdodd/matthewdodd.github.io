               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the table, in question, under the green cloth at all? - A. I did not put the cloth aside to see, but a hard substance was there, which was gone in the morning; I saw you bring the table out of the pantry at half-past four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did my mistress ever pay you the bills when I was present? - A. When taking away the breakfast things; I have lived in Mr. Mackay's service four years, and the prisoner three months.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was you sent for to the house of Mr. Mackay? - A. I was, and found the prisoner in the drawing-room asleep, on a sofa; he had a gown over his shirt, and something tied round his head, but nothing else on: I was shewn a drawer which was broke open, and this turnscrew fits the place; I saw a green cloth on the ground, in the pantry, thrown down in a heap; there was a false key in the lock, which could not be got out; I waked the prisoner, and told him to dress himself, and go along with me; he wanted to know what was the matter; I told him he was best able to judge, and took him to the watch-house; the housekeeper had told me the story in his presence; but he did not deny it, or say any thing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You live in Great Cumberland-street? - A. I do: I went out of town the 12th of April, and left particular directions with the prisoner, not to be absent from the house after ten o'clock, and to sleep in the butler's-pantry for safety; I returned to town on the 18th, and was told this story by the housekeeper; I opened the table, and there were one five pound note, four two pound notes, and two one pound notes, five guineas and a half in gold, nine shillings in silver, a watch and gold seals, and a pocket-book, with gold instruments; this key was in the lock, and this is a key which Mrs. Mackay had inadvertently left in the drawer; it belongs to some drawers where there is great property; I will not be positive, but I think it possible, and believe the prisoner has been present, when Mrs. Mackay has paid her weekly bills.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The morning Mr. and Mrs. Mackay left town, I went up into the drawing-room, to take the breakfast things away; I put them on the tray, and, turning myself round, I hit the tray against the table, and struck a small part of the inlaid work off; the day following I had a few jobs to do, and did not wish any-body to know I had broke it; therefore I took it down into the pantry, with intent to fasten on the work; I went out to spend the evening; I left it in the pantry; when I came home, I went to bed, and seeing the table, I got out of bed to take it up stairs, that they should not suspect I meant to do any thing with it; the housekeeper has said, I delivered a key into her possession; and my master says he took it out of the lock himself; therefore, what key I could deliver to her, I don't know; I have a wife and three helpless children, entirely depending on me for support, and are the principal sufferers; if I am excused for my first error, I shall be extremely cautious of my future conduct.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Laking.) Q. Was the table broke? - A. Not that I saw; I never examined it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship breaker, and have a counting-house in Fore-street, in the parish of St. Ann, Limehouse. On the 18th of March between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner coming out of the wharf, a little way from my counting-house—he had a bundle before him—I went to stop him, but he went round some timber, and threw the bundle away—the officer picked it up—it contained the property stated—the prisoner is quite a stranger—I had not been out of the counting-house ten minutes—I had left it locked, and the key in the door—I found it locked as I left it—he must have opened the door—the things were hung up in the counting-house, not in a bundle—the counting-house door opens on to the wharf.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between you before this matter happened - A. No quarral at all; he told me he owed me an old grudge. This happened on the 20th of February, about ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before that time on that day - A. He was drinking at the public-house. I had been his company. About ten o'clock I came out of the public-house, to go to my home; I had been drinking with my father, my father and I drank about six or seven pints between us. I was quite sober, as I am now. The prisoner was in the public-house at the same time. I never spoke a word to him. I separated from my father; as soon as I came out of the public-house, I bid him good night, and he bid me good night; I was going home; this public-house, the Red Lion was about a quarter of a mile from my home. The prisoner was outside of the door of the public-house, before I got out, he was quarreling with another man, and in my way home, the prisoner overtook me; he pushed me out of the road with his elbow. I told him to be quiet, I did not want any words with him. Then he got before me, and stabbed me. He said, d - n your eyes, I owe you an old grudge, and I will pay you before I go. I looked up at him, and said will you? He said, d - n my eyes if I do not. I went to put my beer down; he stabbed the knife into me immediately, and when I had set my beer down he stabbed this left side of me. I did not then know that he had a knife in his hand. I can shew the wound now; it went through all my clothes. He said, come on. I said, you have done my business. When he said, come on, he had the knife drawn, stretching his arm out. I begged of him to let me go; I did not think I should live until I went home. I told him he had done my business. He said, if he had got his hedge bill he would cut my head off. Then he went along to his own gate. I followed behind him. My house is further than his. He stopped at his own gate. I said, are you not a pretty fellow; you have been falling out with other people. He said, if he had his hatched out of the house he would strike me dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was intoxicated - A. I am sure he was not. I got home without receiving any further injury from him. The blood flowed very fast from the wound; I found myself very weak. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070069"></xptr>ed by for three weeks. I dropped down as soon as I got in doors. The doctor was sent for. I kept my bed for a fortnight. The surgeon is not here. He said it was within an hairs breadth of my life. The prisoner in the public-house had some words with my father. He accused my mother of taking a bundle of wood; my father took my mother's part.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you strike me as I was eating my bread and cheese going along - A. No, I did not.</p>

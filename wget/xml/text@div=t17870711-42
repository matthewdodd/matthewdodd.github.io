            , Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>I had occasion to put these bank notes in question into a drawer in the back parlour in my house; and in that drawer was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110079"></xptr>a red pocket book; I put the notes into that red pocket book, and there I left them.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of them after you had so placed them? - Not till they were found.</p>
               <p>Had this boy access to that place as well as to the other places? - No, he had not; I do not know of my own knowledge how he came by them, that door was locked, and I always kept the key in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the key at any time? - I missed the key about, as nearly as I can recollect, about a month after I had put the notes into the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find that key again? - Yes, I found it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Does your memory serve you to say, whether you had left the key in the drawer yourself? - It does not.</p>
               <p>What is the number of the notes? - The numbers of the notes were 993 and 1080.</p>
               <p>It would be more satisfactory to the Court and my friends here, if you will say by what particular circumstance it is, that your memory enables you to state the number of the notes? - I took the number of the notes when I put them into the drawer; I have a memorandum, not in my pocket, but I can shew it; I cannot make a mistake with respect to those notes, because, on the first of March, I sold out of the three percent. reduced annuities, a sum which was necessary to settle an account as administrator to my father's affairs; I sold that sum out on the first of March, which was the day I received the notes; I came home, and put them in the pocket book which I before described, that they might be ready at the time I wanted them, for it was not my own money, but was so set apart to settle that account.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Mr. 
               <persName id="t17870711-42-person411">
                  Morris

                  </persName>
             the other prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I knew him, he had lived in my father' service; I know him of course; when I returned to England, which was six months before my father's death, he was in my house, in Harley-street; my father lived with me; the black boy lived there also.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. On the first of March you say you received two bank notes, the numbers of which you recollect now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where might you receive them? - At the bank.</p>
               <p>I take it the clerk gave you the numbers which you made a memorandum of? - No Sir, I employed a broker, and he procured the money, his son brought me these notes.</p>
               <p>I may ask you, whether Morris did not, during the time he lived in your father's service, bear a most irreproachable character? - It is certain, that whilst he did live in my father's service, he bore an irreproachable character, and was confidently employed by my father.</p>
               <p>How long might this be when he left your father's house before this affair happened? - I believe it must be nearly a year; when he left our service he said he was going into Shropshire to his friends; I do not know that he went.</p>
               <p>You have not seen him from the time that he left your father to the time this affair happened? - No, nor did I know where he was, till it was found that he was in Petticoat-lane; I concluded that he was in Shropshire.</p>
               <p>I believe this man has not, by your information, been at your house since? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You missed these notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you miss them? - Not till the 18th of April, that was the day that I was to settle the account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mrs. Sullivan. In consequence of something that had been said by the boy, I believe you went to Morris's house with Mr. Saunders? - In consequence of having missed many other things, I went to the house of Mr. Saunders, where the boy was lodged till he could go to India; the boy gave a direction to Morris's house, I took it down upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110080"></xptr>paper from him, not believing him, either that Morris was in town, or that he was capable of behaving as the boy had said.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing relative to what the boy said concerning the notes that were found in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is the subject of a written examination, and I object to it, there is nothing in the world so clear, that if there is afterwards an information in writing, it does away all that is said before, and you cannot receive any thing the boy said against Morris.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I am asking what the boy said relative to his own offence, with respect to the notes merely, and I never have understood it to be settled, that because an information has been taken subsequent, no notice is to be taken of what the person had said before.</p>
               <p>Court. I think any thing the boy said respecting himself is evidence.</p>
               <p>Now we must first of all examine whether any inducement or threat was made use of by way of encouraging him to make a confession? - None at all by me; I was mentioning what mischiefs he caused at my house; he said, you may yet save other things, and you may yet save the notes.</p>
               <p>Did he say then any thing of his having taken the notes? - More than that he said at the time, Mr. Addington examined him, relative to the thousand pound note, which we had given up; that at that instant he had them in his pocket; he said he had taken these two notes, with the one thousand pound note from the drawer.</p>
               <p>Now be so good to carry your mind to Morris's house? - I said to Mr. Saunders, if you will go with me, I will go to Morris's house, and see, not believing he lived there; we had taken a constable; I took Mr. Saunders by the arm, and went up to the house, and immediately saw Morris's wife, and a litle child; the house is in Petticoat-lane; I instantly said, so William, how long have you lived here? he said here, Madam, I have lived here about three months; I then said, when did you see Sadi? and he said he had seen Sadi a day or two before; and I believe I said what did he leave with you? and his answer was, me! what should he leave with me? and I said, did he leave you no notes to change? he said, no, he left none; I repeated the question, did he leave no notes with you to change? he said no, none; I immediately turned round, and Mr. Saunders said, then constable do your duty, and search the house; upon which his wife came forwards, he was present also; it was all in the space of a minute; his wife stood looking at me while I was speaking, and she said, he did leave two notes, and here, Madam, here they are; and where she took them from I do not know, but she took two notes, and gave them to Mr. Saunders into his hand; I was so much shocked on finding the truth of the case, which I did not expect, and I turned about, and Mr. Saunders and the constable took him into custody, and I know nothing more of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have understood from you, that this boy has been very much protected and favoured in the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There had been an examination of the boy with respect to some other subject before Mr. Addington? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With respect to these notes you have no knowledge of his taking them but from what he told you? - I knew nothing of them till the boy told me; Mr. Sullivan had not acquainted me.</p>
               <p>Did you say to him, the only recompence you can make is to tell where the notes are? - I said to him, do not tell any thing but the truth, because I was suspecting what he said about William was not the truth.</p>
               <p>But before, had you told him it would be better for him to tell where these notes were? - I cannot positively say that I used these words, but I am sure I told him to tell the truth, and only the truth.</p>
               <p>Did you use some persuasive arguments to tell where these notes were? - No, Sir, not these notes.</p>
               <p>But to tell where any thing else was? - I was asking him about some things that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110081"></xptr>had missed, and he told me where he left them.</p>
               <p>So the purpose of your visit to Mr. Saunders was in hopes to get back some things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In so doing, you lamented, and used such arguments that appeared to you prevailing? - The boy was in a miserable situation, lamenting that he was dismissed the family, and at the same time saying, how cruelly some of his accomplices had treated him; I made use of no arguments or promises; I lamented some fine shawls; I said I should not be so much hurt if I recovered these things; upon which the boy said, you may yet recover them, and you may yet recover the notes; I said to him, Sadi, do not tell lies, tell the truth.</p>
               <p>It was natural enough for you in the course of your conversation with the boy, to hint at the mercy he had already received in not being prosecuted for the one thousand pounds? - No, Sir, I did not, I did not know the boy understood that; for a year and a half ago, I think he had as much simplicity as the child he waited on.</p>
               <p>Did he state what he did to you in consequence of a general expectation? - No, Sir, he mentioned the notes quite voluntarily.</p>
               <p>- SAUNDERS sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the East-India-House; I am warehouse-keeper; Mrs. Sullivan came to my house on the 29th of May; these are the notes I received in the house of Morris from Mrs. Morris; I was present the whole time with Mrs. Sullivan, and the circumstances were as she has related them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In this stage of the business, my Lord, I beg leave to be heard as to one of the prisoners, namely,

                  William

            , because I conceive neither in law or in fact, is there any charge against him so as to put him on his defence; I think I address your Lordship with more confidence than I ever rose up to address any Court of Justice whatever, because I am clear, that by the principles of law, this man cannot be convicted; the man stands charged on two counts in this indictment, one for receiving two bank notes, knowing them to be stolen; the other for receiving, harbouring, and entertaining the thief.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the second count I think you may save yourself the trouble; I do not think there is any evidence on that count.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110082"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Then it becomes my duty to state the law as to the first count, and as your Lordship knows a bank note was not the subject of a felony at common law, so I take it to have been clearly laid down, and every doubt on the occasion solved by that act of parliament, which made it a felony to steal bank notes; indeed, so the act expresses at common law; it was a promissory note, and not the subject of an indictment; it is not laid to be goods or chattels, and I take it they are the only things that can possibly arise in law; the indictment states it to the property, not the goods or chattels of Mr. Sullivan; and the indictment charges him with receiving the chattels of Mr. Sullivan; but that bank note is not so laid in the charge against the original offender; but suppose it to be perfectly correct, it is laid down by all writers of the criminal law, that if a statute make an offence felony that shall be capable of an accessary before, and capable of an accessary after; but what is that accessary before and after? Certainly the accessary known to the common law, and no other accessary. No man is guilty at common law of receiving goods knowing them to be stolen; that is by express statute; this statute does not go the length of making it a felony for any person to receive a bank note, knowing it to be stolen; it only makes it felony to steal a bank note. There are decisions to this point, one in 1777, a prisoner was tried here for receiving a bank note; Mr. Justice Willes, who certainly was as high and as respectable an authority as ever sat here, as to his knowledge of the crown, ruled expressly in words, that a Jury could not convict a man of receiving a bank note; there is a note of that case now in print; but upon the reason of the thing it certainly is so; therefore I humbly hope you Lordship will direct the man to be acquitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Certainly the objection Mr Knowlys has stated to the form of indictment, appears to me an unanswerable one; he must be convicted of receiving the same thing, the thief has been convicted of stealing: Now, supposing the Jury to have come to a decision that Sadi is guilty; and we were to enquire whether Morris is guilty as a receiver, they would have found Sadi guilty of stealing bank notes as property, not as goods and chattels. Now here the person that has drawn this indictment, having coupled together two indictments, has not made the second pursue the first; for in the second count he says, he received the said bank notes, the property and chattels of Mr. Sullivan. He should in his first count have said, he stole the bank note, the property, goods and chattels of Mr. Sullivan; instead of which, in the first count, he has charged Sadi with stealing these bank notes as the property of Mr. Sullivan, and in the second count he says, property and chattels. Now supposing Sadi was already convicted, and this was an indictment against the receiver, grounded upon that conviction; Sadi not having being convicted of receivings goods and chattels, which is all in the indictment against the receiver; it is impossible the receiver could have been convicted. Mr. Knowlys has not troubled the Court with that which makes it perfectly clear, for is there any evidence on earth to go to a Jury, that Morris has received these goods, only that when the constable was going to search the house, the wife comes forward, the husband never produced them: But the other objection is unanswerable, for we all know there has been a variety of consultations on the part of the Post-office, where people have been intended to be indicted as receivers of bank notes which they could not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I only mean to read that case,</p>
               <p>"Memorandum, at the Old Bailey,</p>
               <p>"in 1779, a woman was indicted for stealing</p>
               <p>"a pocket book, containing seven</p>
               <p>"guineas, and a bank note for ten</p>
               <p>"pounds; and a man with whom she cohabited,</p>
               <p>"was indicted for receiving the</p>
               <p>"said goods, chattels, and monies, knowing</p>
               <p>"them to be stolen: upon evidence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110083"></xptr>" there was proof of the note, and part of</p>
               <p>"the money being received by the man,</p>
               <p>"but the pocket-book was not traced to</p>
               <p>"his possession; Mr. Justice Willes told the</p>
               <p>"Jury that the statute particularly confined</p>
               <p>"the subject to goods, without taking</p>
               <p>"any notice of money or notes; that</p>
               <p>"money could not mean goods and chattels,</p>
               <p>"for that cash was not a trading commodity,</p>
               <p>"and that by act of parliament,</p>
               <p>"the stealing of notes was made a felony,</p>
               <p>"but that there was no act of parliament</p>
               <p>"making the receiver a particeps</p>
               <p>"criminis."</p>
               <p>Court. How is it laid in the second charge? - It is there called the property and chattels of Mr. Sullivan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, in answer to my learned friends, I observe, that true it is at common law, upon a bank note a felony could not be committed; but the statute of 
               <persName id="t17870711-42-person418">
                  Geo.

                  </persName>
             the II. ch. 25, states, that it shall be constituted and deemed a felony of the same nature to steal a bank note, and in the same degree, and with or without the benefit of clergy, as if the offender had stolen any other goods; therefore the act considers it in this light, as goods and chattels; and the gentlemen cannot contend but what a bank note is now become the goods, chattels, and property of the person that possesses it: then with respect to the act of parliament in relation to receivers, it states in this manner; the 5th of Ann relating to receivers of stolen goods,</p>
               <p>"if</p>
               <p>"any person or persons shall receive or</p>
               <p>"buy any stolen goods or chattels that shall</p>
               <p>"be feloniously taken or stole," therefore the statute of Queen Ann which inflicts the punishment, describes the person who receives the goods and chattels, and that coupled with the 2d. of 
               <persName id="t17870711-42-person419">

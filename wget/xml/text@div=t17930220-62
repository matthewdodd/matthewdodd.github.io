               <p>I live in the Temple; this happened on Tuesday the 5th of February, at half after seven in the evening, I was coming out of the Little Theatre, in the <placeName id="t17930220-62-crimeloc352">Haymarket</placeName>

               <p>Q. In the way you describe the blow given you, it could not be an accident? - It was this man ran at me, and done with a kind of stoop; I saw the man; I am sure of the person, as to that; but I have some reason to believe that prisoner was not the person that took the watch, because it went the other side, if he had taken it he must have taken it with the left hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether I was the person that shoved up against him.</p>
               <p>Court. He has sworn positively, he has no doubt it was you.</p>

               <p>Please your Worship, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the fifth of February, this present month, I was coming up Cockspur-street, and coming along by the side of the play house, passing by the play house, just as it was breaking up, we came to this place, where we see Mr. Woodriff. I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright, coming up to him, he said, he had been robbed of his watch, by three, or four, or five people, he said, he had taken one, but he was rescued from him, as he was taking him from the place, where he took him to search him, by rubbing of his arm against some rails; as we found that, we said to him immediately, if you will please to cross over the way, we will try and pursue him we crossed over the way, and at the corner of Norris-street, we met some servants, that had headed him, and turned him, and stopped him; Mr. Woodriff says immediately, that is the man that was with me, but I don't believe he was the man that picked my pocket, but he was with them; we searched him, but there was nothing found on him.</p>

               <p>I came up with Mr. Chapman and Mr. Woodriff, and the prisoner was surrounded by several servants there, I don't know that they had hold of him, but they surrounded him, and Mr. Woodriff said immediately, that is the man, take him into charge; Mr. Woodriff desired we should take him to the watch-house, and he would appear the next morning against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was going down the Haymarket, there was a mob of people coming out of the play house, I was shoved underneath the coach to let the people go by, and they shoved me against that gentleman, but with no intent to take any thing from him. I know nothing at all about it. I have no witnesses.</p>

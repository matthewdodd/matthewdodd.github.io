                  </hi>. I am the wife of Christopher Shepherd, a private soldier in the 1st Regiment of Guards. The prisoner lodged in the same house as I did in Belton-street for five or six months, or, perhaps, more—I had had a quarrel with her last Saturday—in consequence of that I went to Bow-street—she issued a warrant against me, and I went there on Tues<lb></lb>day, and was discharged—she threatened me very much with what she would do to me when we got home—she said she would be the death of me, and threatened my life repeatedly—I went home, went up stairs, pulled off my cloak, and was coming down stairs—I had a glass bottle in my hand—she was standing on the first-floor landing-place, coming upstairs—she had got her bonnet and cloak off, and was swearing she would murder me, and be the death of me—she did not say any thing more to me, but knocked me down, and when I fell down she took the bottle from me—I was trying to pass her—she took the bottle out of my hand, and hit me with it across the head, on my forehead, above my eye, where I have the plaster—it cut my forehead—(I went to Charing-cross Hospital)—the blood came—the bottle was broken with her hitting me—she held it by the neck—after that she hit my right fourth finger with her teeth—the blow stunned me, so that I cannot tell whether she threw the bottle down—she bit my finger almost through to the bone—she kicked me with her feet, and bit me with her teeth—I found her doing so when I came to myself—she beat me about my head, and kicked me about my body—I called out as well as I was able, and went down stairs to the shop—I never had any quarrel with her till Satur<lb></lb>day—I never spoke to her when I came down with the bottle in my hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Tuesday afternoon I was in Seven Dials, and was called to No. 33, Belton-street, about half-past three o'clock—I met the prosecutrix at the door, and found her bleeding very profusely from the head and face—one of her fingers was bleeding—I went after the prisoner—she was in the front attic—the door was closed and locked—I asked her to open the door—she refused to do so—the pro<lb></lb>secutrix went to Bow-street, and shortly after, Shackell, the Bow-street officer, came back and took her into custody—during the time he was gone to the office, I picked up the remnants of a bottle on the first floor landing, which I produce—it is a small half-pint bottle, broken into a great number of pieces—the blow must have been given with great vio<lb></lb>lence—the prosecutrix's face was completely covered with blood, so that I could not distinguish where the wound was—I believe she went to the surgeon—I saw the wound after it was dressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. When I fetched the warrant for her she treated me very ill—I never lifted my hand or my finger at her—she told the Magis<lb></lb>trate I called her a w—, but I did not—I cannot say any thing else—I ever struck her before, and never had such a thought in my head—about four months ago she called three of them together, and they told my master different stories, which are untrue, about me, and they set this woman on call me every thing that was bad, and to beat me—they never did beat me but threatened me on Sunday, three or four months ago, How they would serve me—it always caused me and my master to live unhappy through them.</p>

On the 13th of February, about a quarter to eleven o'clock in the morning, I put this silver tea-pot into the pantry - our area gate is kept open - in about a quarter of an hour I caught the prisoner in the pantry, and asked him what business he had there; he said he came to sell oranges; he had some in a basket; I told him that was not the place to sell them - he said if I disputed his word he would go to my fellow servants for they knew him; they denied all knowledge of him; I said he had better go back, but on looking into the cupboard I missed the teapot. I went after him as he was going out of the area, with the door in his hand, brought him back, and found the teapot in his basket, under the oranges - it is worth 5l. and has master's initials on it - he was given in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

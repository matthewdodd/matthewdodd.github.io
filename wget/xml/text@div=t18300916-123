            . I paid the prisoner 7s. 6d. on the 18th of June, and 7s. 6d. on the 8th of July - here are his receipts.</p>
               <p>MR. ERRATT. He gave me no account of these sums - they ought to have been paid on then respective days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these two distinct receipts on two distinct days? A. Yes, decidedly; neither of them are on the 9th of July: he has a great many accounts to keep; on the 7th of July he states in the books that he received 5l. 5s. from different customers - there was no money owing to him for empty casks, for about this time last year the money for empty casks was taken from him - it was a perquisite, but it was taken off by order of the proprietor; Mr. Braithwait appeared before the Magistrate, and said he expected the prisoner was receiving money for empty casks; he said he believed he had been paid, and he found he had not: I cannot say whether he said it was due to him or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any thing said about it? A. Yes - he said he expected he had received the money for the casks, but I said he had not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then, in point of fact, was it not due to him? A. That I leave to my Lord; I do not know whether any charge was made against him of this kind before - he has received money, and has apologized; I believe it has happened that he has received money in one name, and it has been booked in another name; I do not think that has happened now, when my witnesses have the receipts - I do not know that he ever paid me money in the street - he has occasionally in the yard.</p>

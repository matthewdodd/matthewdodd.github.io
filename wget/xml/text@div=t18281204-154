            . I am an officer. On the 24th of November, I saw the prisoner offering some springs and an axletree for sale, at a shop opposite my door, in Cow-cross - they were brought in a cart, by the prisoner and another person; the axletree was partly concealed, so that a person might have supposed it was a pole - they took them out, and put them into the cart again; I went up to the prisoner, and said I thought it was not all right - he said it was his own property, and he would sell them to me, if I would buy them - that he had taken them from his own cart the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What do you mean by being concealed? A.Part of it was in a bag - it was in Cow-cross-street, a public street; the prisoner's sister's name (

I had a cart there, which I saw safe on the Thursday before I missed the springs and the axletree - that, I believe, was on the 20th of November; I left my cart all correct, in a field belonging to 'Squire Barry - it was not under a shed; the prisoner told me, several months before that, if he wanted a pair of springs and an axletree he should know where to go; I said, "If you rob me, you will rob a church" - these springs and axletree are mine, and belonged to my cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you know them by? A. They are two odd springs, and here is some of the grass upon them, worn as it came from the field - it is almost growing upon them now, upon my honour; Hadley is just beyond Barnet.</p>

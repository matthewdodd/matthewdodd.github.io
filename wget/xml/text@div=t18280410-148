               <p>The prisoner Power, in his defence, handed in the following extract from the Morning Advertiser, of the 24th of March, 1828."Bow-street - A young man, who said that he had suffered the sentence of the law, for picking a gentleman's pocket in Leicester-square, applied to know how he was to act under the following circumstances: on obtaining his liberty, he determined to amend his life, and retrieve the character he had lost; in pursuance of this design, he had procured an employment, in which he was doing prosperously, until some evil-disposed person disclosed to his master and fellow-workmen, the history of his life. The latter, as might be expected, refused to remain in the shop with a convicted thief; and the former having his own fears, pleaded that as an excuse for discharging him. He was then, he said, again thrown on the town, and unless he could procure some means of getting bread honestly, a return to his former evil courses, must be the inevitable consequence; and a consequence, it was his anxious desire to avoid. - JONES (the gaoler) Were you not brought here by Boston? APPLICANT. Yes; I was. JONES. I see how it is your Worship; this Boston is an amateur constable, who, with a fellow named Roberts, goes about assuming the character of officers; when he takes young men up, who, afterwards reforming, get employment; he goes to their masters, and tells what they have been.

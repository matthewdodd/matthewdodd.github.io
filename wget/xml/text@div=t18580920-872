In consequence of having received this letter and the bill of lading, I instructed my bankers at Newcastle to honour the prisoner's drafts, through their London agents, the Union Bank; I subsequently received from my bankers a duplicate bill of lading—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the endorsement at the back is the prisoner's—this letter, dated the 26th June, addressed to the Union Bank, is, to the best of my belief, in the prisoner's writing—there is a translation at the foot—I have compared it with the original, and find it is quite correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THIEDERMAN</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). To the best of nay belief these first six bills of exchange are in the prisoner's writing—they are accepted by the Union Bank of London on my account. On hearing that the prisoner was in custody, I went and saw him, he came out of the cell and was deeply moved; he sat down and covered his face with his hands—he at first did not recognize me; I told him who I was, I then asked him how at his time of life he could commit such acts, and make his family and friends unhappy by it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1850, he was a merchant in an extensive and highly respectable way of business, to the best of my knowledge, at Wolgast—he told me, in the course of the conversation, that he had intended to ship the wheat to me—he said, if I had waited I should have had my wheat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you have frequently signed bills of lading before the goods have been on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That question does not belong to this court—I did it once for part of a cargo—I have never done it more than once; that was in the spring—I do not know whether the cargo had been bought when I signed that bill of lading—that cargo was eventually shipped and properly delivered—I cannot tell how long before the cargo was received I had signed the bills of lading, about 8 days or so; it may have been before the cargo was bought, I do not know whether it was bought or not—it was in the latter part of June that the communication was made to me by the prisoner with regard to waiting at Wolgast for cargo—that was a cargo to Belgium; he did not say what part of Belgium—he only had hopes to send me a cargo for Belgium—he asked me that on two or three occasions—he mentioned Belgium on each of these occasions.</p>

I happened to be at the St. Katharine Docks, on 18th July, when the prisoner was taken into custody by Jarvis, and Jarvis, not understanding German, asked me to communicate with the prisoner—I asked him his name; he said his name was Newman—I said the officer said he was the man he wanted according to the telegraph, and he was taken for two bills of lading—he said, "I am not the man;" he afterwards said, "I hope you won't hurt me, I have got a wife and children"—he said he had got no money about him, he had paid his debts with it.</p>

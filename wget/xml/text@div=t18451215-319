I live servant with Mr. Andrew Larkin, who keeps tea and dining rooms at Greenwich—the prisoner was in his service—on the 13th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I sent him out with a sove<lb></lb>reign to get change—the sovereign belonged to a lady who had dined there, but Mr. Larkin gave her one back again, because the prisoner had not returned—he never canoe back—he was apprehended last week—he had lived with my master three weeks—I am not aware that he had any character with him—he took him out of the Union.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Harris, a labourer, of 6, Osborn-place, Goswell-road—about half-past twelve on Sunday morning 8th April I was going down Arthur-street, St. Luke's, with my husband, I dropped a penny and went to pick it up—I had my purse in my hand with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two duplicates in it, as I stooped the prisoner Kenny shoved up against me—I asked her who she was shoving against—she said, "You "and made use of bad language, struck me in the face and knocked me down, she then seized my purse from my left hand—I tried to hold her and she bit my hand, Shea then told her to go—I saw him strike my husband in the mouth and saw him lying on the pavement insensible—the man said to the woman, "Take your <hi rend="italic">hook, Nell</hi>"—I did not get the puree again, I found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one duplicate on the pavement close by, the prisoners both got away—Shea struck me several times in the breast and side, Kenny got away before him—he called me very bad names—I lost a sovereign, there was</p>

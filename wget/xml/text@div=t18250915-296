The prisoner used sometimes to come to my house, as an assistant to my servants. On the morning of Saturday, the 23d of July, I got up about six o'clock, for the purpose of watching what was done; I did not know whether the prisoner was in my house that morning - my family were out of town; I stopped on the landing-place, and saw the prisoner come out of the parlour, through the counting-house, with some mats in her hand, which she put down, and took some parcels off the cask of cantharides, which I had placed on it, and among the rest, a 14 lb. paper parcel - she then went back into the parlour, and came out again, with a bag, which she filled with Cantharides; she took it into the counting-house, and placed it under my desk; I went up to my son, and told him to get up, and go and tell Jackson, the officer, to watch the house, lest she should leave it. I then went into the shop and staid there till eight o'clock, and then left my son there while I went up to dress.</p>

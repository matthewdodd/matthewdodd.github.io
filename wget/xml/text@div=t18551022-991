                  </hi>. I am a linen draper, of Bennet-street, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christ Church. On the morning of 29th Sept, at a few minutes after 3 o'clock, I was awoke by a loud crash—I got out of bed and went to my second floor window, which commanded a view of the rear of my premises—I called out, "Who is there!"and immediately heard a scuffling, and a noise of footsteps of more persons than one, in the base<lb></lb>ment of my house—I called out, "Dent, bring me my pistols!"—I pro<lb></lb>ceeded a few steps down, but as I had nothing on, went back again, and sprang a rattle—I heard a voice say, "What is the matter? I am here"—I called out, "Thieves! robbers! No. 4, Bennet-street!"—my servant called out, "Sir, they are escaping over the wall"—I went and saw the prisoner Jones—I returned to my bedroom and commenced dressing myself, finding there was assistance at hand—I sprang my rattle again, dressed myself, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the last witness. I recollect the morning of 29th Sept.—I was roused by my master, a few minutes past 3 o'clock—I heard him go down stairs, and heard him say, "Dent, below!" and some other words—I threw the window up on the second floor, and saw the two prisoners getting over the wall—I am sure of both of them—the moon was shining quite bright—they were getting over the wall into Ben-net's-place—they stood on some place, where they had to give a jump to get on the wall; and within three minutes the officer brought the same two men back into the house—I am quite sure—when I went to bed at night the house was done up safe, about 11 o'clock, or a little after—I was the last person up—after seeing the two men I went down; I saw the front kitchen door, which I am sure had been shut and locked and bolted, was wide open, and the back kitchen door was taken down entirely off its hinges, and was leaning on a washing stool—the front kitchen door was not damaged at all—there were two bolts on that door, which were bolted the night before, and in the morning they were unbolted, but not broken—the iron gate had been shut up when I went to bed—in the morning it was open, the chain was cut, and the lock parted in two—the persons had got in by getting over the wall, and burst through the iron gate, and entered through the back kitchen window—that window was wide open in the morning, and the bar and bolt were forced off—it looked into the back yard.</p>

               <p>MARY HIBBERT. I keep the Windmill public-house at Hadley, in the parish of Enfield. The prisoner came to my house on the 29th of May, a little after nine o'clock, and asked if he could have a bed; I said he might - he had a pint of beer, and some bread and cheese; he delivered me a bundle to take care of - I put it into the bar, and in about half an hour the patrol and Beach came to inquire after him; I delivered them the bundle, which had not been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL COLLARD. I am patrol of Finchley. I went with the prosecutor to Hibbert's house - she delivered me the bundle; I have had the articles ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wished him to behave to me like a gentleman; he came and asked me to sleep with him - he did not behave well to me; I got intoxicated on Saturday, and did not know what I was doing - I happened to tie some of his things up in the bundle with my own.</p>
               <p>MRS. HIBBERT. I cannot say whether he was sober or not - he was quite a stranger.</p>

On 15th Sept. the prisoner brought this order—it was handed to me by Mr. Adams—I asked him if he brought that order from Boyd and Co.—he said he did—I said, "Well, then, wait a few minutes and you shall have the goods"—he remained there ten or fifteen minutes—I delivered the order to Mr. Risden; he packed up the goods, and I saw them delivered to the prisoner—it was a piece, and worth 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner gave his name as Jones—he left with the goods—I saw the prisoner again on 15th March—I am positive he is the man.</p>

I was on the premises when the order was presented—I am quite posi<lb></lb>tive the prisoner is the person that brought it—in consequence of directions from Mr. Way I packed up twenty-nine yards of black patent beaver—I asked the prisoner his name—he said, "Jones."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen him previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I saw him next on Saturday, 16th March—Mr. Way was with me—seven or eight prisoners were arranged for the purpose of ascertaining if I knew the man, and I picked out the prisoner—Mr. Way was not then with me, he was in the adjoining room—the prisoner is rather tall, but it is his countenance I allude to particularly—I did not take particular notice of his height—many persons come to our place on the same errand as the prisoner—we do a large business.</p>

I know the pri<lb></lb>soner—I never knew him by the name of Jones—in Sept. last he was out of employ—some time before this cloth was obtained, he asked me to get him one of our bill-heads to settle a bet—I got him one, and either gave it to him or left it at his house for him—I knew where he lived, at 8, Shaftesbury-place—I had been in the habit of going to his house previous to that, and since then I have called there occasionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you the custody of the bill-heads? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I picked it up among the waste-paper in the packing-room, a very short time before I gave it to the prisoner; about a day I should guess—that was the only bill-head I ever gave away—after I heard about the cloth I went to the prisoner and remonstrated with him upon it, and he assured me that he had not made use of it.</p>

            ; when I came home with him, I went into the parlour even with the kitchen; Mr. Abrahams said, this woman has opened the door of the liquor closet, she smells so strong of liquor; we could not find her; I opened her box, and found two books, one a prayer-book, belonging to a former servant, the other a tutor to my daughter, when she was a child; the other things were found between the sacking and the bed; this sheet I had missed ever since Good-Friday; it was whole when I missed it, it is now cut to pieces; I was really suspicious that she had taken a bottle of liquor, and concealed it in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had but five pounds ten shillings a year, and I had received but one shilling and sixpence, and therefore I could not have much to spend in liquor.</p>

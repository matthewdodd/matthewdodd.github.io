            , stands indicted upon the same Act of Parliament, of the 19th year of his present Majesty, as the Prisoners who were tried last , therefore I will not trouble you with any thing more about the law, but proceed to the very fact. The Prisoner was concerned in the running and landing of tea, to the amount of three tun weight, and thirty half anchors of brandy; if we prove this, it will be a very clear case that the Prisoner comes under this Act of Parliament.</p>

             called.</p>

               <p>Barrett. I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us when and where you saw him.</p>
               <p>Barrett . I saw him on the 11th of February, 1746, at a place called Folkstone-Warren , about half a mile from Folkstone , with about fifty people, armed with fire arms, and about eighty horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Folkstone-Warren lie upon the sea-coast?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he and these people doing?</p>
               <p>Barrett. They were landing of goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods?</p>
               <p>Barrett. There were three ton weight of tea landed, and about thirty half anchors of wine and brandy; there were three bags of tea on each horse, and about a quarter of a hundred in each bag, and about three hours afterwards I saw him with fifteen or sixteen people, and he was driving some horses .</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Six.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses loaden?</p>
               <p>Barrett . Yes, they were loaden with tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him at other times?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes, I saw him on the first of November, and the third of November; when he was armed I did not see him with goods.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. What time did you see him at Folkstone ?</p>
               <p>Barrett. About seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that is the man?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these bags, do you know what was in them?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I did not see what was in them?</p>
               <p>Q. What are you ?</p>
               <p>Barrett. I am a blacksmith at Folkstone .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to have no gratuity for this?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember the time?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Because I made a memorandum in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write and read?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not an allowance of ten shillings a week for coming here?</p>
               <p>Barrett. What signifies that.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you not ten shillings a week?</p>
               <p>Barrett. How should I live else?</p>
               <p>King's Coun. Have you that ten shillings a week to swear falsely?</p>
               <p>Barrett. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you had any money offered you?</p>
               <p>Barrett. Yes, I have had forty guineas offered me by Kemp's friends not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>Kemp. I never was in Folkstone-Warren in my life, and I am as innocent of the affair as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had any witnesses * you might have got them.</p>
               <p> * He was to have been tried last Sessions, and then he made an affidavit, that he had two material witnesses who could not be there then, and that he could not with safety proceed upon his trial without them; upon which account his trial was put off.</p>
               <p>Pris. I have been shut up, and could not have any opportunity of making my defence. I never saw the witness,

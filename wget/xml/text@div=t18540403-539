                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at No. 35, Webber-street. In the afternoon of 3rd April I got into a Bayswater omnibus near the Mansion-house—I had a little boy with me—there were three persons in the omnibus; the prisoners are two of them—I was not sitting beside either of them at first; but a few minutes afterwards my little boy got up outside the omnibus; I then moved my seat, and sat between the prisoners—I had a purse in my pocket on the right side, the side on which the female prisoner was sitting—it contained three sovereigns, a half sovereign, and some silver—presently the female prisoner asked me if it was a Paddington omnibus—I said, "No, it is a Bayswater"—I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—she immediately got up, and attempted to pass me rudely; but I put my hand before her, and said, "Stop a minute; I have lost my purse, and I must find it"—on that, the male prisoner turned about on the seat, as if he was about getting up, and then said, "Here, is this it?"—his hand was on it—it was my purse—I took it, and told the conductor to drive on, as I was satisfied, but the omnibus was stopped, and the prisoners were taken by a policeman—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Scotland. I was in London on 3rd April, and got into a Bayswater omnibus, near the Mansion-house, with my father and mother, and two sisters—I saw Mrs. Mullins sitting in the omnibus between the two prisoners when I got in—I think there were other persons in the omnibus—after I had sat down, Siddell said, "Is this a Paddington bus?"—Mrs. Mullins said, "No, a Bayswater"—Siddell said, "Oh! I have got into a wrong <hi rend="italic">bus"</hi>—on that I told my father to touch the conductor, to let her out—Mrs. Mullins put out her hand, and said, "Stop a minute, I have lost my purse"—on that Siddell seemed very much agitated, and wanted to go out; she leaned backwards, placed her hand behind her, and passed the purse to Pearce—I immediately called out, "The male prisoner is an accomplice, the purse is passed!"—Pearce heard that, and looked at me—the omnibus was stopped, and a policeman came—I saw the purse in the female prisoner's hand, and saw her put it into the male prisoner's hand, and she said, "Say, you have dropped your purse; say you are my friend."</p>

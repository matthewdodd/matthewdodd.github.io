The prisoner was more than fourteen years in my employment; he left early in March 1820, to go into business on his own account; he took a shop in Bethnal-green Road. I gave him credit to the amount of 400 l. or 500 l. On the 3d of June last, I received information, and on the 4th I went to his shop in Bethnal-green Road; before I entered, I saw some lawns in the window, which I knew to be mine. I then went in with Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hines; the prisoner was out, he was sent for, and came in a few minutes. I told him I wished to see the lawns which were in his window; he brought part of them; I told him they were my property, and had never been sold to him, and I had reason to believe there was a considerable quantity more goods, and I insisted on seeing them; I said he knew what belonged to me, and I expected him to produce them; this passed in a little back room adjoining the shop. I went into the shop myself, looked about, and desired him to take down some Irish linens, muslins, and a paper containing India muslins, and some shawls; these were taken down, and I claimed them from private marks by which I knew them; I said he must have taken them while he was in my employ, and I had never sold them; there was a considerable quantity of them placed together; he made no answer how he got them; he was so confused, that I thought he was incapable. All the articles stated in the indictment were found there on that day, except the diaper, but that is not a tenth part of what was found; I am positive I never sold them to him; I have since asked him how he came possessed of them, he made no answer. I have never held out any hopes or promises to him; the goods I claimed were put up in a wrapper, and afterwards, by his written permission, removed to my house; the value in the indictment is something below their real value. I told him my debt was twice the amount of any person's, and therefore I insisted on having a warrant of attorney for 300 l., as he owed me 400 l.; I said I should then stand equal with the rest of the creditors. I got the warrant on the 5th, and took out the execution next day. I then informed the creditors, and gave up my warrant to distribute the effects equally - I only took it out to secure the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you not obtained from him since, an assignment of all his book debts and property of every description, to the amount of nearly 1500 l. - A. It is under 1000 l.; the assignment was for the benefit of all his creditors - I never promised to take no steps against him, if he made this assignment. I did not promise not to put the warrant of attorney in force for six months. I had him apprehended about a month after the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not proceed instantly against him - A. It was partly my own convenience, and a wish to obtain the goods. We had a consultation whether we should take him this Session or the next; he was taken the night before last. I have had intercourse with him, from time to time; he has applied to me about it - I said I had nothing to say to him at present. No promise of any kind was held out to him - I did not object to an attorney attending on his behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do none of the goods you sell go out with your mark - A. Certainly.</p>

The goods were exposed.</p>

            . (In continuation.) When the first parcel was found, he was asked to produce his invoices; he brought invoices, and they contained none of these goods; the prisoner called a few days after at my house, and requested me to wait on Mr. Mitchell, to intercede for his forgiveness, and not to prosecute him; I told him I could not think of that, but I did at last, and afterwards saw him, and told him the prosecutor would make no promises. He asked my advice - I advised him to give up all the goods which he had fraudulently obtained, as without that he could not expect clemency; he said, he did not know what he should do; he should be ruined, and what would become of his wife and family; this conversation was about a week after the 4th of June; he called on me repeatedly about my interceding with Mr. Mitchell.</p>

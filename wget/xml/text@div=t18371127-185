Brothers; and when he came on monday morning, the 13th, I desired him to come again in the afternoon, which he did, and said he had come for the plate again—I told him it was finished—he was disappointed, but I told him he must come the next—he did so—I told him the plate was still unfinished, the workman had not completed it, and I could not give it to him—he was still disap<lb></lb>pointed—I prevailed on him to come on the Wednesday—that was the 15th—became that day, and I told him it was not finished—he then became very angry; 1 told him I had some difficulty about delivering the plate up, I did not quite like the appearance of the thing—I told him to write in French what he had to say, and he wrote it on this paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it, which, being translated, was</hi>—" Give me the plate and the note, and on Monday I will bring you the address of Mr. Walker")—I said I could-not give up the plate without a satisfactory address; and afterwards he wrote, "Give me the note only," and signed his name to it—I still put him off till next day, the 16th, and on his coming then, an officer was there, and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, and am one of the firm of Perkins and Co., of Fleet-street. On the 24th of October the prisoner came to my house—a gentleman named White, in my service, who speaks French very well, acted as interpreter between me and the prisoner in every thing that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Bacon's employ—I understand the French language perfectly well. I faithfully interpreted to Mr. Bacon the conversation between myself and the prisoner on his coming to the house on the 24th of October—he had called the previous evening, and presented a twenty-dollar note, of the Louisiana Bank, wishing it to be copied per<lb></lb>fectly, and wished to know the price of copying it, and the time it would take—we told him Mr. Bacon was not in the house, but would be on the following day, and it was agreed he should come and see him—he came the following day, and Mr. Bacon was then at home—Mr. Bacon asked him what right he had to have the note copied—I put the question to him—Mr. Bacon said, "Have you any house in London that you can refer us to, in order that we may know you are authorised to have this imitated? "—he said he had no house; that he was a merchant, who had a quantity of coffee, and other colonial produce; and in the course of his travels he was to have this copied, being himself a Director of the Bank; that he had nothing hut a <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> order of the Committee of Directors—Mr. Bacon then stated to him, that as he had no house in London to which he could refer us, his errand was very questionable; though he himself might be an honourable man, which he did not doubt, he was going just the way any forger would to have a thing executed—on the previous evening he had said that these</p>

               <p>notes had been made at New York, but in consequence of a quarrel which had occurred with the Bank they had withdrawn the notes from that house, and wished to have them executed somewhere else—I specified that the work was a very peculiar kind, which was seldom done any where but at our house and in America. and that it would take considerable time—he wished to know the expense, and said he had applied to a house, which our house was somewhat connected with, in America—he said he had come from France, and if he could not dispose of his produce advantageously here he should go to Rotterdam, where he could dispose of it—we said he must have some house to do business with—he said that he could not tell us hat house he was going to do business with—he had not yet decided what house to do business with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Look at this note—you know, of course, the work of your own house—do you think any house in London besides yours could do such a note as that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as ray judgment goes, I think it—I cannot say Mr. Ashby could not do it—it is more in our line, I should guess—we have a peculiar mode of engine work which distin<lb></lb>guishes our work from others—we generally work on steel—we should have done a small number of these on copper, but a large number on steel the machine would be the same whether on steel or copper—there is a: ret in our mode of working to a certain extent—it is a patent invention we know of no other house in London capable of doing it.</p>

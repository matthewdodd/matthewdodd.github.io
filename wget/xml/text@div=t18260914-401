My mother asked me to give the prisoner a few night's lodging - I had four sovereigns in a purse, locked up in a drawer, in my front parlour; they were safe about nine o'clock in the morning of the 31st of July, and I missed them about ten o'clock on the morning of the 1st of August; I had not been out, but I had gone into the yard on the 31st of July, and left the prisoner in the room; a key was in another drawer, which would open the one the money was in; he knew the money was there, because he saw me take some out; I was not out more than two or three minutes, and when I came back he bade me good bye twice, and went away - he was taken on the 3d of August.</p>

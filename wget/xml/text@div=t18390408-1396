                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Moses Jacobs, a glass-merchant, in Berwick-street, Oxford-street. The prisoner was occasionally employed as a labourer—my master rents some premises in Rupert-street, where the horse and cart are usually put up—on the 16th of March, the prisoner was employed to move the cart and some harness from one stable to another, in Rupert-street, Haymarket—I saw a gig saddle and other things safe in the stable, between six and seven o'clock, when I went to do up my horse—I went there again the next morning, and they were gone—on the 22nd I came through Smithfield, and saw a lad with my master's saddle for sale—I knew it, and gave the lad into custody—this is the saddle—I never authorised any body to take it.</p>

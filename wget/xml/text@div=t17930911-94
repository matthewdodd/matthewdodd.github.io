               <p>I am a customhouse officer attending at the East India warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you on the 6th of August? - One of my partners, Tarratt, was with me; the prisoner at the bar was there, he is a <rs id="t17930911-94-deflabel523" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. What was his employment that day? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that day; and tell us what you observed? - I examined all the men that came out of the warehouse, and I searched him, and I found something bulky with my hand passing, and I gave it a pinch with my hand, and I found it was tea, and I called to Tarratt, my partner, to come down to the counting house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know what warehouse this man was employed in, the bohea warehouse or congou warehouse? - I don't know there is any such distinction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search this man when he went in? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. He may carry in as much tea as he pleased, but they must not carry any out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any tea was lost that day? - I cannot say that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110160"></xptr>Q. What did you find on him? - I found a bulk between his legs; we said you have got something between your legs that does not belong to you; on this he took out this bag of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked into that bag? - I have; it is congou tea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know in point of fact whether there is a distinct warehouse for the congou? - No, congou, bohea and greens, are all in the same warehouse together in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that tea was lost out of the chests? - It is impossible where there are so many thousand chests open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I shall give the matter just simply as it occurred, and begin with my coming to the warehouse. On the 6th of August I met with a man whom I knew perfectly well, whose name is Underwood; he entreated me much to go with him to drink some brandy and water; I told him I should be too late for the warehouse; he said he had known the time that I would not mind losing a day to go with him; I told him I was now married, and had left off all that sort of fun; you married? says he; yes, I am, says I; then says he, I will give you a portion of tea; he pulled out a bag, and it burst; I said I had got a bag which I usually put my breakfast in, and I put it into this bag, and went into the warehouse. I am in a very disagreeable circumstance; I have been swindled by two attornies out of six guineas, who ought to have subpoened my witnesses, but they have not; but I have those here who will give me a character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information which I received from the prosecutor's son, on the 5th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock, I went to the hay-stack, and saw two cuttings, and on each cutting was some hay cut and not taken away—I then went to the cart which was loaded, examined it, and saw there was a place left to put some loose hay. I went in doors, made eighteen tickets, and put twelve in the hay-stack where it was cut, and six in the cart. About three o'clock, I called on the prisoner—I saw him about four—after that I went to the back of the premises, and saw him go round to the stack two or three times—I then went and called my brother constable, while doing so, the pri<lb></lb>soner came on with the cart—we followed him as far as Shepherd's Bush, and there took him into custody—I took him back to Ealing, searched the cart, and found this 20 lbs. weight of hay, in which my brother constable found two of the tickets which I had put in the stack—I told the prisoner it was the hay I had marked in the stack—he said it was the usual quan<lb></lb>tity he generally had—he afterwards said he knew he had done wrong, but he must suffer for it the same as a good many more had done.</p>

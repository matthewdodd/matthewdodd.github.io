            . I am the wife of James Fallen; we live in New Gravel-lane. On Saturday morning I was coming over the bridge in <placeName id="t18310908-262-crimeloc1341">New Gravel-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18310908-262-crimeloc1341" type="placeName" value="New Gravel-lane"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where is your husband? A. In the West Indies - I had no other person with me; I do not know whether my shawl was taken off, or fell off - I have not recovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you mean to say you have not had your shawl again? A. Yes, Sir, I have, but I do not want to hurt the prisoner, if I must tell you the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you get your shawl again? A. It was brought back from the road in which the prisoner had run.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to presume to say that you had not got your shawl, when you had? A.Because I did not want to hurt the prisoner - I have seen his friends.</p>

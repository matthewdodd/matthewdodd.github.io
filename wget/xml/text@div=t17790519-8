               <p>I am servant to Mr. Lander. On the 6th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come in at the street door; the door was only on the latch, she could open it on the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - No. I was in the kitchen up one-pair-of-stairs backwards; hearing the door open, I went and peeped through the rails, and saw the prisoner come softly along the passage; I saw her take the coat off the nail, and put it in her apron, and run into the street; I followed her, and caught her within four doors of my master's house; she was running away with it; I found the great coat upon her, and brought her back.</p>
               <p>(The great coat was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>When the prosecutor took me there was nothing found upon me; he took me first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lander. I heard a scuffle in the passage; I ran to see what was the matter; my servant told me the prisoner had stolen the coat; I went out after her, and brought her in again.</p>

On the 26th of January, the prisoner went to bed about ten o'clock, and about half after ten I went to bed in the same bed. In the morning about four o'clock I awoke; the prisoner was dressed; I asked him where he was going; he said to work. I said it was too soon to go to work, and advised him to lie down again; he took off his coat and shoes, and laid down again; and between that and half after seven o'clock, when I awoke, he was gone, and part of the clothes I had taken off the over night was gone likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your clothes again - A. I went to my box to get some clothes to put on; I found that was gone likewise. I looked about that day, and the following day in the neighbourhood; I could not find him. On the 12th of April I saw the prisoner with a waistcoat, pantaloons, and a handkerchief of mine on him.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you meet with him - A. In Hyde Park; I spoke to him; he affected as if he did not know me. I told him I knew him by lodging at the house where I lodged; I gave him into Mr. Grose's hands a few minutes after. These are the pair of pantaloons, waistcoat, and handkerchief; found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q.What are they worth all the whole together - A. I have made up the bill altogether; they are with upwards of forty shillings; I am sure the the hin s that are here are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you them on the day before, or they were in your box - A. Yes.</p>

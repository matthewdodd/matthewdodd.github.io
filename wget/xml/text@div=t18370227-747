               <p>Martin, watchmakers, Charing-cross—it is the dwelling-house of Mr. Morse—the partnership funds are not applied to the payment of the rent On the evening of the 17th of February, I was in the shop about half-past six o'clock, I heard a tremendous crash of glass, and observed a man's hand being drawn from the window—I immediately ran round the counter into the street, and Ingall pointed out the prisoner—he was six or eight yards from the window—it is a very thick plate-glass window—it was the bottom pane, and about the centre of the window—I think Ingall had his hand on the prisoner's shoulder when he pointed him out to me—I col<lb></lb>lared him, and took him into the shop—a policeman had come up before that, and I told him to follow me into the shop—there are four brass rods in the window, with gold and silver watches hanging on them, and two gold guard chains—a person could put his hand in and reach them by breaking the glass—the prisoner said he did not do it—I observed that his right hand was covered with blood—the brass rods on which the watches hung were supported by two brass uprights—they were hooked on the other parts—the rods were all displaced, and the watches all thrown off them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen-draper, and live in Wardrobe-place, Doctors' Commons. I was standing at the prosecutor's shop at the time in question, and observed the prisoner at the window—I saw his hand inside the window—he drew it out, and walked deliberately away from it, from the part of the window where the frame was broken—I followed him, put my hand on his shoulder, and told him he was the young man that had broken the window—he did not appear to wish to go, but Barker came out and took him into the shop—a policeman came up at the same time—when he was taken into the shop, he said he wished only for seven years, or something to that effect—he was then desired to pull his right hand from his pocket, and it was very much cut and smeared with blood-one of his knuckles was cut, and bled very much, and also the wrist—I did not particularly notice the state of the rods and watches—I heard them fall from their position, and saw afterwards that they were dislodged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is a great thoroughfare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were no people about at that moment—I did not observe the prisoner before I heard the crash—I was then a yard or two yards from him, standing at the same window—I was able to distinguish him by the gas light—I don't think I could have distinguished him without the gas light, but I will not speak positively—it might be about half-past six—it was not earlier than that—I thought he was drunk at first, but I changed ray opinion afterwards, and thought him not so drunk as he appeared—he was a little excited—I was standing at the window making a memorandum on a card—I had not been there two minutes—when I charged him with being the person he was quietly walking away.</p>

               <p>of the window—it was about half-past six o'clock, or later—it was quite dark—the gas was lighted—the light of day was gone—I made up to the window, and saw Barker come out of the shop and run towards the Strand—I ran in the same direction, and found he had collared the prisoner—I took him to the shop—he said somebody had broken the window and not him—I took his hand out of his pocket—it was very much cut, and bleeding dreadfully—his pocket was half full of blood—he then said he did it to be transported, and he hoped he should have seven years—in taking him to the station-house a gentleman took hold of his arm, he struck that gentleman twice, and immediately threw me down and cut my head, which I feel at this moment—he tried to escape, but two more policemen came up, and he did not—when he came out of the shop he <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to the <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi> on the stand, and said he was <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—the blow I got was a severe one just over the eye, I fell on my arm and hurt that—I had hold of hit right arm—he twisted it round, put his foot before me and tripped me up.</p>

                  </hi> I am a furrier, and live in Bull's-head-court, Newgate-street—I have lost six fur muffs—they were in our possession in Sept. or Nov., I believe—they were worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only found this one, I can swear it is one I lost—the prisoner was in my service—this muff has my name on it.</p>

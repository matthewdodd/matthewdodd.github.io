                  </hi>. I do not know anything at all about the case; I was very much intoxicated at the time—I found myself at Guy's Hospital, very queer indeed, from a wound on my head—I had not been in company with the prisoner, I do not know him—I had been working at the Crystal Palace—I came out in the afternoon with a few friends, and got drinking—we went to the White Swan—we were at two or three houses about Norwood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Queen's Arms stables, which is about ten yards from the White Swan. On the afternoon of 15th May I saw Gorham there, about 4 o'clock; he was very tipsy—he came out of the Swan—the prisoner stood at the corner of the Swan palings, talking to a woman—Gorham went up to him, and said something, which I could not hear; I did not notice that he did or said anything to the woman, but he took his fist and shoved the prisoner down with his clenched fist; he did not hit him—the prisoner fell down—he had a shovel in his hand at the time—there was another man with the prisoner, a lodger of his, who also had a shovel in his hand—they crossed over the road; Gorham followed them:—the man who was with the prisoner said to him, "Don't take any notice of him, he's nothing but a b—y London <hi rend="italic">prig</hi>, come down on purpose to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with people, and on purpose to pick people's pockets; that is how they get their living"—they got to words together; the man kept repeating this over and over again to Gorham; he seemed to be upset by it, and kept dodging forwards, as if to hit him, only he was afraid of the shovels—the prisoner said, "If you do hit me, I will knock your b—y head open with the shovel"—the other man said so too—the prisoner said, "If I was a young man instead of an old one, I would give you a b—y good thrash<lb></lb>ing"—the other man, whose name I think is Cooke, kept calling Gorham a rogue and a <hi rend="italic">prig</hi>, and everything but a gentleman, and as soon as he got round the corner, Gorham made forward and knocked him down—the pri<lb></lb>soner directly rose his shovel, and struck a blow with it on the head, which fetched Gorham to the ground on his hands and knees—he got up again, and struggled with Cooke, but he was bleeding, and seemed as if he had no strength; he fell down, and became insensible—he was taken to a doctor's, and the prisoner was given into custody—the prisoner was in liquor, but not so drunk but what he knew what he was about—Gorham was very drunk; I was sober, I always keep sober.</p>

               <p>the Swan about half-past 4 o'clock on the 15th—I saw a crowd, and went out—I saw the prisoner and a man named Cooke insulting the prosecutor, saying that he had pushed him down in some way or other—they called him names, and said he was a rogue and vagabond, come down from London to see what he could get—he made no answer, being very drunk—he looked at them, and followed them—Cooke said something to him, which I could not exactly hear, and Gorham said, "Now I will come, and give it you"—he went towards Cooke, and showed fight to him, and the prisoner, who was standing by his side with a shovel over his shoulder, fetched him a blow, on the right side of the head—he fell, and then got up, and wanted to fight Cooke—he did not know which of the two had struck him—the prisoner walked away, and I saw no more of him till he was taken—Gorham was walking about for some time, wanting to fight Cooke; he seemed to be excited—somebody at last took him to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the evening of 15th May, Gorham came to me at Guy's Hospital; he had a severe cut wound on the scalp—it was a deep wound, and would require considerable force to inflict it—a blow with the edge of a shovel would be very likely to produce such a wound—he has got well now; he left the hospital a few days since, nearly well—he went out irregularly, of his own accord.</p>

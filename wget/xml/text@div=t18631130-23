                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to the Justices at Guildhall—on 7th May last, two persons, named Benjamin Close and Benjamin Everett, were charged with felony before Mr. Alderman Humphrey—the charge against was, first, against Close for stealing 900 yards of elastic web, value 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other goods, in the dwelling-house of Emanuel Lambert Lyons, and after<lb></lb>wards feloniously breaking out of the said dwelling-house; and also against Close and Everett for feloniously receiving the same goods, knowing them to have been stolen—on the examination of those two persons, before Mr. Alderman Humphrey, I saw the oath administered to the prisoner as a witness on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you reading from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The original deposi<lb></lb>tion—I have my original minutes here; this is an exact copy—I do not remember seeing any charge-sheet—there is given only what is called a charge-sheet, containing the nature of the charge—there were several charges against Everett and against other persons—whether in this particular case of Lyons there was a charge-sheet, I am not able to say—that which I have read from the depositions was made out after the evidence was heard—the charge was first made by Inspector Bond, verbally—he charged one with stealing and the other with receiving the goods—I don't think Yates was present at the time Bond made the charge, I think he was in the adjoining room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that Everett was given in custody by Mr. Commissioner Kerr? I do not know it of my own knowledge, it was said so—he was brought to the police-court in custody on 10th April—there is generally a charge-sheet, in almost all cases—my impression is that there was a charge-sheet when he was first brought, but that was in respect of another felony alleged to have been committed, not this of Lyons—the charge in respect of Lyons was not made until 7th May—there had been in<lb></lb>vestigations on various days between 10th April and 7th May—Lyons' case was heard on 7th May, after the hearing of other charges had been concluded—I don't think Lyons' case was on the charge-sheet; I do not remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300021"></xptr>
               <p>seeing it; I cannot say one way or the other—my impression is that there was no charge-sheet—there were a very great variety of charges constantly, almost every day, not entered separately, but elicited in the course of the evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Refreshing our memory by the depositions, will you state what the prisoner stated on his oath in reference to the charge against Close and Everett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps I had better read from my own minutes—he said, "I have known the prisoner Close for eight or nine years; I have known Everett for fourteen or sixteen years; I have seen Close at my house, at 86, Wheeler-street, Spitalfields; in December last I lived at 35, Collingwood-street, Mile End; I have seen Close at that house; he came with a man called <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>, from 9 to half-past 9 in the morning; that was in December, a little before I was taken into custody; they came in a horse and cart; some boots were in the cart, some uppers; I am not sure whether there were not two or three pieces of elastic; there were three or four bags of a darkish colour; Close said, 'Jack, have you got any stuff (money)?' I said, 'No, but I will find you a man that has got some;' the things were not taken out of the cart; I got into the cart with Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>; Close drove the cart, and I took them to Everett's, at No. 60, Sale-street; the bags were taken out of the cart and taken into Everett's house, into the front parlour; Everett was in the parlour with us; close said to him, 'Everett, I have got something to suit you;' Everett said, 'What are they?' Close said, 'Some boots and shoes, and some uppers;' I did not see the bags opened; Everett said, 'How much do you want for them?' Close said, '40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;' he said, 'Unsight and unseen, I will give you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;' Close said, 'No, that won't do;' then Everett said he would give 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I saw the money paid in gold; it was paid to Close, and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>; I got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from each of them; Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi> said to Everett, in his parlour, that the things were from Lyons' <hi rend="italic">burst</hi>; I got to Everett's house a little before 10 o'clock in the morning; I then saw Mrs. Everett first; I think the servant of Everett's was in the passage, but I won't be sure. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined as a witness against Close in March; I did not say anything about taking them to Everett's, I was not asked; Close's brother was tried with me; Close's brother pleaded guilty; my wife did not go with me to Everett's on this occasion; I never gave information about this transaction until after Close had been tried and acquitted. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not believe my wife saw Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi> when they came with the horse and cart; she was upstairs. <hi rend="italic">Further examined.</hi> I saw the mouth of one of the bags opened; there were boots in the bag, uppers and boots together; I can't say whether I saw the other bags opened; the bags appeared to contain what looked like boots"—The reference to Close's acquittal applied to a previous trial—the result was that the two parties were committed for trial.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300022"></xptr>
               <p>found guilty—Yates was examined at great length in all the cases, and his wife in some of the cases; I think in three—this was the only case connected with property of Mr. Lyon.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was convicted in June last, and am undergoing a sentence of penal servitude—I now come from Millbank Penitentiary—I am forty-two years of age—seventeen or eighteen years ago I was prosecuted for an offence, and was found guilty; I did not plead guilty—I had a mother living at that time—a sentence of nine months was passed upon me—when I came out of prison my mother assisted me in starting in a business in Nichol-street, Church-street, Shoreditch—I remained there eight years—the business was that of a grocer, cheesemonger, and broker—I also carried on business as a paper-stainer, but not then; I com<lb></lb>menced that seven years ago, and have carried it on simultaneously with the other business until I was taken into custody—I was married on 28th August, 1848. to my present wife—I was living with her up to the time of my being taken into custody—we kept a servant—I kept another shop in Nichol-street until February, fifteen months before I was taken—I have always been in the neighbourhood—during those seventeen or eighteen years I had saved some money—at the time I was taken into custody I had 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession—that was not all the result of my eighteen years' savings; when I started, my start was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say; that was from my friends, my mother, and my sisters, and my brothers-in-law; they set me up in business and took the shop for me—my mother is still alive, but she is above eighty years of age, and infirm—I was at this Court when I was given into custody—I voluntarily came up—I had a subpoena—I was subpoenaed by Lewis Lambert, 311 K—that was on 7th April—I was not present when Yates was examined—I saw Lambert at the foot of the Court, in the street, and asked him what could be the meaning of leaving me the subpoena; I told him if he required me I should be over at the Beehive public-house—I remained there; he called me, and I came, conscious of my innocence—I came into the Court where the trial was; directly I put my foot in the Court I was taken into custody—I had been in the neighbourhood of the Court before the trial commenced: I came on purpose—I was taken into custody after Lambert called me, and said, "Make haste;" I don't know the hour of the day—I was taken to Fleet-street station for the night, and the following day to Guildhall—I was then put into the dock with a person whose name I now know to be Close—I had never seen that person before—the first case I heard of was a robbery from a person named Skelton, in Bow-road, but ultimately this case of Mr. Lyon was gone into—that was at the second or third hearing—it was imputed to me that I had received a quantity of property, and paid 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I never paid 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any sum of money whatever to Close and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>on London-bridge—no purse was ever produced, and no prosecutor was ever produced; the man always declared that he never stole it—the case was tried here, in this or one of the other courts—William White was the man who was tried with me; he was convicted and had the same sentence as I had—I was then shopman to my mother; she kept a shop at 13, Vine-street, and at 13, Oak-street, Spitalfields, thirty-five years, in the grocery and cheesemonger line—after having served my imprisonment, I married and was started in business—the start was worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more than that, I dare say—my mother furnished the shop and stocked it well, which came to a good deal of money, and my brothers-in-law and my sisters gave me a very handsome present in money; I should say altogether 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in fact, I got a little money from each of my sisters unknown to my brothers-in-law; my sister made me a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unknown to her husband—my brother-in-law bought me some goods and some cheese—I had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—my sister gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my brother-in-law, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my other sister and my other brother-in-law made me a present of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are the exact sums—my sister that gave me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. kept a cheese<lb></lb>monger's shop in Turk-street, Bethnal-green—she gave me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. soon after I was married; three months after I came out of prison—I went in business directly I was married—I know she gave me the money without the knowledge of her husband, because she told me not to say anything to John about it—he assisted her in the business—he had vans and carts; he merely attended to the cart business; he carted coals, and went down to the ships—he and his son attended to the horses, and my sister attended to the cheesemongery, with assistants that she had—I can't say what was the rent of my sister's house; it was not a small shop—the other sister that gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was named Wills—her husband was a shoefactor at 152, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—it was not a small shop, a large one—she did not give me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without the knowledge of her husband; he knew of it—I knew that, because when she gave it to me at first she did not say anything about it, and afterwards when we were at a party it came out—she gave it at first without his knowledge—I can't say how long afterwards it was that she told him—he told me himself that he knew of it—he is not living now—he made the remark that he knew what Mary had given me—he did not tell me how he knew it—of course he could not have known it without she told him—at the time she gave it me she said, "Don't you say anything"—I did not think it extra<lb></lb>ordinary that she should have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to dispose of without her husband's knowledge—she paid it me all in gold, 100 sovereigns—the name of my other sister who gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was Arabella Collins—it was the husbands of those two sisters that gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they did not give me the money after they had discovered that their wives had given me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; it was before that: they thought that was all I did have—they gave me the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—my mother then stocked the shop for me—I had not been doing anything up to the time I was taken in custody, except assisting my mother—after I came out of prison of course I settled down and was married—I don't deny but my friends had given me money before; I dare say I had cost them some hundreds of pounds before my conviction—I wasted it, that is the truth, I am sorry to say so—it was after I had wasted it that I was taken up on the charge of stealing the purse—Wills was a shoe<lb></lb>factor—he is dead—I suppose somebody is carrying on his business—his wife is—I do not know that some of the shoes that were taken from Mr. Lyons' were found at Wills'—I heard that they attempted to make a charge of the sort—I do not know that such a thing took place—I heard that it</p>

I had was invested in the Consolidated Fund—I had two shops in Nichol-street—I lived there for fourteen years—while living there my house was not searched by the police—they called upon me, Mr. Evans did, in 1848—that was just after I had come out of prison—I was living in Nichol-street then—you will see by his evidence it was in 1847 that I was tried and had nine months—that would go somewhere into 1848—there was an interval between my coming out of prison and starting in business—it was in 1848 that Evans called—he was not authorized to search—I asked him to satisfy himself and look at my warehouse—he seemed to hesitate—if you call it searching, he looked over my bundles of goods—everything was labelled—I heard him swear that he was looking for some plate, but I will tell you what it was for—he asked me if anybody had left a half-pint pewter pot, and he magnified that into plate at the Court—the party was convicted, and had six months from Hicks's Hall.</p>

I am a general dealer, and live at 1, White's-row, Spitalfields—in April last I was subpoenaed on the trial of John Odin Simpson, on the part of the prosecution—I was standing in the waiting-room of this Court, and saw the prisoner Yates—no one was with him when I first went into the waiting-room, except the officers and a few other persons—after I and my brother-in-law had been there a-few minutes, I shook hands with Yates, and asked him how he was—I had known him—I was living upstairs with a man he used to work for, Mr. Lewis—I saw his wife come to him—I had known her—I was sitting at the other side of him; he was in the middle, and his wife on the other side of him—when she first came in, she shook hands with him and kissed him, and asked how he was—he said, "Quite well," and asked how the children were—after sitting there two or three minutes, she said, "Don't fret, Jack; I am going to be put into a shop"—after that, she said, "Jack, I am going to put <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Everett in for it"—he said, "What for?"—she said, "About Lyon and Skelton's concern"—she then asked me if I would step on one side for a few minutes—I told my brother-in-law Isaac Martin to come on one side for a few minutes, and I moved towards the door, and left them talking together for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was not within hearing distance, nor was anybody—the two officers were about two or the yards from them—on the Thursday night after Simpson's trial, I and Mrs. Yates, my servant Annie, and Baldwin, were together in the parlour opposite the Old Bailey—Yates was not present, he was in custody—on the following morning I was at the Guildhall justice room—I only went there with my servant; it was our Passover time—my servant had to go there as a witness—I don't know what case it was in; the Judge told her to be there next morning—I saw Yates there and his wife, she sat on one side of him and I on the other, and she said to him, "Jack, I have asked Mr. Bittan to say that he had a conversation along with <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Everett, and he won't"—Yates said, "Well, if he won't, he knows best"—Mrs. Yates had asked me to say something—I had another conversation on the Thursday when I went to Guildhall after my servant—it was the first Thursday in May, when Everett and Yates were at Guildhall—my servant Annie was there, and had the baby with her—I wished Yates good-bye, and as I was by the door he called me back, and said, Don't you tell any one what Jane wanted you to say about <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Everett."</p>

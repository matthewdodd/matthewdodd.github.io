The prisoner came to our house between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning; after she had gone I went into the parlour, and missed a sheet, which had been on a chair behind the parlour-door - I went to her house, and found her examining my sheet; part of my initials are on it - I have no doubt she had picked part of them out; I took it from her, and charged her with taking it - she said she found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What situation was she in in your house? A. She came for some gin; there is a small passage between the bar and the parlour, where the sheet had been left - while I was sitting in the bar I could not see a person passing from the parlour; it was but a few minutes before I missed the sheet, and there was no other person there - I had folded the sheets, and laid them in the parlour ten or fifteen minutes before; she lives but a short distance from me.</p>

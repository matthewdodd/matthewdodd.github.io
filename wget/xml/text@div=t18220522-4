My family had been in the prisoner's house three days, he gave them leave to be there till I could get a room for them - my goods had been seized for rent - I had known him for six months; he has a wife and four children, and was very badly off. I went to his house last Sunday morning, between one and two o'clock, and found him in liquor. I heard him ordering my wife and children out of doors - I was outside, and said</p>
               <p>"Open the door and let them come out," and what he required for the time they had been there I would pay him - he opened the door and seized hold of me, and began pulling me about; he said I should not come in, and slammed the door too - I had a scuffle with him before that; he was trying to get me out, and during the scuffle I found my pocket was torn away from my waistcoat; I had 14 s. 6 d., and some half-pence in a stocking in that pocket - I do not suppose that he knew that I had any money. I had received it from Mr. Maunday on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Your family remained inside - A. Yes. I said if he would give me my money I would go away, and if not I would fetch the watchman; he said he had no money of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220004"></xptr>mine - I said.</p>
               <p>"You have my money, pocket, and stocking alltogether;" he said I might go away, he had nothing of mine. I got a watchman who took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not come at half-past ten o'clock and break all my crockery - A. I broke three plates of my own in taking down the bird cage - my wife was then out with his wife. I went again between one and two o'clock to seek for my wife, and found him at home threatening to turn them out. I sleep in a stable about three hundred yards off.</p>

He left them there all the week, and never brought 1 s. to support them - his wife went to look for him as he was spending all the money. While I was out he came and broke my things; he came again about one o'clock, and said he would break in; my wife said,</p>
               <p>"Don't let him in" - I said I was as good a man as him, and opened the door; he wanted his wife and children; I said he should not have them that night - he struck at me, and we got hustling. The watchman came by, and he said I had robbed him.</p>

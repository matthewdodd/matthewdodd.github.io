On the 7th or 8th of July I saw the prisoner at my house—he was in the habit of frequently calling on me, representing him<lb></lb>self as selling cigars—he said he had taken a shop, and was going into partnership with a young man named Bailey—a person was with him who he brought to my house as Bailey—he took me down to show me the house</p>

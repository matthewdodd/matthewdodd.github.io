I ask'd him, Who that Man was that went out with the Bundle? I don't know who he is, says he, but he went up Stairs to a fat Man. And who do you want? says I. A young Woman, says he, her Name is Elizabeth - a - What d'ye call her? I can't think of her Name at present, but she lately married a Weaver. There's no such Person lives here, says I; and so he went away, and I went up one pair of Stairs, and saw Mr. Gibson's Door and his Drawers broke open.</p>

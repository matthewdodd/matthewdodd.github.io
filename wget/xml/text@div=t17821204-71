               <p>Court. Were these two prisoners among them? - They were, my Lord, the prisoners were among the first people that came in; Wood put a pistol to my head, and Fitzgerald a knife to my belly, and swore they would murder me.</p>
               <p>What were they confined for? - They were vagrants; somebody gave me a violent blow on my face, and as I stood in that position, some of the prisoners cried out, Frisk him for the keys! that is, meaning to feel in my pockets; and they cried, Why don't you murder him? then Wood put his hand into my right-hand pocket, and there he took out a shilling and two sixpences, and out of my left-hand breeches pocket he took the key of the main gate; then they went from the lodge, and went out, and one and thirty of them made their escape.</p>
               <p>Did they secure you any way? - I was close up in the corner standing.</p>
               <p>But when they took the key from you, did they tie you, or any thing of that sort? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. When were they taken again? - Wood was out a week or more; Fitzgerald was taken immediately, within a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>When they held the pistol and knife to you, did they ask you for any money, or any thing? - No my Lord, they took the key out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. As there was such a croud about you, are you positively sure it was the prisoners? - I am quite sure, because having them under my care, I know their faces so well.</p>

               <p>Did you see them take any thing from him? - I cannot say I saw them take the key; they were using him very ill, and I screamed out; and Fitzgerald said he would murder me if I spoke another word.</p>
               <p>How did they use him ill? - Standing with a knife and a pistol; and the other prisoners cried out, murder him! murder him! shoot his brains out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Wood. This woman, and this Mumford's oath would not be taken before Alderman Townsend; he said I will hang you, if you have fifty necks; the Alderman is not here; but if Mr. Wilmot's men were here, they would testify the same; I was taken up to Hicks's Hall, and I was fined for two years, for breaking out; I could have had my master, but I did not know of coming up.</p>

               <p>Court to Mumford. Did they ask you for any money? - No, they said if I did not give them the key, they would murder me; then they put in their hands into my right hand pocket, and took out the shilling and two six-pences.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, in Mr. Walker's employ; I saw these articles safe about three weeks before Christmas, when I left to work elsewhere - I returned on the 2d of January, and missed them - I found them at Worship-street, and am quite certain of them - they are now at home; I fitted them to the cart they were taken from.</p>

            . I was constable of Islington. On the 24th of December, I was near my own door; I saw the prisoner and another man with something in a sack; I asked what it was - they said a pair of arms; that they had found them, and were going to take them to Mr. Scott's - they then threw them down and ran off, but I secured them - they were discharged, as we could not find the owner; I afterwards took the prisoner, whose person I knew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up at four o'clock in the morning, to go to my brother's - I met the other man who said he had found a pair of arms, and was going to ask Scott to buy them.</p>

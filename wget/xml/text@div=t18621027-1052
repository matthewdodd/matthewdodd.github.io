I would not have drawn it"—I trusted them with that, and Dailey then called for a pint—he gave me sixpence, and I gave him threepence change—Maher then called for another pint, but I said, "No"—he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "You draw it; I will pay you"—I drew it, and he put down a shilling, which I found was</p>

"Mr. Pearce, forgive me, and I will pay you good money"—I said, "No"—he put down a florin, two shillings, and a sixpence, in good money, and wanted me to take them for the bad money which he had passed, but I refused, and sent for a policeman; but before one had time to come, Dailey said to Maher, "Give me that packet out of your bosom?"—he did not give Maher time to do so, but put his hand into Maher's bosom, and took out a packet, in tissue paper, about the size of a five-shilling paper of coppers—I had seen that packet before Dailey passed it to Maher, that morning, while he went into the back yard, and Maher put it in his bosom.</p>

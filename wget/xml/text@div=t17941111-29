Gentlemen, I had been in Rosemary-lane, and I bought these things there, I went into a public house to shew the prosecutor the petticoat, and she kept me there above four or five hours, it was a soldier that took these things from me, the constable never took them away.</p>
               <p>Court to Hurd. She says you never took them things away? - I am a bricklayer, I was a working there, and the soldier could not find any other officer, so he fetched me, and I took her with these things.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you said they were found in Ratcliffe highway? Is that East Smithfield? - No, the prosecutor dodged her about till they came near where I was at work in East Smithfield.</p>

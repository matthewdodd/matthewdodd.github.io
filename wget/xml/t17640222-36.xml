            . I am brother to the prisoner and deceased; the deceased ran after the prisoner, and knocked him down with a stick; this was on Friday night, the 4th of this instant, at Arnold's, at Hampstead; the stick was the staff of a pick axe.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220020"></xptr> I begged the deceased not to strike him any more: the prisoner had no stick. After that the prisoner went along, and the deceased ran after him again, and struck at him twice, but missed him; the blows came against a tree: the prisoner went on again, and the deceased followed him, and knocked the prisoner down, and fell himself. The prisoner got the stick, and struck the deceased on the shoulder, but it did not knock him down; the prisoner went on again, and the deceased followed, and knocked him down again; then the deceased tumbled over the prisoner, and fell on his head, and never spoke more: this was in the highway, where were stones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grigson. I attended the deceased. I found the scull much fractured.</p>
               <p>Q. What might occasion that fracture?</p>
               <p>Grigson. That might happen by the fall.</p>

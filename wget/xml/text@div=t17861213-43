               <p>I work facing Mr. Hodge's shop: on the 18th of November, near four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Hodge's shop, with this glass under his arm: Mr. Hodges was talking to my mistress, and she sent me after him; I followed him thirty yards, and he put down the glass on the pavement; I pursued him thirty yards more and took him; he never was out of my sight; he desired me to let him go, and not to degrade his friends; I took him to the watch-house; somebody else took up the glass, and carried it to the prosecutor's; I know it to be the same by the form and make; I had seen it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sent of an errand, and two lads ran by me, and they took them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses; who gave him a very good character.</p>

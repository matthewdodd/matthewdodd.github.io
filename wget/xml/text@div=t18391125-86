                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. James Stones, who keeps the Breck<lb></lb>lock-arms public-house, Camden-town. On the 2nd of November I saw he prisoner at the house, in company with Barker and Jones—they were drinking together—they left about half-past ten o'clock at night, and the next morning I missed two geese, three ducks, and eight fowls—I dis<lb></lb>covered two heads of ducks, and some blood, and a quantity of feathers within a few yards of the place where the poultry had been—I went for policeman, and tracked the feathers from Mr. Stones' house to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house—as we were going towards the prisoner's, we met him and</p>

               <p>Barker—I went to the prisoner's house, and went up the stair-case—I saw the prisoner, through the staircase-window, deposit out of his pocket a par<lb></lb>cel under two boards in an unfinished shed at the bottom of the garden—I went and asked what he had put under the boards—he said, "Nothing"—I took the parcel up, and asked what that was—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing about it—I. then searched the house, and in the kitchen found one fowl stripped of its feathers, and the head pulled off—I looked under the stairs, and found this goose's head, and a parcel of feathers—after that we found a duck thrown over the wall close by the prisoner's house—we found this knife in his trowsers' pocket, at the station-house—it appeared as if it had blood on it—I said, "That is Mr. Stones' knife"—the prisoner ac<lb></lb>knowledged that it was, and that he had broken it in eating some pie at Mr. Stones', the day before.</p>

Another Evidence depos'd the same; and nam'd some particular Injuries, viz. One Gentleman had his Jaw-Bone broke, another had his Arm broke, and another receiv'd a very desperate Wound in his Head; with a great many other unsufferable Affronts and Abuses which he thought too tedious to mention; but that Mr. Bell's Hand had receiv'd a great Contusion, and was very bloody. Another depos'd he heard the same Cry, and they hiss'd the King's Health, threw Firebrands into the House, and almost murder'd several who were about the Bonfire. One Bucknal depos'd he took

Mr. Rogers the Constable also swore, That being at the Bonfire to keep Peace and Order, a Man said to him, have a Care of your selves, for there are some here, will be about your House by and by. Upon which he went home to put on his Cap and Gown, which he had force done but down came the Mob, and the first Man he laid his Hand on that was among them, was Cotton; (who had a Pole in his Hand a Foot longer than his own Staff, and made rough and shagged at the End, fit for desperate Attempts) hollowing and crying out High Church; and having secur'd him, he made what Hast he could to the R. Exchange, to desire the commanding Officer to assist him with a Detachment of the Train'd Bands. Mr. Atkins swore, That being at the Place aforesaid, and drinking King George's Health, a Man that stood by him, hiss'd at it aloud: and drinking it again, he spit in his Face, and said, Damn ye, drink the King's; the King's? (he replied) so I do; pray what do you mean? Mean (says he) I mean Jemmy; and immediately retir'd to the Mob. Warren brought some to his Reputation, who said he was a civil lad; and that Stocks-market was his way home from the Place he was sent to. Cotton also brought the Master he serv'd his Time with, who spoke well of him; but as they could say nothing to the Behaviour they were charg'd with in the Riot, they were found <rs id="t17150907-13-verdict66" type="verdictDescription">

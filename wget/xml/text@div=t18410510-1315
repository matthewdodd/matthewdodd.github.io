                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Plough-court, Carey-street, Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn-fields, and am a warehouseman. The house belongs to John Critchell, and is in the parish of St. Clement Danes—I have charge of it for him—on the 18th of April, I was in the cellar of the house—the leaden water-pipe which passes through the cellar, was safe, and the lead of the pump—I locked the cellar, and took the key away—on Tuesday evening, the 20th, I went to the cellar, found the door open, the padlock was screwed off, the whole of the leaden-pipe, and part of the pump, gone, and the water running about the cellar—I found the prisoner in custody at Bow-street—the lead produced was matched with the cellar, and corre<lb></lb>sponded</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday, the 20th of April, I was in Clare-market, and saw the prisoner in Stanhope-street, with a sack on his back containing lead—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he made no answer—I asked where he brought it from—he said, "From St. Clement's-church"—I asked where he was going—he said, "To Mon-mouth-street"—he then threw the lead at my feet, and ran off—I followed, and met my brother constable—he was secured—I am sure he is the man—I afterwards compared the lead with what remained in the cellar, it agreed with it—he was stopped about a quarter of a mile from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's—there was about 80lbs. weight of lead.</p>

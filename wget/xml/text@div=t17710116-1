               <p>Grey. I shall be fourteen next May. It rained very hard that night; I went below; Mr. Judd bid me see if any body was stealing the butter; I went up; I saw three men stealing the butter. The prisoner was standing upon the gunnel of the lighter; there was a man under the head sheets where the butter was: the third man was in a skuller along-side of the lighter. I saw the prisoner handing the butter firkins into the skuller; there was one firkin left upon the lighters gunnel, they were in such a hurry to get away: I called out directly that they were stealing the butter; a gentleman and Mr. Judd jumped into a boat and rowed after them, but could not make any discovery of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Grey. After they had come back from pursuing them; it was just four o'clock by the gentleman's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the man under the sheets?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; I saw a man there, but I could not take particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get into the skuller too?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; they all did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many firkins did you see them hand over the lighter?</p>
               <p>Grey. While I was upon the deck I saw them hand one into the skuller, then I cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; the night before he brought a lighter to take away some lead in: next morning I knew him again as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>
               <p>Grey. It was moon light, but the moon was rather under a cloud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see them?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes it was. I told my master I knew one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you say he was?</p>

            . I was present at the time the warrant was served upon the prisoner. Mr. Hamar said, This is one of my men that brought the barge down. The captain took the candle because the prisoner turned his back upon the boy: the captain said to him, Is this the man, the boy immediately said, This is the very man, but he has not the same coat on; he had at the time a blue surtout coat on. The captain and I and the officer examined the prisoner's house; we found the coat, this boy, Grey, had described, hanging behind the door; it was rather damp.</p>

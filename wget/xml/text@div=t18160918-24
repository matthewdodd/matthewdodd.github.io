               <p>THOMAS IRONS. On the 28th of August last, between eight and nine o'clock in the forenoon, I was taking my breakfast in the kitchen; I <rs id="t18160918-24-viclabel138" type="occupation">keep a floorcloth-manufactory</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing that drew your attention - A. I saw the prisoner step from the pavement on to the shop-board; I had left nobody in the shop; we have no window to our shop; but there is a board fenced in by an iron-railing raised three feet eleven inches. He had one of his legs extended, and was laying over the rail, assisting as I supposed, in taking this out of the shop. I immediately proceeded up stairs, and saw him and another take the piece of oil-cloth which is now in Court; they had got it outside the shop, and it was upon the shoulder of one of them; it was on the shoulder of the prisoner's companion. I immediately called stop thief, and they dropped it. I pursued after the prisoner, and lost sight of him myself. Then I pursued the other, and left the people to pursue the prisoner. I lost the other; but the prisoner was apprehended by the people; it was not five minutes before he was brought back to my shop. I am positive the prisoner is one of the persons, for I had an opportunity of observing him for two or three minutes; I am certain of his person. The oil-cloth was recovered; I under value it at five-pound; it is here; it cost me five pounds to manufacture it.</p>
               <p>JOHN BURN. I was going down <placeName id="t18160918-24-crimeloc139">Frith-street</placeName>

I then saw the prisoner running away, and ten or a dozen people running after him; he turned off into Church-street; I followed him, and laid hold of him. At that time I did not know what was the charge against him. The prosecutor came up soon after, and said, he had been robbed of a piece of floor-cloth, and the prisoner said he was going by, and helped a man up with it on his shoulder; it was at the watchhouse he said that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up this street, and there was a young man standing by the prosecutor's door, and he asked me to be so good as to lift this up upon his shoulder, and I did so. I ran on about my business directly, and I was stopped, and brought back to the house.</p>

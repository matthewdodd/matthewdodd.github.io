                  </hi> O occupy the first of the prisoner's house. One night, in Feb., after ten o'clock, I heard a noise on the staircase—I went out, and saw two men endeavouring to get up stairs such a grindstone as this produced, towards the yard, not to the shop—the prisoner was at the foot of the stairs, holding a light—had I not seen him I should have inquired their business.</p>

               <p>between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day—people passing could not see it, there were so many things in the window—it was in the open shop, nearest the window than the door, two or three yards from the door—when the door is open it would cover it—if you shut the door it would be plainly seen—I have known the prisoner four or five years; he has borne a good character, as far as I know—there were cocks, metal, and pewter in the window—the prisoner was not there—I took him in Clare-market, before I went there—there is a door half-way up the first flight of stairs; that is the private door, where the lodgers go in—that would not be the way for a person selling a grindstone, not if they sold it in the open shop—Nicholls did not give me the information—a man came on Sunday morning, at eleven o'clock, when we had possession of the premises, and said, "I know whose grindstone that is"—I had never seen him before—he brought Mr. Price at three o'clock.</p>

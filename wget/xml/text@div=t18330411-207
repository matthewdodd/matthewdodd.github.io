            . I am in St. Sepulchre's school. On the 13th of March I was in Sharpe's-alley, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening - I know Smith the prisoner; I saw him about twenty yards from the stable; he was minding some sheep - some of them were long woolled, and one of them had a black face; I threw a turnip among them, and the black faced one eat it - I went for some starch. and as I was coming back I saw Smith again; he told me to go to Greenhill's-rents, and tell the boy there to stop there with the sheep till he came with the lambs; I went there and saw a person - I could not see whether it was a boy or not, but I delivered the message; there were fourteen or fifteen sheep in Greenhill's-rents - on the next morning I went with the officer, and pointed out Smith to him; he had a white dog with a mark round his neck, which had been with him on the Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live in Sharpe's-alley? A. Yes; only three people keep sheep there - there is one gas-light there; there are not many persons - I saw there was some person with sheep in Greenhill's-rents, and I called over to him.</p>

             (Police-constable G 66). On the 13th of March I saw Smith in Seward-street, Goswell-street, just before eight o'clock in the evening - he was in company with one or two others, who were patting off some sheep; there might be forty of them - one of the men knocked a sheep down, and I spoke to him about it, and said if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110116"></xptr>did it again I would take him into custody; Smith said, he knew they were doing wrong, but they wanted to part the sheep; I know Mr. Kimber, in Brudenel-terrace, New North-road - if a man had to drive sheep there from Sharpe's-alley, it would be rather out of the way to be in Greenhill's-rents.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It would not be a great deal out of the way? A. No; sheep sometimes take a wrong turning, and drovers have sometimes a great deal of trouble with them - it was another man who struck the sheep.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On the next evening did you take charge of some lambs at Whitchurch's? A. Yes, two lambs - I took them to the station, and they were identified there; they were killed, and I have brought their skins here - on the 15th I saw Smith in Smithfield, driving some sheep, and I took him into custody - I asked what sheep they were which he had in Seward-street; he said the same he was then driving into the market; I do not know the breed of the sheep.</p>

            . I am a drover, and live in Eccleston-buildings. On the 13th of March I was at Southall-market; I saw Smith there, attending for his masters, Mr. Venables and Mr. Kimber - I saw him marking some sheep, he asked me to go home with them, which I did, as he had some beasts to drive home - I left the market before he did, and he overtook me on the road, and passed me about three miles beyond Tyburu-gate; I afterwards saw him near Gray's Inn-lane, Holborn, the same night; I joined him, and we drove the sheep to Cock-lane, where we parted them - Smith drove off seventy-seven, and left me with twenty-three, about a quarter past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were left in charge of twenty-three sheep while Venables' sheep were taken to Newgate-market? A. Yes; these twenty-three sheep were for Mr. Kimber in the New North-road, but I do not know the place.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Newgate-market. On the 13th of March, I employed Smith to bring some sheep from Southall-market; he brought them and delivered them at my premises, from seven to a quarter past seven o'clock - I have a stable in Sharpe's-alley, but I had no sheep there that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did other persons keep sheep there? A. Yes; three persons - I have employed Smith; his character has been very good as far as I have heard - he had about 450l. worth of my goods on that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte manufacturer's manager, and live at Reading Villa, Hackney—about 11.30 on the night of 22nd August on my way home I was going down the entrance of the Bishopsgate Street station, I heard steps behind me coming very rapidly—I turned round, and under a strong light from the lamp I saw the two prisoners, Looney being about a pace in advance—Gregory struck me across my face with his clenched fist, fracturing my upper jaw, loosening several of my teeth, cutting my mouth, and causing me to bleed profusely—Looney snatched my chain, and succeeded in getting a portion of it—I staggered and fell, and they ran away—I received some injury on the knee, I think from a kick, because my trousers were not cut—I got up and saw them run, and I immediately afterwards complained to a railway policeman in the station—on the 24th I was brought to the police-station, and picked Gregory out immediately from eight or nine others, and on 2nd September 1 identified Looney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Gregory.</hi> I did not say you held me by the arms—I was not intoxicated—I had just crossed over from the Standard Theatre—I could not follow you, or even call out; my mouth was full of blood—my lip was cut by the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Looney.</hi> I identified you at once—it is not true that I could not identify you at first—I was not there in the morning.</p>

I took Gregory in the Bethnal Green Road, on 23rd August, at 11 o'clock, and said, "Buster, I want you"—he ran away, and I caught him some distance down the road—he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "For committing two highway robberies, with violence, on the 17th and 22nd August"—he said, "I know nothing about it. I didn't do it, but I know the two who did."</p>

A pretty fine thing if I get seven years for this"—he was placed with six other men at the station, and identified by the prosecutor—he said, "I know nothing about it".</p>

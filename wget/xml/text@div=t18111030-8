On the 17th of this month I went down stairs to breakfast about eight o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the shop about three or four minutes, upon hearing this noise I went up stairs, I missed the boots from off the work bench, and the hats from off the counter; I opened the door, it was only latched, I looked towards Foley-place, which is about four or five doors from the shop, I saw the prisoner, he was walking with the boots in his right hand, and the hats in his left hand. I ran after him and called stop thief; he immediately threw down the hat and boots, and ran. I took the hats and boots up and went home, another person pursued him, he was soon brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. You had done nothing to your shop door to secure it, had you - A. I merely put it to; there is a patent latch underneath, sometimes it does not catch, that might be the case that morning. These are the boots I have on, this is the hat I wear myself, and this is the child's hat I fitted up the night before.</p>

            . About eight o'clock in the morning I was crossing over from Portland-place to Foley-place, I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned round and saw the prisoner, he was then running and Mr. Cobham after him, he had a pair of boots and two hats with him when he was running. I saw that. I saw him drop them, Mr. Cobham picked them up; I pursued him in Riding-house lane, he gained ground of me. I called out stop thief, Mr. Clowes stopped him.</p>

            . I was standing at the corner of Riding-house-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running up the lane; I waited for his coming, he had no other way except turning</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him at that time - A. No. I stopped him when he came up, he said, I am no thief; I said, if you are no thief you have no occasion to be in a hurry. I afterwards conducted him to Mr. Cobham's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going along the street there rushed a young man by me, he dropped two hats and a pair of boots, I asked him if he knew he had dropped any thing, he made no answer, but kept running. I never picked the hats up, they did not belong to me; I was going along, I only looked at them; somebody cried out stop thief, the man stopped me at the corner of the street, I said, what do you stop me for; he said, what did you run for.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

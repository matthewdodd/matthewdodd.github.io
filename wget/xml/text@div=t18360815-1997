                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Chester-street, Kennington-lane. The prisoner occupied a furnished room in the house for nine or ten months—her husband was with her living, in the house at the time—he came with her, but left a fortnight before she did, to go to a situation—I told the prisoner she must leave, because she owned two months' rent—I told her twice to go away—she went away in the afternoon in question, while I was out; and next day I went to the station-house, as her room door was left locked, and applied to an officer to open the door—I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment—I had her apprehended the week following—I believe she was in distress—when I apprehended her she said, she had pawned them all, that she did not take them with intent to steal them, but to return them, and that the duplicates were with her sister—I have found the things—they were very decent people—the man had been an assistant to a chemist and druggist.</p>

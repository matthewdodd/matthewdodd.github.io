                  </hi>. I am a bedstead manufacturer. The prisoner was my journeyman—I frequently missed pieces of wood—in consequence of that went to his lodgings, and found some pieces of wood that I thought were nine—he said they were not mine, but they belonged to Mr. Mitchell, who had sent them to him—I very much doubted it, because I knew the wood—I went to Mr. Mitchell, and then I went to the prisoner again—I told him where I had been, and he said I had been to the wrong Mr. Mitc<lb></lb>hell—I returned home, and took the policeman to search his premises, where re found this wood—I believe it to be mine, I can speak positively to it—I went to Mr. Mitchell's, because I wanted to know whether part of it was his—I can swear to part of it.</p>

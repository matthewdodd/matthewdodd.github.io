On Thursday the 6th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the night, the watchman called me up to see if I had lost any thing out of the shop, as he said the door was open; I made all the haste I could down, and missed four saws; the watchman told me, the man who had taken them was apprehended, and was in the watch-house. I went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner, and all the things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner came to work for me about six weeks before Christmas, and lodged in the house; I discharged him last Monday was week, because I could not get him to work; that was the Monday before the robbery; he always behaved very well while he was with me; I never suspected him.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol. On the 6th of May, about half after 12 o'clock, as I was taking my rounds, I saw the prisoner lurking about the prosecutor's house; on my coming up to him he crossed the way; I told the watchman of him; I went away and returned again in about ten minutes, and met the prisoner with the saw; I laid hold of him, and asked him where he was going; he said, to his lodgings. I asked him where he got the things; he said they were his own; that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190018"></xptr> worked at Mary-le-Bonne. I took him to the watch-house. He was within two yards of the prosecutor's door when I took him; it was dark, I did not see him come out of the house; I found all the things under his arm.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My name is at full length on the plane; I am so much used to the saws that I cannot but know them.</p>
               <p>Suppose you was at work in a shop with ten carpenters, who all had six saws each, could you pick your saws from among them? - Yes; if there were fifty I could; the stock is mine: I have the bit here that fits it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he has not given me leave to take tools if I had a job to do, without asking him? - He often has taken tools and brought them back again; whether that was his intent now I leave to you.</p>
               <p>Was the door broke open? - There is a door under my shutter that was neglected to be bolted, where I suppose he might get in.</p>
               <p>Have you let him take tools? - Yes, he had not many of his own.</p>
               <p>That was while he lived with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you lend him any after he left you? - I do not recollect that I have lent him any; I believe if he had asked me I should.</p>

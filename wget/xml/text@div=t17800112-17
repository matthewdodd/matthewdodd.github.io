               <p>I am an apprentice to Messrs. Chambers, Langston, and Hall. On the 22d of December, between the hours of two and four in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into my master's shop and asked to see some thread edgings; I shewed them one box in which there was nothing fine enough for them; I shewed them another out of which they bought two yards and an half; they then asked to see some broader and finer lace; I shewed them some; they bought a yard and a quarter; while I was measuring it, I perceived Jones take a card, which she had been looking at before, and slide it into Gaskin's apron, which Gaskin concealed.</p>
               <p>One card of lace? - Yes; Gaskin took it out of her apron and put it into her pocket-hole.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else? - There was more found upon them when they were brought into the shop again. I took no notice of it to the prisoner, but put up what they bought of me, and they paid me for it. I let them go out of the shop, and then went after them and brought them both back.</p>
               <p>Did you follow them directly? - Yes. When they were got into the shop they placed themselves very near the compter, and Gaskin dropped five cards, almost as soon as she got into the shop, before we could get a constable. I saw her drop them.</p>
               <p>What quantity did they contain? - About thirty-five yards.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - Five pounds, and upwards. Two of the pieces were not measured.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was done so public that you saw her take it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where were the cards of lace found? - On the floor of the shop.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - On the outside of the counter.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that it was on the other side of the counter? - No.</p>

On the 19th of May, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came in - I sold her two yards of ribbon, at 7d. - I missed a piece - I saw her handkerchief on the counter - I took it up, and found the ribbon in it - she said she did not know it was there - it was in the drawer which I showed her - there was another piece missing - our young man came and asked if she had seen it - she said No; he told her to look into her bag - she opened her bag and produced it, but said she did not know she had got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you tell this story before? A. Yes, to the best of my recollection - it is not a very large shop - several persons were ther - she laid three sixpences on the counter, but I did take them up, as I missed this.</p>

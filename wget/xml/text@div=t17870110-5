               <p>On the 11th of November last, the night the Princess Amelia was buried, I and two more officers went down to Westminster, to see if we could see any people that we wanted; and just as we got to the turning from New to Old Palace-yard, after the funeral was gone in, we heard the cry of stop thief! I ran and saw the prisoner running very hastily, and the prosecutor almost close to his heels; he ran under a coach, and I ran to meet him, I laid hold of him, and the rest of the officers then came up, and laid hold of him likewise; I am sure he was the man that the prosecutor was in pursuit of; I pursued him under three or four coaches.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever lose sight of him till he was stopped by the officer? - Yes; I lost sight of the prisoner, and kept sight of Allen; I had lost sight of him before the officer pursued him, for five minutes; then they called out, Bill, Bill, that was Allen; then I got sight of him again; I never lost sight of him till he was taken; after I pursued him; I am sure he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court to Freeman. Are you sure he is the same person that you took that night, because he escaped? - Yes, I am sure he is the same person; I did not altogether observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100007"></xptr>that in his eye, but I have very little doubt of his being the person, but I cannot say I had so much view of him then, being night; and I delivered him to the other officer.</p>

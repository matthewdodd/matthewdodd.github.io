            . I am engineer at the Independent Gas-light and Coke Company. They act under that name, and are authorised to prosecute and defend in that name; I have seen the Act - this iron was laying on the ground in their yard at <placeName id="t18301209-236-crimeloc1331">Haggerstone</placeName>

            . On the 7th of December, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I was on duty as a private patrol of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - at the corner of Union-street, leading towards Kingsland, I saw Spurling wheeling a barrow - Jacobs was walking alongside of him; I crossed over, and asked what they had got there - they said, "Some iron:" I asked where they brought it from - they said,"From Kingsland, from Mr. Perry's marine-store shop;" I said they must go with me to the watch-house, and while I was talking to them, Jacobs slipped two shovels from behind his back - I put them into the barrow, and with the assistance of the Policeman, took them to the station: the shovels have not been claimed - I was present when Fullwood saw the iron at the office, and claimed it; I was sure that Perry did not keep an iron shop at Kingsland.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Spurling's Defence. I went down to my father's to do some work; I was coming up and happened to see the barrow in the road - Jacobs said, "Will you give me a help along with it?" I did not know but it was his property, and wheeled it for him - Smith said, "What have you here?" I said, "Iron;" he said, "I can't let you go;" I said, "Well, I may as well go, it is not my property."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. Jacobs said he brought it from an old iron shop - Spurling did not contradict him; he said he had wheeled the barrow for him.</p>

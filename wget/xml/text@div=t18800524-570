I am a lighterman in the service of Arthur John Humphreys and Co., of Tooley Street—on 5th February I received directions to proceed to Horselydown, where the steamship Plover was—I did so—I took a barge named Sabrina and moored it off the ship—it had the master's name, F. A. Hughes, upon it—I loaded it; with potatoes, which were on board the steamship—I left the barge at 6.30 and went to the wharf for orders—I returned to the barge and covered up the potatoes with tarpaulin—there were then 168 sacks in it I left it safe at 7.50—when I returned to the Plover next morning; between 7 and 8 o'clock the barge and contents were gone, and I gave information—the potatoes were in sacks similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) they were marked with a star and. a C.</p>

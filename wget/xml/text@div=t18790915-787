                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 21, Colville Place, I Whitfield Street—in June last the prisoner took a furnished room at my house—she told me at the time that he was suffering from an abscess is her side; she said she had only left her place to recruit her health a little, and she was going back again—after she had been with me about a fort-night she left, saying that she was going to some place near Lincoln's Inn Fields to have her abscess looked to—she returned in a fortnight and two days with a baby—I asked her whose baby it was—she said "It is mine"—I said "Do you mean to tell me that you have given birth to that child since you left me?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Well, come in," and when she unwrapped it it was a nice little baby—she seemed to have an abundance of milk, and gave it her—I said "What are you going to do?"—she said "I shall not keep it here long, I have got a friend in Hamp-stead who has no children who is going to take it, it was all arrauged beforehand, and I am going the following day"—this was on Saturday—she took it away on Saturday, and brought it back, but on Monday she took it away finally—I did not see it again; I was in bed when she came home on Monday night, and did not see her; I heard her go upstairs, but on Tues<lb></lb>day</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Arthur Butcher, of 2, White Horse Terrace, Hampstead—I have known the prisoner about 18 months—I received a letter from her early in July which I destroyed, it was asking me to meet her at the Britannia at 8.30 on the Saturday—I did so; I found her standing in a doorway in Park Street with a baby covered up in a black shawl—I asked her what she had got in the shawl—she said "My baby"—I looked at it; it was dressed in workhouse clothes—I have since seen some clothes similar to those—I cannot say they were the same—I asked her if she had had any dinner—she said she had not, she had not left the workhouse till after" dinner—I asked if she would take anything to drink—she said she would not mind a glass of stout, and she had it—she asked me if I could take the baby in to nurse—I said I could not as I had my business to attend to—I said "Have you any money?"—she said "I have plenty at home, but not with me"—I gave her a shilling to pay her fare home, and then left her—next day,</p>

               <p>Sunday, she came to my house, about 5.30, with the child; it appeared quite well; she suokled it; she had plenty of milk—she came again on the Tuesday as I and my little girl were haying our tea—she was crying; I said "Fanny, what is the matter?"—she said "Oh, Mrs. Butcher, I have lost baby!"—I said "Lost baby!"—she said "Yes, through con<lb></lb>yulsions"—sho said she had taken it to a doctor, and he said it was on account of its being vaccinated whilst it was so young—she did not tell me the doctor's name, or where he lived—she said the child had been buried by a man in Francis Street, Tottenham Court Road, and that it had cost her a sovereign—a few days afterwards she came to my place again, and stayed for a night or two—I did not see her again for some time—she said she was going home—she came back to my place on the Friday before the Bank Holiday, and remained till the 7th August, when the police came and took her away—I heard the police tell her that she was charged with killing her baby, and I said "Fanny, you told me an untruth; you told me the baby died of convulsions, and had it buried by a man in Tottenham Court Road; did you say so or not?"—she said "I did."</p>

I am a widow, and am midwife at St. Pancrss Union—the prisoner came to the infirmany on 27th June, and about 1.30 the following morning she was delivered of a female child—she left on Saturday, 12th July—during that time I particularly noticed the prisoner and the baby, because the mother was so skinny and thin that I had extra food given to her—the child was a nice healthy little baby—it weighed 6lb. at its birth; that is not the average weight—we have them at 3lb., 4lb., 5lb., up to 9lb. and 10lb., but we have more at 6lb. than anything else—when she left the workhouse she took the child with her; it was then wearing the workhouse clothes—a striped frock and a diaper were produced to me by the police, and they are similar to the clothes which the child was wearing when it left the workhouse—during the time she was in the workhouse she had a nice breast of milk, and she suckled it—she said the child would not life long after it left St. Pancras—she took her own discharge—her language to her infant was very bad—she called it little devil and little demon, and I reproved her for it a great many times, and others were constantly reproving her for putting the child under the bedclothes and wanting to smother it—we have to look after them pretty sharply—she was not a kind mother—she used to shake it, and I had to look after it to see that she did not shake the life out of it.</p>

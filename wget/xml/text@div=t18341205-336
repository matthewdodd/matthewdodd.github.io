                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth. The prisoner was my servant—on the 16th of October I was going to send him to Battersea Mills for some barley I had had ground there—Mr. Collyer asked me to send for a sack of flour for him at the same time—he gave me a sovereign, a half-so<lb></lb>vereign, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I believe, but I am sure the sovereign was with the money—I gave it to the prisoner to get the sack of flour, and take it to Mr. Collyer's—he went and got it, and brought my barley-meal—I told him to pay for the flour, and be very particular that it was not put down to my account, as it was not for me—on the Sunday morning following, Mr. Hannet, the proprietor of the mill, called on me, and I asked the prisoner if he had paid for the flour, as there was a dispute about it—he said he had—in the course of the week I told him to go to the mill, and I would meet him there, which I did—I then told Mr. Frost to bring his men for<lb></lb>ward, that the prisoner might point out who he paid the money to—the men were brought forward—he pointed out Robert Young, and said he had paid him—Young denied it, and asked the prisoner where he had paid him—he pointed to a little desk inside the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Frost, at Battersea Mills. I have been there twelve months—I remember the prisoner coming for some flour—he asked for a sack of flour for Mr. Robinson—I delivered him one—I do not know what it came to—I deliver flour and receive money if Mr. Frost is not there—I cannot say what was the value of it—I should not have known till I had asked Mr. Frost—we have various prices—if he had brought the money, I should have taken it, and written a receipt for what he brought—I should have taken what he had given me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You state it is your practice, when Mr. Frost is out, to deliver flour, and take money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do occasionally—if any person had come in and wanted a sack of flour, I should have written a receipt according to what he had given me—if Mr. Robinson, had sent a sum, I should have taken it—I should not have been able to fix a price—I should not have thought so low as 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should not have said under 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, now you remember the prisoner coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he asked for a sack of flour—I told him Mr. Frost was at the Red House—he went to him, and came back and brought me the keys of Mr. Frost's counting-house, and said he was to have a sack of flour—I delivered him one—I and Rock lifted it into his cart, with the quarter of barley-meal—there is a counting-house there—I superintend it in general—I was not in the counting-house that day—I was in the mill—I only went into the count<lb></lb>ing-house to get the book—Rock did not go in with me, nor the prisoner—the prisoner was in the mill when I wrote the note out for him to take with the sack of flour—I generally get the book from the counting-house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183412050130"></xptr>
               <p>and write the note in the mill—the prisoner was by my side when I wrote the note—I left him in the mill when I went to the counting-house for the book, and found him in the mill when I returned—it is generally our practice to write the note on the large counter in the mill—Rock was standing near the prisoner when I wrote the note, and I believe he was by him when I went for the book—they were both just in the doorway when I returned—the prisoner did not pay me any money, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. A.</hi> What is it you mean about a note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a delivery note, on account of Mr. Hannet to Mr. Robinson—the prisoner takes one, and leaves another in the mill—I was before the magistrate—I told him that the prisoner signed the delivery note, and said that he wanted it for Mr. Robinson—this is the note; Mr. Robinson's name is not on it—it shows he received a sack of flour—it is our general custom—it is usual to give a receipt—I never received money without a receipt—I will not swear he has never paid it without—I swear I never take money without giving a receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to adhere to the answer, that you never take money without giving a receipt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not under 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. give a stamp receipt—I have taken a few shillings without giving a receipt—I will not swear that I have not received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. without a receipt—I have not received 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because it is not our usual way—I cannot tell the price of flour per sack that day—I have always an order for what money I am to receive—it is the custom, that I receive an order what to deliver and what to receive—it did not excite my surprise that I had not an order for what the prisoner was to pay—when he was brought, he pointed me out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that Rock was pretty near the prisoner, will you swear he was in the mill all the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were both there when I came out, and I left them going into the mill, when I went into the counting-house—I cannot swear that Rock was not outside the mill part of the time—he might have been—I do not know what the price of a sack of flour was—I should not have taken 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., unless I had gone and asked Mr. Frost the price.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">A JUROR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose I bought a sack of flour yesterday, what would you have charged me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not have known—I should have sent you to Mr. Frost, if he had not been in the mill—if you could not have seen him, I should have asked the price that I thought was right—I should have known within a shilling—it is not worth above 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the mode in which Mr. Frost conducts his business this, that he leaves you there, and you do not know the price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not know exactly—the prisoner did not know me, and yet he charged me with receiving the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not add, that "After you and somebody else had carried the two sacks to the cart, we went back, and I put down 1 sovereign, 1 half-sovereign, and 7 shillings on the board, and told you it was the money for the flour—I put it on the right side of the board?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the mill when the prisoner came for the flour, and a quarter of barley-meal—Young was there, and he sent the prisoner to the Red House, to master—he brought the keys back, and Young and I weighed him a sack of flour, and delivered it—I did not leave him—I was with Young all the time the prisoner was there—Young and the pri<lb></lb>soner and I never separated, nor were out of sight, after the prisoner brought the keys of the counting-house for Young to go and get the book—I did not go to the counting-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not separate then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but we had not loaded the flour then—the prisoner did not go to the counting-house—he stopped in the mill with me—Young was not a minute away, and then he came back with the book—we then weighed the flour and loaded it—the prisoner came back with Young and me, and made a note out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that the whole time that Edwards was there, you three were altogether, except when Young went to the counting-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the prisoner did not pay any money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When your master is out, who sells floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Robert Young, when Mr. Matthews, the foreman, is out of the way—Mr. Matthews is an elderly man—there is a man named Humphreys there; but when the foreman and the master are out of the way, Young sells and re<lb></lb>ceives money—when persons come for a sack of flour, they generally deliver an order—I do not know any thing about the prices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But suppose one of the gentlemen of the Jury had come to the mill yesterday for a sack of flour, and your master was out, and the foreman not at home, what would be done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose he would go back with<lb></lb>out it—I do not think Young would have sold it at all under these cir<lb></lb>cumstances—I cannot say whether he would know the price—I cannot say whether there is any memorandum of the price kept—Young went into the counting-house to get the book after the prisoner's cart was loaded.</p>

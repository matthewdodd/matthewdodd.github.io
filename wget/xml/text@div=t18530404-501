                  </hi>. I am a harness blacking manufacturer, of No. 41, Mansell-street. The prisoners have been in the habit of dealing with me for about four years for sponges; they never, to my knowledge, purchased any harness composition—a person named Manchee was in my employment as dispatch clerk, he had to execute the orders—I never authorized him to sell any composition to the prisoners; I have searched my books this morning, and find no entry of any harness composition being supplied to them, and the books have also been searched by a clerk—I examined my stock of harness composition three or four weeks ago, and missed seven or eight dozen boxes, of two sizes; the value of the small ones is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the large 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per dozen boxes, subject to a small discount on taking a large quantity, but not otherwise—I missed a larger quantity of the small size—the value of what I missed altogether is something over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I am now in custody for robbing my employer—I have been seven years in Mr. Harriss's employment as clerk—I have known the prisoners between three and four years; they were customers of my master for sponges, but never in a regular way for anything else—I have been in the habit of meeting them occasionally at other places, besides my master's, generally in Hayley-street—I recollect seeing David Alexander on one occasion, when I was in want of money, at the Green Man, between five and six months ago—at that time I had committed no robbery on my employers—I asked David to lend me some money—he said he could not, as he had been buying so much sponge lately, but that if I could get some sponge out he would sell it, and let me have the money—I told him I could not, because that was not my line of business; the sponge was not under my care—he asked me if I could get any composition out, that is harness composition—I told him I could do so, but should not like—he said that out of the quantity my master had he would not miss few dozen, and a few dozen would put me all right—(the sum I wanted to borrow</p>

               <p>was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—this was at dinner-time, 1 o'clock—David said he would send his brother Joseph round about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and at 5 o'clock the prisoner Joseph came to the window of the warehouse, and I gave him a parcel of composition—this was in Aug., as near as I can recollect—I saw David the next day—he asked me if I could not get any more out, as that was so small a quantity, and I gave him another parcel after that—about 21st Aug. I sent away a cask, by my master's cart, to Joseph Alexander's house, containing about forty dozen boxes of composition—Christmas was the driver of the cart—I delivered the cask to him from the shop—I had the prisoner's direction written down, and I gave it to him—I saw Joseph the same day at the usual place, in Haley-street, not at a public house—he said that it was all right, he had sent it off by rail to Birmingham, and it was not in the house five minutes—I cannot say whether I saw David about it at all; I do not recollect any conversation with him about it—I delivered some more in Sept.; David paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I also sent away a cask by Christmas in Sept., directed "D. Simpson, to be left at the Birmingham Railway-station, at Birmingham"—it had been agreed on between David Alexander and me to direct it to Simpson—I cannot recollect whether he proposed that name or whether it was agreed on between us—he said he would write and send the money up by a Post-office older, at the Whitechapel post-office, and he would address me as T. Cameron; that was to be my name—after I had sent the composition to Birmingham I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say in whose handwriting it is, or the direction—I expected to receive it—it was agreed between me and David that I was to call at the Whitechapel post-office to see if there was a letter left.</p>

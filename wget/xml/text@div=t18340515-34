The three prisoners came to my shop on the 8th of April - Mason asked for a pair of boots that would fit her; and while I was getting a pair from one window, Holder reached a pair from the other window, and gave them to Davis, who put them under her apron - Mason then said the boots I showed her were not large enough - I said I had no larger, and they were about to leave the shop - I said they should not leave till I saw what Davis had - she said she had nothing; but I found these boots on her - I left her in charge while I went after the other two - I took them, and gave them all in charge.</p>
               <p>ISAAC OFFWOOD. I reside with my brother. While my brother was showing the boots to Mason, I saw Holder pull the curtain aside, take the boots, and give them to Davis - they were then going out, but my brother stopped Davis, and found the boots on her - he then went and brought the other two back.</p>

               <p>JOHN OFFWOOD. She said she had no boots on her - there were only ten pence found on them.</p>
               <p>Mason. I went to ask him if he would take money on the shoes - he said yes - he had not a pair that were large enough for me - I came out, and he came and took me.</p>

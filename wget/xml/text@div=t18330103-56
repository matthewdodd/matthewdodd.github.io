            . On the 22nd of November, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came, and brought this order; he said he came from Mr. Mister, of the Dover-road, and he wanted these things with him, as they were to be sent with an engine to Richmond that evening; he said his master, or Mr. Mister would have come himself, but he had had an accident with his cart, and the shaft was broken: I asked if he was hurt; he said No, that he was in the cart, but was not hurt - he said he was going further, and would call again: he called in about twenty minutes; the goods were then nearly ready; he said he had been to the White-horse, in the York-road: I said it must be wrong; he must mean the Liverpool-road: I gave him the goods, as specified in the order - they were worth 2l. 12s. - he went away; after he was gone I noticed that the order was signed R. Mister; and not W, but I thought it might have been written by one of his men: on the following evening the prisoner brought another order, which I have in my hand; he handed it to me, and drew back; there seemed a shyness about him, which excited my suspicion; I asked where he got it, and who gave it to him - he at first said Mr. Kember; I repeated my question, and then he said a young man at the corner of the street - the same person who gave him the order yesterday evening; that he was in the street, and a young man came and asked him if he wanted a job; that he said Yes, and he said, "Take this order, and get the things, and I will give you sixpence;" which he did, and he said if he would meet him the following evening at the Bull's Head, Smithfield, he would try to get him a place, and he said "If they ask you any questions, say you sometimes work at turning a wheel at Mister's," and that the young man said, "I do not like to call for the goods myself, because I once worked there." I sent a man out to look for the young man, but he could not find him.</p>

I took the prisoner at the prosecutor's, on the 23rd - I asked him who his employer was; he said he was not in any one's employ at present, but he was sent there by a man who was standing in the street, who had offered him 6d. for his trouble; I went out into the street, but could not see any man who answered the description - I waited there ten minutes.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner said the man who employed him did not like to go to your premises because he had worked there? A. To the best of my recollection, I think I did - I am sure he said so; the first day he said he came from Mr. Mister, but the next day, when I questioned him, he told me at once, that a man told him to bring it, and he was waiting in the street - (order read).</p>

                  </hi>. I am relieving-officer of the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—on 18th April, just before 12 at night, I was sent for by the police to 99, Nichol-square—the prisoner lives there—I believe he has a family of six children—my attetion had been called to them on the 14th,</p>

               <p>and I saw him the next day, at the shop where he was employed as a poul<lb></lb>terer's salesman, in Leadenhall market—I told him who I was, and asked him if he was aware of the position in which his family was?—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "Mrs. Thorne has called my attention to your family, and I called last night for the purpose of seeing them; I believe there was a daughter of yours in the room, who refused to admit me, so I afterwards took a policeman with me"—I also told him that I saw his child, Alfred, going in at the door, but he was kept out by his daughter, on account of us being there—I told him the child appeared very thin and haggard—he then said, "What business have you to go into my house at all?"—I said, "unless you provide for your family, I shall take other pro<lb></lb>ceedings, after the case has been represented before the Board of Guardians"—he made no reply to that—that was all that passed on the 15th—when I went to the house on the 18th, I found the room I went into completely stripped of furniture—there were a few rags lying in one corner, and on those rags I found Clara, a child five years of age, and Walter, aged seven and a half—a boy, named Frederick, aged thirteen, was standing under the window—he was clad very badly—Walter was breathing very heavily—he did not appear to understand when I spoke to him—he was comparatively insensible—he had nothing on with the exception of a portion of a blanket to cover him—he appeared to be very dirty, about the head more par<lb></lb>ticularly—a deal of vermin about the head—I sent for Dr. Wallace, who came at once, and I removed all the children to the workhouse, through his certificate—I did not see a particle of food or water in the room—there was one cupboard in the room—I did not look in that.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 243, Hackney-road, and a bachelor of medicine of the London University—I was called on the night of 18th, to 99, Nichol-square, and found four children in an empty room—Walter was in a very weak state—I saw two children lying by the fire-place on the right-hand side, Walter and Clara—Walter had on what you could scarcely term a covering, an apology for a sheet, and Clara was per<lb></lb>fectly naked, nothing at all on—there was a thin piece of blanket covering both—under the window on the left, there was another child, Alfred—he had very little covering indeed: a little piece of flannel over him—Walter was breathing laboriously, and he was <hi rend="italic">semi comatose</hi>—you could scarcely understand what he said—he seemed to be dying—I directed them to be taken to the workhouse—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb></lb>amination—I think on the following Saturday—there was no disease of any organ of the body—the cause of death was from effusion of serum into the three great cavities of the body, the head, chest, and abdomen—debility, and great weakness especially, would produce such an effusion of serum—absence of food would produce that—there was a little fluid in the stomach—that would be accounted for by a small quantity of beef-tea and wine—I examined the bowels carefully—there was scarcely anything in them—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110132"></xptr>
               <p>cause of death was from debility, and from the absence of all disease in the body, I could only form the opinion that that arose from want of food—that is my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I would rather read from what you swore at the police-court; is this true; "I ground my opinion that the child died from privation, from the state of the room, and the state I found the children in, and from what I have heard in conversation?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say that, but it is a very foolish statement—I was a little nervous at the time—I did not form my opinion from what I saw—I have not spoken to the attorney about this—I was not told by anybody that my evidence was not strong enough to convict him—that answer was given at the police-court without sufficient thought—I could not have formed my opinion from what I have heard—I have been examined before in a Court of justice—I was once in this Court, in a case of stabbing—I think I was the only doctor examined—I have been in dirtier houses than this one, but this one was quite empty, no furniture—the children did not complain to me of wanting food—I did not ask them—effusion occurs occasionally in children who are constitutionally weak, but not to the extent I found in this case—if I had found this very child in a gentleman's house, in bed, and clean, and had afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I certainly should have said that the death was caused by starvation, if I found the same symptoms which I found in this child after death—I might perhaps be more careful in giving my opinion—effusion is the flowing of the serum into the cavities—it may occur and yet not cause death, but not to this extent—it may occur from constitutional debility, but not to the extent I found it here—the state in which I found the child could not have been caused by constitutional weakness—it could not have been caused by anything but privation—either of them will cause effusion of serum—I do not think I was pressed before the Magistrate about the food in the stomach—I did not go fully into the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination then—Dr. Clark gave his evidence first, and I was asked whether I agreed with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever hear, or know at all, of a case of a child dying in this way, except from want of food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you say, in common parlance, that the child died of starvation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that would be the form of disease which an insuf<lb></lb>ficient quantity of food would cause—if a child was fed with meat and pudding on the Sunday, I should not expect its death on the following Wednesday in this way at all—suppose it had milk on the very day that I saw it, that would not alter the case materially—no doubt the effusion was in existence then—it might have been so on the Sunday—it could not have gone on for three or four mouths; three or four weeks we will say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer of the St. Leonard's, Shoreditch workhouse—four children were brought in there very early on the morning of 19th April—I went there directly, and saw Walter—his body was generally puffy and dropsical—he was breathing with great difficulty—he was insensible, or almost so, except when roused, and he would give an in<lb></lb>coherent answer—he died within thirty hours after his admission into the workhouse; early on the morning of the 20th—the last witness and myself made a post-mortem examination—there was no disease of any organ what<lb></lb>ever—I attribute this puffyness which I observed to dropsical effusion—effusion of serum into the various cavities of the body—debility was pro<lb></lb>duced by effusion, and there being no disease, I believe the debility arose from privation—there was a small quantity of fluid contents in the lower</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110133"></xptr>
               <p>bowels—after his admission, I directed that a little beef-tea and wine should be given—that would account for the quantity of fluid that was found—the muscles were generally in a pale condition, and somewhat emaciated—the other children were getting better when I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not say a word before the Magistrate about the state of the stomach, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if I am not questioned, I do not give an answer—this is the first time I have been asked the question—I told counsel about it this morning—the question was put to me before the Magistrate, "Was it a likely case to arise from privation?"and my answer was, "Yes"—I still say I believe it was from no other cause—this effusion never arises from constitutional weakness under such circumstances, there being no disease to be traced in this child's body—if a child was of a weak or scrofulous habit, then it would be shown in the stomach—you might have mesenteric disease, disease of the heart, or disease of the lungs—where the effusion is from constitutional disease, or from scrofulous habit of body, you would also find signs of it in the body—there is always some disease to account for it—there must be a cause for every effect—as a law there is no such thing as con<lb></lb>stitutional weakness without some actual disease—there are some exceptions—if I found this effusion of serum in a child, knowing nothing of it, I should not immediately presume it was from starvation, but there being no assignable cause for death, I should then unquestionably attribute it to that cause which I have mentioned—the circumstances the child had been in, would not have any effect whatever—there are no causes that would produce de<lb></lb>bility that are not discoverable on the post-mortem examination—it is possible and barely possible, but not in my experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would mesenteric disease in all forms be traceable in the post-mortem examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would; we should see it in the glands and in the bowels—mesenteric disease is where the mesenteric glands do not take up the nutriment—there was no trace of mesenteric disease here—there is not always inflammation of the stomach with mesenteric disease.</p>

               <p>a case of gin, and put it in his room—I went to the hold and brought up the gin—Higgins and Williams had then left the ship—about 7 o'clock Williams came back alone—he told me to open the gin; it was nailed down—on my breaking it open, he went into his room and took the bottles out of the case, and told me to take the case forward—I don't know how many bottles the case contained—I don't know what he did with them; I suppose he put them in his chest—he afterwards went on board the <hi rend="italic">Snapdragon</hi>, and took two bottles of gin with him—about twenty minutes afterwards, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Snapdragon</hi>—it was lying near us—there was a brig be<lb></lb>tween us, I believe—when I went on board I found Higgins and Williams; Schultz was not there—I saw some bottles of wine and two bottles of gin on the table—the bottles of gin had the same mark as those which had been in the case—about twenty minutes past 9 o'clock, Mews came to the cabin door, and Williams gave him a bottle of gin.</p>

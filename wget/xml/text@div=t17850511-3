               <p>Were they all women that came in, or men? - I am sure I heard three men's voices, they came round me, with their hands on my pocket, and took from me a ten pound bank note, I believe the number on the bank-note was 4,400, and seven guineas in gold, and some silver, about fifteen shillings, but I cannot be sure to the quantity of silver, and a bad sixpence.</p>

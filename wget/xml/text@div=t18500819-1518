                  </hi>. I keep the Boston Arms, Boston-street. Lague was my potman—on Monday, 8th July, the prisoner, who I know by sight, came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—he had been drinking—he went into the tap-room and sat down—he had nothing to drink at my house—about five or ten minutes before twelve, I went into the tap, found him there, and shook him—a man assisted me in getting him out, and I inquired of several people where he lived—they said, "Close by," but that my man knew best—Lague, who was out, came in just then, and I requested him to assist the prisoner home—he got him by the arm and said, "Come along Charles," or <hi rend="italic">"Charley"</hi>—I believe they had been schoolfellows together—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190124"></xptr>
               <p>Lague laid hold of him in a friendly way—they got outside, and the prisoner got hold of him in some way, knocked him down, and struck his head on the pavement—Lague's cap fell off in falling—I assisted him up, he was bleeding very much, and he was taken by Angel in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Dispensary—I do not know whether Lague was intoxicated or not, he had been out an hour and a half, and I had hardly spoken to him—he walked quite straight, I did not see anything to make me think he was drunk—the prisoner was taken into custody immediately—Lague was placed under the care of Mr. Buxton.</p>

                  </hi>. I drive my own <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—about twelve o'clock on the night of 8th July, I was on my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming down Boston-street, and just as I approached this public-house I saw Lague come out, leading the prisoner; they were no sooner out than they fell down together—I was not close enough to discern how they fell—Lague was undermost, and the prisoner on the top of him—I jumped off my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> instantly, and tried to get hold of Lague, and before I could do so the prisoner struck his head on the stones—I and another man caught hold of the prisoner and dragged him off—a constable arrived; we put something at the back of Lague's head to keep the blood from flowing, took him to the Dispensary in my <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I waited outside till he came out again—he was put into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and I took him home to his mother, whom he lived with—it was then half-past one—the prisoner was drunk, and Lague was senseless from the wound, I cannot say whether he was the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended Lague—he had received a very severe contused wound at the side of his head, which was bleeding profusely—the skin was broken in several places—there was partial concussion of the brain—he was perfectly insensible, incoherent, and scarcely knew what he was talking about—I considered the wound dangerous, as I did not know what the result would be—the next day he was better—two days after I was obliged to bleed him—hæmorrhage of the brain came on, and after<lb></lb>wards erysipelas—at one time his life was despaired of for four days—he is still weak, and not able to follow his employment.</p>

On Sunday morning, 14th April, about 10 o'clock, my hnsband and the prisoner had a few words, and she used very bad language, but nothing more after that till about quarter or twenty minutes to 8 o'clock that night, when she came with her husband down the court where I live—she came to my door and called me out—I went and opened the door and she hit me—I went back and defended myself as Well as I could—she then took up a large scraper to throw at me, and her husband took it from her—she then took the tea-kettle of water and threw it, and struck me on the forehead—I was in the hospital three weeks or a month.</p>

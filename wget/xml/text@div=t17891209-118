               <p>On Saturday, the 7th of November, about half past six in the evening, I lost a piece of timber, called Peterburgh plank, worth about three shillings; Mr. Day, a carpenter, sent to inform me that one of his men had robbed me of a piece of timber, which is the prisoner; I went; and Mr. Day and myself went to a house in Newton-street, there we saw it in a basement story of the house, locked up; in consequence, we went to Justice Walker's, and took out a warrant; and with two of his men brought it to his office in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury; we left it there, and went and apprehended the prisoner, at the Marlborough Arms: he was secured, and took to the office, and from thence to prison.</p>

               <p>As I was returning from my work, on the 7th of November, I overtook the prisoner with a piece of timber, resting upon a post; I thought it was my master's property; I am a servant to Mr. Day; I let the prisoner pass, and walked on behind him; and saw whom the man was, and knew whose timber it was; I followed him from there into Newton-street; he laid it down on the curb stone, and went down into a cellar, and spoke to a man, who came up immediately with him, and carried the quartering into the cellar; and then this Norton came up, and went about his business: I immediately went down the cellar, and told the man to keep that timber, and let nobody have it, for it was stolen; I immediately came up and told my master, who sent me to Mr. Allanson: I am sure it is the same timber,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090124"></xptr>because I put some marks on it, which are there now.</p>

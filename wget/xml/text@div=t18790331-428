                  </hi>. I am keeper to Mr. Robert William Webb, Lord of the Manor of Witley, in the county of Surrey—on 9th March I saw some fires burning on the common—I went to find a friend, Mr. Budd—I went in front of the Red Lion public-house, about 10 o'clock; I saw Alan Mitchell there, and heard him use the expression that he would burn the b——common out—I then went and concealed myself a little distance from the Hammer Ponds, about half a mile from the public-house—I saw the fires burning from the direction of the public-house all along the road—I saw the prisoner and two other men, Keen and Elwyn, coming along the road towards the Hammer Ponds; they came close to where I was watching—I heard Keen say, "Don't do it, Alan, you are a fool if you do, there is some one watching?"—the prisoner then stepped back in the road for a few seconds, he then came towards the bushes, a little above where he was the first time, and I moved from the place where I was watching close where he came across, and I distinctly saw him take the matches from his clothes, light them, and put them into the bushes, and light the bushes in several different places—I was a little over two yards from him at the time, not three yards—the common was burning in six or seven different places at that time—I said to him," Alan, what are you doing this for? are you not right now?"—he did not make any reply—I told him he would hear of it—Keen came up at the time and said, "If we put it out, I suppose that will do?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been out nearly all the evening; I left home just before seven—no fires were burning at that time—there was one fire between 7 and 8, but not in the Milward Manor—our manor is the Witley Manor; it is all the same, some call it Witley and some Milward, they are not in different parts, they are both in one; it is in Milward Manor—I saw one fire in the Pepper Harrow Manor a little after seven—some of the fires burnt up nearly close to the Red Lion—the fire at Pepper Harrow was nearly a mile from the fire I saw burning at Witley—there was</p>

               <p>a fire burning before ten against the Red Lion—I saw several men outside the Bed Lion at the time I saw the prisoner; it was about closing time—they close at ten, that made me think it was about ten, as the land<lb></lb>lord was closing his house—several of the men who came out of the Red Lion came down the road, but they were not down where I saw the fire; there was Keen and Elwyn and the prisoner, them three—I saw Keen a little distance from the Red Lion—I saw several men down the road, I don't know whether they had been in the Red Lion or not—it was about 11 o'clock when I saw the prisoner light the furze—the night was very moonlight, and the fires round were nearly as bright as day; there were over 7 or 8 fires burning between 10 and 11 o'clock—at the time I saw him there there were 6 or 7 fires buring in different places, most of them alight at the side of the road—Budd was with me during the time I saw the prisoner, but he was not so close as I was quite when I saw him—I was a little more than two yards from him when I saw him set it on fire—I cannot say exactly how far Budd was from me; several yards, four or five, or five or six when we were concealed in the furze—I was concealed close to the road, close to the bank at the side of the road, when the prisoner came first I was not a yard from him—I know one bush that he set on fire, and was scorched and put out—it was about 8 feet from the road where he set it on fire; not so far where it was put out—a man walking along the high road would be about 8 feet from where he set it on fire—where the fire burnt to was not so far as where he set it on fire, because it burnt down the bank towards the road, where they put it out—I have resided at Thursley all my life—I only know two men there called Alan—I have hoard of a madman who is called Alan, but he was not there at the time—it is not a very common name in that part of the county.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and Keen and I walked down the road to<lb></lb>gether from the Red Lion—we were close to the prisoner when he was making water, we never left him, we were three or four yards in front of him; I turned round and saw him—I can swear we were not so yards ahead of him—I was not called before the Magistrates at Guildford, this is the first time I have been examined in this matter—it was not in our direc<lb></lb>tion home to go down to the Hammer Ponds, we walked down to see the fire—I did not light any of the fires, most decidedly not; I can answer for myself and I did not see tho rest.</p>

               <p>three or four yards behind us—Lilly white seemed to come from the direction of the cross-road; ho might come through the furze, he came to the turn<lb></lb>pike and then turned back to the cross-road—he was not at the Bed Lion with us, he was at the Half-Moon in the afternoon, before the fires were lit up; I was not at the Half-Moon—some people came from there and said there was a fire on the common—I saw Lilly white in the road just before, perhaps about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, he walked down with Bampton and his wife from Hammer Ponds—I did not see him come up from Hammer Ponds, but he must have come up from there—they were going back towards the Ponds when I saw him first—he passed us as we were standing in the road looking at the fires; it was after that that he spoke to the prisoner, I could not say how long after—sometimes we walked a little way, then stopped to look at the fire—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to Lilly white when Lilly white spoke to him—I was in company with Keen at the Bed Lion—I came with Keen and the prisoner nearly to the Ponds; Lilly white did not come with us from the Bed Lion—when we got near the place where the cross-road is we saw some one we thought was Lilly white come up in the road; he came from the same side that he came out of afterwards, he did not come from the cross-road to the turnpike, he came from the bushes—he came out of the road into the turnpike, and went back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say positively that I never set fire to the fume, and I never saw anybody esle; if either Keen or the prisoner had done it, I must have seen it—I knew Lillywhite before, and knew he was the keeper.</p>

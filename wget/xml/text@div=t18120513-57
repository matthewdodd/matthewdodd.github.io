            . I am a constable of Harrow. I, by the order of Skins, about nine o'clock, went to the place where the lead was. I kept behind the hedge, about twenty yards from the place where the lead was concealed. I could see what passed. In about three hours afterwards Jackson came by with his cart loaded with sash-frames. He was going to Mr. Gray's, Wemley-park. In about an hour after he came back with his cart. Dyke came with him. Jackson stopped his cart. They both went to the place where the lead was, and Dyke brought the lead forward, and by the assistance of Jackson they put it in the cart. Jackson went on with his cart. Dyke stopped where the lead was: he seemed to be searching for something that he could not find. I stepped from my hiding-place, and took Dyke in custody. I asked Dyke, where he got that lead from that he had put in the cart. He said he knew nothing about any lead. I then followed the cart, with Dyke in custody. Jackson stopped before we came up. I asked Jackson how he came by the lead. He got into the cart and threw the four pieces out.</p>

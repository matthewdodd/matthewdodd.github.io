               <p>Q. What have you to say, with respect to the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Steers. There were two of them, this other Lad saw them, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Steers. About half an Hour after. As soon as I came down Stairs this Lad told me he saw two Men come out of that House; and he said, I know one of them extremely well. I ask'd his Name, and he said, his Name was 
               <persName id="t17471014-34-person386">

As soon as the Prisoner saw me he went away with a little Confusion, and I went after him and laid hold of his Collar. He said, what is the Matter? I said, I believe you are concerned in taking some Lead. He said, he was not. He was committed that Night to the Compter.</p>

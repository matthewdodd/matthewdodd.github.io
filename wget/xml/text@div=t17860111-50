             sworn.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of the robbery, I am apprentice to Mr. Stock, on Sunday the 24th of December, between five and six in the evening, a customer came into the shop and I waited upon her, and another came in after this, immediately after this man came in, the other two was in the shop; the prisoner enquired if Mr. James lived there, I replied no, and immediately turned round to ring the bell to give my master notice there was another customer in the shop, in the mean time the goods were missing, I turned round as soon as I had rung and he was gone out of the shop, and missing things off the compter I immediately called after him, I missed nineteen callico gown pieces, five yards and a quarter in each, they had been laying in one bundle, they had been taken out of the window, I cannot say I saw him have the things, because he was in such a position I could not see him have them, I went to the door and a number of people came round the door, and some said he went one way and some another, he got off, and he was taken on the Monday morning, I have never seen him before to my knowledge, he was not five minutes in the shop.</p>

               <p>Did he do any more than ask if Mr. James lived there? - I did not see him do any thing, he just came into the shop and touched his hat, and asked if Mr. James lived there, then I turned round to ring the bell, and I turned round again and he was going out of the shop.</p>

               <p>Can you undertake from the glimpse you had of this man to swear he was the same person? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Were the things ever found again? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I went to the prosecutor's shop, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110137"></xptr> there when this man came into the shop; another gentlewoman came in after me, and asked for a bit of cloth, and the prisoner came in and asked if Mr. James lived there, and the boy said no, I turned my head and saw him, he was carrying off the piece, he had the piece in his hand before, I think the prisoner is the very same.</p>

               <p>Can you undertake to swear positively? - I have no doubt at all, I am very apt to look at a person, it is very foolish of me to do so, I did not see him take the piece, but I saw him removing something away, and going out, I have no doubt but he is the same person.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was taken up on Monday, nothing was found upon him, I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment, I saw them three minutes before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of it than a child unborn, I was at a public-house in the same street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

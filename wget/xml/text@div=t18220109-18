On Sunday, the 6th of January, about a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning, he came to my house. I desired Cox to conceal himself, and watch him; about ten minutes after, I was told he had left the house. I opened the door and called him back, but he would not return - we pursued, and overtook him; we found two mould candles in his hand - Cox said he had 3 lbs. of candles in his pocket. We took him up a court in a cellar, in one of the houses there, and in a copper, we found 3 lbs. of candles. He begged very hard to be let go, and said he would resign his commission and leave the country.</p>

I found the 3 lbs. broken to pieces.</p>

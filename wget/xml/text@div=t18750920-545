                  </hi>. I live at 9, Elizabeth Place, Webber Row, Waterloo Road, and am the wife of Samuel Tubb, a painter—the prisoner lives at No. 17—on Monday evening, 16th August, I was passing his door between 9 and 10 o'clock, with Mrs. Cook—the prisoner was standing at his garden gate and made use of fearful language towards me—he put up his fist and hit me—my husband was sitting at the door, and I called to him to protect me, he came up and I went indoors—the prisoner said if he did not do something for me someone else should before the week was out—nothing more occurred until the Wednesday, when my son went and asked the prisoner what he meant by calling me such filthy names—I went up with my son—the prisoner said if he did not go away from the door he would rip his b----bowels out—he shoved him away and they fought—my husband came and took the boy home—about ten or fifteen minutes after wards I sent my little girl for the beer, and I saw the prisoner come rushing down to our place—I said "Shut the door"—he rushed into the house and seized the chair to illuse my son—I put up my right hand and I saw part of a knife in his hand, below his fist, and I received four stabs on my hand—my husband put him outside the door—someone said "Blind her with the lamp," and my husband removed the lamp from the table and put the prisoner out—I went to the station and the inspector ordered me to be taken to the hospital, where my band was dressed.</p>

I am the daughter of the last witness—on Wednesday evening, 18th August, between 8 and 9 o'clock the prisoner came to our house—my brother was indoors—I was outside—I did not go inside at all—I had been for my mother's supper beer, and as I came back I saw the prisoner coming along—he walked till he got to the first gate and he threw off his hat and jacket, and ran down to my mother's door—when he got there father put him out, and I went to shove him again, and I felt some thing like a knife cut my hand—it bled and I screamed—the police came and I was taken to the doctor's.</p>

I am the brother of the last witness and son of the first—on this Wednesday night I went round to the prisoner's house and called him out and asked him why he had insulted my mother and used bad language to her—he said if I was not off from the door he would rip my bowels out—he then made a blow at me and I hit him back—we were parted and I went home—about ten minutes afterwards somebody halloaed out "Close your door, here he comes"—I got up from the chair and he rushed into the house and took up the chair to go to make a hit at me—we made him put down the chair, and somebody said "Blind him with the lamp"—the prisoner had a knife in his hand when he came in, it was hang ing out of his hand—my mother came in and they said "Blind her with the lamp"—he made a stab at me and I went back—my mother put up her hand to save me and he stabbed her in the hand—he struck her hand three or four times—he had the knife in his right hand—he caught my mother by the wrist—my father pushed him out of the house and shut the door.</p>

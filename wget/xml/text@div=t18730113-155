I am a teacher of music at Percy Circus, Pen<lb></lb>tonville—on 28th December I was walking a little behind the prosecutor, who was going along in an inoffensive manner, and just by the Turkish Bath the prisoner seized him by the fez, and clutched his hair at the same time, and with the other hand he grasped at his chain and broke it—they closed and grappled, and rolled in the mud together—the prosecutor then seized the prisoner by the throat, and they went down again—I then got up to them, seized the prisoner by the collar, and Mr. Nash seized him on the other side—in a minute or two two policemen appeared, and we gave him in custody—the prosecutor wrenched his hand open, and a gold ball was found in it—he appeared to have been drinking, but not to excess—he knew perfectly well what he was about.</p>

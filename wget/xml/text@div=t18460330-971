                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Grote, who lives in Clap<lb></lb>ham New-park. On the 13th of March I was going up stairs, about a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner in the hall, with my master's coat on his arm—I called out, and he ran away—I ran after him—he threw the coat down, and ran round the green-house, and made his escape at the front gate—another man stopped him—he is the same person—I saw him take a miniature and case out of his pocket, and throw it over the gate into the garden—I took him into the kitchen and sent for the policeman—this is my master's coat—this is the miniature—I picked it up out of the walk where I saw the prisoner throw it—it is the miniature of my master's youngest brother—this handkerchief and pair of gloves were in the coat pocket.</p>

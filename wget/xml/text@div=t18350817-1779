On the moning of the 3rd of July, at three o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel, about one mile from Eastcheap, and saw he had something bulky in his bosom—I asked what he had got—he said a pair of trowsers which he was going to take to his brother, who was a performer at Fairlop—I opened his bo<lb></lb>som, and found these trowsers—I took him to the watch-house, and found on him these two medals—this handkerchief was round his neck, and these other articles were about him—he burst into tears, and said he had found them.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a warehouse at No. 48 Eastcheap—no one sleeps three—I left it all secure on the evening of the 2nd of July—I went there next morning, and found it perfectly safe on the outside—one of my young men went in, and found the desk broken open, and the papers strewed about—I then missed these articles, which the policeman after<lb></lb>wards borught—they had been locked in my desk the night before—they are pulling down the next house to the warehouse—I consider the person must have got in there, and in at my attic window, which had been boarded up; but one of the boards had been forced down, which would make an aper<lb></lb>ture large enough for a man to get in—the warehouse is in the parish of St. Andrew Husbard.</p>

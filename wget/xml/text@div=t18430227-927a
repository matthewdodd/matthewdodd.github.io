                  </hi>. I am assistant to James Daw, a draper. He had some goods placed outside his shop on the 9th of Feb.—I saw the two prisoners come to the shop—they looked at some silk handkerchiefs, and after looking at them some time, they went and looked at some cotton ones which were close by on the left—they then commenced turning up the silk ones—Hill pulled one of the pieces off the shutter, and it fell down on the ground—I saw her take it in her hand, and challenged her with doing it—she said she was very sorry she did not wish to injure the goods—she then bought a cotton handkerchief, and both went in together to pay for it—when they came out she said she had been in and bought one and paid for it—a person then came up and asked the price of some flannel which I told them—I then turned round and saw Reid with a quantity of silk handkerchiefs in her pos<lb></lb>session—I ran and took them from her hand—she had got about two yards from the shop with them—they were under her cloak—these are them—she was walking off with them—I caught them before they dropped from her hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reid. Q.</hi> Did you not see me pick them off the ground? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—I did not <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> either of you inside the shop—I took you inside.</p>

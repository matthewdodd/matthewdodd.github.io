                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Docks, and live at 92, Pennington-street, St. George's in the East—on Thursday, 31st July, between 10 o'clock and half-past, I was coming through Pennington-court, and two men rushed out, one caught me behind and the other in front—the one behind caught me round the neck with both hands, while the other tried to get my watch out of my pocket, but I put my arm on it and he could not get it without tearing my pocket to pieces—he did tear my pocket, and took my watch—it was silver, and was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never seen it since—the prisoner is the man who was behind and squeezed ray neck tightly—I had a stick with me, with which I struck the man in front—my guard chain broke—the men ran away—I tried to hit the man in front but could not, because the man behind gave me an extra twist, and I could not move—I turned round quickly and saw the prisoner's face—there were two large lamps, one at a public-house, and the other at a sugar-baker's—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—they ran straight down the street and turned down the last turning—that is in the direction of Wellclose-square—the one who had been in front of me, and who took my watch, ran first—I halloed out, "Stop thief!" and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

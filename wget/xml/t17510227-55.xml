I lost the loin of pork from off my stall on Friday was fortnight or three weeks, I cannot directly tell which. I found it upon the prisoner about 10 minutes after in Walbrook. It was a stale loin of pork; I really think he did it for want.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jos. Bentley. I have known the prisoner from a school boy; he has been <rs id="t17510227-55-deflabel277" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I do believe meer necessity caused him to take this stale pork; he has had a very bad sickness, and is reduced greatly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scantlebury. The prisoner lived servant with me almost two years, he was a very honest lad then, and I have been with a master where he lived since, he gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibson. I have known him 7 years; he lived with my brother servant between 7 and 8 years ago. He has a very good character.</p>

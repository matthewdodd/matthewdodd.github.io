               <p>Q. Have you any lodgers - A. Samuel Berry; he was in the house at the time I found the prisoner in in the house. I returned and came in doors about twenty minutes past five; I heard somebody up stairs; I thought it had been my wife. I occupy the ground floor and the first pair of stairs. I heard the noise on the first pair of stairs; I supposed it was my wife. I am positive I latched the door when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave the room door on the first pair of stairs when you went out - A. I shut it on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020039"></xptr>spring lock. That is my bed room. I am sure I shut it when I went out I left my wife in bed; the bed room door lock caught.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a noise up stairs - A. Yes; I called my wife twice, and went up upon the second or third stair. I saw the prisoner coming from my bedroom towards the second pair of stairs. I went up to my bed-room door; I saw the door was open. I looked in the room; my wife was out. I saw the drawers open, and the clothes laid on the table. On seeing the clothes out I went up stairs after the prisoner; I saw him upon the second landing; he was looking to see if I saw him. I went up to him, and asked him who he wanted; he said he was looking for a person of the name of Robertson living there. I had no such person living there. I seized him by the collar, and asked him if he pleased to walk down with me. I took him into my own bed-room, and asked him how he opened the door. He wished me to let him go, and said he was a poor person, just come out of the country; it was distress that induced him to do this. I asked him how he could think of my letting him go, when he had got all my money. He said he would give me all the money he took to let him go. I asked him to hand the money out. and let me see what it was; he took out of his pocket a three-shilling piece, an eighteen-penny piece, three silver tea-spoons, and a pair of ear-rings. These tea-spoons were kept in my wife's trunk, and the three-shilling and eighteen-penny piece were put by for a keep-sake. When he gave me the money I told him he must have more silver of mine. He said he had no more about him. I clapped my hand upon his thigh; I said, you have more money. He said, that was his own; I should not have it. His waistcoat pocket was full of keys. I then said, what a pretty fellow you are to ask me to let you go; you will come before night and take all I have got. I called Berry; he went for a constable, and the constable came and secured him.</p>

            . What time did you leave your bed-room - A. A little before five. I locked my door before I went out; I left the key on the shelf, down stairs. The prisoner was taken away before I returned. My husband found the key on the shelf, where I had left it. There were thirty-nine keys found on the prisoner; one of them opened my door. I tried it, and locked and unlocked it three times.</p>

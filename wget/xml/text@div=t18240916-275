            . I am a veterinary-surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-mews. I saw the prisoner at Wreckin-tavern, in Covent-garden, and had some business with him - he deals in horses, and lives at Kensington. He said he wanted a horse for a gentleman at Streatham of the name of Sewell; I said I had a very clever horse in my stable, if he would give the money; he said that would not be an object if he liked him. I said I could not well send it, but a porter came from him next morning, and I gave him a note to go and get the horse. I was to meet him in the afternoon, at his stables, to settle about it - I met him, and he said he it was a likely horse; he thought it would suit Mr. Sewell, who he expected every moment to try him; I said I would call about one or two o'clock, which I did, and found the prisoner, but the horse was gone. He said the gentleman had rode him, and liked him - if I would meet him at four o'clock he would settle with me. I met him at that time; he said,</p>
               <p>"I can't do it now, I have to go into the City," but if I would meet him at twelve o'clock next day he would settle it; I went, and he again said he was going into the City, I must call at two. I went - he was not ready then, but said he was going to his brother at the Stock Exchange, to receive the money, and if I would meet him at four o'clock he would settle it: he then put me off till six o'clock - I went at six, but he was not ready - I told him I suspected he was not doing right. He then wanted me to wait till Monday, which I refused, and he put it off till the next day, but I did not get it then. I then went to Streatham, but could find no such person as Mr. Sewell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give the prisoner the horse to sell for you - A. Yes, to Mr. Sewell. It belonged to Mr.

I have met him there several times. I had some dealings and conversation with him about two horses of mine: he said he had had horses of Pennington, but I did not say I should be glad to deal with him on the same terms, nor that that was a month's credit.</p>

            . I have seen Mr. Powis and the prisoner together, in conversation, about Mr. Powis's mode of dealing with Mr. Pennington - it was before the prisoner had Mr. Price's horse. Mr. Powis said that if the prisoner could let him have the money in a month or six weeks he should be perfectly satisfied, and it would be better to begin with one or two horses in a small way; this was the first week in 
               <persName id="t18240916-275-person2351">August.</persName>
             I have a distinct and perfect memory about it. I know of no dealings that they had had before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES GIBLING. I am servant to the prisoner. In August last I was present when he talked with Mr. Powis about two chestnut horses. I went with a note to Mr. Powis and fetched them without money: we had them a week or ten days before they were parted with. Mr. Powis came almost every day to see my master. I was sent for to the Wreckin-tavern, where Powis and my master were at dinner. I got an order from them when they were at the Wreckin, and the next morning I got the horse. Mr. Powis came to our stables, I think the next day; he asked how the horse was; I said it looked very well: he said it was seventy-five guineas; the horse was then at the stable, and they talked then about it. There was no other bargain made; it was to be sold by my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. A. When you went to the Wreckin, your master and Mr Powis were at dinner - A. Yes; I do not know what was said before - I do not know Mr. Sewell of Streatham; I went soon after six o'clock next morning, and delivered the note to George, his man; he gave me the horse; it was then put into our stables, and stood there a good while; it never was sold.</p>

On the 2nd of September my cousin went down to Kingston: he continued there till the Monday, when he and his wife returned to town; he has been in town ever since.</p>

At the latter end of July the officer told me there had been some person in our trade robbed, and the articles were offered for sale; I gave directions that if any articles were offered which we sold, to bring them to me - I gave my knife to the warehouseman to mark some juice, and as I thought he did it rather awkward; I said, "Give it me, and I will mark some;" the officer afterwards told me that they had discovered some juice which Hanchett had bought, and he stated before the Magistrate that he bought it of Porratt.</p>

On the 6th of July Hanchett came, and brought to my house 5 lbs. of Italian juice, and asked 1s. a pound for it, as I deal in that article; I knew him before'; he is a hair-dresser- I gave him 5s. for it, and then went to Harrison, and we went together to the prosecutors'; this is the juice, but I never saw it in possession of Porratt.</p>

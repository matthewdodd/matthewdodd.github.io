                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, of 87, Whitfield Street—I was in Whitfield Street on Saturday morning shortly after 1 o'clock—the pri<lb></lb>soner threw me down on my back—I saw him over me and I felt his hand in my right hand trousers pocket—I had in it altogether about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called out "Police," sprang to my feet, and caught him by his coat—he swung round and threw me down again—I got up—he ran away—I shouted "Police" and "Stop thief," and ran after him—a policeman stopped him—I never lost sight of him—I missed a sovereign, three half-crowns, and some shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had been to see a friend in the New Kent Road—I left him a few minutes before 12 o'clock—I had been there about an hour and a half, and had been about an hour walking—I left my work at 8 o'clock—I had been into three public-houses with a friend—the sovereign was a George and Dragon sovereign—I had changed an ordinary sovereign in the Strand—I spent 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bought several things as I went along—I was not talking to a woman—I had an umbrella in my hand—I did not push against the prisoner—I might have been excited.</p>

I was on duty in Whitfield Street on Saturday morning—I heard cries of "Police" and "Stop thief"—I ran to the corner—I saw the prisoner running—I got into a doorway and he passed—I stopped him—the prosecutor came up and said the prisoner had knocked him down and stolen 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his pocket—I took him to the station and found on him one sovereign, one half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one shilling, sixpence, and one penny—the prosecutor appeared exhausted, but to the best of my belief he was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The prosecutor stated he remembered having a sove<lb></lb>reign and four half-crowns—he was excited—he had an umbrella—I did not see a woman there—when the prisoner was charged he said he was wending his way home, he saw the prosecutor talking to a woman and he went up to him and advised him to go home, when the prosecutor ran after him and attempted to strike him with his umbrella—I produce the money—the prosecutor may have been drinking—I did not see him drink.</p>

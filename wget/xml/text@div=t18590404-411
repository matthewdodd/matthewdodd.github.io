I was with William Alfred Bennett in Leicester-place—I remained at Spring-gardens till the establishment was broken up—from long practice, and being at Leicester-place, I was enabled to see patients almost as well as Mr. Bennett—I know Mr. Haynes—I have seen him at Spring-gardens frequently—I have seen him act as Dr. Watters—I believe he was John Gibson Bennett's attorney; and he has seen patients as Dr. Watters—once, about the middle of December, 1857, a lady called; and the door being opened, she was shown to me—she said, "Mr. Colson's assistant?"—I said, "Yes, I was formerly"—she said, "Can I see Dr. Watters?"—I said, "Yes; have the kindness to step up stairs; he will be shown to you"—I communicated to Mr. Bennett that the lady was waiting, and Mr. Haynes was with Mr. Bennett—John Gibson Bennett said, "Then you cannot see this woman?"—I said, "No"—"Neither can I," said he; and the question was put to Mr. Haynes, "Will you oblige me, my dear</p>

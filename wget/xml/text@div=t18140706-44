On the 23rd of June, the prisoner came blusteringly hallooing out, Millwood, Millwood, give me change for a two-pound note; when he hallooed out the name of Millwood, my husband was not at home; he called at the door; I came to the door to give him two one-pound notes, all that I had. I received of him a two-pound note, apparently, in return. I put the note I received of him into my pocket book; there was no other note there; he said, at the time that I gave him the change, Mr. Powell, I am coming. I went to the door, and saw him go to Mr. Powell. Mr. Powell lives at the next door to me. As I had seen the prisoner several times before, I wondered where he lived. This attracted my attention. I took particular notice of his person. I kept the note in my pocket-book until about ten o'clock at night. Mr. Millwood came home; I gave it him to buy fish the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of anything that passed did you see the prisoner on the next day - A. In the course of the next day I had suspicion that the note was a forged one. Before that suspicion had arisen, the prisoner passed my door. About ten minutes before word was brought me, he stood and stared at me. I thought him a gentleman; I curtsied at him, thinking him a gentleman. On the next Saturday, at half after three o'clock, I saw the prisoner walk before me in Thames-street; I went up to him and tapped him on the shoulder; I said he was the gentleman I was looking for; he said he knew nothing of me. I took hold of his collar, and said he must go with me. He offered to put his hand into his pocket; he said if two pound was any object, he would give me two pound, or any money that he had; he pulled out a handful of notes, a good many. I then told him if he gave me the King's dominion I would not take it; he then put them in his pocket. I said he must go with me. When I got into Little Trinity-lane, where I live, he ran away; there he set off running; I called out, stop thief; my husband heard me; he came to my assistance; he and Mr. Powell together took the prisoner into custody; they brought him to my house. I fetched a constable myself; his name is

I brought him back to my house; he asked me for a pint of water, which I gave him; he then wanted me let him go; he offered me two pound to let him go, and some more money that he had got in his pocket if I would let him go. I gave him in charge of a constable.</p>

He went to the next door, and asked that lady to change him a two-pound note. My shop is next door; he spoke loud enough for any body to hear at the next door. Before he went from me the first time, he apologised for disturbing me at my dinner. In about two minutes, he came back again, and asked me if I knew any body in the name of Robinson; I told him I did not recollect any body of the name of Robinson.

Mrs. Millwood pointed him out as the person that had given her the two-pound note. I asked him if he had done so; he said, he never gave her any note; he had no such transaction at all. I searched him. I found good notes upon him, which I gave to Mr. Lees, to the amount of ten-pounds about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there about him a two-pound note - A. There was. I found a key upon him; I asked him what it was the key of; he said it was the key of his chest. I asked him where he lived; he said, No. 5, Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane. I told him his house must be searched; he said, it would alarm his wife; he would send her a note, desiring her to let the house be searched. In consequence of that, he wrote this note in my presence, and directed it Mrs. Mitchell, No. 5, Greystoke-place, Fetter-lane.</p>

The good notes were altogether in a small piece of parchment; I think forty pounds, or thirty-eight pounds; I cannot recollect which. I looked then at the clothes in the chest; I felt the flaps of the coat pockets; there were four or five coats. I felt something in the pocket flaps of three of them; the coats are here; I found in this coat eight two-pound notes, slid in between the lining and the outer part of the coat; this was only in one flap.

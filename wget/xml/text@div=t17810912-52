On the 13th of September, I went to Deptford, to receive six months pay, due to me from the Greenwich man of war; after that, I returned between eleven and twelve at night; going along the Strand, I met the prisoner, near the New-Church; I returned back with her to Mr. Davis's, the One-Bell Inn; we went up into a room together; I called for some rum, which I paid for; she then asked me for a present; I gave her half a crown; we went to bed together; the candle was almost out; the prisoner bid me not put it out; I fell asleep in three minutes: I had put my breeches under my head.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes: I had drank nothing but sixpennyworth of rum and water, and a pint of beer, when I went to bed: I had seven guineas in my pocket; I had counted it in my pocket, just before I met the prisoner. No person was near me, so as to have taken this money, nor was I in any situation afterwards, so that it could have fallen out of my pocket, between the time I counted it, and my going to bed. I was waked by the waiter, about two in the morning; he asked me if I had lost any thing, and he brought the prisoner into the room. I then examined my breeches pockets, which were still under my head, where I put them, and found that out of seven guineas, five were gone: I examined all round the bed, to see if any had dropped, but I found none. I told the waiter I had lost five guineas: the prisoner strongly denied the charge; the watchman was sent for, and she was carried to the watch-house, and there searched; and the five guineas were found concealed in her shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you took up your breeches, whether the money did not fly about the room? - It did not. No money flew out of my pocket.</p>

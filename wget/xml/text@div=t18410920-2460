                  </hi>. I keep the King's-head public-house in Colt-street, Limehouse—the prisoner was my cook. In the afternoon of the 19th of Sep<lb></lb>tember I heard her and the pot-boy quarrelling—on going into the kitchen to see what it was about, I found the prisoner was in liquor, and ordered her out of the kitchen—she would not go—I was obliged to take her by the arm and put her into the back kitchen—I found she was leaning her head over the sink, and intoxicated—she could not stand—my attention was drawn to a pint pot standing in the kitchen—I took it up and found in it some gin and peppermint—I asked her in the policeman's presence where she got the gin and peppermint—she said one of the bar<lb></lb>men gave it to her—I have three bar-men—I called them into her presence—they all denied it—I gave her in charge for being intoxicated—the policeman pro<lb></lb>duced two bottles, one containing rum, and the other gin and peppermint—I believe it to be mine from its taste—I know the bottles—there is the remains of a label on one—I had the bottle in the bar on the Saturday night, and I had missed it—I charged the prisoner with stealing them—I after that, with the assistance of an officer, searched her box and found some soap, some cigars, some cheroots, some arrowroot, coffee, tea, and sugar—the name of our grocer was on the papers containing the arrowroot and coffee—the cheroots and cigars were such as I sell, and were tied up as those I sell—I had missed cheroots and cigars—I believe, on my oath, the property found belongs to me.</p>

I know the prisoner; he has been in the employ of the Company as guard, and occasionally as driver of the vans—it was his duty to call for parcels from my office; he was on the extra cart which relieves that portion of the city—it was his duty to present the way bill, and I or my daughter enter it—my daughter occasionally makes out the way bills—this is the way bill (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is made out by my daughter—besides presenting the way bill, the prisoner examines the number of parcels delivered to him, and signs in the book for the number of parcels he receives—on this day the prisoner signed for four parcels, three unpaid, and one paid; it is signed, "J. Bowler"—it is part of my duty to take the particulars of parcels received at my office—the first parcel was a stone bottle and basket, addressed, "Massey, 2, Reading-villas, Islington;" the second was a parcel directed, "Harrisson, 5, Ayle-place, St. John-street;" the third, a hat box; and the 4th, a basket directed to Gilbert, of No. 2, Notting-hill-square—I delivered no parcel addressed to Mrs. Budd or Rudd, Euston station, to be left till called for.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 63). On 14th Oct. the prisoner was given into my charge—I told him that it was for stealing a basket of the Parcels Delivery Company—he said that he had received a basket from the Euston station; that he was taking a walk on Sunday morning, as usual, when a woman came up to him, and asked him if he would go into the luggage office, and get a parcel for her, as she had been there, and could not get it herself; he did not say for what reason—he said, "I went, and got it for her"—he said he had never seen her before; that the parcel had no name or address, but, to the best of his belief, had something sewn over the top.</p>

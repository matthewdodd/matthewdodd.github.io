On the 4th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the room behind my shop, and heard a rattle against the window, and in about two minutes I saw a shoe moving from a shew-board - I immediately ran out, and caught the prisoner with this shoe in his hand - one half out of the broken window, and the other half in; I had seen it a quarter of an hour before - he had entirely removed it from where it laid before; quite so - he had lifted it up, and got it half out of the window - he was pulling it out when I seized him; he said, "I have done nothing - I have just come from work - you are mistaken." I immediately took him to the watch-house, and found a knife on him, which he must have used to break the window; the glass was not broken at all before- his hand must have been inside the window to get the shoe. I sent for his father, and from what he said I was induced to bring him here. There was another boy with him, who ran out of the yard, with the fellow shoe. I found a rule on him, which he said he had found. I produce the shoe which he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming by, and saw two boys whom I knew - they told me they had broken a window; I said, "I will get away, or I shall be taken with you." The gentleman came and caught hold of me, and said, "I have caught you with a shoe in your hand;" I had not touched the window. I picked that rule up in Old-street. Several people said I was not the boy who had been seen about there. I never touched the shoe - I could find the boy who broke the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Bishop's-court, Old Bailey. I am a journeyman shoemaker—on Saturday night, 15th April, I was in Newgate-market near upon 9 o'clock—there were many people there—I had at that time a purse in my waistcoat pocket—it contained eleven shillings, two half crowns, and a sixpence—I had seen the purse two minutes before, as I came out of my own door, which is but a short distance from the market—as I was walking through the market, the prisoner was coming in front of me coming towards me, and in passing he put his fingers into my pocket and drew out my purse—I saw him do that, and I was trying to get hold of him as fast as I could through the crowd—I caught him a few steps from where I was when he took the puree—it was at the corner of a turning—he turned the corner, and I caught hold of him—I never lost sight of him—when I took him, I asked for my property—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "What you have taken from my pocket; my purse and my money"—he said, "You villain, what do you mean by charging me with robbing you?"—I said, "Certainly I do; you have got it about you now"—he said, "I have got nothing of yours; you let me go; fetch a policeman, and search me"—I told him "No," it was not likely that I should do that—a policeman came up after about two minutes; he asked me what was the matter—I told him that the party had robbed me of my purse, and I gave him into custody—as we were proceeding to the station, the beadle of the market said, "Give him room, and watch his hands; the money will be dropped, no doubt;" and I saw the prisoner put his left hand to his right side pocket, he drew out his hand, pulled out a purse, and dropped it down—I spoke to the policeman, and picked it up—it was my purse, and it had the money in it when it was examined at the police court—when I picked it up, the policeman took it from my hand.</p>

               <p>my son was in custody—when he was taken several persons came and told me—I heard of my son being taken the first day it appeared in the paper—my son brought the paper—I went to Mr. Pavey to ask him how my son came to rob him—I cannot read, my son read the depositions to me—I had heard the statement how my son came to rob him; I could hardly believe it—I wished to know the truth—I had seen my son before I went to Mr. Pavey's on the Thursday morning, in Newgate—when I went to Mr. Pavey's the young woman said there might be work—I went to Mr. Pavey to know how it was—I did not say I was the mother of the person who robbed him, I did not like to say so—I had no work for him—when he came the next day, the Friday, my daughter was there—she is seventeen—she is not here—I did not know that I wanted her—when Mr. Pavey came, I clasped my hands, and said, "Good God! how did my son come to rob you?"—my son had denied it, and said he had never done such a thing—I did not say it was a false charge—I said, "It lies between you; I can't tell whether it is true or not"—I heard my son was charged with robbery from the newspaper, three days before I fetched the depositions—I can and do swear that I did not know my son was in custody till I heard it from the newspaper—two or three told me, but I did not believe it—he was taken on the Saturday, and one of my children came to my house, and I said I did not believe it—I do not know whether it was Sunday or Monday that I first heard my son was in custody—I first heard it for sure from my son bringing the newspaper—I did not know for sure that my son was in custody before I heard it from the newspaper—I have five sons—the prisoner's brother is living with me—his brother told me of it first, when he read it from the paper, and he said he heard it before—he believed it far more than I did—his brother might be at the station on the night when he was taken into custody—he would not tell me to frighten me—he told me that he had seen his brother at the station—it was 10 o'clock.</p>

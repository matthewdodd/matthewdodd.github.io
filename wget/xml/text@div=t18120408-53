               <p>Mr. Challenor. That is not the time you lost the bundle - A. No; I lost the bundle between seven and eight at night; Anthony Musson took the bundle from between my legs, and handed it to Higginbottom, Higginbottom gave it to a boy, he ran away with it; I demanded my bundle, Higginbottom said if I said three words more he would have my life; I procured two constables; we had a coach, and then we took the prisoner to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in your bundle - A. Eleven waistcoats, two pair of braces, and nine handkerchiefs; I never saw my goods again.</p>
               <p>Q. This took place in a public tap-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober - A. Yes, I was, because I had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the landlord you would make him pay for it - A. Yes, and right, if any man takes away another man's living.</p>

               <p>Mr. Challenor. The boy that took the bundle was not in Higginbottom's company, was he - A. No, he was sitting in a distant part of the room, and Musson was sitting on the other side of the table, eating pickled sprats.</p>

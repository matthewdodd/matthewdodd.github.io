             sworn. - Q. Do you remember, on the 26th of December, meeting with either of the prisoners any where? - A. Yes, between twelve and one o'clock at night, in <placeName id="t18040111-57-crimeloc343">Parker's-lane, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No, I did not know either of them before; Brown came up to me, and put his handkerchief into my face, and Brewster came up directly in the front of me; Brown pretended to wipe my face, because the night was wet, it rained; Brewster then snatched the watch out of my pocket, and ran away; I pursued him till the watchman caught him; one went one way, and the other the other; I cried out stop thief, all the way into Drury-lane, till the watchman stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch? - A. No, he was searched at the watch-house, but the watch was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. While the handkerchief was over your face, how did you know it was Brewster that took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110037"></xptr>the watch, you could not see him? - A. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. Moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other man taken? - A. He followed us to the watch-house, and I knew him, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you sure it was Brown? - A. I saw two men come up to me, they spoke to me about the weather.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you before they put the handkerchief to your face? - A. Two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing for those two minutes? - A. Sitting still.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go on, you said you were going home? - A. They came before me, and I stared and looked at them; I did not mind that they were thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it rain at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it could not be moon-light? - A. It was not dark.</p>
               <p>- BUCKLEY sworn. - On the night of the 26th of December, a little after twelve o'clock, I heard a hue and cry out of Parker's-lane into Drury-lane; I turned round, and saw the prisoner, Brewster, running, but not very fast, however it was fast enough to make me think it was after him the hue and cry was, and I went after him, and stopped him; the prosecutor came up directly, and told me he had robbed him of his watch; I took him to the watch-house, and he was searched, but no watch found upon him; the prisoner, Brown, followed us, as it were, to prove an alibi for the prisoner, Brewster, to clear him of the charge; but Barry made one against him, and charged him as an accomplice, and he was taken into custody also.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barry.) What was this watch? - A. An old-fashioned silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it thrown away or dropped? - A. No, only by all accounts, Brown made away with it before he came after Brewster; they seemed so close against one another, one made off one way, and the other the other.</p>
               <p>Brewster's defence. I was going home to my sister's, and the watchman laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I went to the watch-house to see what was the matter, and the prosecutor said I was concerned; if I had been guilty of the robbery, I should not have been so foolish as to go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckley.) What sort of a night was it? - A. Rather a rainy night.</p>
               <p>Q. Parker's-lane is not much lit up with lamps? - A. Sometimes they were lit, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see a man's face to know him? - A. I think it was; it appeared to me that the prosecutor was in liquor, and since he has been enquiring of me about it, as much as if he did not recollect.</p>

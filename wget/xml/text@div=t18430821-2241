                  </hi>. I live in Chequers-square, Aldgate, and have been porter at a box-maker's; I have known the prisoner about twelve or fourteen months. On the 8th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, I met him near Aldgate-church—he asked where I was going—I said to look after work—he said he would give me a day's work, if I went with him—he took me to Brick-lane, Whitechapel—he went into a plumber's shop, and brought</p>

On Tuesday forenoon, the 8th of Aug., Ince brought this paper—we had had five before in the same hand<lb></lb>writing, and had received orders from Mr. Goulder to detain any person bringing them—the prisoner had brought four, and a strange man a fifth which had all been successful—I told Ince I would go and fetch the lead—a policeman was fetched, and Ince given into custody—he said Mr. Goulder's foreman had given him the paper, and was waiting for him at the corner of the street—he had a paint pot when he came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Blackfriars-road. On the 8th of July, about ten o'clock in the evening, I observed two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> coming abreast down Blackfriars-road, towards the Elephant and Castle—they were coming, according to my judgment, at from twelve to fourteen miles an hour—the horses were at full gallop—the drivers were flogging their horses—the one that drove the grey horse hit it twice as they passed my door—I observed a female crossing the road, and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the grey horse knock the woman down—I imagine it was done with the shaft—it appeared to me so—the woman lay between the horse and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> passed over her—several people called out to the man to stop, as he had knocked a woman down, but he immediately flogged his horse and went on as fast as he could, and never stopped at all—the woman was picked up and taken next door to me, and then to another surgeon—I do not know who was the driver of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was a grey horse—the other horse appeared a sort of chesnut, and was on the other side of the road.</p>

I was in Blackfriars-road on this night, on the Christ-church side of the way—the same side as Skillecorn—I saw two <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> coming down the road at a very great rate—going at full speed, galloping as fast as they could go—the one with a grey horse was striving to gain on the other, which was on the opposite side of the way when I saw it—I saw a female in the act of crossing the road—she had no sooner entered the road than the grey horse knocked her down; and as soon as the woman was knocked down, the driver hit the horse with all his force two or three times, and by the time the horse got to the spot where I was, I darted into the middle of the</p>

I know Hill perfectly well, and have seen Serjeant on the rank—Johnson has been ostler to Serjeant of late, and the other is what they call a lawyer, or something—I never saw him with Serjeant—on Saturday night, the 8th of July, I was on the stand in Farringdon-street—the prisoners were also on the stand—I heard Hill challenge to race Serjeant from Farringdon-street to the Surrey-gate—they agreed—and each drew up to the curb and took two passengers—the other two prisoners got into Serjeant's, and two others in their company got into Hill's—I saw them leave—Hill returned again, I think, about half-past ten o'clock the same evening, and said to the by-standers, "They have run over a b——old woman, and I turned down a street, by which</p>

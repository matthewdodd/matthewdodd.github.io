               <p>SARAH SAXBY. I am a widow; the prisoner was a neighbour of mine; I <rs id="t18090412-117-viclabel705" type="occupation">go out charing, and take in needle work</rs>

On the 6th of March she came into my room as a neighbour, it was about half past five o'clock; I took out a half-crown piece and eleven shillings and six-pence, she saw me take it out and put it in a housewife, and I put the housewife in a box; the box was not locked; afterwards she saw me put the money and housewife in the box; she bid me good evening. I went out for a quartern loaf; she left me, as I thought. When I came back I met the woman on the stairs; I had been gone about ten minutes. On my going up stairs I heard somebody running down very last; I said who is there; she made a stop, and did not answer; I put out my left hand, and felt her hand in her pocket; finding it was a woman, I said who is it, why not answer; she said Bailey. I asked her why she did not answer when I first spoke to her, she said that her husband and her had some words; I asked her why she did not come and stop in my room and not stop there. When I went into my room, she asked me if I would come down stairs and take a drop of something to drink; I told her no, I was obliged to to her, I did not want any thing; I was going up to my box to put some money in, but I had forgot some butter that I wanted; I came down and went for the butter, and when I went into my room, thinking to put the money in the box, the housewife, instead of being folded as I left it, it was unfolded, and eleven shillings and sixpence was taken out; there was only the half crown left; I said to my child who has been here, and what has become of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child - A. Eleven years old; - the prisoner is the only person that had been in my room that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see where she put it - A. Yes, she put it in the housewife in the box; Mrs. Bailey saw my mother put it in the housewife and put it in the box; Mrs. Bailey bid my mother good night; my mother went out for a quartern loaf, I laid across the foot of the bed because I had the head-ach; Mrs. Bailey came up again, and came in without knocking at the door; she asked me what I laid there for, I said I had the head-ach; she said that is a good girl, lay still; she took something out of the box, kept it in her hand two or three minutes, and then put it in again; I was getting up to look to see what it was; she said lay still; she went out; my mother came home, met her on the stairs, and asked who is there.</p>
               <p>EDWARD THREDWAY. I had a warrant to apprehend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120065"></xptr>the prisoner. I went to her house, she was not at home; the prisoner came down to the office in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six months ago this woman lodged in my two pair front room; then she took a room opposite of my house; she came on Saturday, and asked me to lend her a guinea, to get a gown out of pledge; I could not lend it her. On Monday she said can you lend me your great coat and bonnet, for me to go and receive a pound note; I did; when she came in, she asked me to have something to drink; she came to me in the afternoon, she said it was very cold, and she had sent her little girl to the pawnbrokers with a pound note; I asked her whether she was not afraid of sending her little girl for fear of taking bad money; she replied, she should only have three shillings out of it; and she came in the evening very much intoxicated; she said, I am robbed, I said by whom, she said your daughter, then she said me; I went up to her room and asked the child if she saw me, the child did not answer, the mother answered yes; hearing the officers had been after me, I went up to the office, knowing myself innocent. Every time she is in the habit of taking the money, she always loses the money, she is so much in the habit of drinking.</p>

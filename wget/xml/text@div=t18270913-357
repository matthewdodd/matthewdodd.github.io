            . I am an officer of Smithfield. On Friday the 27th of July, I was on duty in Smithfield - it was horse market day; some man came to me, and asked if I would come to the Ram-yard, and take possession of a horse which they had found, belonging to somebody in the country. I went and found this gelding there, in possession of a man named Clinsey; and from what he said, I went to Dixon's Repository, and from what I heard there, I went there on the Monday at nine o'clock - I left, and went again at ten; I then found the prisoner in custody. I asked him where he got the horse; he said a man met him in the street leading the horse, and asked him to take it and sell it for him, and he would give him 5s. if he would sell it, and bring him the money. I asked the prisoner his name, he said it was Thomas Brown, and that the man who employed him was John Linton, of Church-street, Bethnal-green. I asked where the man was - he said he was waiting for him at a public-house close by - I asked him where the public-house was, and said I would go and take this Linton - he said it was in Beech-street or Barbican, on the right hand side of the way, but he did not know the name of the street, nor the sign of the house; he said he would go and show me; I asked if he could not give me a better description; he then said it was at the Star public-house, in the City-road, opposite the Lying-in Hospital - I asked what sort of a man it was; he said a tall thin man, with drab coat and top-boots - I secured him, and then went to the Star in the City-road; I had some porter, and inquired if they had seen such a person,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130145"></xptr>but they had not. I afterwards showed the same horse to the prosecutor, who claimed it - as I took him down the yard, he said, "I have told you part, I may as well tell you all; my name is Heffield;" I said, "Is it not Thomas?" he said Yes.</p>

            . I am clerk at Dixon's repository, Barbican. On Wednesday, the 25th of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, the prisoner brought this horse to our repository - I entered it in the day book - I asked him what name; he said, "Linton, Church-street, Bethnal-green;" he booked it, "Quiet to ride, and quiet in harness, to be sold to the highest bidder" - it was sold to the highest bidder, at the Friday's sale for 1l. 10s. - it was small and very lean - it was delivered to the purchaser, who paid me for it; he is not here, but I understand he took it to Smithfield - it was knocked down to a Mr. Hedges, but afterwards transferred to Mr. Clansey, who paid me, and took it away.</p>

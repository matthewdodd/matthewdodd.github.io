               <p>JOHN AUDEN. I live with my father, in Homer-street. On the 23rd of April I was sitting at a table in <placeName id="t18320517-208-crimeloc1204">Chalk Farm tea-gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. Now, do you not know that you told her she had better not come here, and that she had no need to care for a subpoena, as it would not be enforced? A. I was at the Yorkshire Stingo last Sunday evening; she there told me that she had to come here - I asked what it was, she said to appear; that was all I said; I may have seen her ten times at McDonald's; she did not tell me from whom the subpoena came, nor what trial it was on Sunday, but I had heard her say at McDonald's that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170101"></xptr>had to appear here - I do not think I told her she had no need to come; the prisoner did not say that it was true enough he had some money of mine, but he should keep it for a treat - my money did not fall out; there had not been a great deal of larking - we had brandy and water, and ale; I paid for some; I think the prisoner paid 6d., and Mitchell paid 6d.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going up to Chalk Farm a little after seven o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of April; I saw a mob - the prisoner was sitting on a grass plot, and the prosecutor standing by, asking him for his money - the prisoner made use of very bad language, and swore he had not got a farthing about him; I took off his shoes, and found in his stockings two half-crowns, which I took through some boles; he made a great deal of resistance - when I found the money he said he was very sorry, and wanted the prosecutor to forgive him; he said he would give him 1l. - he said he knew he should be transported, and it would be a good job for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Do you remember his saying he did not intend to steal it? A. I did not hear that; I recollect his telling the prosecutor they were all friends together - I did not notice any girls there.</p>
               <p>JOHN GAYTON JOLLY (Police-constable S 164). I was on duty near Chalk Farm gardens - I saw the prisoner in custody of Tisdale; I assisted to take him to the watch-house - I said to him, "Don't you think you are a pretty sort of a fellow, to sit with a friend and rob him?" he said,"I did rob him, and it would be the best thing for him and for me to be transported."</p>

             MITCHELL. I live in Frederick-place, Hampstead-road. On the 23rd of April I was at Chalk Farm, with the prosecutor and the prisoner; I had seen the prosecutor before - I went across the gardens to speak to a friend, and saw the prisoner and him quarrelling - I asked what it was about; the prosecutor said he had lost 7s. out of his pocket, and he could not accuse any one but the prisoner; the prisoner was very much intoxicated, and could not say much to him, but kept walking round and round - we had a good deal to drink; I saw the prosecutor at the Yorkshire Stingo on Sunday week, and on last Sunday; I said I was subpoenaed to come here - he said I had no call to come without I liked, but he did not say why; I had seen him a good many times at Mr. Donald's</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the money found? A. No, I did not notice that - I considered it might be done out of a joke; I did not hear the prisoner deny having it.</p>

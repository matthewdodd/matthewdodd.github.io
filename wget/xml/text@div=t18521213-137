                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband; we live at No. 27, Nicholl-street, Bethnal-green. On the evening of 13th Nov. we had been out and had a little drop of something to drink together; I went home before him, and he came about half an hour afterwards, which, was between 7 and 8 o'clock—I was lighting the fire, and my husband said, "Never mind the supper, I will give you your supper"—we had had two or three simple words before that; I had spoken to him, not thinking it would <hi rend="italic">form</hi> to anger; I had not said anything to provoke him; I had done two or three things in the week that caused him to be provoked on the Saturday—he had never acted so before—after he had said this he commenced beating me about the face with his fist—he pulled my cap off, and beat me on the head and the neck—I fell down on my face—I got up, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me down again, because he did not want me to go out—it was when I was</p>

               <p>down he commenced beating me—after I had fallen a second time, I tried to get to the door, and he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me out on to the kerb—it was when I had fallen down the second time that he beat me on the head and face—he beat me with his fist as far as I know; there was something in his hand, but whether he struck me with it or whether it was with his fist I do not know—it was a piece of iron, I believe—after I saw the iron I tried to get out at the door; as I was trying to get out of the door I felt a blow at the back part of my head, which nearly stunned me, and then he pushed me—I fell on the kerb on my back, and after that I knew no more—I became senseless.</p>

               <p>not strike me this blow without any quarrel, but from what words we had in the course of the week, about my parting with the things—we had words several times—I did not get a false key, and take a stove and pawn it—I did not take a stove out of the house while he was away, and pawn it—I did not take the copper out of the place while he was away, and pawn it—he never had a copper in his possession—we never had a copper in that house—I have never been fined before the Magistrate for being drunk—I mean to swear that—I know Worship-street—I was there with my husband—I was not charged there with being drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not your husband obliged to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in consequence of the fine and expenses put on you for being drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of that—I did not pawn somebody else's things—I do not recollect that I was ever charged with pawning any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 7, Old Nicholl-street. On the evening of 13th Nov. I was passing the door of the prisoner's house—I heard a scream of "Murder!" which proceeded from the parlour—the shutters were open, and I looked through the window—I heard the wife scream—I knew the prisoner and his wife before, by their living in the street—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—I saw him knock the woman down—he struck her across the head, and in the face, with a piece of iron—I did not see him do anything else—I went away—I saw her fall from the blow—at the time she fell, the prisoner was by the drawers in the room—I did not see her fall anywhere else before I went away—when I went away she was indoors, lying down by the drawers—I did not see any blood—I went away—I went upstairs, and was called down again, and assisted to take her to the doctor's—she was covered with blood, on the pavement, against her own street door, lying senseless—my dress was very bad with blood in car<lb></lb>rying her—the policeman helped me to take her to the doctor's.</p>

I saw this woman on 13th Nov., when she was brought to the hospital—she had two lacerated wounds on the back of her head, and several contusions on her head and face—her eyelids were closed, she could not see—the upper part of her chest and left side, and just at the point of her shoulder were black afterwards, but did not come black immediately—they were contused wounds—her clothes were all torn off—she appeared sober, but of course was a good deal excited—I never saw a woman's face so knocked about before—I examined the wounds at the back of the head—they were parallel to each other, and were about two inches apart—they might have been inflicted with any blunt instrument—all wounds on the head are dangerous—there was danger of erysipelas, but it did not come on—she was in the hospital from the 13th to the 30th, and was then discharged.</p>

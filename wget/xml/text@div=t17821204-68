            ) were going to breakfast, and I told them how I had been used; they said they were very sorry, they would see if they could hear any thing of them; he said it was better to send for one of the runners at Justice Walker's; by the time he had applied to them the prisoners were taken: I saw them again the afternoon of the next day, I knew Margaret Hall very well, I said the same then I say now; the gold coins and some of the gold rings, and about 20 l. in money, was produced, the Bank note was not produced.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you spend the afternoon before this? - I came up by the coach, I got down at the White Horse-cellar in Piccadilly, I was very much benumbed with cold, I drank several glasses of rum on the road to keep out the cold, then I went and had a pint of beer, and read the newspaper, then I had another.</p>
               <p>Were you not very much in liquor? - Yes, or else I should not have done so, especially if I thought of my property, I never once thought of my property.</p>
               <p>Now after this, you went with this woman to the public house, and drank more there, so that when you went to Dyot-street I suppose you was so much in liquor as not to know what happened to you? - I was rather too much in liquor, or else I should have had more prudence.</p>
               <p>Can you speak particularly to taking out the box, and giving the half guinea? - I remember that exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>Did you know either of these young women at the time? - I never knew them before.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of them so as to know them again, as you was so much in liquor? - That young woman I know exceedingly well.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear positive? - I can, indeed, I said all along that I could swear to that young woman, there were two in the room, and one up and down stairs fetching the liquor, that young woman was one of them; I believe one young woman sat down on, or got into the bed.</p>
               <p>Was that the tall young woman or not? - I cannot swear positively.</p>
               <p>Then how can you swear positively that the tall young woman was in the room at all? - Oh yes, Sir! I remember her being in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room when you went to bed? - I believe she was.</p>

               <p>But you are not sure of that? - I cannot swear positively to that, she was in the room, and was drinking at the public house, and I am sure she and I agreed to go to bed together.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in the room before you pulled out these boxes? - I imagine some time, they were continually asking for more and more to drink, and I found I had no more silver, and I took half a guinea out of the box; I am sure she was with me in the room.</p>
               <p>Can you swear with certainty to her being there any time after you went into the room? - I think, to the best of my knowledge, she was in the room all the time, but I cannot swear for certain.</p>

               <p>Court. The other young woman you say staid all night? - As far as I know, I did suppose her to be there all night; I did not hear any thing of her being gone at all; we do not suffer two girls to sleep with one man; it was the prosecutor's desire that the little one should sleep with him, he told me so: and so I told Hall not to stay; she only came in as an interloper herself, only to drink.</p>
               <p>Did not they all come in together? - Yes, the prosecutor and Sarah was together; and Sarah was to stay with him, as she told me; and Margaret Hall told me she was to have something to drink; she came with them.</p>

               <p>I am a silver-smith, and keep a sale shop in High-street, St. Giles's; I know the prisoners at the bar, they both came to me on Tuesday morning last, between nine and eleven; they pointed to two pair of silver buckles that hung in my window; they agreed to give me 2 l. 16 s. for them; they were all silver, tongues, chapes and all; going to pay for them, they pulled out some foreign coins, which I have in my pocket; they gave me the silver ones, and said, if it was not enough they would make it good; I weighed them, and they afterwards gave me the gold; and I said, with a view to see if they had any more, that they were worth 4 l. (though they were worth 10 l.) they swore an oath, and said, it was very lucky for them, that they had got money coming to them; then I asked them how they came by them, they said they found them between my house, and the church; I told them I must have a more explicit answer than that, or I would stop them; I sent for a constable, and they were taken into custody; we searched them in the shop, and upon them we found about 20 l. or upwards; there was a box found on the shortest, and nine guineas and a half and two shillings on one, I do not recollect which; and 11 l. odd on the other; they rather baffled me at that time, one of them told me a different name than that which she is indicted by now: I am sure to both the prisoners; I received the coins from the tallest, she had the same cloak on she has now, only it was turned lining outwards. (The coins handed up to the court.)</p>

               <p>What are the letters on the buttons? - I cannot say exact, they are not done by me, there is T. H. on them I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me some of the coins. - There is a Hanoverian coin, silver with a horse upon it; there is a gold coin, a very remarkable coin of Charles in armour; there is a Venice coin; there is a Hungarian coin; there are several of King John's coin; that gold coin is virgin gold, it will bend under your fingers like lead; it is a great deal better gold than our guineas: there are some of King John's pennys; there is a seven and twenty, without any particular mark; I brought them up to sell.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these coins. - (Looking at them.) I am sure they are mine, if I was to die this minute.</p>

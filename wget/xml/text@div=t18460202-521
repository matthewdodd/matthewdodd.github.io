                  </hi>. I am a hawker. On the morning of the 16th of Jan., I was at the Grapes, in Farringdon-street, standing at the bar—I had a bundle with me, containing the things stated in this indictment—I left it on a barrel in my sight—I had not seen the prisoner there till I saw him laying his hand on it—I told him the goods were mine, and he drew back—I turned to speak to a man I was in company with—I turned back in about a minute, and the</p>

               <p>prisoner and the bundle were gone—I told the man who was in company with me, to go out at one door, and I went out at another—I did not take the prisoner, but he came back in about twenty minutes—I asked what he had done with the goods—he said he would punch my b—head if I accused him of taking them—I told him to let us have them, and let us have none of his larks—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—I saw my goods again at Guildhall—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Timothy Lynch—we live in Hart-court, Farringdon-street. I have known the prisoner from a child. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 16th of Jan., about eight o'clock, he brought these goods in a bundle to my house—he said he was going to have half a pint of beer, and to take care of them till he came back—he was very much in liquor—he left the goods on the table, and about eleven I took them to the station—I did not open the bundle—it was tied with a knot.</p>

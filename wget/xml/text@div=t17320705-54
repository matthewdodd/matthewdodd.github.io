               <p>Cath. Burkett. Between 10 and 11 last Wednesday Night, as I was going along <placeName id="t17320705-54-crimeloc234">Brownlow-street</placeName>

The Watchman found the Pocket the same Night as he was going 11 o'Clock, but there was nothing in it as he told me. Court. Could you see their Faces plain enough to know 'em again? Burkett. Yes; there was a Glass-Lamp at the Bagnio, and when I came home to St. Giles's, I described them so exactly that they were taken the next Morning, and I went to see them in St. Giles's Roundhouse about 9, and knew them both as soon as ever I saw them. Court. Where is the Cut in your Arm? Burk. Here it is. Court. It looks more like a slight Scratch with a Pin, than a Cut with a Penknife.</p>
               <p>P. Thomas. I'll prove that we were in a House at the Seven Dials when you say this Robbery was done.</p>

            . Mr. Burkell call'd me up about 5 last Thursday Morning, and told me that his Wife had been robb'd, and that he had some suspicion of 2 Men, who he believ'd were sauntring about the Seven Dials. We went to a Brandy-shop and took the Prisoners, who he said answer'd his Wife's Description; she came to see them in the Round-house, and as soon as the Governor of the Round-house shew'd them, she said she could swear to P. Thomas, because he turn'd her round, but she could not swear to Baker, because she did not see his Face. The Prisoners brought a Soldier and a Woman to prove that they were in St. Andrew's-street by the Seven Dials, at a Brandy-shop, at the same time the Robbery was said to be committed; and so the Jury <rs id="t17320705-54-verdict235" type="verdictDescription">

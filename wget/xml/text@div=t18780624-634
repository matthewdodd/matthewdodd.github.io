I am assistant house surgeon at the Westminster Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought to me on Monday—I found a long incised wound over the top of her skull on the left hand side—it would be produced by a sharp instrument; I should hardly think it had a curve like this axe—the wound would not be caused by falling unless she fell on something sharp like steel, or the brass edging of stairs—it was a clean wound, which indicated that it was done by steel.</p>

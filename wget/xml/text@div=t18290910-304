               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. What time in the morning had you left Bushey? A. At twelve o'clock- we stopped at the Crown on our way to town, about three o'clock, and called for a pint of porter, but had nothing else; we had some porter in London - it might be three pints; I did not drink a pint, I am certain - we had nothing more till we got to the Crown; there were a great many men there - we had a pint of porter, and Haygreen asked me to drink; I drank with no other man, to my knowledge - I am not certain whether I drank with any body else; I will not swear it - I might perhaps; I do not think I did - if I did, it was not with more than one; I began two songs, and did not get through the third - I do not exactly know what the songs were; the one I sang through was, "Yes coachmen all of London-town" - I will swear I only sang two, and part of a third; a woman asked me to sing - I said I did not make a practice of singing in public tap-rooms, and it was a long while before I attempted to sing; Haygreen put his arm round my neck - I did not put my arm round his waist, or round any man's waist; Haygreen attempted to kiss me, but I do not know whether he did - I begged of him to take no liberties: nobody else kissed me: I had a black veil on, and did not pull it up for him to kiss me -I did not go into the passage and beckon him out, nor any other young man; I knew Haygreen by his voice - I did not say it was a dark man who robbed me, but I could not tell who it was - I said it was Haygreen; I told the Magistrate he was the man, but I did not know his name - the patrol asked me if I could swear to him; I said Yes, if I had a light; it was a very dark night - all the company came out of the public-house together; we had a pint of porter outside the house before we went in, and sat under a tree with it - that was for a very few minutes; we went in for shelter - Scott, the ostler, brought us the beer; he did not advise us to go home, as it was late - I asked him for some water; he said had I not better have porter - I said I had had porter in town; I do not recollect his saying any thing about my going home.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's father. I left home with her between eleven and twelve o'clock, and went to Windmill-street, Haymarket; we stopped and had a pint of porter at two houses - it was dark when we got to town; on our way back we stopped at the Crown, which is about four miles from town - Bushey is thirteen; my daughter had some water at the Black Lion in Kilburn, as she did not like the beer - I had two pints of beer in town; when we got to the Crown, the servant brought us a pint of beer, and the girl some water - we had it under the tree; it began to rain very fast, which induced us to go into the house - there might be six or eight persons in the tap-room; I cannot say how many - Haygreen was one; I do not know Duttol - we sat there an hour or more; one of them wished my daughter to drink - I thought as they were hard working people, there was no harm in it, and I did, out of fear, persuade her to drink; she drank with nobody but Haygreen - there were two women in the house; the servant had orders to shut the house up, and all the company went out together; Haygreen wanted to kiss my daughter - I told him to let her alone, that she was my daughter, and very tired; they would hardly believe she was my daughter - she sang merely to oblige the people, out of fear; she attempted two songs, but could not sing - I could tell by the beating of her body that she was in fear - she afterwards sung three verses; they said that would do - when we left the public-house, I had her bundle in my arm, and her arm was linked in mine; when we got about two hundred and sixty yards, we heard some people running after us - it was very dark; my daughter said"These men are coming after me" - I said, "Never mind, hold my arm;" Haygreen then caught hold of her, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100160"></xptr>said he would be d-d if she should go home with that old man; she said, "Father, why do you stand any nonsense? why don't you draw your pistol, and shoot them?"- I said I would, as soon as I could get it out, for I had one in my pocket that never missed - I had a knife in my hand, and was going to plunge it into Haygreen if my daughter had not been between him and me, and the patrol speaking, he certainly would have had it in him; I felt the bundle drawn from my arm very plainly - they ran away; the patrol pursued them directly; we stood a few minutes listening, and heard a noise - she said, "They have got them, father;" they were taken to the public-house and we went back; I saw Haygreen then - I am sure he is the man who offered to kiss my daughter; I cannot speak to the others - I am positive of Haygreen; we did not go back to the spot to look for the bundle; whether it was dropped near the spot I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time the party came up to you, was it not so dark you could not see any body? A. I could see there were two men, and I knew Haygreen's voice; he had talked very much at the public-house - I speak to him by his voice, his jacket, and his height; it was very dark, but I knew him again perfectly well, both by his dress, person, and every thing - he had a cap on; I did not notice whether the other people had caps; there might be eight, ten, or more in the house; there was a man called Austin there, and I hear he has absconded - I cannot say whether he had a cap on; my daughter had a little of the beer on the road, but I drank the best part of it - it might be ten o'clock or half-past when we got to the Crown; I do not think we sat under the tree above two or three minutes; I saw no one but Haygreen take liberties with her, farther than forcing themselves up against her; he kissed her, I cannot say how many times; I will say twice - that is as much as I know; he lifted the veil up to do it, she did not lift it up to my knowledge - she did not put her arm round his neck nor round any other man's; I believe no one took liberties with her but him - she went into the passage and beckoned to me to come home, not to him; whether any man went out to her I cannot say - I did not go home, as it rained hard; I did not like the company altogether, and I thought some might be going our way; I do not know who asked her to sing first - the man who has absconded sat next to her - I said, "They are all hard working people, I dare say - it will be no harm, sing if you like;" she sung, "Ye coachmen all," &amp;c., for she said she did not recollect one - I said, "You do sing that at home;" I do not recollect telling her to sing another afterwards; the officers were very close to us when the men came up -I do not recollect the man, who brought us the beer under the tree, telling us we had better go home; they never separated my daughter's arm from me - it was drawn back by pulling - her arm was clenched in with mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the bundle be drawn out with their trying to get your daughter? A. It was drawn out by a hand; I will swear I saw it in the man's hand, and felt it taken.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was on duty near the Crown a few minutes before half-past eleven o'clock; I was standing up against the pales, taking shelter, as it was very dark and stormy - I saw the two witnesses coming along the middle of the road; two men came after them - when they got up to them a kind of scuffle ensued; I heard a female say, "Father, take out your pistol and shoot them;" a male voice answered directly,"D-n your eyes, if you don't leave my daughter alone, I will shoot you;" I hallooed out, "What are you after there?" I might be twenty yards from them - the two men immediately ran away - I said to the party, "Don't be frightened, it is only the patrol;" the old man called out,"Then run patrol - they have robbed me of a bundle;" I immediately pursued the men - we lost sight of them entirely: it was very dark - we followed footsteps to the corner of Child's-hill-lane, about two hundred yards, and then lost the sound; I returned, and found the prisoners in custody, near the Crown - I said to the girl, "Are either of these the men?" she said Yes, Haygreen was the one who took hold of her round the waist - that she could swear it, and the father said he was the man; Haygreen said he was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the men pass you in going after them? A. No, we were beyond them - I do not know a man named Austin; I had been into the Crown at a quarter past ten o'clock, to light a pipe, and saw the prosecutor and his daughter sitting there by themselves; there might be twenty persons there - it was full of people, labouring men and some women, girls of the town; I never knew Haygreen.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and was with Thompson near the fourth mile-stone; I observed people coming from the Crown, and when they got within thirty yards of us, I heard a female voice say, "Father, why don't you draw your pistol and shoot them?" I heard a man say, "D-n you, if you don't let her alone, I will shoot you;" two men ran away - we called out, and the party called out, "Make haste, patrol - they have got my bundle;" we followed them as far as Child's-hill-lane; it was too dark for me to see them - Thompson and I went up the lane, and Blaney went up the road; in seven or eight minutes I saw the prisoners in Mr. Prior's chair - it is a garden chair, that stands about one hundred and fifty yards from the Crown - they were both sitting there; I told them we apprehended them on suspicion of a robbery that had been committed; I searched the chair and them, but found no property - they made no answer, nor any resistance; Blaney came up, and we took them to the Crown - the prosecutor and his daughter had come up in about ten minutes; both said they thought they could identify Haygreen if they had a light - we took them to the Crown - the daughter fainted as soon as she entered; we got a light, and went out to took for the property - I was not present when the daughter came too; I left the house entirely.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The night was very dark indeed? A.

            . I am an officer. I was with the witnesses - I heard the prosecutor and his daughter coming along before this happened; they were about fifteen yards from me, when I heard the daughter say, "Father, take your pistol, and shoot them;" I then perceived two men run away - the father said, "Make haste, they have got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100161"></xptr>my bundle;" I had not distinguished the features of either of them - I lost sight of them, and saw them in Covington's custody in about eight minutes; I saw the prosecutor and his daughter - they said the dark man.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Covington took them in the chair? A.

The prosecutor and his daughter came there about three o'clock in the day, and had two pints of porter - they returned rather before nine, I should think, and had a pint of porter under the tree - they then went into the tap-room; there were eighteen or twenty haymakers and labourers there - there was a lad named Austin who, I understand, has left the neighbourhood - he had a cap on; the prosecutor and his daughter went, and sat among the rest of the men, they did not appear alarmed - very far from it; the young girl sang several songs at her father's request - I believe she drank with most of the men; she was in two or three parts of the room, and I believe drank wherever she sat - they were there nearly two hours; I turned them all out together - I saw Haygreen lift up her veil, and kiss her two or three times; I saw nobody else kiss her - they returned to my house about three quarters of an hour after it was cleared - it was full that time; I have known Haygreen for three years - he was servant to Mr. Tilyard, and had the care of about one hundred cows; he was strictly honest, and rather above a man in his station.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it not raining very hard while the prosecutor and his daughter were in your house? A. There were showers - it was not a continued rain, for I went out to see; it rained a little when they left: I did not know Austin, but understood he worked for Captain Lewis, opposite my house; the first time I saw him at my house was the night before - I know he has absconded, because the officers were sent after him; I heard the Magistrate order them to search for him - I believe it was neither of the officers that are here; he had a cap on on Sunday and Monday, and Haygreen had a cap - I had seen him and Haygreen sit down, and should judge they were nearly of the same height, and about the same stoutness.</p>

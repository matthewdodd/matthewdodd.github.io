I received information on Tuesday, the 6th—I made inquiry, and apprehended the prisoner on the 10th—I went to his master's house, where he is a barman—I told him who I was and charged him with wantonly throwing a stone over Waterloo-bridge, thereby causing injury to a boy named Abbot—he said, "Yes, I am the person, and am very sorry for it"—he said as he was going across the bridge to Messrs. Hodges on an errand for his master, that he saw the stone lying in the recess, and thought he would throw it over the bridge and have a splash as he returned—I was on the bridge at the time it happened, and examined it—the projecting part of the bridge, which is a flat surface, had part of the stone work broken away, as if the stone had first struck on the coping of the bridge, and cut about two inches out, then fallen on the pier of the bridge, and I found that portion of the bridge was all powder, a sort of indentation made, as if the stone had rebounded from the parapet—it might have struck the boy where it was found—I saw the boy before and after he was dead.</p>

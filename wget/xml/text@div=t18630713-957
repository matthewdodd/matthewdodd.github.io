               <p>JOSEPH ALLEN (Policeman, M 39). On Monday morning, 25th May, about half-past 7 o'clock, I was called by Mr. Pugh—in consequence of what he said I went to 28, Borough-road—I found Dr. Marsh there—I saw the prisoner's wife lying dead on the bed, smothered with blood; I also saw his son lying on an adjoining bed, with his throat most frightfully cut—I then went to Mr. Pugh's shop, and found the prisoner there standing in front of the counter—I told him I must take him into custody for the murder of his wife, and also cutting and wounding his son—he said he knew all about it, but he did not know what he was at at the time; he had been up and down all night long, and he could not get it out of his head—I took him in a cab to the station—Dr. Marsh walked down behind some time afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I now reside in Hanover-street, Hanover-square—I used to live in the Southwark-bridge-road, close by the prisoner's house—I have known him for seventeen years; the first occasion of my attending his family was at the birth of the boy who is now dead—that boy was an imbecile and a cripple—I always found the prisoner's conduct to his wife and child most affectionate and considerate—he was always a strange, odd man, peculiar in his manner, taciturn, uncommunica<lb></lb>tive—he sometimes would not reply to a question—he would frequently pass me in the street without taking any notice, even if I recognised him—I remember both the accidents that occurred to him, one took place in March, 1856—the history I had of the case was, that a week previous to my being called in to see him, he was thrown out of his cart and taken up in a state of insensibility, and carried in that condition to the London Hospital; there he remained a week, and on his being brought home I was called in to see him—he had very extensive injury to his head and face in the shape of wounds and contusions—I thought that after that his perceptives were less acute, that his strange way was stranger—he took longer to appear to under<lb></lb>stand a question before he replied to it—the second injury was in 1859—I. had then removed to where I now live, and my partner was called in to see him—he had fractured his arm—I saw him the next day, and continued attending him—there were contusions about the head on that occasion, but no destruction of surface, no wound or serious injury apparent; it was such as might be produced by the kick of a horse—that would jar the brain undoubtedly—I have since then met him occasionally, professionally in public places, I mean parochially, and so forth—he was overseer, I think, some time ago, a member of one of the local boards—he was very much respected—his strangeness of manner has increased—on the last occasion of my going through his shop to see his wife or child, he did not take the slightest notice of me or reply to my ordinary salute—I thought him originally a poor feeble thing, and the shock received by the accidents would aggravate that originally feeble state of mind—I have not seen him since this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was he overseer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been eight years ago—he was a member of a road trust previous to the passing of Sir Benjamin Hall's act, six years ago—that was subsequent to the first accident—he attended to the parish business pretty well, but he took no part except being there; he would sit the whole evening and never say a word to participate in what was being done—he was undoubtedly competent to perform business, because he carried it on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering all the circumstances and all that you know and have heard of him, have you any doubt that he knew right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only give a general opinion, drawing my conclusions from my early knowledge of him, and my knowledge of his having had these accidents, and hearing of what has taken place, I should give it as my opinion, as a man of common sense, that he was not cognizant of his acts, that he did not know what he was doing—it is my opinion that when he killed his wife and child he did not know he was doing wrong—although he told persons of it directly and lamented it, I should still persist in that opinion; taking the history of the case, and it being so thoroughly without a motive, and his peculiar feeble</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the gaol of Newgate—I have had the prisoner under my care since this day week—I have seen him daily and had conversation with him—at present, in my opinion, he is in a sane state of mind—I have seen nothing of feebleness of mind in particular; every mind has its own peculiarity—so far as his condition of mind is concerned, since he has been under my observation he would perfectly know right from wrong—I cannot of course answer for what state of mind he may have been in when this act was committed—supposing a man to have received an injury to his head, or to be originally of feeble intellect, drink would have a greater effect upon him than upon other persons—if he was shut up in gaol so as to be kept from drink, no doubt his mind would improve.</p>

I am a certificated master, and was formerly part owner of a vessel—I shipped as an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Starnaway</hi> at Syd<lb></lb>ney, to work my way to England—about 18th February we started from Sydney—Tomlins was captain, and Reed was first mate—about 12th May, when in the tropics, I was sent to set up a stay—I was out on the flying jib-boom end, and the mate was on the gallant forecastle—I had finished my work, and the mate asked me what I had dropped the blocks overboard for—the blocks were upon the lines that I set up the stay with—I told him I was going to get them in—he said, "You are no sailor, and nothing but a soldier, you men with certificates think you can do as you like; but I will let you know different"—I said, "I am as good a man as you are, and I suppose my certificate is as good as yours"—he then went aft to the captain—about 2 o'clock next morning when I was relieved at the wheel, the mate followed me off the poop; he called me by name, and asked what I meant by telling him I was a better man than he was—before I had time to reply, he struck me on the mouth—I took a belaying-pin to defend myself, but before I could use it he closed his arms round me, and pinioned me; he forced my head on the rail, and fixed my cheek with his teeth—his teeth did not penetrate—he said, "You son of a b——I will bite the nose off you"—he then knocked me down—while I was down he punched me, and jumped on me several times with the whole weight of his body on my stomach—while he was doing this the captain came up, and said, "That will do, Mr. Reed; drag him aft"—he dragged me a little way aft, and then threw me down, and jumped on me again, and said, "You d—d son of a b——, I will murder you before I get home"—the captain was present when he did this—I was then taken into the captain's cabin, and was put in irons by the mate, the captain being present—I was then put into the sail-locker, a small house on deck, about twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and six feet high, which was three-parts full of sails—there was just room to stand upright—the only ventilation was through a crevice at the top of the door—there were two small windows, but they were fastened up with wood inside—I was was kept there seven days and eighteen hours—I was let out for an hour in</p>

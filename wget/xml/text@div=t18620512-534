                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 141). On Thursday morning, 17th April, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in Leather-lane—I missed the padlock off the iron gate leading into the cellar of No. 82—I also found the window pushed back, and the gate tied up with a piece of twine—I had seen the padlock safe about twenty minutes before—I got the assistance of another constable, and we undid the twine, opened the gate, and turned our lights on into the cellar, and I saw the prisoner trying to hide himself under a shelf which projected out from the cellar window inside—I reached down, and said, "Prisoner, all right, come out of it"—I took hold of him, and he said, "All right; I'll come out"—I called up the proprietor, who gave him in custody—I took him to the station, searched him, and found a small pen<lb></lb>knife and some matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave no explanation of his being there.</p>

I live at 82, Leather-lane, and am a metal dealer—on 17th April my cellar was properly padlocked—I was called up by the police about half-past 3, and round the cellar broken open and the prisoner in custody—he had no right to be in the cellar—I kept some old metal there—a person can get from that cellar into my house; it is part of my dwelling-house—it also gives access to some of the neighbouring houses, by coming up the cellar stairs—I have not lost anything that I am aware of—the prisoner gave no explanation of his being there—my house is in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn.</p>

I had been walking about all the previous day; it was coming on to rain, and I went in to get some rest. I had no intention to rob Mr. Josephs or his house. I never saw these articles before they were produced in Court.</p>

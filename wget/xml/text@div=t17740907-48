I am a single man; the prisoner worked for me by the day; I locked up my outer door. I have a closet within my room which I usually leave open; in that were the velvet breeches, and all this money was locked up in a chest; as soon as I returned from church I found the box of the lock of the room door burst open, and lying in the middle of the room; several things that were in the outer room in the drawers were taken away; being surprized to see the door shut of the inner closet, which I always used to leave open, raised my suspicion, and upon enquiry I found that the box had been forced open with a chissel, which I found was my own chissel; I enquired after the prisoner and he was taken by Mr. Clack.</p>
               <p>- Clack. I met with the prisoner in Berkshire; I passed by him at first; seeing him so fine with a pair of velvet breeches, I did not suspect him to be the man, because Marshall had not described him to be such a man; but afterwards I returned, as he otherwise answered to the description given me by Mr. Marshall; when I attempted to stop him he threatened that he would cut me down in case I offered to take him; that I had no right to molest him; but I was determined to secure him; he ran into a field, and afterwards a cross the road to another place; at last I did secure him, and brought him back to a house where he had a bundle, which he claimed as being his own; for the people of the house said there was a bundle; I asked the prisoner whether that bundle belonged to him; he said it did; that bundle and the prisoner I secured. (The bundle containing the breeches, three of the shirts, the cotton stockings, and a waistcoat, part of the things mentioned in the indictment, and about six pounds in money, was produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>I was working in the garden; in the afternoon coming into the yard I saw the stable door open; that surprized me; I went into the stable, and behind the stable I saw a bundle; that surprised me; I went in to see if I could see any body; I did not look to see what was in the bundle; I did not dismolish any of the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Watts's Farm, Acton, and work for Mr. Davis. On the 9th of March I saw the prisoner in my master's farm-yard—I asked if he would take down some rough wood to Oldoak-common that I had been chopping up to mend a fence—he said he would not—he passed me again in master's farm-yard in about five minutes, with a bundle of bean-straw, carrying it from the stable into the barn—I said, "Will you take this timber down?"—he said, "No, I will not go out of the yard for any<lb></lb>body"—he then dropped the bundle of straw down, and struck at me with the fork—I put my hand up, but it bit me upon the head—I do not know how many times he struck me, but he struck again upon the back part of my head,</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the farm-yard—the prisoner and prosecutor were quarrelling and abusing each other with foul language—the prisoner struck Miller with the hay-fork across the head, and knocked his hat off—he struck him twice—one blow broke the prong of the fork—Miller never struck him—if I had not run up and caught hold of Miller he would have fallen—about a pint of blood came from his head where the fork struck him—Mr. Francis, who was in the yard, gave him a plaster, with which be strapped the wound up—the prisoner remained in the yard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear the prosecutor call him a b—y old rogue and a villain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and he accused him of stealing a sack—he went towards him, and caught hold of the truss, which the prisoner dropped, and struck him with the fork—he had been seven or eight months in my father's employ, and the prosecutor four or five years—the prisoner was bailiff, and it was his duty to give orders, and not the prosecutor's—the prisoner always conducted himself well and peaceably.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 29th of March I was going to Mr. Davis's farm, and saw the prisoner going into the stable with a bundle of bean-straw upon his back—Miller said to him, "What had you in the sack, Hooper?"—he made no answer, but went into the stable, put the straw off his fork, turned round, and came out of the stable, and directly stabbed at Miller with the fork—he hit him upon the breast, but did not wound him—he then went into the barn with an<lb></lb>other bundle of bean-straw, and as he returned the prosecutor said, "You d—d vagabond, you would have stabbed me if you could"—he put his hand upon the bean-straw, Hooper threw it off, and struck him upon his hat, and then upon the head, with the fork—he struck another blow at him as he was falling—he bled a great deal.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the yard. I heard Miller call the prisoner a b—y old rogue—he caught hold of the straw he had upon the fork, turned him round, to prevent his going on, and wished to know what he had in a sack which he had taken out of his master's yard—he was going into the stable at the time—he turned him round, more to aggravate him than anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and machinist, and live in Collingwood-street, Blackfriars-road. Towards the latter end of July, Aime and Boisserolle called at my premises—Aime asked me if I could make a coining press—I told him, "Yes"—he said, "A coining press to coin money"—he shewed me a copper coin, and inquired if I could make a press of sufficient power to make that coin, and the number that the press would make per minute—I told him, with sufficient men, it would make about sixty of those coins per minute; and I showed him the wooden model of that which is used for the Mint, to show him the size of it—I told him the price would be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered me 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "No; I would not take that"—there was no agreement made at that time—they offered me then 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills—I said if the bills were good, and upon good per<lb></lb>sons in the City, I would take them—it was Aime who spoke to me—the copper coin they showed me was about the size of a penny piece—it was similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they went away, and I made some inquiries—in about two days, Aime and Boisserolle called at my house again, and I stated to them at once that I had considered the matter, and I should not take any bills whatever—Boisserolle was very indignant—he marched about the place, and said he would have nothing to do with me; but when he was going down the stairs, he said, "Well, never mind; bring your agreement over to-morrow morning to 8, Chapel-place"—I agreed to draw up an agree<lb></lb>ments, and when they had left, I prepared this agreement—my daughter wrote it—I took it to 8, Chapel-place—I should imagine that was about 30th July—I then saw both the prisoners and Boisserolle—that was the first time I had seen Reverdy—I produced the agreement, and Boisserolle signed it in the presence of the others—Boisserolle did not speak English—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought to me in Collingwood-street, the same afternoon, by Aime—he paid me the money, and took a receipt—he called again in a few days, to see how I got on—during the whole six or seven weeks that I was at work at the press, he called to see how I was going on—he called by himself—he once had a man with him who was a stranger; that was all—soon after taking the order for the press, he said he should want a great quantity of dies—I prepared the blocks—I only do the smith's work, and then they go to the engraver—I made sixteen altogether—Aime told me to give them to the die sinker—I gave three or four to Thomas, and the rest to Oester Zetzer—Aime desired me to give them to Thomas—Oester Zetzer brought back the dies with the representation of John the Baptist, and Thomas brought back the coining dies—after I had these dies back I saw Aime several times—he called on me, and I spoke to him—on one occasion I asked him if that was not the Turkish Sultan's signature that was on one of those engraved by Thomas—he said it was not, and he produced some gold coins to show the difference between that on the die and the gold coins that he had—I had not finished the press by 10th September, but I fixed it temporarily up in my place, with a view to show that my work was right before it went away—I told Aime why I had done it, and I told him I should want some pieces of copper to try it; I wanted him to get some</p>

               <p>made—he said he could not do that, but he brought some copper, and I made a pair of catting-out tools—he sent me two pieces of copper from Messrs. Pecke, of Soho—it was very good copper, apparently; such copper as would make coins; I should say so by the look of it—I wanted to try the thickness of the copper, to see if my work was adjusted right—I did not try the machine at all; we had not got it finished—I afterwards com<lb></lb>municated with the Turkish Ambassador—I gave the dies I received from Thomas and from Oester Zetzer to the officer.</p>

Mr. Otto Thomas,—Having heard of you by my friend Smith, I beg you to call on me to-morrow evening at half-past 7 o'clock, if possible.")—I, in consequence, went, and saw the prisoner Aime—he said he was recommended to me, and had to give me an order—he showed me some patterns of coins; some like this yermelik, and these piastres, and these small coins, paras—he showed me several of each—he showed me other coins, the same pattern, but different kinds—he asked me about the price of doing them—I did not believe it was money—I asked him if it was money—he said, "Yes, it is money; they require new dies for them"—I asked him what they wanted new ones for, and what was done with the others—he said they were broken up, and they required new ones—I took the patterns with me home, and he gave me the coins, about four or five pieces—I agreed to make them at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pair—I took the five pieces home—I did not sink any dies for them in March; I sunk the dies in July—I saw Aime at the end of June or the beginning of July; I met him in Holborn, at the George and Blue Boar, and he introduced me to Boisserolle as the agent for the Turkish government, to give orders in London—I gave them my direction, 89, Stamford-street, and Aime and Boisserolle called on me and looked at several patterns—they said there were one hundred dies to order, and they would give me the whole order—the first dies were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pair, if I had the whole hundred I said I would do them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they gave me three patterns, the patterns of the coins here produced—I had given back the coins that were given me in March—these are the coins that Aime and Boisserolle gave me—I was ordered to prepare dies from those patterns—they said when I received the dies from Mr. Davis I was to begin—I received the dies from Mr. Davis, about twelve dies—I engraved six pair, which was twelve dies—I returned four of them to Mr. Davis; these are them—they are the obverse and reverse sides of a piastre—I afterwards prepared two pair of dies from each of the other two coins—I gave those eight and the coins which I had received to Whicher, the officer, about the middle of October—while I was engraving those dies, Aime and Boisserolle called on me—they saw the first dies, those which I gave to Mr. Davis, but they were not finished when they saw them—I saw the elder prisoner, Reverdy, in the beginning of July at 8, Chapel-place, Cavendish-square; there were Reverdy, Aime, and Boisserolle—I had not then begun to work on these dies—I never did execute the other dies—I never saw Reverdy about these dies.</p>

Vivians at Birmingham, and an order was given to me for Messrs. Vivians, for fifteen tons of copper—it was to be delivered in Liverpool to the care of H. Reverdy, the elder prisoner—Aime spoke English, Reverdy spoke very little English, Boisserolle did not speak English at all—Aime said Boisserolle was to pay for the copper, but how it was to be paid was to be settled with Mr. Smith—I saw Boisserolle give some money to Reverdy—I should think as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five tons of this copper delivered at Liverpool to the order of Mr. Reverdy—Aime said he thonght he should go to Egypt—I asked him what he wanted this quantity of copper for, and his reply was to make belts for the Turkish Army.</p>

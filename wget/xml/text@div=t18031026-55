             sworn. - Q.State what you know of the robbery? - A. On the 28th of September, I got up about five minutes after five o'clock in the morning, and found my bar had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your dwelling-house? - A. Yes; there are two hatches to the bar, one above that locks, and a lower one which bolts on the inside, and which I found unbolted, as if somebody had come out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was bolted when you went to bed? - A. I am certain of it; I had locked it the last thing before I went to bed; I had been robbed a little while before, which made me very particular in looking round the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to-bed? - A.About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you miss? - A.In looking round, for I took every thing of value out before I went to bed, I saw two sixpences lay at the corner of a small shelf, but do not know them again; at the further end of the shelf, I saw a quantity of bad halfpence and farthings, but I did not think them of any consequence, and left them there; there was a small napkin also, which I took up in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260025"></xptr>hand and threw over some butter in a small room behind the bar, left the cat should get in; I cannot swear to it, only from its general appearance; in the morning I missed the things I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your house as to the fastenings? - A. I saw a stool placed under the bar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the bar? - A.In the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a stool necessary for the purpose of approaching the window? - A. Yes; the bar-window was a sash which drew to and fro; it had not been broke open, but was drawn back, as I had forgot to fasten it; the stool had been taken out of the bar too.</p>
               <p>Q.The stool was inside the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How could it be used to get into the house? - A.Not to get into the house, but to get into the bar window.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any part of the house broke? - A. The pannel of the back door was broke; I had fastened it myself the night before, when it was quite entire, and not broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it dark when you fastened it? - A. I fastened it a few minutes before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the whole you missed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing else broke? - A. It was necessary, after he broke the back door, to come through the tap-room, where there is another door, the line of which was out which pulled the door to, which I had fastened round a staple.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see any of these things again? - A. They were produced before the magistrates; I cannot swear to the cloth, but my daughter can.</p>

             sworn. - Q.Did you make any search at the lodgings of the prisoner? - A. I did; on Wednesday, the 28th of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, at No. 5, Court-street, Whitechapel, and in his room I found a napkin, which I carried to Mr. Chaney's, and his daughter knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that which you shewed her was the identical napkin you found in his lodgings? - A. Yes; I asked the description of the man who lodged there, and having got it, I went to a place called the Broad-place, near Petticoat-lane, where I took the prisoner, about twelve o'clock; he was pointed out to me by a little lad; I searched him, and in his pockets I found three sixpences, two good and one bad, and some halfpence and farthings. (The napkin and sixpences produced.)</p>

             sworn. - Q. Look at that napkin, and say whether you know it? - A.

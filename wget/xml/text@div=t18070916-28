            . I live at the London tavern. On the 8th of July, in consequence of information from one of my servants, I stopped the prisoner going out of the passage; I found in his right hand waistcoat pocket a piece of lead; he told me it was lead he was going to take to his master's premises; the prisoner is a <rs id="t18070916-28-deflabel142" type="occupation">plumber</rs>

I received further information; in consequence of which I searched him, and found a large quantity of lead.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS. I am a waiter at the London tavern. On the 8th of July I was up stairs. I heard a knocking at the window on the leads; I saw this prisoner with a piece of lead of about three or four pounds; he concealed it under his jacket. I went down stairs and told my fellow servant to go up stairs into the Small (that is the name of the room) to see the fellow sacking the lead. I informed Mr. Terry of it.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the London tavern; I went up stairs in one of the tavern rooms between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the leads, he was collecting his tools together apparently; after that he removed his jacket, and under his jacket lay a piece of lead; he took the piece of lead up and put it into his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man besides him on the leads. (The lead produced.)</p>
               <p>- TEMSEAD. I am an officer, I took the man in custody; these two pieces he took out of his pocket, and the large quantity was in the front of his breeches; it weighs somewhat more than a quarter of a hundred: he said he was going to get some nails for his work, he said he had measured more lead than the measurement of the place; he was going to take it to his master's and put it in the melting pot, in order that there might be no words about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to measure this lead; I went to the shop to cut it out, I was called away. When I came down again I cut out the remainder, as I thought, and rolled it up together; I took it to the premises, and when I opened it I found I had made a mistake in some of the pieces; and I could do nothing to it till I got some nails; so I doubled up the piece that was to spare, and went in order to get the nails. As it was not booked I made a memorandum, I knew Mr. Chapman was very severe, he would not like to see me take the cuttings home. I thought to take it home, I doubled it up and put it in my waistcoat to carry it to my master's shop, unknown to my master and the surveyor, or any body else.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

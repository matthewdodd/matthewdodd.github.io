             the elder my back garret; in the morning before she came in, I went on the roof through a trap-door to put a bit of glass on the sky-light that lighted the stair-case, as it was broke; I then perceived my lead was dirty with the mortar, and I swept it clean; my lead was then all safe; they came in on the 5th, and on the 19th of the same month they quitted my room. After they had taken all their things out of the room, they left me the key; when I went into the room, I found it all a flood with water; I got out of the trap-door, and found my lead gone that was round the chimney by the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young woman lodge with the old one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with them? - A. Yes; my wife went after their character, they gave them a good character; my wife went to them after they were gone, and asked them how they could give them such a good character; they said they gave it them to get rid of them.</p>

             the younger put this lead through the trap-door, you do not know what became of it - where were you when this was done? - A. I was in the room with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You visited the two prisoners at the bar often at times, and you visited them often enough to keep the young woman company? - A. That was her fault, it was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You were received into the family as a visitor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180040"></xptr>and as a person they put confidence in - pray how often used you to be there in a week? - A. Sometimes not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes how often? - A. Sometimes twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes more - do you mean to swear that you were never left in the room when neither of them were there? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it that you first took upon you to charge them with stealing this lead? - A. When they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not taken into custody, were you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken into custody on suspicion of stealing the lead - have you come here in custody? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure, if you do not know, I do not know; you have good luck if you do not - As you say you do not know, I will tell you: when you were taken into custody for stealing the lead, then you accused that young woman of stealing the lead? - A. I did not accuse her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story then as you have done now? - A. I told the truth then.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till then, you said she was the person that stole the lead? - A. I said she was the person that gave the lead in at the trap-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this to climb up? - A. It is not above this height from the floor (about four or five feet,) it is a slanting gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long after the lead was lost was it before you accused this young woman of stealing it? - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. By your own account you are a good honest lad - How long had you been in custody before you told this? - A. Not an hour in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge that young woman, to clear yourself? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no hope of that kind? - A. I was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. No man is guilty by his own account - You did not charge her at all, to discharge yourself? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you charge her in hopes of clearing yourself? - A. I did, because I knew myself innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. You did it then in hopes of clearing yourself? - A. I did.</p>

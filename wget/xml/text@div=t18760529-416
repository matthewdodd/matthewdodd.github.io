                  </hi>. I am a barge builder, of 273, Westferry Road, Millwall—on the morning of the 29th April I missed a stack of timber from a barge lying alongside my premises—it was safe over night—I also missed other property which was safe over night and which was worth from 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed the things the first thing on the Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290070"></xptr>
               <p>morning, and about 2 o'clock the same day I went to the prisoner's premises in company with George Reed—I saw some planks outside the house which were mine, and inside the house I saw a quantity of paints, oils, varnish, turps, nails, felt, and such like things used in the trade, which belonged to me—the value of the property inside the house which I claim was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to Reed, in the prisoner's presence, "If this is my felt three pieces are perfect and one imperfect"—that was before I laid a hand on them—I also found three pieces of timber that I bad missed six weeks previous; I knew it by the initials on one piece, and the other was apiece I had cut myself—a portion of the property is here—the prisoner was present at the time I made the search with the constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "All the planks came from Mr. Lash, he supplies many large builders"—they are ordinary planks—I said that I recognised the paint by the tins, they are Fitzgerald's tins; they are used by many large builders—I identify one of the planks by its having been lined and marked out the night before for the men's working—mine are waterside premises, and the prisoner's also—he is a publican and a barge builder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Those were the planks I saw outside the house, and one of the pieces I had missed six weeks before corresponded with one of those I missed that morning, it came from the same log; it compared in length and width, and in every way—I can speak to the cans of paint, one especially.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Albert Place, East Greenwich, and am a barge builder in the prosecutor's employ—on this Saturday morning that the things were missed I went in search of them—I found some planks at the King and Queen Stairs, in the five footway in front of the prisoner's public-house, at 8 a.m., or it might be two or three minutes past—I went into the house and had something to drink, and I saw the prisoner take a can of green paint upstairs through the bar parlour, from the pothouse or kitchen that was alongside, I recognised it as my master's property—I saw cans of oil and nails standing in the corner in the lobby or kitchen, which<lb></lb>ever they term it—I recognised them as the things I had missed—I have examined the things since and can speak to them as my master's property—I gave information first to the police at Rotherhithe and afterwards to my master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing in front of the bar, drinking, when I saw the prisoner carrying the can of paint; he went into the kitchen and took it up the stairs through the bar parlour—I recognised it as my master's can by the outside of it; I did not see the inside—I saw at the top that it was green paint that I had missed—the nails were in the corner in bags; the oils were in cans—I did not see the inside, only the can?.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector-</hi>). On this Saturday I went with Detective Middleton to the prisoner's house; I saw him, and said "I am an inspector of police; are you Mr. Ireland?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Do these planks outside your door belong to you?"—he said "No"—I said "Do you know to whom they do belong?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you bought any tins of paint, or tins of oil, or bags of nails, to-day, from any person?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you received any from any</p>

               <p>person to-day?"—he said "No"—I said "From whom did you receive those that you ordered to be taken upstairs this morning?"—he said "I have not ordered any to be taken upstairs to-day"—I said "A man was here and saw you and heard you order some paints and oil and bags of nails to be taken upstairs this morning; let me see what, you have got"—I then accompanied him to a room in the upper part of the house, where I saw a large quantity of nails, some in bags and some shot in bins, and one parcel lying on a sack on the floor; also a quantity of paints, oil, and white lead—I said "What are those?"—he said "They are things that I use in my trade"—I sent for the prosecutor and he came, and in the prisoner's presence he identified the things—he then said "There is some felt gone, four rolls; they are here somewhere"—I looked in another room and saw some felt, and I said "Here is some felt here"—he said "Then before I see them, if they are mine one is imperfect, and the others are perfect"—I then fetched them out from the room, and he identified them as his property—I said to the prisoner "How do you account for these?"—he said "They belong to me"—I said "Have you any receipt to show from whom you bought them?—he said "Yes," and went downstairs and brought up a receipt, and handed it to Middleton; the prosecutor examined it, and said "That does not relate to these rolls of felt;" the prisoner said "No; these rolls I got close handy here, and they have not been settled for yet." (<hi rend="italic">This receipt was dated December</hi>, 1875.) I afterwards went into the prisoner's yard with him and the prosecutor, and there saw three oak planks; I then charged the prisoner with stealing these things; he said he could account for all the things he had.</p>

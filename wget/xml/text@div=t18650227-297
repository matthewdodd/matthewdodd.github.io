                  </hi>. I am staying at an hotel in Leicester-square—on 16th January last I made up a letter, addressed to Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. Davis, Harrow—on the hill, Middlesex—I enclosed it in another envelope addressed in the same way—I then took it to the Post-office, in Castle-street, and there purchased half-a-crown's worth of postage-stamps; I had closed the letter, and not wishing to open it again, I put the stamps round it, and bought another envelope, a post-office envelope, and enclosed it in that, and then posted it at Castle-street, before twelve o'clock, mid-day—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite certain that you enclosed all the stamps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am sure I paid half-a-crown for them, and to the best of my belief the post-mistress gave me thirty; I did not count them, I was in a great hurry—if I had only received twenty-eight I should have observed it, because I should have seen the rough edges, or a hiatus, which there was not—the stamp I placed on the outer envelope was my own, not one of those I purchased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the N. W. district office—if this letter was posted at Castle-street before twelve, it ought to have gone out from the N. W. district-office at twelve—it bears the stamp of the N. W. office, of 16th January, eleven o'clock—I despatched the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at Harrow—the prisoner was the principal letter-carrier there—I remember the mid-day mail arriving on 16th January, soon after two—the prisoner was absent that day and I had to take his duty—this letter was sorted to me—I was a Stranger on the prisoner's walk—I took the letter out for delivery, but could not find the person—I took it back to the office and gave it to the next man who was going out oil that delivery, I think it was Blake, to take it out on trial, as we did not know where to deliver it—the letter was then perfectly safe, fastened up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner speak to you about this letter the next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say for certain whether he did the next day, but we had the letter before us several days—by us I mean the letter-carriers, myself, Blake, Warden and the prisoner—we did not know what to do with it—the prisoner sorts of an afternoon—the sorting is done in the same office that we are in—I am not on duty in the afternoon—the prisoner does</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at Harrow—I remember Wise giving me a letter on 16th or 17th January—I think this is the letter, but 1 could not say—I never took it out"; if we have a difficulty in finding the person to whom a letter is addressed, it is taken back to the office and placed in the hands of the charge-taker the head letter-carrier, that was the pri<lb></lb>soner; whatever he thinks proper is done with it—if it cannot be delivered the last that had it out writes upon it and hands it to the charge-taker, and it is sent back to the dead-office; that is what I have always understood—I did not give it to the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see it lying about several days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Wise handed it to me on the evening of the 16th; it was lying down and I never had it in my hands after—Mr. Kay is the postmaster, he is here—I did not call his attention to the letter, he had nothing to do with it—the prisoner did not speak to me about it—after I saw it it, was not my place to have it any more—it was handed to the man on the beat—there are four or five persons of the name of Davis at Harrow—if one man cannot find the per-son he would hand it to another—we should not keep it in our pocket—if we go out with a letter and the person cannot be found, the next time we go back to the office we give it up.</p>

I am one of the senior clerks in the General Post-Office—on 30th January I went to Harrow with Mr. Clare and Rumbold the officer—the prisoner came to the office while I was there—after some ques<lb></lb>tions being put to him, Rumbold was desired to search him, and he took from his pocket this letter in precisely the same state it is now—the coloured envelope, containing a small note was enclosed in the outer envelope, and the postage-stamps were enclosed in this pillar letter-box bill; it is one of the office-forms—the envelope was torn open, as it is now and the other envelope was also open, but not the small inner one—I said to the prisoner, "Here is a letter which the police-officer has just taken from your pocket, how do you account for its possession"—he replied, I don't know anything about it, I suppose I must have taken it up with my pocket-handkerchief—I said, "But it has been opened, and here is another envelope enclosed, bearing the same address; and also some postage-stamps, wrapped in a pillar-box bill, all this could not have been done by accident"—he replied, "I don't know, I must have taken it up with my handkerchief or with some bills"—he was shown the envelope and asked where the person lived to whom the letter was addressed—he replied, "by the hill," or "over the hill, round by the pillar box, it is the first of four cottages"—after receiving that descrip<lb></lb>tion I sent Mr. Clare.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Limehouse. I was at the Needle-maker's Arms, Douglas-street, Limehouse, at five o'clock on the 26th of Dec.—the prisoner who I knew before was there—my shipmates, who went in to have a drop of porter, sat on the further side of the room—there was no room for me there, and I sat down next the prisoner, and fell asleep—I had these half-crowns and other money—I was asleep till near seven—when I awoke the prisoner was gone—the other persons were there—I went to look after the prisoner, and at last found her at Dickens', the pawnbroker's—I asked her to give me my money—I accused her a second time—she told me at last she would make it up to me, then she turned to and blackguarded me—I was sober—I saw one half<lb></lb>penny at the station—I told the policeman if the halfpenny was there I could swear to it—this is it—I can swear to it—I took it that night fortnight at the Needle-maker's Arms—it is very much battered on the woman side.</p>

On the night of the 26th of Dec. the prosecutor gave the prisoner in my charge for robbing him of two half-crowns, two shillings, two sixpences, and two halfpence—she said she had not got a farthing in her possession—I took her to the station—she tried to put her hand into her bosom—I took hold of both her hands till I got to the station—when I got there she dropped one penny-piece and two half<lb></lb>pence on the floor—she put her hand into her bosom—I took two shillings and two halfpence out of her hand—this is one of the halfpence.</p>

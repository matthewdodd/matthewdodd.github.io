                  </hi>. I am an officer. I found the bed-cover on the bed in the room smith used, as if used with the bed—it was in his house on the first floor—he was then in custody, and his wife and Kew also—he had been in custody on the Wednesday night—I found it on the Friday following—I saw the cover on the bed when I searched the room on the Wednesday—the prisoner then was with us, but his attention was not called to the cover—nothing was said about which room he occupied—he owned he occupied that room—he said we might search the room, and we went into the room with him—I cannot say whether he said, "My room"—he said the room on the attic floor was Kew's room—the family consists of smith, his wife, Kew, and a lodger—I did not know any thing about the bed-cover at that time, but I am certain it was on the bed—the wife was taken into custody the same night—I did not ask if it was his room, and he did not, say whether it was—I cannot say any thing more about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I cannot give any account of it being there—I know nothing of any of the transactions—when the officers came to my place I went up to help them search the house—what was found was these quite unknown to me—I have been in the parish thirty-four years, and never had a key turned against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Woolwich with my step-father, Thomas Charles Andrews. The prisoner lived as servant with my step-father—I think she left last Wednesday three weeks—before she left I missed a brooch, with little blue stones in it, in the shape of a leaf, which used to be on the table in my dressing room—I missed it about a month or six weeks after she had been with us, which was two or three months before she left—on missing that brooch, I made inquiry of her about it; she said it was in a little box on the drawers—I never went to that box—I did not go to it till two days after she left—on the evening she went away, I missed another brooch—I had seen it in the morning and put it on the pincushion, and missed it after she was gone—these are my two brooches—this is the one with the blue stones—I am quite sure these are mine.</p>

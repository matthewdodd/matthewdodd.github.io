                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. George Wilson, a draper, living at No. 90, Whitechapel. The two prisoners came to the shop in company, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th of August—they inquired for calico—I showed them some they purchased three yards—there were three bundles of shawls close to my right hand on the counter before they came, all secure—Murray left the shop after they bought the calico—she assigned no reason why she went away without the other—they had been dealing for the same articles—Riley remained about two minutes—she paid for the calico, and then went away—in about ten minutes I missed one of the bundles containing eleven shawls—no other person came in but the prisoners—three of the shawls have been found—I had seen these women several times at the shop before, and served them.</p>

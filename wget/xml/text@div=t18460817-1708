                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live in Southampton-mews, Euston-square. About two o'clock in the day, on the 4th of Aug., I was at Woolwich—I had had a pint of stout on board the vessel I went down in—was a little in liquor—I recollect going into a public-house—I do not know How long I was there—I think I must have gone in about three o'clock—I had</p>

I am single, and live in Rope-yard-rails, Woolwich—I was in the Duke on Horseback on the evening of the 4th of Aug.—I saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners—they all came in together—a pot of beer was called for, and the two prisoners shoved the prosecutor against the fire-place—they came away from him directly, and his right-hand pocket was tamed inside out—Pitcher then went back again to him and took bis watch-guard off his neck, and his watch out of his pocket and put into his own—the two prisoners were then going out, and they said to another marine who wat there," Come on"—he said,"Indeed I won't"—the prisoners went out, and I never saw them again till they were at the station—the prosecutor stopped till Mr. Harris came and fetched him.</p>

            </rs>: They were charged in the Indictment to have seduced him the said Puplet, and got out of his hands (he being Cash keeper to Mr Bernard) the Sum of One thousand and seventy pounds in money, and of Goods to the value of 150 l. The Matter of Fact was thus; Mr. Bernard being on the 15th of July last at Bristol Fair, and leaving the said Puplet at home, to look to his Affairs here at London, and a younger Apprentice, in the interim of which time Margaret Summer was Mr. Bernard's <rs id="t16931012-24-deflabel91" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

Mr. Puplett being so tricked out of so much money, and not knowing what to do to get it, and make up the Cash against his Master's return from Bristol, was persuaded to comply; upon which he raised several Sums, some of which were in Guineas, the rest in Silver, to the value of about 1000 l. in all, and with that he was shipt off from Harwich; this was the sum of the Evidence against the Prisoners. They by their Counsel pleaded, that they never allured nor inticed Mr. Puplet, neither did they know the money was his Master's; and that he was as forward as they in the whole matter, which was declared upon oath by several Witnesses on their side; that did them no kindness, for the Jury were pleased to consider the bad Consequences of such base Practices as these, so after a long hearing, the said Steward and Rowland were found <rs id="t16931012-24-verdict92" type="verdictDescription">

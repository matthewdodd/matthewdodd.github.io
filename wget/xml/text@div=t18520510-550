                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Joseph Bowman and Mr. May, warehousemen, in Wood-street, Cheapside; I superintend the silk department, which is on the second floor. On Monday last I was engaged in that warehouse, and I saw the prisoner, between 11 and 12 o'clock—a few minutes previously I had seen these handkerchiefs on the counter—when I saw the prisoner he was folding these pieces of handkerchiefs in this wrapper—I should think he was about half a yard from the counter—I observed the ends of the handkerchiefs sticking out of the wrapper—I imme<lb></lb>diately walked towards him—he was coming towards the aperture which leads down stairs—we met together—he was then from two to three yards from the counter—I charged him with the robbery—I cannot be positive what words I used, but I took the wrapper from his hand—I said he had no right to take them, or words to that effect—he at first made no answer, but he said some few minutes afterwards, that he intended buying them—here are two dozen and eight neck handkerchiefs; the value of them is about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took them from the prisoner, took them out of the wrapper, and placed them on the counter—the prisoner then ran down stairs—I followed him, with another young man in our employ, named Kent—I called to the prisoner to stop, and he stopped about the middle of the stairs, towards the bottom—we brought him back, and he was given into custody—I do not know how he had come in to the premises—I have seen him at the warehouse before, and I knew his errand—he called from a party named Coggan to know if we had any goods to be dressed.</p>

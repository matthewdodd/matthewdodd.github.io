               <p>MR. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JAMES DEADMAN. On the 28th of December I entrusted John Hill, my servant, with a horse, cart, and harness, and he never returned; I saw my cart last Tuesday in possession of the prisoner - I knew it to be mine, by one wheel in particular; I asked him where he got it - he said, he bought it of a person who he named, and where he lived; that man is here - he said, he gave 4l. for it; I consider it worth 8l. or 10l., it cost me 18l. six months before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your name on it when you lost it? A. Yes; but when I found it the prisoner's name was on it - the prisoner told me at the public-house, that he would give it up, provided I did not take him before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Being a respectable tradesman he did not wish to go to the office? A. I believe his general character is good; he told me directly that he bought it of Doddridge - I took Doddridge before the Magistrate, and charged him as an accessary, or something; the Magistrate would not entertain the charge, because the thief could not be found.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live in Charlotte-street, Old-street-road. About five months ago Doddridge placed this cart in my yard; it stood there five months, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030039"></xptr>full five hundred people looked at it there - the prisoner is a bedstead-maker, and did business with me; he has several times pulled out his rule, and measured the cart - I told him he might as well buy it; I saw him pay Doddridge for it.</p>
               <p>- DODDRIDGE. I am a painter. I bought this cart at the Bear and Ragged Staff public-house, and I think I gave 3l. for it; I bought it on the 28th of December - here is a memorandum which I made on the following Sunday morning, (reads) "Bought a cart on Friday, the 28th of December, at Smithfield; No. -, name, James Deadman, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, at the Bear and Ragged Staff."</p>

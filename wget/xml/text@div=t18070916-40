At four o'clock I heard my house door open, I got up and found it open; I shut my door, and went to the room where he had lodged; I missed him out of the room, and no one but him; all was at home a-bed, and Stevens was fast asleep.</p>

There was five slept in the room where I lay; there were two that went out before me; I told one of the men to give me a call; he called me. I have subpoenaed this man; he sent me word he was indebted to the landlord, and he would not come forward, for fear the landlord would turn him out.</p>

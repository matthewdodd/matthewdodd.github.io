On the 7th of December last, the prisoner was brought to our workhouse from Shadwell police office; he remained with us until the night of the 10th, and on the night of the 10th he was locked up in a room adjoining the oakum room. On that night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, after I was gone to bed, I heard a noise; it continued louder and louder. I was alarmed. I got up, fearing for the safety of the people in the house. I called up Burn; Burn and me went to the door of the oakum room. I then found the prisoner in the oakum room, and the door was fastened on the inside. When I went to bed it was fastened on the outside. We called to the prisoner; he never spoke. We broke the door open; I saw the prisoner; he was standing forward, with an axe lifted up. Burn attempted to lay hold of the prisoner by the collar; in the mean time I rushed forward to catch the axe. He shifted the axe; he struck me a blow with the back of the axe; it stunned me completely. I was so stunned I do not know how I got the other blow.</p>
               <p>Q. When you recovered yourself in what state did you find your face - A. I had a deep cut at the side of my nose; my nostril was cut quite round, and my lip was cut at the bottom; I believe it was done with the front of the axe. One of my teeth was knocked out, and there is another tooth coming out now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known this man - A. About a fortnight before that he was brought to us from the police office; he was with us three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of your observations upon him do you believe him to be a man in his senses, or not - A. I now believe him to be an insane man.</p>

On the 19th of November my partner taxed him with having lost various things, in my presence, he told him that many times he had missed money out of his desk. and asked him if he knew any thing of it; he said he did not; I asked him if ever he had opened Mr. Haynes desk and where he got the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. I believe you told the prisoner that you had very good reason to know that he was the person that robbed you, and therefore he had better tell you. - A. I asked him to tell the truth; he asked me to intercede with Mr. Haynes for him; I told him I would, if he told the truth, but as he had not told the truth I would not; I asked him where he had got the key that opened this desk; he asked me what key; upon my repeating the question, he said he had opened it. We both asked him what he had taken, he said nothing, he opened it out of curiosity.</p>

            . Q. You had some reason to suspect your property had been taken. - A. I had. On the 19th of November I had the prisoner into my accompting house, I asked him where he got money to purchase such things as he had, he hesitated a long while before I could get any answer from him; when I got an answer, he told me that he had got some money from me. I asked him how much, he told me a very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he told you, had you encouraged him that it would be better for him to tell you. - A. When I first interrogated him, I told him it would be better for him if he would confess; that was prior to Mr. Douglas coming in, if he would not confess I would send for a constable; then he appeared to be frightened, and said he would confess all the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I do not ask you to speak to any thing that he said after the constable came, but whether he produced to you any thing. - A. He went up stairs into his bed room and took out of his box two new sixpences and a few halfpence; I asked him if that was the money he had taken, he assured me it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not repeat what he said; in consequence of conversation you had with the prisoner you made a discovery. - A. I made a discovery of a box of his that he had in Henry-street, he told me the man had some money of his; the man told me he he had no money of his only a box; he directed me to

Four five shilling papers in halfpence, and six five shilling papers in penny pieces; we frequently have two hundred pounds worth of halfpence where we take them from. I found in that box two pieces of canvas that had been cut off the pieces, one shilling in silver, and three knee buckles, and several other articles that are not his own, and there was also a twine box of mine in Tibbey's room.</p>

I am a constable; I was at Mr. Haynes's accompting house when Tibbey brought this box; he gave me the key of it; I opened the box I saw a great quantity of halfpence tied up in parcels in the box I found all the things that are there except one article, a twine box, that we found in Henry-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Haynes. The halfpence were undone by the clerk at Hick's hall; before they were undone then I could swear to them; we are furnished with them from the tallow chandlers, we serve them with candle wicks, the parcels are not marked; I could not swear to them now; this canvas is made into an apron; we had such canvas. These knee buckles I can swear to them, as being my own, and the twine box is my own.</p>

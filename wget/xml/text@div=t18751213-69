                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist at 6, Store Street, Bedford Square—on two occasions the prisoner has passed bad money at my shop, a bad florin on one occasion and a bad shilling on the other—the florin was given to the constable—on the second occasion I saw the prisoner across the road receive something from some one, and he came into my shop and tendered a bad 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I tested the coin with nitrate of silver, which turned it black.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 457). I took the prisoner into custody—he owned that he put the money down, but denied any knowledge of its being bad—Mr. Burton gave me the counterfeit coin—I have it here. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM WEBSTER</hi>. The florin produced is bad.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If a man puts a ls. in his pocket with lucifer matches, provided it is there any time it will turn black; supposing a man who works at a gas factory puts money in his pocket, after it has been there any time it will turn black. It is not because the coin was black that it is not good; I am inflicted with a wound in the thigh, and have been in the prosecutor's shop several times. A child of six years of age would not go a second time if he knew he had done wrong; the young gentleman I spoke to across the road gave me the ls., and he said he had wished he had a thousand of them. Unfortunately he is in Wales, or he would be here to prove that the ls. was good. Another thing they have not produced the ls., my sight is very bad; I might take a piece of lead for a ls., not knowing it to be counterfeit.</p>

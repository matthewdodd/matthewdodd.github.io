                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, and live in Brewer—street, Golden<lb></lb>square. In Feb., the prisoner called on me—I think it was between the 20th and 24th; he asked me to discount him this bill of exchange, which I did—I did not make any inquiries as to the genuineness of the signature—it came due on 21st May; I think it was presented that morning, but not by me—I received notice from my solicitor that it was a forgery—I saw the prisoner a day or two afterwards, and said, "Here is a bill of Hodge's returned a forgery"—he said, "Impossible; I saw him write it.

                  </hi>. I am a piano—forte string maker, and live at 61, Greek-street, Soho. I know the prisoner, and have had a great number of transactions with him about bills—this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) has "Accepted, James Hodge," on it—this is not my writing, decidedly; it is very little like it—I never gave the prisoner authority to write this for me—I never gave him instructions to accept bills for me; he never accepted a bill in my name, to my knowledge—I became informed of this document shortly after it was presented, for pay<lb></lb>ment—I was not in the way when it came—it came to my notice tome time in the same day—some time after that the prisoner called on my solicitor; I bad a very long conversation with him, I should think five or six hours, at the solicitors, Messrs. Pritchard and Collette, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Mr. Neal and Mr. Collette were present—the prisoner said he had been in such difficulty for some considerable time past, that he really did not know what he had been driven to do—Mr. Neal immediately said, "Then you intend to admit having committed a forgery?"—the prisoner said he hoped there would be no advantage taken of anything he might have said there—the words were "Of anything I have said now"—I do not know the date of the con<lb></lb>versation; I think it was Some time in May—I remember the declaration that has been alluded to—I think it was made about a fortnight before he was taken, and I think about a fortnight after the bill was dishonoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner said what you have already told us, had anything been said about the handwriting of the bill, or its being a forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He laid he would give any time that was required for payment of it, if I would only admit it was my signature—I said I would not admit anything of the kind—I am quite satisfied he used the word "will"—I told him I never accepted the bill, and therefore I would not admit anything; I knew nothing about it, neither would I contribute a penny towards it—he had brought me another bill—I think that was some time in April—I do not remember the date—he came to my work—room, and he said, "Don't throw yourself in a passion, Hodge; there will be a bill presented to—morrow, take the notice, and I will make it all right"—I told him I had no bill coming due—he said "Never mind, I will make it all right"—I did not see the billon the day it was presented—I saw it afterwards; this is it—the acceptance is not my writing—it is dated 10th Feb., 1851—it is a two months' bill—it was pre<lb></lb>sented the day after the conversation I have spoken of; the conversation was on 12th April, and on 13th, the bill was presented—I never paid it—I know the prisoner's writing—I believe these letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>) are his writing—I have not the slightest idea as to the writing of the acceptance, "James Hodge," on both these bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Mr. Neal here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he is outside; he is clerk to Messrs. Pritchard and Collette—I believe they are respectable solicitors—I had not this five or six hours conversation to see if I should compromise this matter—I was sent for by my attorney—there was the pri<lb></lb>soner, Mr. Collette, and Mr. Neal—I mean to represent that Mr. Collette was present—the prisoner was without any assistance—we had him amongst us live or six hours—that was after I knew be had committed a forgery upon. me—two or three forgeries have been committed; I do not know who com<lb></lb>mitted them—if I had accepted this bill, I would pay it; but I have not—I did not have the prisoner at my attorney's; I was sent for; I did sot know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070080"></xptr>
               <p>he was to be there—I found him there—I did not give him into custody, for I had nothing to prove that he had forged—I did not want to get a confession, or a compromise; a compromise was not proposed—I believe Mr. Neal sug<lb></lb>gested to him that the best thing he could do would be to go and pay these forged bills—I believe the attorney's clerk did say so in presence of his master—I believe Mr. Collette supposed it was a forgery—I do not suppose they cared about settling the matter—I never heard the name of Gilchrist—no person came in while this conversation was going on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not proposed that somebody should give an acceptance, and did not that person say he would not lend himself to do so—he would' not prefer one creditor to another? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will swear I never said it, or heard it—this last bill which has been put in is a forgery—the prisoner told me this forged bill was to be presented—I did not leave word at my house that when presented the parties were to be told that I was at Exeter—I did not go away—I believe I was in the house at the time it was presented—I did not see the bill—the notice was brought to me—I took it in, and said I should see Brandt on this—I did see him, and told him he had better settle it—I received a copy of a writ for it—I gave instructions to my solicitor—I do not know whether it was ultimately paid—I do not know that the prisoner forged my name on that occasion—I was perfectly satisfied that he knew something about it—I accepted two bills for him after that, after I knew the first was a forgery—Mr. Child showed me two bills, and asked me if that was my sig<lb></lb>nature, I told him it was—I did not deny it—I had not denied it before—he spoke to me about a bill coming due, and my solicitor wrote, by my direction, to say there was no bill coming due, and when it came it was a note of hand payable on demand—Mr. Child did not say, "You scoundrel, do you mean to deny your signature?"—he never made use of such a word—there was a bill purporting to be drawn by James M'Lean, and accepted by me; I denied the signature to that—I afterwards paid it—I was applied to pay a bill—I denied it when the notary called, because it was understood by the drawer that I was not to be called upon—it was an accommodation bill—this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not deny that it was my signature—I said it would not to be paid—I said I was not to be called upon to pay it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you drawn checks upon your bankers over and over again, know<lb></lb>ing that they would not be met? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have drawn checks, on an under<lb></lb>standing with the prisoner that he was to pay the money in on my account before they were presented.</p>

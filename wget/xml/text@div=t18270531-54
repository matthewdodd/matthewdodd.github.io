            . I live in James-street, Lisson-grove. I know the prisoner; he used to call for orders for Messrs. Davenport; I paid him 13l. on their account, on the 24th of June, 1825. I am sure there were eight sovereigns among the money; I took his receipt.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Davenport, of Fleet-street. The prisoner was in their service, as town-traveller, and should account to the cash-keeper for what money he received. On the 29th of June I was cash-keeper; he never paid me this money; here is his book in which he enters the cash he receives; he has entered 8l. received from Stevens on the 24th; he has only accounted for 8l. on the 24th; he left about the 14th of July, the very day we found this account.</p>

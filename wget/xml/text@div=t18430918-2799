                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in Vine-court, Tooley-street, Borough. On the 4th of September, between twelve and one at night, the prisoner came to my place—I had never seen him before, ito my know<lb></lb>ledge—he appeared to be very much in liquor—I said nothing to him, but shut the door—I refused to let him in—with that he burst the door open—it was bolted—the bolt was not quite forced off—the hinges were forced so as to let him in—he came into my room, which is on the ground floor, and dragged me over a place, close against my bedstead, out into the court by the hair of my head, and said he would cut my b—throat—he threw me down and took a clasped knife out of his pocket—it was shut when he took it out, and I saw him open it—he then cut my throat—I called out for assist<lb></lb>ance—a person named Jakes came up, and I saw the prisoner chuck the knife about two yards from him—a young woman who was in the house at the time, went and fetched the police, who came and took the prisoner into custody—I saw the knife picked up by a young man and given into the policeman's hands—it was such a knife as this now produced—the cut was not very deep—I went and got some strapping put on it—I was not attended by any medical man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live about three doors from the prosecutrix—on the night in question I heard a noise at her house, in consequence of which I came to the door, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix scuffling togther—he got her down on the stones outside in the street—I think he had his arms somewhere round her neck at the time—he was on the top of her—I heard him say that he would cut her throat, and saw him take a knife out of his right-hand jacket pocket—I did not notice whether he opened it—she sung out "Murder"—I directly ran, picked the man up from her, and took her in doors—he threw the knife away—I saw it picked up, and given to the police<lb></lb>man—this is it, I believe—it was turned up a little at the point, where it hit against a stone when he chucked it, but that has been altered—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix was bleeding at the throat, and I wiped the blood off—the police came up and took him.</p>

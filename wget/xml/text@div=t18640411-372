I am a mason—on 27th February, between 8 and 9 in the evening, I was in the Queen's-road, Chelsea, looking in at a pie-shop window—the prisoner came upland said: "Go and get me a penny pie and one for yourself"—he put a half-crown into my hand—I went into the shop and asked the pieman to try the half-crown before I asked for the pies—Mr. Selwyn and a young woman were in the shop—I handed the half-crown to the young woman—the prisoner was outside at the time looking in at the window—the young woman gave the half-crown to Mr. Selwyn and he put it in the detector—I then saw the prisoner run away—Mr. Selwyn ran after him.</p>

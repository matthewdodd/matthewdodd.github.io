About 3,30 a.m., March 8th, I was in George Street, Euston Road, near the Orange Tree public-house—the door of the billiard-room stands in from the footpath—I heard a noise inside—I listened for a few moments and saw the prisoner come out from the billiard-room door, with another man not in custody—on seeing me they ran towards Gower Street; I pursued the prisoner and called out, "Stop thief?"—he ran against a lamp-post and I caught him—I was in plain clothes and told him I was a constable—I took him back to the house—I found the billiard-room door open; I woke up the landlord—I found the lock of the door had been wrenched off; on the mat inside the door I found this jemmy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took the prisoner to the station with the assistance of another constable, and charged him with breaking and entering the prosecutor's dwelling-house</p>

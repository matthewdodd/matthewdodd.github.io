            , Little Brick Hill, Buckinghamshire." The first Sunday I was in Newgate, to my astonishment, I saw Sinfield in the chapel - he was convicted last Session of horse-stealing, which horse, I believe, was stolen from Buckinghamshire. I immediately identified him, and when I saw Mr. Sheriff Parkins I told him of the circumstance - he asked if any other person could identify him. I said Yes; he then ordered Sinfield to be put with other persons, and my friends were sent for, they immediately identified him. I requested he might not be sent away, but he was sent to Sheerness, and when he arrived there, I am informed, he wrote a letter to Mr. Hardy, stating that I was innocent.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Marne, who is a horse-dealer, in Great Dover-road, Borough. About the 14th or 15th of April my master sent me into Kent-street. I met a man in the alley on a horse, with a broken knee, and blind in one eye. I asked him the price - he said 4 l. but at last he said I might have it for 3 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you know the horse again - A. Yes; I have not seen it since, but by the description given of it, I think this is it. I met a man about an hour after, who said Deneh had bought it. The prisoner is a costermonger - he did not deal in horses; he kept a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it - A. A young man, rather pale, about my height; he had a brown coat, velveteen breeches, a redish waistcoat, and high-low shoes; he was sitting on an old coat, and had neither saddle or bridle, only a halter in the horse's mouth. The horse looked very poor - this was about nine o'clock on Saturday morning - both its knees were broken, but not bleeding; the skin appeared white.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not have been done so late as the night before - A. No, it was an old wound. I have not seen the man since.</p>

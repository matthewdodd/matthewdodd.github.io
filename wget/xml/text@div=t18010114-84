             sworn. - I am the master of the boy and of the prisoner; I am a farmer at Hadley; Castle has been with me three years and upwards, and Leach since Michaelmas last; on Sunday morning, the 14th of December, I got up early in the morning, about six o'clock, and missed the prisoner; after making some search and enquiry after him, I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment from the box; I immediately called up my next neighbour, and we went in search of him; he was overtaken at Colney, in the road to St. Alban's, with the property upon him, which property was brought back with him, and has been in the care of the constable till now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself? - A. He made very little excuse, scarce any; he had nothing to say against me as a matter; I met with him in the Isle of Sheppy in the greatest distress, and I took him and cloathed him; his father had deferted him, and he was without money and without friends. (James Cox, the constable, produced the property, which was deposed is by Castle.)</p>

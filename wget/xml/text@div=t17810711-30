We kept wrangling till the watchman came; and she gave charge of me, and I gave charge of her; and we were both in the watch-house till Sunday morning, the 17th. She is a woman of the town. She had a swelling on her nose, and could not smell for some time: she said the bridge of her nose was broke.</p>

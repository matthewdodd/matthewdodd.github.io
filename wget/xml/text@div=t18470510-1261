                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William George Harrison, tobacconist, Bucklersbury; the prisoner was in his employment. On Tues<lb></lb>day evening, the 5th of May, he left the premises about seven o'clock—I stopped him as he was leaving, and told him he had some property in his possession—he denied it—I insisted on having the property produced, and he opened a handkerchief which he had in his hand, and this leaf tobacco was in it—it weighs four ounces and a half—he went to the end of the room, and put it into a box in which there was stalk tobacco—that would not get mixed with leaf tobacco—on the following morning I took it out—prisoner asked me what I was going to do with it—I said, "What! you never want it again?"—he said, "No"—I gave it to the foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present on Tuesday evening last when the to<lb></lb>bacco was produced by the prisoner—I have heard Silvester's account—it is correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Harrison. I received the tobacco from Silvester, and gave it to the constable—I was present when Mr. Harri<lb></lb>son gave the prisoner into custody—he asked him if it was true that the to<lb></lb>bacco which I held din my hand had been in his possession—he said he was very sorry for it, but there was not so much as was produced at that time—the value of it is about a half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a usual allowance of tobacco made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; to men like the prisoner there is mostly two ounces delivered to them weekly, but that is manufactured tobacco—the prisoner was sent for, and came directly.</p>

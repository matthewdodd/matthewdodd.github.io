                  </hi>. I am one of the keepers of the Colney-hatch Lunstic<lb></lb>asylum, and perform duty principally in ward "C"—in March in the present year the deceased, William Swift, was placed under my care in that ward—he was about fifty years of ago I should thing; he might be a little more—he was a large built powerful man, very strong—from that period until Wednesday 9th May, he remainted in the ward under my care—on that evening, in consequence of hearing some noise made by him, I went to the door of the door of the room in which he was and opened it; before I had sufficient time to speak to him, he struck me in the eye and seized me by the necktie—he made use of the words, "I have got you now, you b----"—I found that he was near strangling me; I struck him, and we both fell together—I fell sideways; I could not exactly say how—I knew no more till I was released by Reed—in my struggle with Swift, I did not use any more violence than was absolutely necessary for my own protection—I struck him in the pit of the stomach, just here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the place</hi>); a little to the right as near as I could judge—I saw Swift again that evening, about 8 o'clock, in the same room—he only said, "Good night;" that was all—he did not then make any complaint at all of suffering from any injury—it was my duty on the following morning to unlock the door of the room in which he was—I unlocked it about ten minutes past 6—he showed me a bruise which he had on his stomach—he did not complain of any pain or suffering—the bruise was where I pointed before—he did not at that time appear to me to be under any suffering at all in breathing, or in any other way—he made no complaint at all, only showing me the bruise—it was his habit to sweep that ward—he applied to me about half-past 6 for a broom to sweep the ward down as usual—I thought proper not to give it him—I saw him about the ward that morning, the same as usual; he took his breakfast as usual—he was out in the airing-court as usual; he came in and had his dinner the same as usual—it was 1 o'clock when they sat down—after dinner I went down with him to No. 11 ward, and there I left him—that was by Dr. Tyerman's direction—what had taken place the previous night had been reported in the morning—during the whole of that morning, up to the time of my removal of him to No. 11, he did not exhibit any symptoms at all of distress or suffering, or make any complaint at all.</p>

I am an attendant at the Colney Hatch Asylum, and was so on 9th May last—I recollect being called by one of the patients to the assistance of Gann—I went into the room where Gann and Swift were—I found Gann lying down on the floor and the patient had got him fast by the throat, by the necktie, and had one knee on the floor—I took hold of his hand and said, "Leave go, Swift," and he let go immediately—this was between 6 and 7 o'clock, or it might be a little after 7—before I left the room with Gann I desired Swift to go to bed—he did so in my presence—I said, "Swift, go to bed," and he went to bed directly—he was undressed—he had nothing on but his shirt—he got into bed directly—I saw him after<lb></lb>wards at 8 o'clock; he was then in bed—he did not get up at all, or make any complaint to me—I did not notice anything peculiar in his breathing—I did not go into his room—I unlocked the door and saw him lying in bed—I spoke to him; I bade him good night—he said, "Good night, old fellow," or something similar to that—I saw him again on the subsequent morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock, sitting in the recess in No. 5.—he was dressed; he had dressed himself—I did not speak to him then—nobody had dressed him that I know of—I never knew any one to dress him—he did not make any complaint to me then—he said to me, as I was walking up the gallery, "Charley, it was a lucky job for him that you came last night; if you had not I should have killed him"—I cannot say whether he appeared to have his breathing affected at that time, or to walk with any difficulty—I did not notice anything—I saw him again that day—I believe he was shifted that day—I saw him after six o'clock that day—I cannot say that he had anything the matter with him at the different time I saw him.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose he told you he had killed a man twelve months ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should investigate the matter—if he told me he had killed a man in Australia, I should not rely upon his simple statement—he is under the delusion that poison has been administered to him, antecedently to his being with me—I believe that to be a delusion—that is his principal delusion—as a result of that delusion he believes that his system has been much injured—I have no doubt he sincerely believes all that—I believe it to be utterly untrue—at first I could detect no delusion about Varney; but his delusion is that he has been the subject of persecu<lb></lb>tion by the parochial authorities from whence he was sent, and by the officials of the Asylum where he has been—I think there is no foundation for it; I believe it to be a delusion—I have not heard him use threats against any persons—he was not violent when' he talked about these perse<lb></lb>cutions, he was quiet and calm—I was not able to defect any other delusion—I tried to discover—I have read the account of what took place at the inquest and before the Magistrate—I was informed that I should be required to give evidence on this subject a few days after the lunatics were placed under my care.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it a fact that lunatics may have a delusion upon one subject and yet reason correctly upon others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—persons labouring under delusions may state facts correctly; their memory is not necessarily affected from their having a delusion upon one subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Upon Samuel Clark, one of the lunatice, being called</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">sub<lb></lb>mitted that, as further evidence appeared upon the depositions relating to the state of mind of the witness, the prosecution should first lay that evidence before the Court, as, primd facie, the evidence of a lunatic was not admissible.</hi>

I live at Grove-hall—I remember residing at Colney Hatch—I know the two prisoners—I know their names—they were two at<lb></lb>tendants at Colney Hatch—I knew a man of the name of Swift—I was not acquainted with his death until the Tuesday—on the Saturday I saw him taken from the airing court into the ward—that was about ten minutes to 5 o'clock—Vivian caught hold of him with his right hand—he went to take him by the collar, and the man said that he would go where he pleased with him; he simply dropped his hand, as though I was going to take hold of this gentleman's arm—Mr. Slater was there—there were some men coming in from walking round the building, from the airing; Mr. Vivian met Slater</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170030"></xptr>
               <p>as he was coming in, and said he had been waiting for him, as he could not keep Swift out of the ward; Mr. Slater immediately said, "We had better have him in at once"—they took Swift into the ward and threw him down, by catching him by the collar and tripping his feet from under him—Vivian did that—he tripped his legs from under him—he fell on his back—they then kicked him, and punched him—and jumped on him with their knees, and stamped with the foot on his chest; here (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—they put him into the padded room after that—they went in—I could then hear the noise of their ill-treatment, and him calling out—it might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes that it lasted—I heard him call out "Murder!" once; and he was calling out not to be kicking of him, ill-using him in that way—as I went in from the airing court I saw him in an inclined position—he was in the padded room—I went from the airing court into the ward—I could then see into the padded room—Slater and Vivian were there then—I saw Slater's hand on his head, and he drew up his legs as though to shift his position—Slater just looked round towards the door as if there should be a rush by the patients from the noise that was made; it could have been heard all over the build<lb></lb>ing—Slater had his hand on Swift's head, and looked round towards the door—Vivian was on his left, standing erect—Swift was lying in his back with his face towards the airing court, and as the patients came in he drew up his legs—the patients came in from the airing court; that was the ward for them to come in; Slater said, "We had better have them in as it will be heard all over the building"—he gave the word immediately for "All in"—I went into a recess and sat down—I did not see anything more—Inever saw Swift again—when he was put into the padded room he was partly undressed—his trousers were down—he took off his stockings, shoes, coat, waiscoat, braces, and handkerchief—I did not see whether he was more undressed than that before Slater and Vivian left.</p>

               <p>every time they gave any blows or kicks he drew himself from them, but he never struck, or showed any signs of resistance at all—this kicking and stamping continued nearly an hour, and during that hour they were frequently kicking him as hard as they could kick him—they had their boots on—during the whole of that hour he was screaming as loud as he could scream.</p>

               <p>about 7 o'clock, he sat down to breakfast with me; but I heard him talking to Slater at the bath-room door—he complained to Slater of being hurt inside—he said it was too bad to kick him so, and he put his hand up to his breast in this manner—Slater seemed to take but little notice—he did not talk violently to Swift at that time—Swift ate his breakfast that Satur<lb></lb>day morning—I saw him during the day in the ward, he appeared very much hurt in sitting down and getting up—I noticed that—he dined on that day at the same table; he ate it all to the best of my knowledge—after dinner that day we went out into the airing court—I went out of the building that afternoon, we went to Southgate to paly at cricket, and I left Swift as usual—I returned again about seven or ten minutes past—when I went into the ward the door was shut—I heard Swift in the room—I did not see anything of him—I never saw him again.</p>

               <p>May—I know I was in that quarter of the establishment once or twice—I do not recollect seeing him at this distance of time—I recollect seeing him on more than one occasion before his death—I did not at that time feel his pulse, not in the interval from the time he had been removed into No.11 ward—I heard of the attack he made upon Gann—on Saturday evening, the 12th Slater came to may residence and gave me information—it would take a minute or two to get to my residence from the asylum—he came between half-past 7 and a quarter to 8—he told me that the patient Swift was very ill, if not already deceased—he led me to suppose that his state of danger was so great, that I might possibly find him dead when I got there—he said that Swift was very ill, having had a fit, I think—I immediately accompanied Slater to the padded room, and found Swift lying upon the mattress, straight out upon his back, with his night-clothing on, dead—there was no contraction of the muscles or anything of that kind, he was quite straight out—I observed on mark of external violence on the right side of the stomach, a large bruise—Slater stated that he had fallen in a fit in the ward—I asked some particulars about the fit, of Slater and Vivian—I asked them on the circumstances of his death, and they told me that he had a fit—I am not quite sure at this time whether there were not two fits described—I think so—I am pretty certain it was first stated that he had a fit from which he partially recovered, and appeared better, and that then he appeared worse and was palced in bed—I am not clear what was said about another fit—I do not distinctly recollect whether it was worse I am sure, and then was palced in bed—it would be my duty to make a report of any matter of that kind-Slater and vivian said it was an epileptic fit—the post mortern examination was made on the following Monday morning in my presence—they told me they left him to attend to the other patients, who were then, I think, at supper—they both agreed as to that—I forget which first stated it—there are so many thousand fits occuring in the course of the year that it would be impossible to fetch a medical man to every individual fit that occurs to an epileptic—there are, perhaps, 30,000 or 40,000 in the course of a year, in one department alone; but if any extraordinery circumstances appear, if the fit does not pass off, and if there is any danger, it is the duty of the attendant to fetch a medical man—during the time Swift had been under my care he had not suffered from epilepsy to my knowledge—I think I have recollection enough of the post-mortem examination the answer you the particulars—a great portion of the arch of the chest was frac<lb></lb>tured on both sides, across the sternum—there were several ribs on each side broken and the breast-bone was also broken across—the sternum is the centre of the chest, and that was fractured across, about the centre—there were two slight ruptures of the liver—there was an extravasation of blood in the abdomen to the extent of two or three pints, I presume coming from the ruptured liver—there was no appearance of inflammation in the liver—with regard to the chest we found some serous effusion into it which was evidence of a certain amount of excitement in the membrane, the pleura<lb></lb>that was in the pleural cavity; the cavity at the side of the chest—there was an effusion of serous fluid into the chest which was tinged with blood—there was no symptom of inflammation about the lungs—I should say that the fracture of the arch of the chest down on each side and across was not ac<lb></lb>compamied</p>

               <p>by displacement of the bone—there was no depression of the bone, no fragments of bone pressing on the lungs; there was no manifest appearance that the bone had at any time penetrated—the nature of the matter that was deposited, of which there was an effusion, was a blood<lb></lb>tinged fluid; at all events tinged with the colouring particles or colouring matter of the blood—it was reddish, blood-stained—that was in the chest—it was on one side of the chest here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to his own chest</hi>), the cavity which contains the lungs—I could tell you by looking at my notes on which side it was—I made these notes at the moment of the post-mortem examination on the Monday following the death of the patient—I had not then heard of any complaint against the prisoners in reference to this paticular case—I had heard of the attack upon Gann by the patient and nothing more—I had not heard of any alleged attack by these two persons in the most remote degree—these notes were all made at the same time—probably this first memo<lb></lb>randum might have been made before I went into the autopsy room, but just at the moment, (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>:) "William Swift, aged 54, admitted apparently paralysed, 24th February, 1860—recovered to a great extent and became stout and muscular—epilepsy—evening of May 12th, died between 7 and 8 p.m.—married—a labourer—great violence—lately attempted to throttle master of workhpuse of Aldgate, and also and attendant Gann, at Colney Hatch"—I did not get any of the particulars I have just read from the pri<lb></lb>soners—now I come to the autopsy<lb></lb>"Right ribs 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th; left 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th; echymosis of left costal pleura"—that means the external portion of the pleura—"An effusion of three ounces of sanguineous fluid in right pleural cavity; echymosis of right costal pleura; sternum fractured across the centre; lungs cretefied, tubercles of right sper, generally healthy and moderately collapsed"—that refers to the lungs—"Heart not well contracted; right side empty; left side also empty and not well contracted; a layer of blood in the under mudiastinum—abdomen, a large quantity of partly coagulated blood in the abdominal cavity—liver, laceration two inches long, not deep, at the anterior surface of left lobe of the liver; slight superficial laceration on right lobe; mark on the right face and neck and lower part of right ear; bruise and ecchymosis underneath the abdominal integuments at right of umbilico; slight bruise onn right wrist; outer side—brain, before dissection 55 3/4 ounces, after, 54 3/4 "—there is the figure of "I" which implies that there was a loss of one ounce of fluid passed into the liver from old disease of that organ—the heart was wholly un<lb></lb>touched by any fractured bone—it did not appear to have been touched.</p>

               <p>I think perfectly so—they do not under that state manifest evidence of pain under severe injuries, fractures—I have known cases of patients with that form of insanity endeavouring to go about their ordinary occupation with broken limbs of bones, and also in another form associated with epilepsy, in a way that a sane person could not do—I have known that occur in Colney Hatch Asylum with persons whose ribs I have subsequently discovered to have been broken—I have noticed and reported such cases, and carefully attended to them for the purposes of science; I remember the case of a person there who fractured the left clavicle or collar-bone, and he did not appear to suffer the least pain; he moved his arm almost as freely as before, somewhat to my astonishment—a sane person could not have done that—there is a wide dif<lb></lb>ference between the two—I remember another patient who, in kicking at the door of the padded room, fractured the left patella or knee-cap; he walked about with a considerable amount of facility a few days afterwards without any apparent pain whatever; that could not have been done by a person perfectly sane and having the usual amount of feeling, not in a state of sobriety, a person intoxicated might possibly do so; the nervous system alters—I remember a patient dying rather suddenly from collapse; at the post-mortem examination I found that several ribs were fractured, they were comparatively recent fractures, I mean wihtin a few days of his death; between the time of the accident and his death I saw that man walking about in his usual way—he made no complaint; on the contrary, on the morning of the day he died he said he was quite well; upon further post-mortem examination extensive fractures of the ribs on both sides were disclosed, and injury to the pleura—nothing whatever was known of it up to the time of his death—the cause of all that, occurred three or four days before—an inquest was held in that case—I have known repeated cases where patients have suffered injuries of this description without any appearance of pain—I have been connected with lunatic asylums for twenty years, as superintendent of the Cornwall Lunatic Asylum and that at Colney Hatch, and during that period I have seen many cases—such cases are con<lb></lb>stantly occurring under the eyes of most scientific men—Dr. Forbes Winslow is an authority on these matters—the paralysis of which I have been speaking is a form which supervenes upon insanity—I have been in court during the greater part of the day—I have heard the description of the violence said to have been exhibited by the prisoners to the deceased immediately before his death—I do not think it could possibly have taken place without leaving some mark upon the external system, beyond the mere bruise that I discovered—a single blow may cause death without leaving any external mark—I should not expect that a great number of very heavy blows and kicks, such as have been described, could be inflicted without leaving any external mark—the immediate cause of death was h✗morrhage from the liver, producing collapse—if the bones were fractured on the Wednesday without being displaced, a fall on the Saturday, in con<lb></lb>sequence of a fit, would tend to displace them more than if they had not been previously fractured—the ruptures of the liver were not in the imme<lb></lb>diate vicinity of the fractures—there were two normal ruptures—I should suppose that the liver would be more likely to be ruptured in consequence of losing the protection of the frame-work—I could trace a connexion between the bruise on the upper part of the abdomen, and the disruption of the liver—there might be a possible associated between the two in this way, that a very heavy blow upon the abdomen might cause rupture of the liver—I believe it possible that the bones may have been broken on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior surgeons of King's Col<lb></lb>lege Hospital, and am also Professor of Anatomy—I have been so for twenty years or more—I have been in Court during the whole of the evidence, and I have heard the condition described upom the post-mortem examination of the deceased—taking that as the basis of my opinion, I believe the proximate cause of death to have been collapse; fainting, arising either from the loss of blood from the the liver, or the effect that a very severe accident of any kind always had on the nervous system—supposing the injuries described on the chest, the ribs that were broken, and the sternum, to have taken place on the Wednesday, I do not believe that that person could have walked about, eaten, his meals, and appeared to be in good health up to the Saturday; I do not believe it to be possible—I understand that aboput eleven ribs were broken, besides the breast-bone, and that a great part of the chest was injured; that would consequently impede the breathing, therefore there would be a change very obsefvable in the mode of breathin, and dependant upon that would also be a chagne in the pulse—it would probably by hard, provided he had recovered from the immediate effect of the accident, the collapse, which must be presumed if he had lived for a day or two after—the effect on the breath would show itself externally, thus (<hi rend="italic">descrubing it</hi>)—we breathe with regularity, a certain number of times in a minute, with more or less tran<lb></lb>quillity</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170041"></xptr>
               <p>but there would be a diffuculty in drawing his breath if the walls of the chest, the ribs, were extensively broken, and especially if the breast<lb></lb>bone were broken; and itr would exhibit itself externally in the way I have described—I should call it a panting, a hard and struggling breathing—it would not prevent his eating his food—the same appearance of breathing would be visible during the time of his eating—that appearance of breath<lb></lb>ing would be continuous—it is not such an appearance I think as to escape the attention of a medical man—I heard, likewise, of the rupture of the liver, and the extravasation of blood in the abdomen—supposing it to have occurred on the Wednesday I think that quantity could not have been dis<lb></lb>coverable; the liver may be ruptured to the slight degree I heard without any very manifest symptoms, but if I recollect rightly about two pounds, that is, about two pints, of blood were lost out of the liver—I cannot come to any very distinct conclusion on that point, as to when it was done—those injuries were inflicted, I should think, shortly before the death, perhaps a few hours, certainly, I should say, not more than a few hours—with these par<lb></lb>ticular injuries a lunatic, or a person in any condition of body, would not be able to alter the state of his breath—the difference between the mode in which a lunatic sustains an accident is this, that a lunatic having broken his collar-bone, or his thigh, or his arm, say his thigh, will do what a sane person will not do, attempt to stand upon it; and if the limb is capable of sustaining him he may do so, or he may make a blow with his broken arm, and he does not manifest any sense of pain, but if his tongue is cut, or his chest is broken in, that is, his sense of talking or breathing, then his lunacy would not help him to carry on the functions of his body any more than in the case of a sane person—the puse would be different if the loss of blood had taken place at once; if it had been gradual loss it might not—it was a very slight wound of the liver, which is an organ that bleeds very profusely when injured—if the loss had been gradual it might not have affected his pulse manifestly, but if it had taken place within the moment, the half hour or so on, it would affect it—supposing injuries of that kind had occurred on the Wednesday and the death on the Saturday, I should undoubtdly have expected to find symptoms of inflammation—that applies both to the injuries of the chest and liver, but more especially to the chest.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In giving that opinion about the breaking of the ribs, and the consequent effect upon the pulse and also upon the breathing, are you assuming that the chest was knocked in, or merely that the bones were fractured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely that the bones were fractured; not necessarily displaced—I am presuming that they were not displaced; I understood that they were not; not at all—certainly there would be con<lb></lb>siderable impediment to the breathing, in my judgment and experience in such cases—the muscles which assist in breathing are attached to the ribs, and the ribs being separated, they would lose their purchase—some of them come round the sternum, they lie between; others are attached—supposing the sternum were ruptured to actual separation, and assuming the cartilage was not displaced, that there was something still which held it together, I think that it undoubtedly would affect the muscular system; the mere breaking of the bone without displacing the cartilage round it—that alone would affect the breathing, to such an extent, that any observant persons, such as these gentlemen who have been examined, must notice it—I have had no experience of the intelligence of keepers of asylums, but I think you</p>

               <p>would observe it; any intelligent person would—within a couple of days or so it produces an uncontrollable tendency to cough, the irritation is so great and uncontrollable, even by a person suffering under the form of paralysis which induces the absence of pain—notwithstanding all those con<lb></lb>ditions, I still think that an ordinary person would obseve the difference; these are involuntary muscles and not paralysed by the kind of palsy so described—supposing the system of the chest to be broken and not displaced, I should say a patient would not feel any difficulty in sitting down or getting up—I do not think a sane person would move about much; how far a lunatic would do so, I cnnot say—I have seen accidents occurring to lunatics brought into hospitals, but have had no further practice amongst lunatics—a person may break two or three ribs or more and be almost un<lb></lb>conscious of it; it depends upon the rib—I should not like to venture to define very accurately how much of the sternum or how many of the ribs may be broken without the person betraying these symptoms; but the breaking of a breast-bone is a very different thingt from the breaking of a rib—I think that the sternum is searcely ever broken without the ribs being broken; I never saw it—I should not like to say how many ribs might be broken without showing the symptoms; a great point is finding so many ribs broken—I do not know of an instance of the breast-bone being broken without the ribs, except by one shock—assuming the breast-bone or one or two ribs to be broken on the Wednesday, it might happed that from a little extra violence, a fall or anything of that sort, the rest would follow and the other ribs would go; it would be more likely; it would depend upon where the breast-bone was broken—supposing the main bone of the breast to be broken through and one or two ribs to have gone with it, the rest would be more likely to break from want of support—I never saw the breast-bone broken without considerable innury to the ribs; I do not con<lb></lb>ceive it could be broken alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the evidence of the number of kicks, the stamping, and the blows of the fist, do you think all that could have occurred without leaving any marks at all externally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen such extraordinary injuries without any external sign, that, although I should certainly have expected there would have been marks seen, I would not say that it was impossible, but I should have expected marks on his body—if it was pos<lb></lb>sible with one blow, every additional blow would render it more impro<lb></lb>bable—I think the effect of the kicking would be more likely to be seen than the stamping.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons and senior surgeon at the London Hospital—I am also surgeon to St. Luke's Hospital for lunatics—I have been connected with that hospital for forty years—in the course of my duties at the London Hospital some 10,000 or 12,000 accidents come under my observation in the course of a year, they do not all come under my observation—I have heard the medical evidence in this case and the description of the post mortem appearances—in my judgment the injuries that I have heard detailed were the proximate cause of death; I include the whole of the injuries collectively—I think it not probable that those injuries were inflicted on the Wednesday, he not suffe<lb></lb>ring in the interval between the Wednesday and Saturday—I should say they were inflicted at no considerable period before death; I mean a few hours before death, so that there was not a sufficient interval for inflammatory disease to occur—I have heard Mr. Tucker state that be felt the man's pulse at 1 o'clock on the day of his death, and that it was then in a healthy con<lb></lb>dition—I do not think that is at all consistent with the previous infliction of such injuries as these—the injuries to the sternum and ribs would most undoubtedly cause a perceptible effect upon the respiration—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Partridge, and, in the main, I agree with it—I believe that insane persons can conceal pain or not feel it; but as regards the dis<lb></lb>turbance of functions, I think they cannot conceal it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you take in all classes of in<lb></lb>sane patients at St. Luke's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not every class; they reject paralytic and epileptic cases, they are sent to other asylums—the absence of pain is not limited to paralytic patients, nor chiefly so—I do not know that there really is an absence of pain; there is an absence of expression—it arises from a dullness of the nervous system from some cause, but not necessarily from paralysis—I would not say generally from paralysis—we sometimes find insane patients suffering from other causes with an apparent absence of pain—I do not know that I have known cases where, with broken ribs, a patient has sung and danced j but I have known them move about without any apparent inconvenience, with one or two or even three ribs broken; I might perhaps go to the extent of three; they would not necessarily suffer a great deal of inconvenience—I should agree with Mr. Partridge in not going beyond the third rib—Dr. Forbes Winslow is an authority on these matters—I can easily believe that a person may walk about with a broken rib without showing any signs of suffering—I think the whole of the fractures collectively must necessarily have occurred recently—if one rib is fractured the adjoining ribs will always support the walls of the chest; even with the sternum broken it might not materially weaken the functions of respiration—a patient might not evince pain with one or two ribs broken, and the functions of respiration might not be materially interfered with—I do not mean that it was because I found so many ribs broken that I think the injury must have occurred immediately before death; but there was no evidence of inflammation—the excitement in the pleura might arise from the effusion of blood at the time of the accident—it might also be evidence of inflammation in connexion with other things; but those other things in this case were apparently absent, at least, they were not mentioned—it is because so many as eleven ribs were broken and the liver ruptured, that I think all this must have occurred shortly before death, in connexion with the absence of symptoms previous to the Saturday—I could not undertake to say how much of the injury might have occurred on the Wednesday and yet the man have lived till the Saturday; perhaps he might have lived with</p>

               <p>the whole of the injuries, but he would have exhibited in the interval very marked symptoms of distress in his breathing—if the system had severely been fractured on the Wednesday and not displaced till the Saturday, I still think there would have been so marked an alteraton in the breathing as necessarily to have excited the attention of any ordinary person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the symptoms of inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A deposition of a pecular fibrinous matter on the surface of the pleura or the peritoneun, with an increased turgescence of the vessels of the parts—there may also be the effusion ofserous fluid as stated.</p>

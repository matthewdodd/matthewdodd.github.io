            ; the prisoner was a single man, and said, he never was in a church till he went with me. We were married on the 28th of May, 1788. We lived together till this about these ten weeks past. I have had two children by him; but one has since died for want. When he went,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140060"></xptr>he said, I should never set sight of him again, as he was going to have another wife. He left me very distressed; I had not above a shilling or two in my pocket. He came, and took the sheets off the bed, and two silver spoons out of my pocket. I walked about afterwards for three weeks or a month, to trace out, if I could find out, where he was.</p>

             sworn. - On the 13th of this month in the evening, about half-past nine at night, she came into my house, the Goldsmiths' Arms, Bedfordbury, Covent Garden; a few days before that, she came into my house, about the same hour, and called for a pint of porter, and sat down in my house about half an hour or more; on her going away she said she could not drink all the beer; she would take what was remaining in the pot to No. 4, Turner's court, where she lived, and she would return the pot the next morning, about eight o'clock; the next morning she came in, and wanted half a pint of purl; I had no fire lighted, the young woman was then lighting it; she then said, as you have no fire, I will take it home and make it warm at my own apartment, and I will return the pots by and by; I gave her the half pint of purl, and took no more notice; I went over at the regular time to fetch my pots in, to this No. 4, and went to every apartment in the house, and no such person lived there then; on the 13th, a few days from that she came in the evening, and called for the pint of porter which I have mentioned; I knew the prisoner immediately; I

             the pint of porter and gave it her, and said, madam, you did not return those two pint pots which you had; yes, sir, says she, did not you get them; I said, how should I get them; she said she put them outside of the door, and very likely some other publican's servant had taken them away; I asked her to oblige me, and let me walk with her, to her apartment; she said, very well, I will go with you; after which I went into the parlour with a shilling's worth of brandy and water, and she absconded with the pot, though she was drinking her beer in the house; I went after her, and overtook her by the mouth of Turner's court; I then said to her, I will go with you and see if I can find my pots in the house; when she got into the court she did not know which way to turn, she stood a little time, and went into No. 1, I told her that was not the number she directed me to; here I live, says she, will you stop at the door till I go up stairs; I was a stranger in the neighbourhood; I kept close to the prisoner, and when she had got up a few stairs, I found a pint pot of mine on her; after finding the pot, she said, she would shew me where she sold the pots; as such I called upon my friend Mr. Perfect and he went with me and her, and by her direction I went to Akerman's house, an old iron-shop in Vine-street, Chandois-street, we went into Akerman's house, and enquired if he had any pots of Mr. Perfect's (he is a neighbour opposite to me) or Mr. White's, he was the publican I succeeded; he said he had no pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of Wilkins's? - A. Yes; two pint pots; after our persevering, he handed over two from behind the counter, the prisoner was present at the time; he said he had just received them from the prisoner, and gave her six-pence a pound for them; Mr. Wilkins's name was upon them both;

             and Akerman both begged for mercy, and hoped we would not punish them it being the first that either of them had done,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200043"></xptr>we sent for a constable to secure the parties, and I took one of the pots to Wilkins.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the prisoner in the charge of Godsell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilkins come with you to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; when Mr. Wilkins came to Akerman's with me, he saw the man and the woman together, he told Akerman he could swear to that being his property, they said nothing; afterwards he took a candle and looked in the woman's face, he said he knew the woman and her friends, and as such would not prosecute; they remained in the hands of the constable, and were taken to the Magistrate; Mr. Wilkins was sent for by the Magistrate and bound over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Wilkins said he would not prosecute, he knew her and her friends? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Akerman's you told her that your object was to take her as a witness; I ask you whether your object was not to prosecute the receiver and not the thief? - A. No, my object was to prosecute both.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you asked him if he had any pots, he immediately produced them? - A. He denied having them at first, after that he acknowledged to one; we after that searched more and found another.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they new? - A. They are the same as new.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they were to be sold, they would be sold as second-hand pots? - A. They would be sold for the same as new, if a person was to succeed another.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not worth above a shilling? - A. I have not been in the habit of selling one, therefore I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Mr. Forbes fetched me on the 13th of January, about nine o'clock at night; I went to Akerman's house, No. 2, Vine-street, Chandois-street, and in the parlour I saw two pint pots with the name of Wilkins on them; one old pint, half mutilated, and some solder melted down, and one as good as new; I asked the woman where she had got them; she made me no answer to that; she owned she had sold them for fivepence a piece; Akerman said he gave her sixpence a piece for them, and he begged for mercy, and hoped we would overlook it; while we were putting the things together, he absconded for about an hour, and his brother was in the parlour; I told the brother I understood the house belonged to him, and if he did not come back, he should stand in his shoes; his brother's wife then informed me, if I would not take her husband, she would go and see if she could find him, and he came back again. (Produces the pots.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Akerman before? - A. I had information of his house being a fence shop - a shop for buying swags.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is that? - A. Buying stolen property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not the prisoner Akerman say that he had received them from Bethell, the other prisoner? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that he had bought them, and gave sixpence a piece for them, which he believed to be the value? - A. I cannot say that he said what was the value; he said that he gave sixpence a piece, and she said fivepence; his brother offered ten pounds to let him go. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Bethell called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

P. R.," on it—I never saw it opened, and had nothing to do with it—it was fetched away afterwards by either Mr. Bolton or Mr. Peach, my clerk informed me—I did not try and ascertain who it was—I did not know what it contained, or who brought it, and it was taken away without my knowing who took it, but my clerk said that Mr. Peach or Mr. Bolton had fetched it—on 2nd February I sent the prisoner 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 7th January I paid him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by a cheque on Messrs.

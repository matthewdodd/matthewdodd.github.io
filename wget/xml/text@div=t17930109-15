About five o'clock in the afternoon, on Friday last, I lost this cloak a little above <placeName id="t17930109-15-crimeloc78">Middle Row, Holborn</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17930109-15-crimeloc78" type="placeName" value="Middle Row, Holborn"></interp>

I was coming towards Middle-Row; I was coming along, a sudden motion I felt at my pocket caused me to turn about. I found immediately my pocket was picked; and, from the sudden motion, I naturally put my hand in my pocket; and I found a black silk cloak was taken out of my great coat pocket Two men were turning about, on which I followed them immediately; and, in about ten paces, I laid hold of them. I said to the people about, give me assistance, these two villains have robbed me. I laid hold of the two; and they being too strong, forced themselves from my hands; on account of that I cries out stop thief; the witness present lays hold of one, and I laid hold of the prisoner; he ran round a coach; and I took him. I took him then into a shop, and the person said, I saw that fellow with his hand in a gentleman's pocket not half an hour ago; and I think you are bound in justice, for the good of the public, to prosecute him; in consequence of that, we sent to the patrole, and conducted him to the rotation office, from thence he was committed. The prisoner is one of them that I see who got round behind the coach; before ever they got round this coach, I had got them; and they broke from me and ran round the coach. I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that I first saw; for he was-never out of my sight till he broke away from me; and I am quite sure that he is one of the two men that I saw near me when I felt that motion at my pocket; there was no any other man ten paces before or behind, but these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had that cloak in your pocket? - About half an hour, I had been to conduct a young lady home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090024"></xptr>and I put it in my pocket coming home, I came from Argyle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you felt that motion had you any occasion to take notice, whether you had your cloak in your pocket? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it is possible it might have been lost? - It is possible, but I do not believe it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was making water the corner of Southampton-buildings, and when he catched hold of me, I said I was very willing to be searched.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On my oath it is false, so far from that, they were walking side by side, and turning into Southampton-buildings.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the robbery; Mr. Staff called for assistance and I gave it to him; the prisoner at the bar was the first person I saw run from him, and I seized him; I was coming up Holborn towards him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am an hard working man, I work up at Marybone, I lodge in Fleet-lane; what this gentleman accuses me of, I know no more about than a child unborn, I told him he was welcome to search me; I am a hard working lad, and been brought up all my life time at sea.</p>

               <p>Mr. Warriner. I am the justice's clerk, I heard French confess he knock'd the man down, and own'd that to be the stick; he said, he took away the hat, and sold it to an old cloaths woman for a shilling, and shar'd the money, and that Holmes had six-pence ; Holmes said, he was in company with French, but was at a distance, and that French would have kill'd the prosecutor if he had not gone up, there is the knife in court, with which French was to have cut his throat.</p>

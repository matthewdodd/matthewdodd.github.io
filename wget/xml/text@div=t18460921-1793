                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Hayward—we keep a shop in Bishopsgate—the prisoner called on me for orders for Mr. Peppercorne—I gave him an order about the middle of April—he brought the goods, two gross of blacking, from Mr. Peppercorne—he said he was not to receive the money then, but he would call again—I said I preferred paying on delivery—he said he was not to receive it then—he called next day and said he called for that little account—I believe he said for Mr. Peppercorne—I gave my little boy two sovereigns to give him—I saw him pay it, and saw the prisoner sign the bill—this is it.</p>

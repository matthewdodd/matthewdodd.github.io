               <p>Blackfriars-road—I have had occasion to look at the stock, to see whether we have any missing—I did that at the end of October—I found between 300 md 400 reams which I could not account for—I have seen the emery-cloth which is produced—it is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—that is the invoice price—that is the way in which our paper is labelled when it leaves our place—the second quality cloth is 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and the selling price of the glass<lb></lb>paper is 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are the wholesale prices—I did not know the prisoner till I saw him at the police-court—we had no account with him—I super<lb></lb>intend the town department in the business—we have different sized figures for goods sent about town, and to the country—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) will illustrate it; the small figures are the country, and the large ones are the town—we generally begin every month with one, for town, but the country numbers go all through the year—we have numbers in our books for town which run above 505—I have the books here—these are the town and country order books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in October the numbers went higher than 505—I have got August here—I made the entries myself in September—the highest in August was 590, and the other was 364—in the course of our business I never knew a town order rise above 1,000—the date of this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is 7th September; it is for emery-cloth, emery and glass<lb></lb>paper, and sundry things, from Jameson &amp; Co., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne—I have examined those goods which are the subject of this inquiry; they are our manufacture—the selling price of Scotch glue, from our place, is 63<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—I do not remember, in the course of my business, going to Mr. Barnes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you yourself take stock last October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I ascertained that there was some stock missing by counting the stock we had in hand—it was all packed in reams—I do not know what quantity of stock there was—I have not my book here—I took the stock by counting the reams—they would not be in the place where these were kept—this was a surplus stock that was kept in two or three different rooms—at one time, I should think, there were 900 reams of surplus stock—I cannot speak for certain—I cannot tell about how much in October; it was between 500 and 600—this paper was packed in reams, and placed in certain rooms; and the account was taken of what was sent up then—one of the young men took that account—he is not here—it is by a comparison with what he wrote or said, that I speak to a certain quantity being missing—if he sent up twenty reams he would furnish me with an account of it; and if he took down five reams he would give me an account of that—I made up my account from that; and when I looked at that book there was a deficiency—that book is in our counting-house—we had no check at all upon the young man's accuracy—I did not, nor did any person under my orders, see that he accur<lb></lb>ately took the surplus stock—we trusted to him—it altogether depended on the accuracy of his paper—he is not in our employment now—I do not know where he is—this surplus stock was in three rooms, on the first floor, the middle of the factory—the manufacturing portion is above and below—this was between the two—after the surplus stock was manufactured, it was packed into reams similar to these, and brought down into the warehouse first, by the manufacturer—the warehouse is on the ground floor in front of the house, and the manufacturing premises are at the back—the whole quantity manufactured is brought into the warehouse—no account is taken of that, so as to comprehend the whole stock, including the surplus stock—when an order is being executed, the paper is put behind the press that it is packed in, in the warehouse—it is not marked before it is packed—the stamping is done before it is made—I made these numbers—they would be made to agree with the book—that is put on the packing note, and is not put on the goods before they are packed—the number is put on at the time they are packed—each packet would be numbered, ana they would be all stacked together, behind the packer's press—suppose there are ten packages of this sort, all going to Newcastle, to one man, when the operation is com<lb></lb>plete, some person puts them together in a package, they are put into a railway-carriage, and sent to Newcastle—a label and number is put on each package we send, and they are left for the packer to send them together—we have not a very large business over the counter—last year it was about 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, up to October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that occasionally when persons come in for a town order, there being some packages ready stacked for the country, that they have been handed over, the figures altered, of course, and altered from a country order to a town order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been done, but not to my know ledge—the goods sold over the counter do not have numbers on—if a man comes in to buy a ream of paper it does not go through our books, and therefore does not have a number—the man who does that ought, properly to erase and alter the mark—if goods are sold over the counter we cannot put a number on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller—I have not travelled for orders exactly in this particular trade—I know the prisoner; he lives in New-street, Borough-road, and keeps an oil shop—I had known him in that business in September last, about five weeks—I first met him at a public-house in Southwark—after that I called upon him, hearing he kept an oil shop—he said he had got some things to sell, and showed me some emery cloth and glass paper—the invoice will show what quantity I saw, and what I took away—there was between twelve and thirteen reams—I can tell you by the invoice how many reams there were (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were twelve reams of paper and cloth—this is in my handwriting—I was to pay 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the paper, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the cloth—this is my invoice that I made out—I made out a list of the articles that were there at the time—I cannot say I have got that here—I have not looked for it—I had a lot of lists—the prsioner did not suggest any names I was to call upon—I am a traveller myself—I have a connection in London—I went out by myself to sell first—I made the first sale to Mr. Rose, and then took the money back to Briggs—I got the goods from Briggs' shop—I made the sale before I took the goods out—I made the invoice out at Briggs' shop; he was present—I commu<lb></lb>nicated to him the price I sold at, and the result of it was that I made this invoice (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"September 7th, 1861, Mr. Rose bought of Henry Rushbrook, 54, Boston-street, Hackney-road, 8 reams of glass paper, at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 4 reams of emery cloth, at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s;</hi> 2cwt. of Scotch glue, at 54<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I was to have one shilling out of the fourteen—there are plenty of makers who will buy them of you at that price—that transaction was about the date of this invoice—I called round again in the course of three or four days—I made another invoice out to Mr. Scrine—I think this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Scrine is a wholesale oilman at High-street, Hoxton—I went to him on Saturday, 14th September, and sold him goods to the amount of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10 reams of glass paper, and 9 of cloth—after I had made that sale I informed Briggs as before—I recollect the goods being sent to Serine—they were taken from Briggs's shop in a corn-chandler's cart, Mr. Moore's, of London-road—I do not know the driver's name—Mr. Briggs assisted me to put them in the cart—he went with me—when we got about two hundred yards from Serine's, the prisoner got out of the cart, and went into a public-house—there had been nothing said, between him and myself about his getting out of the cart and going to the public-house—I delivered the goods at Mr. Serine's—I was paid by cheque, and I delivered the invoice—I gave the cheque to Mr. Briggs, in the public-house in Hoxton—I found him there—there was only his little boy with him, about ten or twelve years of age—I got my commission; Briggs paid me when I gave him the cheque at the public-house—the next transaction was with Lee, of Hoxton, on September 10th, for 13 reams of glass paper—when I made ths sale I informed Briggs as before—I went to his shop and oommunicated with him—the cart was ordered from Moore's again, and I and Briggs packed the cart—I cannot say whether his little boy was with us then—when we got near Lee's he got out as before, and went into a public-house—I was paid for those in cash—I brought the money to him, and I was paid my commis<lb></lb>sion—the next transaction was with Mr. Rose—I saw the number on some of the paper that was taken to Rose's—it was 2,030—the next transaction with Rose was on 17th September—I got this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Rose; it is payable to Henry Rushbrook or order; I gave it to Briggs—there was one cheque I cashed myself—I do not know which one it was—I gave all but one to Briggs, and that I cashed myself in consequence of Ross being out—the date of that is September 26th, for 12 reams of glass paper and 8 1/2 of cloth; sold at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got the goods as before—Briggs went with me—he did not go to Rose's—he stopped opposite at a public-house—I gave him this cheque, made out as before to me or order—the next trans<lb></lb>action was with Barnes, of Brick-lane, Spitalfields, and consisted of three reams of emery cloth—I got that from Rose's shop—I had originally taken it to Rose—there were four reams of No. 3 returned, and these were three of them—I noticed the coverings of those three reams; they had 2,030 on the cover—I do not recollect the colour of the label—the prisoner did not go with me to Barnes's—this was for my commission—I sold them for myself—there was another transaction with Mr. Berry, of St. John's-square, Clerken<lb></lb>well, one cwt. of Scotch glue, and two reams of glass paper and emery cloth; the amount was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and was paid in cash—the next transaction was another with Barnes, of Brick-lane—there is no date to this—it would be after the 2d October; it was for one ream of emery and two of glass—then there was one with Rose again, on 10th October, for two reams of</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186203030132"></xptr>
               <p>by myself—I got this paper from Briggs's shop, at the date that is on it; I am quite sure of that—Mr. Rose had nothing to do with this paper, only taking it in receipt of the money he paid me—it is a receipt by me to Rose, of the money in payment of the goods I had given to him—I wrote it in Briggs's shop, and handed it to Rose in receipt of the money he paid me—I wrote it after I had sold the goods to Rose; after I had sold them, and before they were delivered—we do not make invoices out when we sell goods, but when we deliver them—I wrote this on the day it bears date—I have no doubt about it—the bargain with Rose to buy the goods was not made on the same day that I delivered them; there might be the interval of a day or two between the bargain and the delivery—I could not say for a day—this was written on the day of the delivery—I gave it to Rose at the same time I delivered the goods—it has now come from Rose's possession, as far as I know—I cashed one cheque myself; I did not cash any other—I got it cashed in gold, not in notes; I think the amount was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all the cheques were payable to my order—all these invoices were written at Briggs's house—the receipt attached to the bottom of them, "Paid, Rush<lb></lb>brook, same time," was not written at the same time, but when I went to the counting-house—Briggs would know on each occasion, if so disposed, to what customer the goods were going—in one of the instances there was a sale which did not come up to the commission I had arranged for; for that I received No. 3 Emery cloth, that I took to Brown's—I headed that in the same way, "Rushbrook," Co. the customer; that was instead of my commis<lb></lb>sion—that was at the date of one of the invoices, "Returned, 4 reams, No. 3"—I was examined altogether four times at the Police-court—I do not think I told the story in different parts on different occasions; to the best of my recollection I told all at first—I remember Parrott being examined—I was not examined again after he had been examined—I was in the witness-box and my deposition was read over; but I was not examined for fresh evidence—I had not, before Parrott was examined, told the policeman that Parrott was the person who gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not think he was the person, before he was examined—after he was examined I said I had made a mistake, and that it was the prisoner's son; it was in Parrott's presence—I had made a mistake, if I stated it—I never recollect stating it—I never did receive the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Parrott—I came forward and said I wished to be examined again in order to correct the mistake—I was in court at the time Parrott was giving his evidence, and heard the mistake made—I heard what he said—it was after that that I said I had made a mistake, and that Parrott had not given me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 19th October, in consequence of some information, I went with Mr. Oakey to the prisoner's shop, in New-street, Borough-road—it is a small oil shop, and I should call it a chandler's shop too—a man named Spencer went with us—when I went into the shop I saw Briggs, and in consequence of what Spencer had told me, I said to Spencer, "Is this the man you had the goods from"—he said, "Well, I am not certain about the man, but I am sure this is the shop"—I found some glass paper there marked with the name of Day—I said, "I think this is some of Oakey's manufacture"—the prisoner said, "It's false, I have never had any of Oakey's goods in my possession"—he said he bought that paper at a sale, at a chandler's shop round the corner; I found that to be correct—it was only a few quires—I took Spencer into custody upon that, and in consquence of what he told the inspector, I went back with Constable Pearce to Brigg's place—I said to him, "Spencer still adheres to the state<lb></lb>ment that he bought the goods from your shop, and that you are the man that he had them of"—he said, "It is all a lie, I never had any of Oakey's goods in my possession; I never sold any, and if you are not out of my shop I will punch you head"—on 2d November, I received from Mr. Good<lb></lb>rich some emery cloth and glass paper, 34 1/2 reams—I also received some from Serine, some from Lee, and some from other persons—we have got at the station about 59 reams—I am speaking of the property that we have traced to the prisoner—all that we have traced to him is not here—there has been a large quantity sold—we have traced some to customers not here—I looked after Briggs after this—I was looking after him from 28th November for about six weeks, almost daily—I went to his house on three or four occa<lb></lb>sions and left word for him—I saw his landlord—I made every inquiry for him—he was not at his place of business; his wife was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you leave word at his house that you wanted him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that his father was dying, and that he had gone into the country to see him, but I did not believe it—I have no one here to show that that was not true—he surrendered at last all of a sudden—this paper that I have been looking at, is the memorandum that I made at the time he surrendered—it only contains three dates—it was on 2d November that I left word at his house that he was wanted, and on the 28th he surrendered—he was then discharged, and he again surrendered in January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present when he surrendered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a person named Church came with him, and his solicitor, Mr. Lewis—Mr. Lewis was in Court, and asked for the case to be postponed for him, and we could not find the different witnesses, but Rushbrook was the principal one.</p>

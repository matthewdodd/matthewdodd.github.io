                  </hi>. I keep the Cherry Tree public house, in Whitecross-street On Saturday, 28th Jan., the prisoners came about 3 o'clock in the afternoon; Clase asked for a quartern of gin, stating it was her birthday—I supplied them with it, and Clase, to the best of my recollection, tendered me a shilling—I put it in the till—I cannot tell whether I had any other money there—they came in again in four or five minutes afterwards; Clase again asked for gin, stating it was her birthday; she gave me a shilling, and they drank the gin there—Clase then asked Godfrey for another shilling—I did not notice her give it, because there was a partition between where I was standing and her; but Clase gave me a third shilling, which I put in</p>

               <p>the till, and in two or three minutes afterwards, in consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I tried to see if the shillings were good—I then found that beside the three shillings, there was one other shilling in the till, which was found to be good—I do not know how I became possessed of that fourth shilling—I left the good shilling in the till, and put the other three in my pocket—I went out to see if I could find a policeman, but I could not—the prisoners came again, about 6 o'clock the same evening, and Godfrey asked for a quartern of gin—I supplied her with it, and she tendered me a half crown; I looked at it, and discovered it was bad—I did not say anything to the prisoners, but I drew the gin, and took it back—the prisoners left, and I followed them, and gave them into custody—during that time I did not put the half crown out of my hand; this is it—I gave that and the three shillings to the policeman at the station.</p>

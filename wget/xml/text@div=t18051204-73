             sworn. Examined by Mr. Arabin. Were you in the month of April last in the employment of Mr. Bourne's, a pawnbroker in East Smithfield? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of the prisoners acquainted with Mr. Bourne? - A. Mr. Newsham visited there frequently at the time that I was there.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of that you became intimately acquainted with him? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any conversation with him relative to your situation in life? - A. I do; it was in the latter end of April or the beginning of May he first introduced the conversation to me; first of all he asked me if I had got a situation; I told him in what a situation I was then in; he said he had a brother in law in the Drawing Room in the Ordnance office; he asked me whether my friends could raise 130 l. or 120 l.; I told him I thought it was very probable that they would; he said he had so much interest with general Moss, and this brother-in-law<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040090"></xptr>would resign in my favour, if I could advance that sum of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what the emolument would be? - A. Yes, twenty-eight shillings a week for the first half year, after that it was to be doubled, and after three years it was to be doubled again.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, I believe you met the same evening at the Blue-boar Coffee-house, Aldgate? - A. Yes, he then wrote a letter to my grandfather; (the letter read in Court,) addressed to Mr. Rolf, Wimbeach, May 1st, 1804.</p>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>Having in an occasional visit to a friend, met the young gentleman who is the bearer of this and hearing of his situation, it has been in my power to assist him, and to place him in an office under government, whereas, I know, will be the making of him, and for particulars of which I refer you to him; yet it cannot be complete without some assistance from you or some other friend. But I have no doubt but you will use your utmost endeavours to so laudable a purpose.</p>
               <p>(Signed)</p>
               <p>T. NEWSHAM.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take this letter in the country? - A. The next morning, May 2d, I took that letter to my grandfather, in the parish of Wimbeach, Essex. I returned on the third or fourth. I met Newsham on the Monday following, he asked me how I succeeded, I told him that I believed my grandfather would send the money, and on Tuesday I received a letter from my father, which inclosed a draft for one hundred pound. Newsham wanted me to advance twenty pound, in order to bind an agreement that he was going to make between an upholsterer and his brother. On the same afternoon I advanced him twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advacce it yourself, or authorise any body else to advance it? - A. Mr. Bourne said he would advance it, if I would deposit my draft in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever learn from the prisoner that that twenty pound was paid to him by Mr. Bourne? - A. Afterwards I learned that Newsham never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day that you went to Chelsea? - A. I do not exactly, but before I went to Chelsea I paid him the twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever shew you any parchment or any writing before you went to Chelsea? - A. He did.</p>

            . After he had shewn me this resignation, he said I must go with him to Chelsea, and I must take some money with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what you must go there for? - A. To get the appointment from General Moss for himself to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention who General Moss was? - A. He said he was Deputy Master General of the Ordinance. I went with him to Chelsea, to a house close by the water-side; Newsham left me there some time, on his return he shewed me a parchment sealed and signed, and over the seal was D. G. M. O. he said that purported to be Master General of the Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was that directed? - A. To R. H. Crew, secretary to the board of ordnance; he said he must, or I must, make General 
               <persName id="t18051204-73-person821">Moss</persName>
             a compliment of a certain sum of money. I gave him ten pounds for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the amount of the present? - A. No, he did not. After I had delivered this money to him he left me for a considerable time; when he returned we went to Westminster<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040091"></xptr>bridge to Ireson's hotel. He went out a while, I was there and bought a stamp, he wrote a promissory note for ten pounds, he got me to sign the same note accepted by myself, he then put it in his pocket. He after that went with me to Langbourne coffee-house in Fenchurch-street, he there said he had done my business now, as he had got my appointment, consequently he demanded the money according to the agreement. I gave him then a 50 l. note, and ten or fifteen pounds besides, I do not know which, in small bank notes. After that he made an appointment for me to go to Westminster hall to make an affidavit that I was a protestant, and of my birth. We went there, Newsham and me, about a week afterwards; before we went to Westminster hall we went to Ireson's hotel again, we stopped there a little while, and Newsham brought me the affidavit written out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the affidavit? - A. It is the same, I signed it (the affidavit read in court). I went to Westminster hall after I had signed it with Mr. Newsham, as he told me to take my appointment, and to have my affidavit filed in the Exchequer; he said I should meet the secretary of the board of ordnance there, Mr. Crew. Paterson was going up the steps into the Exchequer; Newsham said he was the secretary that was going up the steps, he did not mention his name. When we got into the Exchequer; Newsham gave me the affidavit, he desired me to give it to that gentleman, meaning Paterson.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give it to Paterson? - A. I did; he looked it over, the judges were all present, he desired one of the clerks to come forward and swear me, I was sworn to it; after that Newsham desired me to go in the country, to get the certificate of my birth. After I had been in the country about eight or nine days, I was desired to be at the Parliament coffee-house in Parliament-street; I waited there a considerable time, he did not come. I met him on Westminster bridge the same day; we then went to the Parliament coffee-house, and Newsham and me remained there about ten minutes; Paterson came up in a hackney-coach, I saw him through the window, Newsham went out to him, he brought to me the oath of allegiance, he desired me to read it over, it was on stamped paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the certificate? - A. It is, I signed it there. After that I went with Newsham to the court of Common Pleas; Paterson was there; Newsham gave Paterson the oath; I was sworn there the same as at the court of Exchequer, but it was not signed. Paterson said I must get a fresh certificate, and Newsham wrote to the clergyman for it; I got a fresh certificate; in about a week afterwards I saw Paterson in a coach as you go into the back door of the Common Pleas. I addressed him as though he was Mr. Crew, I asked when I should be employed in the office, which he was pretending to get me in; he said he believed it might be on the Monday following, he said I could not be sworn on that day, he never knew them so damned difficult, but it was on account of the catholic petition being in the house of commons. He further stated that he had belonged to the office for thirty years, he never knew them so difficult.</p>
               <p>Q. What office? - A. I suppose the ordnance office. I asked him in what department I was to be employed in, he said I was to be employed in the commissaries department; he then said that this certificate would do that he had got, but I must first of all swear that this certificate was true, before one of the aldermen at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that make any appointment to meet at any coffee-house? - A. Before I swore to the affidavit I met Newsham at the Guildhall coffee-house, as I supposed to take the oath of allegiance; I went twice, the second time Paterson was with him; he shook his head at me, and told me it was too late for it he was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day or any other day were you sworn to any affidavit before any alderman? - That day Paterson handed me the certificate, and said it must be sworn before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any money? - A. I did, to Paterson; Newsham called me to the middle of the room and said, that we must make the secretary a recompence, as he had been at a great deal of expence and trouble in going about for me; I gave to Paterson a pound note with a shilling wrapt up in the middle of the note; he thanked me for it and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the next day make that affidavit (another affidavit handed to the witness)? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards meet Paterson and Newsham at the Exchequer? - A. Yes, in two or three days afterwards, and there Paterson took another oath of allegiance, which was drawn up in the same form as the first, he delivered it to me, and I read it over, I was sworn to it, and just before we parted, as we were going out of the Exchequer, he said he believed there would be a board next Tuesday, and he believed he should be able to get me my appointment on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this receive any letter? - A. I received a letter dated the 30th of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Look at this? - A. That is the first letter I received, and this is another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040092"></xptr>I received them both on the same days they are dated.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Newsham write? - A. I have seen him write frequently, it is his own hand writing, June 12th, 1805, addressed to Mr. Rolf, No. 8, Wilson Place, Lambeth Road.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir,</p>
               <p>I left Mr. C. at twelve last night, he has for reasons, which you cannot but approve, and think yourself highly obliged by him appointed, that you may see him at twelve o'clock this day, without fail, where I shall be with a friend of Mr. C's. Keep this to yourself, and if you want a months pay beforehand you may have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Newsham's hand-writing likewise? - A. It is addressed to Mr. Rolf.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir,</p>
               <p>By a letter from the old gentleman, he says he saw you yesterday on his way to Woolwich, to attend the examination of the persons suspected of setting fire to the arsenal. As I am going out of town until Saturday evening, on a fishing party, I shall not have an opportunity of seeing you till the Sunday.</p>
               <p>T. NEWSHAM.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the second of July, the day before I received this letter, Paterson called on me in Wilson Place, Lambeth; he said he was very sorry the business at Westminster was put off, as he was going to Woolwich on the examination of the persons suspected of setting fire to the royal arsenal at Woolwich; he said they had got two persons in custody, that he was in hopes they should discover the whole of it. He was afraid he should not be back in time to dispatch my business, if he was, he would meet me in a coach, if not, I was to meet him to-morrow, at the same time he called on me that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that go to Newsham's house? - A. After that, on the third of July, I went to Newsham's house; the letter was directed to me on the second.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Newsham at his house, I believe? - A. I did not, I pursued him. after going to York-street, by the Commercial Road, in company with an officer; we overtook him at Rugley, in the county of Essex, we took him in custody, and brought him with us in a stage; he made his escape from me. We charged him with defrauding me out of several sums of money, he said he had not defrauded me of any sum of money, the business was very right and correct, and we should be obliged to ask him pardon for falsely accusing him.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the man? - A. I cannot swear to him, I never saw the man before or since to my knowledge; I saw the watchman with the blanket; to the best of my knowledge they are mine, there is no particular mark, I did not go up stairs to see whether the articles were missing; I went down, and then we took the man in soldier's clothes to the watch-house, on suspicion of stealing the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know you had lost any thing? - A. I did not go up stairs to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, to this hour, know that any thing was missing? - A. The bed-clothes were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them - did you go up to see if they were missing? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>EDWARD CONNOR sworn. - I took the things in the street, the prisoner was in the house; I saw them come out through a window I was at a distance; I took the prisoner into custody, because I saw him come out of the next house, not out of the house where the things came; I staid at the door to see if I could see any body come out, and I saw a man come out of the next door; I asked the woman whether that man lodged in her house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - A. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take up the blanket, or any thing? - A.No, I got them, he did not; he did not make any claim to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing with the property? - A. I cannot swear he chucked them out.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out of the house, did he take up the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you must acquit the prisoner, as the property is not identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Berridge, of 30, Thomas Street, Clerkenwell—it is our dwelling-house—the prisoner lodged with me on the first floor back—on the evening of the 7th July, she came home at 5.30—she asked me if I would give her a cup of tea—I told her to go to her own room, and I would bring it up to her—she refused to do so, and sat down in my kitchen—I poured her out a cup at the table—she did not drink it—she poured half of it out of the cup and threw it into my little girl's face—I ordered her out of the kitchen—she then took up the cat's saucer of cold water, and threw it into the little boy's face—she then took up a knife that I was cutting the bread and butter with, and ran to me in the corner, and said she would run it through me to the handle—she then threw the knife away across the table, and want up into her own room—she had been drinking—she went out, and returned about 8.45—I was speaking to a policeman at the time, asking his advice about what I should do, and she began abusing the policeman—she did not speak to me—she want and stood at the foot of the stain, and said she would burn the house down and all that was in it—she was still under the influence of liquor, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186907120065"></xptr>
               <p>not so bad as she was at 5.30—the went up stairs to her own room, and sat there using the most obscene language for about half-an-hour—there was no one there—she said, "I will find my matches, and I will burn the place"—I went out into the yard about fire minutes afterwards, to get my clothes in, and I saw the flames reaching to the second floor window, and she was standing with the match box in one hand, and a large piece of lighted paper in the other, holding it underneath the valance of the window—the valance was all a blazing, and she was still holding it—I ran and got my little children out of bed, and laid them at the street door—a young man was passing the door, and I pulled him in, and begged him to come in and put the flames out—he went up stairs, and burst the door open, and went in and took the paper out of the prisoner's hand—I went in with him—it was all a blazing, the valance was best part burnt, and all the wood work and frame work was cracking—the young man put out the fire with rags—I sent for a policeman, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have known the prisoner some time, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only since the Saturday before Whit-Sunday, when she moved into my house—I never saw her before—I did not ask for her character—she was only moving out of the neighbourhood close by—I was in the yard when I first saw the flames—I should think they must have been burning five minutes, because the wood work was all cracking—I don't know whether the window faces the south, it faces Green Terrace—I had no quarrel with the prisoner—she told me her husband had been disturbed by the bugs and could not sleep, and I offered her a room on the second floor front, which was clean, and she took her beds up to that room at 5.30—she did not take up the curtains, nothing but the beds—the room was quite empty, I was going to let it—there were no curtains in it—her room was the first floor back—they were her own curtains in that room—she said she was going to move her things up stairs next day—the window to her room is a sash window—there were no long curtains to it, only a valance across—she had no candle—we found the candle when the prisoner was there, all smashed under her feet—she had not lighted any candle, only a piece of paper, from the matches—she had the box in her hand—I did not say anything to her when I went into the room—the young man asked her what she was doing, and she said she was burning the bugs out—I did not see that her apron or dress was burnt, I did not notice—I followed the young man in—I saw the flames—she was sitting on a basket when I went in—it was about five minutes from the time when I first saw the flames till I went into the room—I had to get my four children out of bed—one is six years old, big enough to run out himself—the prisoner was not doing anything when I went in, she was sitting on a basket by the tide of the bed—the young man was putting out the flames with a rag, I think part of a nightgown which he picked up—he pushed her on to the box, and got the paper out of her hand—she did not seem agitated—it is a very large window—there was no bed the room—she had carried the beds up in the afternoon—her carpet was on the floor, and her clothing was there—in the other rooms there were beds and furniture of all kinds—the valance was all consumed, and all up the side of the window frame was burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Wynnyat Street, Clerkenwell—about 9.30., on the evening of 7th July, as I was passing through Thomas Street Clerkenwell, the last witness laid hold of me and dragged me in, and said "For God's sake, go up stain"—I went up and burst the door open—it was</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I had seen the valance before it was burnt, it was over half a yard in depth—there was a short muslin curtain to the bottom of the window, but the top sash was pulled down and the short curtain was between the two sashes, and was not burnt—she could not have set light to the valance accidentally in lighting a match—the bottom of it was, I should say, nearly two yards from the ground—she could reach it without standing on anything—it is a lofty room—I don't know the height.</p>

             said I will give you thirty guineas, Osborne said, it shall never go for that, if you will not give forty guineas, you shall never have it; Lucas took it from the table and went to the stair-case with it, Waters said you shall have it for forty guineas, it was all agreed upon, and you shall have it; Levy pulled out thirty-nine guineas, and his wife gave him one guinea; Waters took the money up, he said it came from near Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. What are you? - A clothes dealer, I buy things in the streets.</p>
               <p>What are the Levy's? - I cannot tell, we are not intimate.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon were the prisoners taken up after this? - About a day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the second examination, did you say any thing of this transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At the second examination? - I cannot tell whether it was the second or the third.</p>
               <p>Were not you and your husband to have half the profit? - Yes, but after we knew how the lace was got, I did not wish to have half the profit.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not Mrs. Levy bilk you? - I do not understand that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not she give you the bag? - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>You said you were to have half the profits? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you or your husband stipulate, that you should have half the profits? - Yes, after they were bought.</p>
               <p>Then after you knew that they were stolen goods, you agreed to take half profits? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the laces? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether you do not know that an hundred guineas was considerably short of the value of them? - No, I do not know any thing of the value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, another of Prisoners Council. What did you swear before Sir Sampson? - I said what I say now.</p>

               <p>Was not all you said respecting Waters, that he received the forty guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But did not you say that you did not know for what? - I do not know that I did, or did not, I cannot swear.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of January, in the morning, between eight and nine, the three prisoners at the bar, and another with them, called on me, they asked me if I would buy some lace and ribbon, I said yes, and Waters was to go with my wife to bring them; they said if my wife would go to fetch them: she went with him, and came back about eleven, and they brought a quantity of lace and ribbons, and the gentleman asked me to buy them; the man that spoke most, is he that is not taken; one of them said to another, you will go with Mrs. Levy, the key lays in such a place, and you can get it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Summers say any thing? - I do not know that he spoke much; I bought the ribbons of them, they contained sixty dozen and some odd yards, at I believe much about two shillings and three-pence a dozen.</p>
               <p>Court. Who agreed with you? - Sometimes one, sometimes the other; Summers asked two shillings a dozen, and I agreed to give two shillings a dozen, the other two cried out they would not take two shillings, they would have three shillings, I said I would give them no more than two and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230117"></xptr> three-pence, and they agreed to take it, and I paid them six pounds seventeen shillings, or six pounds nineteen shillings, I do not know which: then they opened the laces, and asked me one hundred and fifty guineas for them, I would not bid them any price for them, I said I would give them a shilling a yard for them: at last they asked me to buy them in the lump, and then came down to fourscore guineas, and then I bid them forty guineas, and they agreed to take the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where do you live? - In Bedford-street, Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a dealer in tobacco, lace, and all things, nothing comes amiss to me.</p>
               <p>I suppose not; and it is my opinion, that you will deal in manufactured hemp, sometime or other; when did you tell this to any body; - About a fortnight ago, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When did you tell it to the Magistrate? - About three weeks after I had made the purchase.</p>
               <p>How came you to go there? - I was advertised.</p>
               <p>Did you leave Petticoat Lane upon it? - I did not abscond, but I went into the country, I very often do.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of these sixty dozen, and odd yards? - Two shillings and three-pence a dozen, was the full value and a shilling a yard was more than the value of the lace, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the things? - I sold them to a man I owed some money to, a Mr. Wilson, who lives near Baldock, he keeps markets and fairs, I sold him thirty guineas worth of it, I lost money by them.</p>

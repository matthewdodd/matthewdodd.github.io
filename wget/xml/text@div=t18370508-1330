                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. John and Alfred Blyth, en<lb></lb>gineers, of Fore-street, Limehouse. I have known the prisoner thirteen months—he has been employed by Messrs. Blyth to go on errands, and clean the office—on Saturday last, the 6th of May, I desired him to go to Mr. Stronger for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper—we are in the habit, on Saturday of sending there for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he always went for it—I desired him to say, that in the course of a short time I should send over the cheque, and for him to bring the rest—the prisoner brought in the copper, and said in half an hour the rest of the change would be ready—I did not see him again that day—I inquired for him about the time that he had said he was to have gone for the rest of the change, and he had absconded.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of May, the prisoner came to our house about ten minutes before three o'clock—he had been in the habit of coming for change—he said he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of coppers—I gave them to him, and told him to come in a short time and the other change would be ready—he came again, and I gave him 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him for the cheque—he said Mr. Blyth was not in the way, but as</p>

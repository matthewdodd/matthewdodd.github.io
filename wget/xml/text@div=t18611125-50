I am the wife of Albert Bowe, of 18, Craven-terrace, Bayswater, and sister of Richard Manning on 29th October Ireceived a letter from Mrs. Betty—after looking at it I gave it to my brother—I broke the envelope, and the letter and the envelope were burnt in my presence—there was a cheque in that letter—this is it—the address on the letter was "Mrs. Bowe, 18, Craven-terrace, Craven-hill, Bayswater," and inside there was another envelope with "R. Manning" upon it—I saw part of the letter—I remember part of it—I have known the prisoner for three years—I know her writing—I have seen her write twice or three times, I cannot say—I have been in the habit of receiving letters from her—the writing on the envelope and letter was her's—I believe the writing on this cheque to be the same—my brother went up to the police-court to be examined—he was there taken with a fit and obliged to be carried out, and has been very ill ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old, and am now in St. Bartholomew's Hospital—in January this year I left my situation, and went to live with the prisoner—he is a hairdresser's assistant—we lived at 27, Cowper Street, Islington, in July, and I had charge of Mrs. Barth's baby, who lodged in the same house, while she was out all day at her business—the baby was subject to convulsion fits—on 25th July Mrs. Barth wanted me to go and have the baby's likeness taken—I did not tell the prisoner where I was going, but I asked him whether I could go out—I gave him the key in case I did not get back in time—my sister went with me, and on our way home I called where the prisoner was employed, and got the key from him—I went home and prepared tea, and he came home about. six o'clock, and said that I had been rather too long—I said that I had not been longer than I could help, and showed him the baby's photograph—he said that I had no business to have it taken, wasting my money—I said that my sister paid for it—she was not present—we began tea, and in the middle of it he asked to see the picture again, and he deliberately broke it on the corner of a chair, and threw it on the fire, and smacked me in the face once or twice—I think I flew at him, it was in self-defence if I did, and he struck me again in the chest with his fist, I believe—until he smacked my face I had done nothing to provoke him that I am aware of—on the morning of the 26th he went to his work, and came home to breakfast about 10 o'clock, having shaved off his moustache and whiskers—I said "What have you done that for? what a boy you look"—he said "I have had a clean shave to "swing for you in"—I said "I am glad you let me know"—we breakfasted in Mrs. Barth's room that morning because the baby was so ill, but Mrs. Barth was not present, she had gone to her work—as we were sitting down to breakfast the prisoner said to me "If you have got anything to say you had better say it, as you have not much longer to live; you may live another half hour, and you may live till to-morrow"—I said "You have threatened me so often, I take no notice of your threats"—he never said anything for ever so long, and then he got up off his chair and threw himself across the hearthrug—I asked him to get up, but he made no reply—I went downstairs, and came up again, and he was still on the hearthrug—I said "Mr. Pick<lb></lb>ford," that is his employer, "has sent for you, and wants to know if you are going back to your work"—he said that he was never going to do any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220048"></xptr>
               <p>more work, and I need not trouble myself—I then asked him to go into our own room, but he made no answer, still lying on the hearthrug—I washed the baby, and it had two fits—I then put the tea things away and went into our own room, and then downstairs and saw Mrs. Oliver the landlady—I then went up to Mrs. Barth's room, and the prisoner—was sitting on a chair—I said "Mrs. Oliver is coming to ask you for the rent" and Mrs. Oliver walked in behind me. and asked him for the rent—this was about 11 o'clock—he said "I will give you a fortnight next Monday"—she said "Very well," and left the room—I asked him why he did not give Mrs. Oliver the rent—he said "Before I give her the rent her house will be in the <hi rend="italic">Police News"</hi>—he did not take in the <hi rend="italic">Police News</hi>, but I think they sold it, or had it at the shop—I said "We should make two nice pictures for the <hi rend="italic">Police News"</hi>—a short time after that I asked him for a penny to get half a pint of beer—he said that I need not trouble myself, I should not want any more pennies for beer out of him—I went and got half a pint of beer with a penny of my own, and brought it back—he drank a very little of it, and I finished it—when he was drinking it he said "My love to you, and I hope you will be better tempered the next time we have a drop more together"—I said "I have no doubt we shall," or something to that effect—I then noticed that the child was in a fit, and went across to it, and as I did so I said to the prisoner "You had better go out for a walk, or else I will"—he said "Next time you go out it will be in a cab to the hospital"—I cannot remember what I said, and I think he went into his own room—I took the child downstairs, and brought it up again, and laid it down—the prisoner was then there, and I said "I wish you would keep in your own room"—I do not think he made any answer—I was sitting at the side of the bed looking at the baby, who was in a fit, and the prisoner shut the door and the window, and came towards me—I said "Bill, look at this child"—he made no more to do, but hit me on the back of my head deliberately with a chopper, which I first saw when it was lifted in his hand to strike—it was Mrs. Barth's chopper, and had been in a corner of that room—I said "Bill, before you hit me again think what you are doing it for, and what excuse you will make"—he said "I will soon find some excuse"—he kept on repeating the blows, and I fell off the side of the bed, and saw him change the chopper into his left hand—I said "Bill, if you hit me once more you will kill me"—he said "That is what I want to do"—how I got up I do not know, but I got to the door—I kept continually screaming, I think, till I lost my senses—just as I got to the top of the steps a person who lives next door came to my assistance—I saw her on the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Directly I went to live with him he proposed to marry me, and I think he commenced to save up money for that purpose, and I believe he gave it to his master to keep for him—after which he fell ill, and was for some time in the doctor's hands, and for the time the marriage was spoken of no more—when he broke the likeness and I flew at him I do not think he was smoking a pipe—I do not remember smashing a pipe in his mouth—he usually smoked after tea, but that was in the middle of tea—I flew at him quite in self-defence—I did not kick him—I never used my foot in my life that I can remember to him—I once tried to bite him when he had his hand across my throat; not this time, some time ago—I may have endeavoured to dash the pipe from his mouth—when I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220049"></xptr>
               <p>asked him for a penny for beer I did not stamp my foot in front of him, I did not feel so inclined—I never in my life spat in his face—I did not dare him to touch me—I do not remember snatching a pan from the table—there was no pan but one, which I left in my own room on the drawers, clean and quite empty—I did not pass it towards him as if I was <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to throw it at him—I washed the baby in Mrs. Barth's room, but I never attempted to throw the pan, that was before the blows were given—I only moved the pan from one chair to another, and he laid on the floor nearly all that time—he struck me with the proper side of the chopper which they chop wood with, but it is not very sharp—the prisoner was sitting near the cupboard where Mrs. Barth keeps her wood, and in which the chopper was kept.</p>

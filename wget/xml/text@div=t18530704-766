                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Horns public house, in Petticoat-lane. The prisoner was in my service twice—she left me, and came back about two months afterwards—she was the only servant I had—I had a purse with eleven new sovereigns in it, locked up in a little box, which I kept in a leather trunk, also locked, which was kept in my bedroom, which communicated with the prisoner's bedroom with folding doors—it was some<lb></lb>times in her room and sometimes in mine—I kept the keys—I was saving the sovereigns to pay for my license, which was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen the eleven sovereigns safe four or five weeks before—the prisoner left my service on a Thursday, about four weeks ago—I was not aware of her going till after she left—I then went to the box and missed my purse and sovereigns, and also four or five foreign coins—the box bad not been broken open, and I had had the key all the time in my pocket, on a ring with my other keys—I' am sure I did not take the money out myself—it was a bead purse, which I had had for twenty years—two orphan children who I keep, slept in the room—a week or two before the prisoner left I told her she must look out for another situation, as she kept company with a married man—I received some information, in consequence of which I said to the prisoner, "Ellen, are you going?" she said, "Yes; that man's wife follows me so, and brings a crowd about the house, and says she will have my life"—I asked her to stop, and she said she would stop till I got another servant—that was on the Thursday night, about two hours before she left—I did not see her go, I suppose she took her box out at the side door—a woman named Connor, a sister-in-law of her's, used to come backwards and forwards—I charged Connor with taking the box away, not the money—they were both put to the bar before the Magistrate, and Connor was discharged because there was no case against her—I charged her with taking the prisoner's box—it was just getting dark in the evening when I asked the prisoner to stop till I got another maid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She gave me warning to leave on Thursday, and asked me what was in my box, and said she would burn it; I said "I will take it away," and I got my sister to take it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said that if she wore such a bonnet I would burn it—she had a white drawn silk bonnet, full of flowers, and a green parasol—I said they were not fit for a public house, and that I would not wear them myself, they were too smart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I got my sister-in-law to take my box to a house where I used to lodge when I was out of place; Mrs. Carter brought up a dress against me which she had bought for me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I bought it for her out of her wages, and she took it to the dressmaker's—I have made no charge against her about it, but I think I am entitled to the things, a poor woman like me—I never parted with my keys to my knowledge, unless it was while I was changing my dress.</p>

               <p>Carter—I went with her to look for the prisoner—I did not see her that day hut on the Sunday following I saw her at a dressmaker's in Petticoat-lane—seven or eight people were in the room—I knew pretty well all of them—Ellen Connor was not there at that time—I told the prisoner that her mistress had told me she had stolen her money—she made no answer at that time, but moved in among the people, and I saw her drop her parse out of her hand on to a chair close by; I picked it up, and asked her if that was not her mistress's purse; she said, "No," but told me to conceal it, and not give it to Mrs. Carter, and some of the people there told me the same—I said I should show it to Mrs. Carter, and went for her—I saw silver and copper in the purse, but I did not count it—I saw no gold in it—I gave it to Mrs. Carter in the same state as I picked it up—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—the expression the prisoner used was, "Do not you show the purse to Mrs. Carter.

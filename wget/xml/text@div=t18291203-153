On the 7th of November I was in town, and went to the Tavistock coffee-house, with a friend, and had supper; I afterwards had a glass of punch - I took out a sovereign to pay, but my friend would not allow me; I desired the waiter to call a coach - I stepped down and saw the coach; I took out my watch, and it was near twelve o'clock - I told the coachman to drive to the <placeName id="t18291203-153-crimeloc796">Gloucester coffee-house, Piccadilly</placeName>

I took up no woman" - he said, "Yes, I will take you to the place where I sat her down, it was in Portman-place;" I took an officer with me, and we went - when we got there, he got down, and said, "Oh, your honour, I have forgotten the place;" I told the Police-man to take the number of the coach, and the prisoner was taken the next day - I have never seen my watch since; it was of immense value to me as a family-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you dined? A. Yes, at the Gloucester hotel, with a friend; we had only a bottle of port between us - after supper I believe I had two glasses of punch; they were rather large - I did not walk to Charles-street; I never walk after dinner - I had been fagging all the morning, and felt tired, but not affected by what I had drank; I believe I went to sleep immediately I got into the coach - the windows were closed; I did not feel any person in the coach - I swear I did not speak to any person in my road at all, nor to any women; there was a man examined, named Michael Fowler, who was called by the prisoner - a person might have got into the coach, and I not have known it; I did not say any thing about a sovereign, or of having lost any -I put seven sovereigns into my pocket in the morning, but had laid out most of them; the watch has not been found - I was sober; I told Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, I was the worse for what I had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How lately had you seen your watch? A.About half a second before I got into the carriage; it was fastened with a guard, and the guard was broken - it was but a common guard.</p>

            . I am head waiter at the Gloucester coffee-house, Piccadilly. On the night of the 7th of November Mr. Goodere came home there a little after one o'clock; when I opened the door he was out of the coach, and said to me, "Smith, I have been robbed - I have lost all my money and my watch;" he had the ring and the guard in his hand - I said, "Have you indeed, Sir? has the coach been searched?" the prisoner replied, "Yes; but the gentleman has had a woman in the coach, and I can take you to the place where I set her down;" Mr. Goodere said, "Smith, get your hat and go with me;" I said, "I can't well go, Sir, but here is the Police-man, he will be of more use than I shall" - the prisoner said he saw the gentleman with the watch in his hand when he got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Mr. Goodere a little tipsy? A. He had been drinking, I dare say, but I thought him sober enough to know what he was doing; I did not help him up to his bed-room - the prisoner got on the box again and drove from the door, with the prosecutor and the officer inside; I did not see any coachman or cuds about, nor hear any thing said about sovereigns.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CUNNINGHAM. I am a Police officer. On the morning of the 8th of November, the prosecutor called me, and said the prisoner had been robbing him of some money and a watch; the prisoner said, "It was not me, it was a lady he took up on the way, I can take you to the house she went into" - he acknowledged that he saw the watch in the gentleman's hand, but he gave no further account of it; the prosecutor desired me to go in the coach, and we went to Portman-place; when there, I said to the prisoner,"Which is the house the lady went into?" he said, "That I really can't say;" I said, "I am an officer, I insist upon searching you,' which I did, but found nothing; I searched the coach, and the prosecutor said, "Take the number, and ask where he lives;" I went to the address which the prisoner gave me the next morning, but could not find him - he was taken by a brother officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you help the gentleman into the coach? A. No, he got in: it was a chariot - I do not know whether the prisoner looked at the houses or not.</p>

            . I drive a cab. I know the prisoner; on the night of the 7th of November I saw him, and spoke to him - he had a gentleman in his carriage, speaking to a lady outside; I did not see the gentleman's face, but I had just put down a fare at the end of a court - I went and spoke to the prisoner - the gentleman was then speaking to the lady, and he desired the prisoner to let the lady into the coach, which he did, and they drove on towards Piccadilly: I am certain the prisoner is the man; it was a quarter-past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where did you see this? A. In Coventry-street; I had put down a gentleman at the end of Coventry-court.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. I cannot tell; I have seen him at different ranks, perhaps a couple of years - I do not know the number of his coach; I am sure it was not half-past twelve o'clock, because I had noticed the time, as we always do when we take up a fare; I had taken up my gentleman in Bond-street, at twelve or a few minutes past - my face was 1s.; I cannot swear what sort of a lady it was - I took very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030058"></xptr>little notice of her; she was dressed very gay - I know there was a cloak of some dark colour; it was a very fine night - I asked the prisoner how he got on: there might be a few more words said by us - I did not speak to him two minutes, only just while he got down and let the lady inside; one of his horses was a chesnut, and the other a black one - I cannot tell the colour of the lady's bonnet or hat; I was examined before the Magistrate, and stated these facts; the Magistrate did tell me I was tipsy - I believe he said he would not believe what I said; I did say I could not tell whether it was a coach or a chariot, but now I know it was the same coach or landau that he always drives - I cannot tell why I could not tell the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WADE. I am ostler to the prisoner. On the evening of the 7th of November he went out with his landau, and returned it a quarter before nine o'clock on Sunday morning; it is No. 317. - one was a chesnut and the other a black horse; he has three pairs of numbers.</p>

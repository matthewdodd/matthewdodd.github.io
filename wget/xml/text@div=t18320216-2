            . I am serjeant of the Scotch Fusileer Guards. On the 14th of January, a little after one o'clock. I was ordered to search the prisoner's clothes, which hung up in the barracks, in the place appropriated for them, and took this box out of his clothes -the prosecutor was not present, nor was the prisoner; he was intoxicated when I found the box, and I said nothing to him about it; any body could get at his clothes - I did not search his person; I searched his clothes, because he was suspected of a robbery - I did not myself see the prosecutor till five minutes after the search; he knew the box, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRALEY. I know this box by two letters on it, which I had observed several times in my comrade's possession; I was robbed on the Saturday, the 14th of January; I passed the board on Wednesday, and got my money on Thursday; I stopped two days at an acquaintance's in London -I went to the barracks as soon as I could find them out; the prisoner appeared a little in liquor when he was with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160004"></xptr>me - he struck me with his fist; I do not know the letters on the box, as I am no scholar.</p>

            . I am a baker. On the 14th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw Braley and the prisoner in Park-lane - I did not see them go into any public-house; they were walking together by the side of each other, but not arm-in-arm - I saw the prisoner knock Braley down - they were both a little intoxicated; the prisoner struck him in the neck - he fell down across the road: the prisoner picked him up, and put his hand into his right-hand breeches pocket - I saw him take out a purse; I did not see any thing else - I was about ten yards from them; the prisoner walked on tea or twelve yards, then pulled the purse out of his own pocket, pulled the ring back, and took some silver out of the purse; he put the silver into the purse again, turned back to Braley, and asked him to go down towards Bayswater-road - Braley refused; the prisoner then ran on down Oxford-street - Braley turned quite a contrary way; I went and told him I had seen the prisoner take his purse out, and took him (Braley) to the barracks - we got there nearly half an hour after I had seen them in Park-lane; we saw the prisoner a very few minutes after getting there - I knew him again; I have not a doubt of his person - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to Oxford-street did the prisoner knock Braley down? A. About two hundred yards; there are not houses on both sides - it was in Park-lane - there is a dead wall on one side; there was a gentleman near: I gave no alarm, as I thought at first that the prisoner was Braley's son, and I knew the prisoner belonged to the Scotch Fusileers at the Portman-street harracks - I did not know him before; Braley was a little in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was paraded at half-past ten o'clock, and dismissed a little before eleven - I went up stairs at the barracks, and told my comrade to put my belt and fire-lock in the room - I then came down, walked down Oxford-street, from there to Regent-street, and up Regent-street, into Oxford-street again; I went into the Horse Grenadier, Oxford-street, and called for a pint of beer - one of the Coldstream Guards came in, and called for a pint of beer; he offered this box for sale in the room, and asked me to buy it; I gave him 2d. for it - I left him, and went home to my barracks; I put the box into my jacket pocket at the barracks, and hung my jacket up- I then went into the Canteen, to get something to drink - I was ordered into the Guard room; this man came up, and said I was the man - he was then worse for liquor.</p>

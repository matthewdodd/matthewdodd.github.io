            . I am bricklayer to the society of Lincoln's Inn: I was sent for to measure the place where the lead was taken from, and was directed to go to justice Welch, to measure some lead that had been stopped at a broker's; I did, and found it tallied in length and breadth with the place from whence the lead was stolen.</p>
               <p>John Brown. This lead (producing it) was brought from justice Welch's, yesterday, to the grand jury, and left at Mr. Clark's till this morning. I stopped Edges with this lead on his shoulder, in Hog-lane, and brought him to justice Welch's; I thought from the quantity it was stole; Edges told me Coleman and Dowling were concerned in stealing of it, and directed me to his house in Mutton-lane; I went there and found him in a two pair of stairs room; he jumped out of the window, and I took him in the yard. Dowling confessed before justice Welch that they were all three concerned in the robbery; I found this ladder (producing it, about five feet high) on the staircase, where the lead was stole from, with about 14 lb. of lead; Dowling said it was his ladder; it has the initials of his name upon it.</p>

            . I am employed at No. 13, in Lincoln's-inn. On the 17th of February the lead was taken from the top of the house. In the afternoon about three o'clock, I saw three men on the stair case; the two prisoners are two of the men; they brought a ladder, a board of mortar, and a hammer (producing it); I found it the next morning at the trap door going on to the leads; it is a cutting instrument as well as a hammer.</p>
               <p>Q. from Coleman. What clothes had I on?</p>
               <p>Bates. I did not take notice of their clothes: I think Dowling had a red waistcoat; Dowling came and asked me for a shovel; I gave him a holey one; he came a little after and asked me for a birch broom; he said they were come to mend the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Bates. Coleman.</p>

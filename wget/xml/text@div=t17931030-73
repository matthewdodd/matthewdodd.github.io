               <p>I am an officer in the half pay line; the young man at the bar, who is a brother officer of mine, I became acquainted with him at the Barracks at Chatham.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he now in service? - He is in the marines, he is the first lieutenant; I believe I had not met him since the peace, till about two months ago I received a note from him, informing me that he was in London, and in very great distress, claiming my assistance, requesting me to send him a temporary assistance; I desired the boy who brought the note, immediately to conduct me to him; I was extremely unhappy to find a young man that I had known in good circumstances and in a genteel line, in so deplorable condition; I rendered him what assistance I could, and requested he would come to my lodging, I told him I should occasionally render him any little assistance in my power, I invited him constantly to breakfast with me, and about three weeks ago he came to my lodging, says he, you can put a guinea in my pocket without any inconvenience to yourself, I am sure; I said, I should be very happy to do it; he told me that he had a watch of his wife's in pawn for four guineas, and that if I was so good as to lend him four guineas to redeem it, he could very readily pawn it for five, I told him I should be happy to lend him any assistance in my power; I was in bed at the time, I told him there was exactly four guineas and some silver in my pocket, he was very welcome to take it for the purpose; he took it out of my pocket by my desire, by the time I was up and at breakfast, he returned with the watch in his pocket; I told him it was certainly worth much more, and if he pleased I would lend him the other guinea, and keep the watch as a security, which would save him the expence of pawning of it; but if I should happen to want five guineas in the interim before he paid me, he could have no objection to my sending it to a pawnbroker's. I wore the watch for several days in my pocket, and shewed it to several of my acquaintances, mentioning the circumstance; I mentioned it to several of my acquaintances, and on Friday week last a friend of mine, a very old acquaintance, a Mr. Lawrence called on me in the morning, begged the favour of me to lend him a few guineas in order to pay a bill, that he was bound to take up on that day; I told him I had not cash to spare, and pleaded an excuse, he told me his credit would be hurt, as his bill became due at twelve o'clock, and he had promised to pay it; this was I suppose about ten, and he intreated me to lend him what I could spare, I told him I could not spare a single guinea, he then suggested the idea of lending him Mr. Wheeler's watch, and he says I will pawn, and will give you my honour to redeem it, and let you have it by eight o'clock this evening; as he told me he had a pressing occasion for a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300115"></xptr>money, I did not refuse him, I gave it him for the purpose of pawning it; in about an hour and a half he returned to the room where I was dressing in custody, he told me that the offer of the watch had been attended with a most serious consequence, that he was detained for its being a stolen watch. I was astonished at the declaration, and told him I will attend you immediately to the justice of the peace, and sufficiently exonerate you. I went with him to justice Addington's, and told justice Addington all the circumstance, and he was discharged, and so was I, and he told me it was necessary to take Mr. Wheeler, in order to justify myself, and at four o'clock that day Mr. Lawrence, and I took him into custody. I think it is three weeks ago to day that he come to me, for I had the watch in my possession for one week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask him whether on last fortnight I did not go with him, during the time of divine service in the afternoon to Westminster Abbey? - I do recollect our walking that way, and going into the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before you had the watch or after - I think I had the watch at that time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On Saturday the 28th of September, between the hour of five and six in the evening; I was coming along through the Bird Cage-walk in St. James's-park; I perceived against one of the large trees, a cross made with chalk, and at the foot of the same tree the leaves were heaped up higher than the rest, which lay about considerably, I immediately went up and kicked the leaves away, when I perceived something wrapped up in a white linen rag, I took it up, and in the rag was a gold watch, a gold chain, two gold seals, and one setting of a seal without any stone in it, I immediately took it up and converted it to my own use, as I was at that time in great distress; this is the whole state of the case, that is the simple way by which I came by the watch, and I trust, my lord and gentlemen of the jury, that though there are many stories told of this kind in court, that you will consider the watch might be taken out of my Lord Stormont's bureau and placed there for purposes, which I don't know, it was said in Bow-street, that the Lord Stormont had employed a carpenter to mend his bureau; the bureau has been left open several times, I understand from what his Lordship said.

I have known the prisoners about three years; they were never at my house before the prisoner James came, which was last Saturday three weeks, about seven o'clock at night; I was at home, alone - I had seen him three months before. He knocked at the door, and asked if I would go and have something to drink; I never drank with him before; I refused to go three or four times, and said my husband had just gone out, and would be in in a few minutes, and I could not think of leaving - he said I might as well. I said I was going for some potatoes, and went with him. I told him when I was in Orchard-street, that I could not stop many minutes, for I had double locked the door and left the key in, and that my husband's watch hung over the fire-place, and if it should be taken it would be a terrible thing. I went to the Castle, public-house, Strutton-ground with him, into a back room, as he said his brother and two other friends were there - we sat down and had a glass of rum and water; he put it on the table, and told his brother he was going out after a man; he whispered in his brother's ear, and went out. I said I would go with him, as I could not stop; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, stop and drink, I shall not be many minutes," and so I stopped. He returned in about eight minutes. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140007"></xptr>home immediately; and found the room door shut, but not locked - I had double locked it. I missed the watch from over the fire-place; it had three seals, a ring, and a steel chain to it. I immediately went back to the house, and found James only there - I told him somebody had taken my watch, and it could be nobody but him, for nobody else knew that the key was left in the door; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not got it, perhaps your husband has been and taken it, to frighten you;" I asked for his brother - he said he was gone out. I said it was a planned thing between them to make away with it; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, so help me God; I could not go up into your room without making marks with my shoes;" it was dirty, and there were no marks - I said he could pull his shoes off, and there was a mat at the door. I went home, and found my husband there; he had not got it. I returned to the public-house, and found them both there; I told James he must have it - his brother jumped up, and threatened to kick me out of the room, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been married - A. Eleven months. I never lived at Chelsea. I thought it no harm to go and drink with him; he persuaded me to go. I never drank with him before. I was not out a quarter of an hour. It struck me before I opened the door that somebody had been in. I never gave the prisoners anything to pawn. The street door was always ajar; there are lodgers. I was married at St. Martin's Church; my maiden name was

No. When my wife returned, she asked if I had been and took the watch; she said that she had been out for a quarter of an hour for some potatoes, and a person came to the door, and asked her to have something to drink.</p>

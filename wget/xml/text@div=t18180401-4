On the 16th of March I went to bed about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner had gone to bed at eight; he got up about five o'clock the next morning, I missed all my clothes when he was gone. My pantaloons were taken from under my pillow, there were two 1l. notes and ten shillings, in silver, in the pockets; the rest of the articles stated in the indictment were taken off my bed-my clothes cost me above 4l. 15s., and I had only worn them twice. About four days after the prisoner was apprehended at Chelsea, by Edmunds; we found my hat on his head - He left his own hat in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 1, Lavender Grove—on the night of 11th February, about 12 o'clock, I was in Lansdowne Road, returning from my daughter's, where there was a child ill—as I was walking on I felt a very severe blow at the back part of my head, and before I had time to turn round, the prisoner came behind me and put one hand on my mouth and another on my throat—he got me on the ground, and the next thing I felt was his hand in my pocket—I said "Take my purse, but don't kill me;" he was so exceeding rough, in fact I have been under medical care for a month since—a gentleman came up, and said "What are you about to this lady?" and held him—another gentlemen came up and they wished me to give him into custody—I had a purse in my pocket, but it was empty—it was not taken—he had not the opportunity as the gentle<lb></lb>man came up—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the person—he did not leave me until the gentleman held him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner when I was on the ground—I was on my side, and he had great difficulty in getting his hand in my pocket—the first blow felt as if something was flung—there was a current of air—it was near the corner of Lansdowne Road—I had seen no one near me at the time I received the blow—I was seized immediately afterwards—I don't know the name of the gentleman who came up first—he is not here to-day—it was a little before 12 o'clock at night, and happened a little distance from the corner of the road; some few doors.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 32, Shrubland Grove—about 11.30 or 12.0 on the night of 11th February, I was in the Lansdowne Road—I saw the last witness standing near the corner—the prisoner was close by—I daresay he might have had his hands on her elbow—she said that he had knocked her down and tried to rob her—he said the lady fell down and he was trying to pick her up—I took hold of him—he was very violent—I held him till a constable came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman, and live at 11, Leyton Street—on the 11th February, between 11.30 and 12.0, I was in the Lansdowne Road, and saw the prosecutrix and prisoner—they were standing together on the opposite side of the way—he had one arm round her neck, and the other</p>

               <p>hand appeared to me to be across her mouth—there was a struggle, and they both fell down—he then placed his hand towards her pocket—a gentle<lb></lb>man and lady came past about that time, and then the prisoner attempted to lift her up—she did not tell the lady and gentleman what was the matter—I remained till the prisoner was given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on the opposite side of the road all the time—it is a good wide road; room for two or three carriages—there were no shops open at that time—the only light was the ordinary street lamp—I remained on the other side till Mr. Brigham came up—I did not have a close view of them till he came up—he was lifting her up when the lady and gentleman passed, that was before Mr. Brigham came up—when the old lady said something about his attempting to rob her, he said it was untrue, he was helping her up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He was helping her up then, but before that it appeared as if there was a scuffle.</p>

About 11.45 on 11th February, I saw a crowd, and the prisoner was struggling very hard with Brigham—when I got up the prosecutrix said "This man came and struck me a violent blow at the back of the head, which broke this comb"—I found two pieces of the comb on the pavement, and one piece was in her hair—she said "He placed one hand over my mouth, so, and one hand round my neck, and threw me on the ground"—the prisoner said "Did I take anything out of your pocket?"—she said "No; my pocket was too deep"—he said "The b—woman is drunk, policeman; it is only a get up"—another constable came up, and we took the prisoner to the station—in answer to the charge he said "If I am guilty, I am guilty; that will have to be proved before the Magistrate"—the prosecutrix was quite sober—she walked all the way to the station, and I had to call the doctor to dress her head, which was wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe I have stated before to-day that she said he had one arm round her neck and the other hand on her mouth—I searched him—I found a German silver watch and a chain, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and a pair of spectacles.</p>

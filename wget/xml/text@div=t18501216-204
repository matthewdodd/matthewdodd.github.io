Thompson, another warehouse-man, gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I saw the prisoner in the warehouse—he saw me with the order in my hand—I proposed to send patterns, and he said he thought patterns would do—I cut him five patterns; one was of a lower quality, and another richer than was asked for—he went away with them—it was about four o'clock—he returned about six, and I received this other order from Mr. Brankston, one of the partners; the patterns were enclosed in it—Mr. Brankston called the prisoner, and asked him if he was the man who brought the second order—he said, "Yes"—I went to do up the goods—I took them to the entering-room, and found the prisoner was not there; he had been given into custody—(<hi rend="italic">orders ready,</hi>—"Broadway, Westminster,—Please send by bearer a few lengths of black satinettes, the best you can, from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; also a piece of black ducape, about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—"Broadway, Westminster.

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the house of Messrs. Leaf and Co. On 29th Nov., a little before six o'clock, the prisoner came to my desk and presented this order to me, with the patterns contained in it—it was sealed up, and addressed to the firm—I opened it in his presence—I thought it was a forgery, took it to the silk-room, and instructed Braid to get the goods ready and take them to the entering-room—I asked the prisoner to go there—I did that to get time to con<lb></lb>sider what to do—I followed him to the entering-room, and told him I suspected he was about committing an act of dishonesty—he assured me he was not, and appeared hurt and indignant—I asked him how long he had been in Mr. Beasley's employ—he said, "Yesterday," this was Friday—he entreated me to allow a young man from the establishment to go with him, but I felt that a policeman would be best—I sent for one, and he was given into custody—the value of the goods ordered was 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

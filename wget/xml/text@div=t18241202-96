            . I am shopman to Messrs. George Drake Sewell and Thomas Cross. About three o'clock, on the 8th of November, Ann Wilson came to our shop, and asked to look at some black sarsnet ribbons. I shewed her the drawer - she looked at them a long while, and purchased one yard and a half of very narrow ribbon. I saw her take a piece from the rest, and put it in a corner of the drawer, and as I was turning to put the drawer away, I missed that piece. I mentioned it to a fellow shopman - she then left the shop. I followed, and overtook her about twelve yards off. I said, I wanted to speak to her; and as we crossed the road, the prisoner, Martin, met her, and took something from under her shawl; I could not perceive what. I took Wilson back - Martin was brought in by Dudley; but I did not see her till she was in the watch-house.</p>

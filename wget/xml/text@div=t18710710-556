I live at 14, Grace's Alley, Whitechapel, and am a boot-maker—on the night of 12th June, at 12.30, I was in my shop—about 12.40, I went to my mother's, next door—five men came in—the prisoners are three of them—they had supper—after they had finished, I asked them to pay—they said "We were called in by a friend up stairs"—I called the friend, as they called him, down stairs, Murphy, who said he did not know them—the prisoners said he was not the friend, it was the tall one who asked them to sup—they tried to get out of the house; I tried to prevent them—they eventually got out of the house by the deceased opening the door for them—before they went, they smashed the windows of the doors, and one of them struck my brother—deceased and I followed them—he was my cousin—I came up with them; they turned round—I did not have</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was called to the station at Leman Street, and found deceased there, dead—there were marks of violence about him—his upper lip was very much contused—there were cut bruises about his forehead, and on the upper part of his head—there was a contused wound communicating with a fracture of the skull at the back part of the head—my impression is that he had received a blow upon the month with a fist, and had fallen on the back of his head.</p>

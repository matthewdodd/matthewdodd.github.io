                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 62, Aldenham Street—on 18th July, at 1 o'clock in the morning, I was walking along Judd Street—the prisoner accosted me, and Weedon laid hold of my arm, and wanted me to go home with them—Harris held hack, and all at once I received a blow from behind, and was felled to the ground—my face fell against a shop-front and I was covered with blood—I saw nobody but the two prisoners—Weedon put her hand in my trowsers pocket, and drew out all the money I had, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., among which was a half-sovereign—I do not know what became of Harris, I was so stunned—I was sober—I have no doubt they are the women—I never let go of Weedon till I gave her in custody, and I saw Harris at the station the same night.</p>

On 18th July, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was in Judd Street, in plain clothes, and saw Ivemy and Weedon struggling on the ground, and Harris standing at the side, with a child in her arms, which she placed in Weedon's arms—I pushed Harris back, and asked Ivemy what he had lost—he said, "This woman has robbed me of my money "(<hi rend="italic">Weedon</hi>)—I took her to the station, and then went outside, saw Harris there, and took her—Harris said that her mother had given her it to buy some things of Weedon—Ivemy appeared stunned, and his face was covered with blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harriett Defence.</hi> I was going home, and the prosecutor and a female turned the corner and pushed against my baby's head—I heard a noise, looked round, and saw Weedon and the prosecutor on the ground. I went up and said, "Weedon, what is the matter; have you got the money safe? if so, give it to me;" and the prosecutor said that I was the person who struck him on the back of the neck. At Bow Street, he said that it might be a half-sovereign and a florin, he did not know, but he could swear to the half-sovereign, because it had a flaw in it.</p>

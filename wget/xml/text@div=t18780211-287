                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Wallbridge, of Dua House, Lansdowne Villas, Leith—on 11th January I went upstairs to my work—on coming down I missed an overcoat from the passage, and a jacket, and a large bundle of waste paper from the kitchen—these books I saw last safe on the 11th January—the kitchen door was ajar—on the following Monday I missed this spoon from the kitchen dresser—I had seen it last on the Friday—we did not have occasion to use it from the Friday till the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer at Lewisham—on 11th January the prisoner brought me this parcel of paper, and I bought it—I next saw him at the police-court—I have known him some years and have no doubt he is the man.</p>

I took the prisoner on 12th January—I took him to the jeweller, who identified him as the man who pawned the spoon—on leaving the door he said "I have spent the money"—he was charged at the station with unlawful possession—he said that he took it from the dresser—that was after he was remanded.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I am innocent of stealing these things. I met a man who said he had some things which he had bought, and after I purchased them of him he said he had stolen them. I met him next morning and he asked me if I would sell some paper. I took him to Mr. Harris, who knows me. If I had stolen the things I should not have taken them to people who knew me. The jeweller also knows me by sight. I told him I got the spoon from some rubbish, because if I had told him I had it from another man, he would not have bought it. I sold it for another man. <hi rend="smallCaps">

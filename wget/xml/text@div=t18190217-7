The male prisoner came in, and asked for it - Gough having claimed it, I thought it proper not to part with it; there was some little confusion by people coming in; I took them into my house, which is three doors off.

The father at last agreed to open the door, but his wife insisted that he should not; we then came away, as we could not get it open. On the 23d a woman fetched me from the watch-house to a public-house in Aldersgate-street; when I got there I was informed they were gone to the watch-house, through the Bars; I went there, and took them to our watch-house. I searched the mother, and found a watch, the key of a room, and 2 s. 9 d. on her; I searched the prisoner, Sarah, and found the key of her own box on her - I took them to the Compter. I then went back to the prisoner,

            's house - he was not in custody. I knocked violently at the door, took the key, and opened it. He started upon us, to know who it was that opened his premises. On searching, I found two new shawls, a pair of cotton stockings, two pieces of lace, and a pair of gloves all new, in a drawer. I took him to the Compter with them. On the Monday following, which was the 25th, I found out where these things had been bought; we found thirty or forty duplicates on the woman, one of which was for a shawl pledged for 8 s.; I got it from the pawnbroker's - I have the note, which Stevens gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you go to his house on the 9th - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, they were in bed; we did not get admittance. Gough did not send for me to search the girl at his house. I went again on the 23d, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sheppard, who is a linen-draper, and lives in Aldersgate-street. On Saturday, the 9th of January, the two female prisoners came to our shop, and bought two cloth shawls, one silk shawl, and several others, amounting to between 3 l. and 4 l.; the mother presented me a 10 l. note, and I gave her change; I put it into the till. The mother gave me the address after I had put it into the till; she said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Powell, No. 11, Goswell-street;" which I wrote on a piece of paper, instead of the note - I cannot swear to the note; there is no mark of mine on it, nor is there any mark on the shawls found at the lodgings. I know the silk one is of the same pattern as that I sold them - the other two are the same sort as I sold them. I cannot say whether they are the same or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you write</p>

I took six 5 l. notes of them, and marked the name on all: I lost them all. I discovered the robbery about half-past eleven o'clock at night - the girl was at my house all day, and went home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she out of the house all day - A. No, except on errands. She came as usual every day till she was taken.</p>

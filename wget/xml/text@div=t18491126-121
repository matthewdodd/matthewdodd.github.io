                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Walker, who is in partner<lb></lb>ship with Mr. Brown; the shop forms part of the dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. On 6th Oct., about a quarter to twelve o'clock, the prisoners, Rolls and Evans, came to the shop-door, and asked me the price of a brooch in the window—I cannot say which one spoke; the price was not marked—I went outside the shop, and they took me to the further end of the window from the door, and pointed to two black brooches on a card; they were about two and a half yards from the door—I was out-tide with them about a minute and a half—I told them the price, and they pointed to some more brooches, not black, and asked the price <hi rend="italic">of</hi> those; they seemed scarcely to know what to point to—I told them the price, and then returned to the shop-door—I bad left no one in the shop—when I went in I found the boy Richardson standing in front of the counter—he asked for a box of Mordan's leads, and while serving him, Evans returned into the shop, and asked if we had any sixpenny brooches—I said, "No"—I am sure it was one of the two men that had previously drawn my attention to the brooches outside—he came very near to where Richardson was standing—when I told him we had none, he made no remark, but left the shop directly—after I had served Richardson, he also left the shop—about half-au hour afterwards I missed a gold watch, worth twenty-eight guineas, out of a glass-case behind the counter, fixed up against the wall; it was shut, but not locked—I had seen that watch the day previous; a person must have walked round the counter to get it—I next saw Evans on 27th Oct., at the West<lb></lb>minster Police-court, when Rolls was in custody, and being examined—Evans was standing among the bystanders—on seeing him I told my master that I identified him as being one of the. men I had seen outside the shop, and he told the inspector, and he was taken into custody, and charged—looking at him now, I believe him to be the man that was with Rolls, but from what I have heard, there is a doubt in my mind—I have not the slightest doubt about Richardson—I would not speak positively as to Rolls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the driver of the omnibus that runs from Sunbury to London. It arrives at the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's Churchyard, at a quarter-past ten in the morning, and leaves on its journey back to Sunbury at twenty minutes before eleven—the prisoner Evans was the conductor of that omnibus, and has been so upwards of two years—the omnibus clears London, that is, the White Horse Cellar, about five minutes past eleven. On 6th Oct. I drove the omnibus, and Evans conducted it—we left St. Paul's Churchyard at the usual time, and arrived at Piccadilly at our usual time-Joseph Clark was time-keeper there that day—Evans never left the omnibus from the time we left St. Paul's Churchyard till we got to Sunbury at half-past one—our route is through Hammersmith, over the Suspension-bridge, through Barnes and Mortlake, not near the Whitechapel-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much does a conductor lose by getting a substitute, and not going himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would have to pay the half-journey to the man put in his place—his wages were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for seven days—it was the middle journey that he had asked to be absent for—he worked the omnibus up in the morning, and was to have returned in the evening—his brother is engaged by the same Company—I do not think he is much like the prisoner; he is much stouter.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">COLLETT</hi>. I am postman, at Sunbury. On Saturday, 6th Oct., I had a letter for Evans from nine in the morning till half-past one o'clock, when I gave it him on his omnibus, near the Church, at Sunbury—this is it; it bears the London post-mark of 5th Oct., eight at night—he had gone to town before I had it, in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know where he lived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but he had requested me, some months previous, when I had letters for him, to keep them for him, which I had done once or twice, and I, thinking it applied to all letters, kept this one.</p>

(Evans received a good character.) <hi rend="smallCaps">

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Thomas Smith a pawn<lb></lb>broker, at No. 98, Edgeware-road, Paddington. On the 21st of No<lb></lb>vember, I observed the prisoner in company with another, lurking about the shop, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon—some one came and told me my shawl was gone—I ran out, and saw the prisoner about 100 yards from the shop—he stopped the moment he saw me turn the corner—I asked him what he took the handkerchief for—he said it was a drunken <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I brought him back to the shop—he said the same there—he said he was drunk—I knew nothing of him—I never saw him before—he could walk, and was sober enough to all appearance.</p>

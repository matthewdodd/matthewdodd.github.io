Uxbridge Bank-note, and a 1l. note; I took the 1l. note to pay for the liquor, and the prisoner took the bag out of my hand; I asked her for it back, and she gave it me, and said, it was all right; I took up the change, and went to the door to see if it was good, and then put it in my pocket; before I looked at my bag, to see whether the papers were right, she snatched the bundle from under my arm; not thinking she was gone, I did not take any notice of that; I was looking at my papers, and when I turned round, she was gone, and the bundle too; a woman told me which way she was gone, and I went out, and a woman and another man caught her and brought her back; when I looked over my papers, I missed a 5l.

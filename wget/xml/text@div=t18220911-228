I saw him pass it to another man rather taller than himself. I attempted to rush on him, but a man lifted up his arm and threatened to knock me down. I ran to the left to avoid the blow - they ran up Nicholas-row, and Nicholas-street, and there I lost sight of them. I went as far as the Gibraltar, public house. Gibbs the officer and several persons came up; Gibbs and I went down Church-street, to the end of Nicholas-row again. I described the persons to him, and went with him and Goddard to the prisoner's father's house, at the corner of Nicholas-row; they knocked at the door, which was opened, and the prisoner stood there with his mother. Goddard said,</p>
               <p>"Joe, step out;" he did so, and Goddard said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know this young man?" I said,</p>
               <p>"He has seen me before to-night, within a quarter of an hour; that is the young man who robbed me." I verily believe him to be the man who pulled the watch from me; I am fully persuaded of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not at first say he was like the man - A. Not to my recollection: I did not tell him he had seen me before, for the purpose of getting an answer from him; I did not expect any answer. The impression on my mind is fully that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen one Greenwood - A. Yes, at Worship-street; he is something like the prisoner; it may be possible to mistake one for another with their hats on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had seen Greenwood without seeing the prisoner, should you have charged Greenwood with the robbery - A. I think not; I think there is sufficient difference between the two to enable me to know him; it happened within a yard and a half of a gas lamp.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would the description you gave answer to Greenwood as well as the prisoner - A. I think not: the dress was different - he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, and a black silk waistcoat - it was scarcely dark. I think Greenwod is nearly of the same height, and both have red hair.</p>
               <p>MRS. BROWN. I was with my husband, following him, and saw the prisoner run up to him. I did not see his person, only his dress - it was a blue coat and yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Greenwood - A. Yes: his hair is rather red, but lighter than the prisoners. I did not see the prisoner's hair at all for he had his hat on. He was brought to our house as soon as he was taken, and placed in a room with five or six others; a man said,</p>
               <p>"Which of these is the man who robbed Mr. Brown?" I immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is like the man?"</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Brown complained to me, and described the person; he said he had a blue coat, yellow buttons, a black waistcoat, and I think a black handkerchief. I went with him to the prisoner's house; his mother, he, and his brother came out; he came to the threshold of the door; I crossed over the road to Mr. Brown, and asked if he had any doubt of the man, and he said, No; I held the candle up to Mr. Brown to see him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt at all of that man." I afterwards took him to Mr. Brown's house; there were several in the room; Mrs. and Miss Brown pointed him out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He asked what I wanted; I did not satisfy him; he said he was innocent, but that he had been at the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat, public-house, which is about twenty minutes walk from where the robbery was committed.</p>

I do not know where the ferry is; it was not settled how we were to go; we talked about nothing else, except that he had been to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton.

            . I work for a weaver. Redman was keeping me company; in July I was standing at the door of the Porto Bello with him talking to Allen; we heard the alarm five or ten minutes after ten o'clock. I had been in his company from seven o'clock that night, and never left him. We were at the door when the cry was raised; Hatch came up directly after the thieves ran by; we had been talking about going to Eel ferry. Hatch came up and said,</p>
               <p>"Why did not you stop them?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I did not know it was thieves; I thought it was only fun." The prisoner was with us half an hour after that. Hatch went away to Woodcock the patrol. The prisoner was dressed in a blue coat and yellow buttons, black waistcoat, and pepper and salt trowsers, and a black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you and him been - A. To the Cat and Mutton. We went there about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, and remained there till twenty minutes after nine o'clock exactly - it is about half a mile from the Porto Bello. I was talking with Allen and the prisoner at the time of the alarm - nobody else was with us. Beckford and Debas stood at the corner as the thieves ran by - they then came up. Only we three were to go to Eel ferry - the gentleman stopped at the corner, and said to the men who stood there,</p>

               <p>"I have lost my watch." This was just before Hatch came up. I went away with the prisoner, about a quarter of an hour after Hatch went; we left at half past ten. The prisoner went to his mother's which is about sixty yards off. I stood at the door when Gibbs the officer came up. I did not know him; he asked who I was waiting for. I said,</p>
               <p>"Not for you." He said,</p>
               <p>"Cannot you give an answer?" I said I was waiting for a young man who was just gone in to see how his mother's leg was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any charge made against him about a watch - A. Yes, and told Gibbs. I had been in his company all night, at the Cat and Mutton and Porto Bello. Gibbs told me to stay there, for he wanted to take him for a few minutes, and he sent to me after, to say he was gone to Mr. Brown's. I went there, and saw the officers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110103"></xptr>bring him out; he said he was going to the watch-house, as he was accused of Mr. Brown's robbery. I said several times in the hearing of the officers, that he had been with me, and it was impossible.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you go to the Magistrate, to give the account you gave to-day - A. Yes; they said no witnesses for prisoners were wanted there.</p>

            . I saw this woman there, but never heard a word about her being in his company. I might have told her to stay there till I returned. I remember her saying they had been to the Cat and Mutton that night together, and Redman mentioned about being at the Porto Bello. She said at the watch-house, that she had been with him, but I do not think she mentioned it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Pino, at 101, Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill—the prisoner was in the same service—we did not sleep in the same room at the time she was confined, but we did on the Thursday afterwards—on the Wednesday before Good Friday I moved the prisoner's box to clean under it, on the floor, and found a stain of blood under it, which came from the bottom of the box—I cleaned the floor, and put the box on the bed, and when I moved it from the bed I saw two stains on the sheet—the smell continued—she had not told me she was in the family-way, but I had observed appearances of it—I do not know whether she had made any preparation for the birth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on Good Friday morning, 7th April, I was sent for to the police-station, Notting Hill, to examine the prisoner—I found that she had been confined, probably three weeks before—I asked her to tell me about it—she said that she was taken ill the Sunday week before, at her master's house, Blenheim Crescent, and the baby was born at 7 o'clock in the morning, and she was not conscious of what was taking place, and found herself confined of a child; that she got up afterwards and put the body of the child into a box, and tied herself up and went about her work, and put the after-birth in the fire—I asked her if she had heard the child cry—she said "No"—I was directed to go to the house to examine the box, and saw the body of a large male child, in a tolerably advanced state of decomposition—I should say that it had been born three weeks before—my connexion with the case there terminated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She told me that she was confined the Sunday week before—decomposition is sometimes more rapid than at others, especially when shut up in a box—she did not say that she was sitting on the open box—the stains were not blood, they were the result of decomposition—she said that she was unconscious at the time—that is not at all unusual; if she had been suffering all night she was probably in a state of uncon<lb></lb>sciousness, it being her first child—she answered all my questions in a straightforward manner, without the slightest concealment.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 101, Blenheim Crescent—the prisoner was in my service eighteen months—on Thursday, 6th April, I received information from the father of my other servant, and next morning I went to the room where the prisoner slept, and told her I wanted to see her box—she made some difficulty about not being able to find the key—I said that I wanted to have the box opened, and she found the key and opened the box—there was a very bad smell; I did not ask any questions, but sent for Dr. Kemp—we then found the dead body of a male child—I sent for a constable, locked up the body in the room, and gave the key to him.</p>

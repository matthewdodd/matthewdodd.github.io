            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 12th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Waterloo town, Bethnal-green, and saw the prisoner with three men - we took all four into custody, and in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket, I found a duplicate of this gown and table cloth. I told him he was apprehended for a burglary committed last night close by, and I had no doubt but the duplicate was for some of the woman's clothes which were stolen; he said "I had no duplicates;" I said "You certainly had; I found one in your right hand waistcoat pocket;" he said "If you will swear that, you will swear any thing."</p>

            . At the time of the robbery I lived in Quaker-street, Spitalfields. I pawned these things in the name of Trivens, not Trapping; I was at that time living with Trivens, and the people supposed I was his wife; I do not know the prisoner - I was at home, in Quaker's-street, on the 11th of March at seven o'clock - a young man came and asked for Trivens - he spoke to him, but I was cleaning and did not hear what he said - he had a bundle, and when they had done speaking, the young man turned round and said to me, "Will you pledge these" - it was a table-cloth and gown, and by persuasion, I pawned them at Russell's for 2s.; I returne dand put the duplicate on the table with the money- he and Trivens were both there; I did not see him put the duplicate, and money into his pocket; I told the Grand Jury I thought the prisoner was the man - but I do not know whether he is or not.</p>

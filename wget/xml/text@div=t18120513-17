               <p>Q. When did you lose this telescope - A. Last Saturday afternoon, the 9th of May, in the afternoon between five and six, the prisoner came into the shop for some relief. I am an overseer. She produced this pass to me as overseer, and while I turned my back to write my name on the back of the pass, she secreted a telescope; I had no suspicion of the telescope being gone, my wife assured me that she had taken something.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife present - A. She was not, she was in the parlour, the parlour door had glass windows. I had the money in my hand to give her in the shop, but when I saw the telescope taken from the counter and in her lap, I did not give her the money but sent for an officer, he came and searched her and took away the property from her.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Banks, I fetched the officer; we searched the prisoner and found the telescope upon her.</p>
               <p>GIBSON. I am the officer that took the prisoner, I had taken this woman about three hours before, she was drunk in the street, I put her in the watch-house and sobered her; when she went out she went to Mr. Banks's and stole this telescope, I put her in the watch-house and kept her there an hour to keep her from the boys, she had an hour's sleep and got sober. This is the telescope.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain it is my telescope.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge - Eaton informed me on Monday, that he had been robbed on Saturday night, and described the prisoner - I knew her, and could not find her - I found her at High-Wycomb fair, in company with Donovan and Rosin - Eaton accused nobody but the prisoner; he told me two women had been in his company, one shortly before the other - Donovan is not like the prisoner; I took her from his description - one could not be mistaken for the other - I found seven sovereigns, and 17s. 6d. on the man; the women left word at a stall that Jem would finde them at the Red-lion public-house, and he came there to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who is Jem? A. Rosin; I believe he travels with turnery - I have found none of the property; he described two women to me, and I thought Donovan was like one of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say which of the women robbed him? A. No; he said, a woman came up, and in a few minutes another joined him - he did not say which he suspected, nor that he felt his money safe after the thin one left him - he said when the last one left he missed his purse.</p>
               <p>COURT to S. EATON. Q. Did you meet two women? A. Yes; I met one three hundred yards before the prisoner, she only spoke and passed on; she was a thin tall woman - I had my hand in my pocket when the prisoner came up - I told the officer where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell him who robbed you? A. I said the second person who met me.</p>

            . I live at Uxbridge; I was at the Red-lion public-house, on Sunday morning, in church time - I saw Eaton come in with the watchman - he said, he had been robbed of some sovereigns and notes last night - I went into the kitchen and told the persons there, a man had been robbed last night of sovereigns and notes; there were several travellers there - Ellen Donovan, Rosin, and the prisoner were there - Donovan turned very white, and went into the back parlour, staid some time, and then came back - they dined, and then went away - Eaton did not go into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner show any indication of guilt? A. No - Donovan looked frightened - the prisoner heard what I said.</p>

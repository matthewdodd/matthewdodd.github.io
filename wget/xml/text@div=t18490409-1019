                  </hi>. I am a surveyor and auctioneer. On 31st March I was at the Sutton Arms, Caledonian-road, Islington—I supped there with the landlord, and about half-a-dozen select friends—I was leaving to go to my own residence, about half-past eleven—as I fronted the bar, the pri<lb></lb>soner stood there with two other persons—I had seen him at my house the day before on business—he said, "What are you going to stand?"—I said, "Anything you like, but it is your turn"—he said, "I have no money"—I said, "Well, have what you like"—I ordered Mrs. Clayton to draw them what they liked—there were three glasses of brandy and water had, one of soda-water, and a cigar—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had one glass of brandy and water—I threw down a sovereign, and said to Mrs. Clayton, "Take for what we have had out of that"—she turned her head to a little parlour to get change, and the prisoner took up the sovereign and put it into his pocket—I said, "Don't be a fool; pull that sovereign out; let me pay for the reckoning"—he said, "I have not got it, I did not take it up, I have no money"—Mrs. Clayton came back, and the prisoner borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of one of his friends to pay the reckoning—he seemed in a jocular mood—I still insisted on having the sove<lb></lb>reign—we left the house, and came on towards my residence—I could not find a policeman—when we got to a coffee-shop, which was open, I said, "You shall <hi rend="italic">go</hi> no further, I am determined to have the sovereign"—we went in there, and had some coffee—I sent a friend to fetch the policeman—the pri<lb></lb>soner still said he had not got the sovereign, he had not got any money at all—I saw the prisoner searched at the station—the sovereign was found in the pocket which I pointed out.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you meet with the friend that you sent for the policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the coffee-house door—he is my own family doctor—the prisoner said he lived in Chichester-place—he keeps a corn-dealer's shop, or something of that sort—he came to me the day before, and wanted a customer for the shop—I think my clerk wrote down the particulars—the supper that night began about half-past eight o'clock—I should say I might have had one glass more than enough—I had had about two glasses of brandy and water—I was sober, but not perfectly sober—I have been charged with felony—I was discharged in that case—I had paid for an article, and it appeared that the party who sold it me had not come by it properly—I tendered the receipt before the Magistrate, and he said that the prosecutor ought to be placed in my position—I charged a woman I had gone home with, with stealing a watch—it was afterwards brought to me by the policeman, and the woman was discharged—the Magistrate asked me whether I wished to press the charge, and said had I not better take the watch back—I did so—the Magistrate dismissed the case, but said he would leave it open for me to indict him—I preferred this bill, not behind the prisoner's back, he knew it perfectly well—I told him at the police that I would indict him—the Magistrate allowed the sovereign to be placed in the policeman's hands—he did not bind me over to prosecute.</p>

England supped at our house on 31st March—when he was leaving, the prisoner asked him what he would stand—he said anything he liked to drink—they had brandy and water, and one of them had soda-water—Mr. England took a sovereign out of his pocket and told me to take the reckoning—he put it on the counter towards me—I went into the bar-parlour to get change—on my return I did</p>

Mr. England gave the prisoner in my charge—the prisoner said he had no money: I am quite sure of that—when Smith asked for the pay for the tea, Mr. England said, "Who will pay for it?—the prisoner said, "I have got no money"—Mr. England paid for it—when I got within about 200 yards of the station the prisoner said, "I do not disown having a sovereign; I borrowed it"—when I got to the station I found a sovereign in his left-hand trowsers-pocket—Mr. England had said it was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit-broker, and live at No. 27, Pudding-lane. On Friday morning, the 11th of March, about a quarter or half-past one o'clock I was returning home with Mr. Claridge who lives at No. 21, Pudding-lane—I was just parting with him—there is a flap to the cellar of Mrs. Walter, of the King's Head public-house—I heard a noise like the pin out of a Shutter, which drew my attention to the flap, and I saw a man get up—I suppose he was putting the flap into its proper situation—I was ten fifteen yards from him—he went away—I went down the lane to the flap, and found it partly open—Mr. Claridge and myself lifted it up and saw a man in the cellar—I closed the flap and stood upon it—he called out to me to let him come up, that he only went there to sleep—Mr. Claridge went and brought a policeman—they went into Walter's house and took the man into custody—it turned out to be the prisoner.</p>

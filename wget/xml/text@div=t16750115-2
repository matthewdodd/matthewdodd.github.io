               <p>The first Indictments for Felonious taking away of the 3000 Pound, he Pleaded Guilty; To the 2 Indictment, whereupon (besides the Feloney) he was indicted of Burglary which he might know was a Crime that exempted him from the benefit of Clergy <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16750115005"></xptr>he was so much a friend to himself as to put himself upon his Tryal by Pleading not Guilty.</p>

               <p>The fact was Clearly proved against, him both by Witnesses and his own confession in a letter of his own wrighting, which was read in Court, and wherein he owned the fact, and said moreover, that he stole the key wherewith he opened the door out of the said Mr. Lees Pocket; but the witnesses tonement varyed in their Evidence as to that, whether the said doore was broken open or opened by a key.</p>
               <p>There was some dispute in the Court whither the Indictments was well laid for the burglary, for that the fact although the same yet related to several persons the house that was broken open being Mr. Rowland Lees the Elder, and the Money that was taken away was Mr. Rowland Lees the younger, and therefore it was advised whither another Bill should not be drawn up to indict him severally of the burglary, but this Court not being agreed upon; the whole matter was left to the Jury, who brought him in <rs id="t16750115-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

On the 1st of February, about half after two o'clock, I was first in his company at the White Swan in Rosemary lane; I met him afterwards in Leadenhall street.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you were in his company had you any notes, or drafts in your possession - A. Yes; I had a hundred pound bank note, a check for twenty four pound, a two pound bank note, four one pound notes. I had them in a sample bag in the inside coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were in company with the prisoner, did you take them out - A I did, in the back room in the White Swan; I asked Mackdonald to look at this check; I said I am not used to these checks, as I am of gold and bank notes; when I shewed him the check he could see that I had bank notes in my pocket; at the same time he gave his opinion, and another man sitting by said he knew Mr. Milton very well, the check was a very good one; I put the check into my bag, and put the bag into my pocket again; the prisoner and the other man had an opportunity of seeing me put them in my pocket; there were a good many people sitting there, but none that took any notice that I could see; they were playing at cards; this was about half after two o'clock in the afternoon; I had been to market to pay this money, but I was too late; I left the house in about a quarter of an hour; I met the prisoner again in Leadenhall street, about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he join in company together - A. No; I had something else to do; at eleven o'clock at night I saw him on the Surrey side of London bridge; he was walking the same road it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. Nothing further than countryman how do you do. I went into the Mitre, Tooley street, and had a pint of porter; when I had drank the pint of beer. the landlady of the public house told me it was time to go home; going home over <placeName id="t18080601-83-crimeloc483">Westminster bridge</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Had they all slouched hats - A. Yes. There was a lamp that gave me a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say who was the man that took the bag out of your pocket - 
               <persName id="t18080601-83-person706">A. Alexander Mackdonald</persName>
             was the man, most undoubtedly; his face was well known; after trying to catch him in vain, I went home. It might be then within ten minutes of twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How soon did you make this charge against the prisoner - A. I did not make the charge against him till the 7th of May, because he owed me six pound ten shillings and sixpence. I had a better opinion of him when I lent him the money that that he would become a thief and rob me on the highway; he promised to bring this money forward; I was persuaded to get the money first and take him up afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did he pay you this money - A. Two days before that; after that I went to Bow street; the prisoner was taken before the magistrate and there bailed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long after the robbery was committed was it before you went to Bow street - A. From the 1st of February, till the 7th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. That is near four months; had you been making any complaints against the prisoner or any body - A. Yes; I had been to Mr. Bligh about the business; but I did not tell him of the prisoner; I was afraid he would fly; I wished Mr. Bligh to go and see whether he could find the other men that were with Mackdonald; I supposed them to be two soldiers; he went up to the horse guards to see if he could see any loose people about; I told him that all three had soldier's clothes on, and great coats on, such as they call weather coats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe to him that the three persons that robbed you had soldier's clothes on with slouched hats - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe at that time that the prisoner was one of three - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him instructions to take up three persons - A. It does not signify to bother me; the prisoner at the bar is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you tell Mr. Bligh to take up three persons - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that - A. Yes; I told him there were three men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present at the time you gave instructions to Bligh - A. Yes; he was very busy on the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear the charge to Bligh that you gave against the three persons that he was to take up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he was not there - A. He came up soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told me the prisoner was present - A. He was there; he came soon afterwards; I was in Mr. Bligh's house; this prisoner came there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses might you have been in this day - A. What day.</p>
               <p>Q. What day, indeed! I do not believe a word of it - A. I do not care whether you do or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public houses had you been in - A. Not above five.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank in each of the public houses - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been drinking of - gin - A. No, porter; gin is not my liquor.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came to London bridge was you drunk or sober - A I was sober enough to know what I was about; I had my senses about me as much as I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking this morning - A. I have had two half pints of porter, and a glass of gin and bitters.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought gin was not your liquor - how came you to take it this morning - A. I had a pain in my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober when you attended at Bow street - A. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended the night afterwards - was not you turned out of the office because you was beastly drunk, was not you told by the magistrate to go out, and did not he order the officer to turn you out - A. Yes, I was told so; I was not drunk</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of your property A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man, supposing your story is true, had all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010063"></xptr>the four months to squander oway your money, and you never charged him of robbing you till the 7th of May, for the purpose of getting your six pounds - A. It is so.</p>
               <p>Then I leave you with the jury.</p>
               <p>COURT. How was the prisoner dressed - A. He was dressed in boots, blue coat and waistcoat, and a round hat; he was dressed like a gentleman; he had the same dress when I met him on the Surry side of London bridge.</p>

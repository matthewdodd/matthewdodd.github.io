                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Powles, a hosier, of Fleet-street—on 26th February, the prisoners came—I was at the other end of the shop, and saw Mr. Powles serve them with twelve cambric handkerchiefs, two silk scarfs, six pairs of kid gloves, one silk mantle, three flannel shirts, and thirty-six yards of Irish linen—they selected them between them—they came to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they ordered them to be sent to 17, Margaret-street, at 7 o'clock—I took them there, and was answered by a maid-servant—I said that there was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay—she said, "Mr. Carri is out, but will be in in half an hour—I remained in the hall, and the servant went up stairs—a man with a cap came in, asked for Mr. Carri, and went up stairs—I had remained there twenty minutes or half an hour when Carri came in and went up stairs—I remained a few minutes and the man with the cap came down and went out, and afterwards Carri went out—I stood up to speak to him, but did not as I thought he had perhaps gone out to get change—in consequence of something the maid said, I went upstairs and found Paul and Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, as I understood them to be—I demanded my goods of Paul, or else the money—he said that he had not got them; Mr. Carri had gone out and had taken them with him—he spoke to Mr. Robinson in their own language, and then he took his hat and said he would take me to a friend's house where he thought we should find Mr. Carri—they can both speak English—I know that Carri can, because he spoke to me, and he spoke at the police-court—it was broken English, but such as you could understand—I went out with Paul to Oxford-market, and in Soho-square I ran up against Carri, and the man with a cap on—I asked Carri for my parcel or the money—he said that I was to go home, and he would call again to-morrow—Paul was within hearing; they were all three conversing together—I said, "I must have either the parcel or the money, or I will send for a police-constable—we all four went to the house in Margaret-street; one of them knocked at the door, and the man with the cap on turned and went away—the two prisoners went in, and I followed them, and asked the man to run for a policeman—the landlady spoke to the prisoners about my parcel; they said that they had not got it—I was asked to follow them up stairs to the first floor—Carri slipped into another room, and Paul said, "Come along here," or "Follow me up here," trying to induce me to follow him up higher—I said, "I shall not go up, for I know Mr. Carri is gone"—the landlady said,(You had better lock the front door," which I did, and put the key in my pocket—shortly afterwards a policeman, Barber, came, and I told him what had happened—Paul, who had followed me down to the hall, spoke to him—we then went up to the second floor, front, and found Carri smoking a pipe—the policeman demanded the parcel or the money—Carri said that he had not got it; it was locked up in the other room, and Mr. Robinson had got the key—he wanted me to go home, and to write something on a paper for me to take and show to Mr.</p>

               <p>Powles, but I would not have it—shortly afterwards Paul went into the other room and produced six pairs of kid gloves and two silk scarfs—they were jumping about like mad men because I would not go without the goods, and Paul got a poker and advanced to me and the constable, and another constable was sent for—they said that we had better take them to the station to have it settled—they would not produce the other articles—Carri asked me if I would be good and kind if he showed, me where the parcel was—I said, "Yes, all I want is the other portion of the parcel"—we all went out together with the constable, and, they took us to the ice-shop in Oxford-street, where I saw the other portion of the parcel lying on the table all untied—I got my articles and saw that they were all right—one of the policeman asked the ice-man, in the prisoners' presence, who had brought them—he said that Carri had brought them and wished him to let him put them under the counter, but he would not, and he put them on the table—I then gave them both in charge—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my master's property.</p>

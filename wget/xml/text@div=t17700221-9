               <p>Mr. Williamson. I stopped these pair of shoes upon the woman at the bar. (Produced and deposed to.) She brought them to my shop to sell. I sell wholesale and retail. I had sold them to the prosecutrix. I asked the prisoner where she got them? She said, she had them in Monmouth-street. I asked what she asked for them, she said, Half a crown. I said to my wife, Go, and get change for a guinea. She understood me; she went and asked the prosecutrix; she said, she had just lost them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought them in Monmouth-street for my husband; I paid half a crown for them. I would have showed them the place where I bought them, and they would not go with me.</p>
               <p>Williamson. The magistrate gave her two days to find the place where she bought them, but she said, she could not.</p>

               <p>MARGARET WILLIAMS. On the 12th of August, I was going to Wales with Mary Ann Humphries - we were to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140140"></xptr>go by Turner and Bailey's waggon; we went to the White Horse-cellar - I had my property in a small deal-trunk, and fifteen shillings of Mary Ann Humphries' were in it; I had put the things in, but my mother packed it up - the waggon was gone, and my mother, I, and Mary Ann Humphries, went in the Southampton waggon to overtake it; I saw my trunk put into the waggon we went by; we went in at half-past ten o'clock at night, and got on to Hounslow at half-past two in the morning - we then went into a public-house, and three men, not the prisoners, followed us out - the waggoner gave a waggoner a shilling to take us to Staines; we waited there to see if Turner's waggon came; we then went to <placeName id="t18260914-340-crimeloc1917">Colnbrook, to the Punch Bowl, public-house</placeName>

At half-past nine o'clock, on the day in question, I was on the Bath-road - Mr. Cox came and informed me of the robbery - I went in pursuit, and overtook Trindell in the road to Staines - I asked him what had happened, and where the girls were who he had been in company with; he said they were gone down the lane with three gipsies; I went down the lane, and found them with the gipsies; I turned back, and brought Trindell back to the place; the landlord said,"Here is a man here who owns to taking the box, and giving it to another man;" Hazell then came out and said he had given it to Faris; one Goodman, who was bound over, but is not here, brought me the box in the morning.</p>

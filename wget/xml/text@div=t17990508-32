               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket; - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080058"></xptr>I felt her hand about my pocket; but I had two bags in my pocket, and feeling one of them there, I did not miss the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket? - A. I felt her hand rubbing all round my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now, that the time she had her hand about your pocket was the time you were robbed? - A. Yes; I am clear of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to see her at the time? - A. Yes, by the light from the linen-draper's shop at the corner; after that, she absented herself, and I was searching for an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be with you? - A. About a minute and a half; the next evening I went through Scotland-yard again, as I was going that way; there was only the prisoner and another that attends that corner, and I got intelligence from that other woman where to find her, in Tothill-street, Westminster; on the Saturday I went, and they denied that she lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her in Tothill-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was the same woman? - A. Yes; they said, if I had a letter for her they would take care of it for her; I went up stairs, and there she was lying upon the bed, and then she screamed; she seemed in liquor, and I got myself used very ill in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your property since? - A. No; she was taken up the Sunday following.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He said, before the Magistrate, that he saw the prisoner pull a bag out of her bosom.</p>

               <p>Bentley. I saw her pull a bag out of her bosom, turn her backside towards the fire, and pay for what she had; but what there was in it I cannot tell.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner came into my house, the Sun, in Scotland-yard, between seven and eight o'clock on Thursday the 28th of February; I saw no bag, but I saw her with some silver and halfpence, and she paid me for what she called for; she came in doors, and said to me at the bar, that she had done the man out of a seven-shilling-piece; I thought she meant she had given him some bad money, which she had often, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never absconded from my room, and he might have taken me if he would; I was turned out by proclamation last Sessions, here, and he took me up last night again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it true she was discharged last Sessions?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. A. She was in prison from the 9th of March to the 6th of April, upon this same charge.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Christmas.) Q. How came you not to prosecute her last Sessions? - A. Because I was too late to get a bill; I could not get a man that morning to do my business for me.</p>

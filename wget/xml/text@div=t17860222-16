               <p>Did you see her take it off the counter? - No, I did not, I never saw her take it till I saw it stick out behind.</p>
               <p>What value is it? - It is valued at thirteen shillings, but it is worth more money than that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two other people in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that so? - Yes, there were some people at some distance.</p>
               <p>Did any of these persons observe her take the petticoat, and put it under her cloak? - No, my Lord, they did not.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this woman in the shop before? - Yes, she had been a customer many times.</p>
               <p>Did you know where she lived? - She told me she kept a shop in Monmouth-street, but I found she had left that ever since Christmas, she did keep a shop in the ready made line.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that the coat upon the child she has with her? - I believe it may, it is the same colour.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into Mr. Steel's shop to buy this little coat, I did not say I lived in Monmouth-street then, but he knew I had lived there; he asked me six shillings and sixpence for the coat, I gave him five shillings and sixpence for it, he lifted it up, and put it under my arm, and I told him, that I wanted one of a dark colour; he went up stairs and fetched one, and asked me to try it on, I told him, I did not like the colour nor the buttons, he offered to change the buttons, I took off my cloak, and he fitted on the great coat, I told him it was too tight, he wished me to have it, and he went behind me, and said, it fitted me very well, and he picked up a petticoat, the young man had been there wrapping up some petticoats, and he said, I dare say you have had this petticoat under your cloak.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the account she gives true? - Some part of it is; about fitting on the coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the petticoat drop down when she first pulled off her cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very extraordinary if you thought she had been guilty of a felony in stealing this, that you did not proceed to charge her? - I hesitated with myself, whether I should let her go off quietly, as she had been a customer before; and then I thought to let her go, when I had got her, as we had lost so many things, was not right.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not it have been brushed off the counter? - No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Could not she have taken it up by mistake? - I am confident it was a petticoat she had under her arm by the feel.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she willing to pull off her cloak, or did she hesitate? - No, she hesitated; she said, she would bring a lady to suit herself, but when I went past her, I felt through her cloak, and it felt like a stuff petticoat, it was not half a moment before I charged her with the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you charge her with the petticoat, before you tried the great coat, or afterwards? - Afterwards.</p>

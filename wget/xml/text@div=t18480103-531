                  </hi>. I am a broker, at Missionary-place, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On 15th Dec., between ten and eleven at night, I fastened up my premises—I fastened the wash-house door with two middle bolts and a bar across the bottom—that door leads to Missionary-place—I saw a basket of clothes safe on the copper, five or six yards from the door—I fastened the door leading from the wash-house into the parlour, you go from one to the other without going into the yard—I was awoke at half-past one by a knocking at the door—I went down, and was answered by Castleton—I opened the door, and saw him with the prisoner in custody—I afterwards saw my basket and clothes—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were in the wash-house the night before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 33.) On 16th Dec., about half-past one, I was at the corner of Nursery-row, Missionary-place, and heard a rustling, and saw the prisoner coming over the sill of Mr. Newman's wash-house door, which was open—I took him in charge—he said, "I was only passing, and</p>

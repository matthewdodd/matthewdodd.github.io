I immediately let go the prisoner Cook, whom I had got hold of, and ran after the prisoner Porter, and he was stopped in the Church-yard, Islington; the handkerchief and slipper were found on Porter; I found them in his pockets; the constable happened to be at hand, and I called him, and took him to our house, and he was searched, and taken to the justice.</p>

               <p>That is dark in January? - Yes, but there are a good many lamps on the Terrace which shew a great light; he was hallooing at the top of the Terrace, and the prisoner ran towards him.</p>
               <p>When you first ran out at the door, did you see either of them? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When you first saw Cook on the Terrace, what was he doing? - He was making a hallooing just before I got to the Terrace, the corner of Cross-street; I met my brother at the top of Cross-street, and told him they had got the property; my brother laid hold of Cook, and coming back I saw Porter run from behind the watch-box, or somewhere about there, as hard as ever he could; I told my brother that Cook was not the man that robbed the window, but that it was him who ran from behind the watch-box; he ran after him, and left Cook on the Terrace; he was not taken up till the next day, after we went to Mr. Blackborough's.</p>

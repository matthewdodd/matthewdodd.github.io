On Monday the 23d of December, I was sent for to Mr. Clark's house, a linen-draper, in Cheapside, when he told me, Mr. Bolton, in his neighbourhood, had got some goods, which he supposed to be stolen, and he had sent to the printer which had printed some of them, to know whose they were, and they appeared to be mine; he then sent for

He also informed me that he was a married man, though I had hired him for a batchelor, and that he had a lodging in Little bell-alley, which made me think it necessary to get a search-warrant, to search his lodgings; we searched, but found nothing of mine, neither there, nor in his box at my house. I went to Mr. Bolton's house with the prisoner, the officer, and my journeyman. Mr. Bolton and his wife both said the prisoner was the man that brought the goods there.

On the Thursday morning we took the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor, with Evans, there the prisoner confessed he had taken the whole (before my Lord, Mr. Bolton, the officer, and myself) and sold part to John Evans (the goods produced in court, and deposed to, there were two parcels, one that was sold to Evans, and another parcel left with Mr. Bolton.) These are the goods laid in the indictment; there were other goods which the prisoner said were mine, but the marks being out of them, I could not swear to them.</p>

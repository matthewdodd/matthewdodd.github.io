                  </hi>. I keep the Royal Oak, New Road, Woolwich. I saw my copper safe a little before eight o'clock, on the 9th of February, and missed it at twenty minutes past ten o'clock—it was taken out of the brick-work—I have since seen it fitted in the place—it fits exactly—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, about half-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 9th of February—I knocked at the door, and called the name of Elliott twice—he opened the door—I told him I was a constable, that a copper and some lead bad been stolen from Mr. Lee's, the Royal Oak, that night, and suspicion had fallen on him, and I should not be satisfied without searching the room—he said I might—I searched, and found this copper under his bed—I asked if it was his—he said, "No"—I took him—the next morning I fitted it to the brickwork—it agreed perfectly, and Mr. Lee identified it—the prisoner said I should have a difficulty to prove that it was the property of Mr. Lee—that was while he was dressing himself in his own apartment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he the only person who lived in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—it is a small cottage, in some back premises—he was the only person there at that time—two cottages join each other, and there is one room in each—there is a passage between the front houses, down to this little cottage, which stands in the rear—there are not two apartments in the cottage, only one room and one entrance—I found this under the bed on which the prisoner was sitting—he did not seem to be perfectly sober nor perfectly drunk—he was able to walk—he refused to have the handcuffs on, and appeared to be under the influence of liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not say you would have great difficulty in proving he stole it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was as I stated—he said they would have great difficulty in proving it was Mr. Lee's—I took the copper, and fitted it at Mr. Lee's myself.</p>

               <p>something on his shoulder—I am positive he is the man—Mr. Lee lives in the New-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Corss-examined. Q.</hi> How far was he from the prosecutor's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 100 yards—he was not running—he walked under a gas light—I went with Warden to his house—when I asked him where he got the copper from, he said he received it from Mr. Moore in lieu of money that he owed him when he left Woolwich, three months before—he was not drunk—I will not say he was sober—you might consider him sober, or not quite sober—he walked beside the constable, and I carried the copper—the constable had not hold of him—I did not see what he was carrying upon his shoulder—I was about ten yards from him—I am certain it was not a bundle of clothes—whether it was a copper or tub I could not tell—he said we should be troubled to prove that he stole the copper from Mr. Lee's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he tell you that he had fabricated a story; that he had picked it out of the water and it had fallen from a ship? A. No.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I said, No - he said, "It will get a bit of bread," and he took the bar; I stood outside while he went in, and told the woman he had picked it up as a ship was unloading at the saltpetre warehouse, and it was wet - she said, "Are you sure of that?" he said, Yes; she gave him 3d. for it.</p>

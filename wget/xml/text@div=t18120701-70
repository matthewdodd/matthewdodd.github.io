The prisoner came to my shop, on Saturday, the 4th of July; she asked for ribbon. My wife was serving in the shop, as well as me. I took out the drawer. The prisoner bought three different lengths, of three quarters of a yard each. As soon as she had bought the ribbon, she asked to look at some bobbin; and that was kept in a bundle behind. I went to get the bobbin for her. The ribbon remained in the drawer before her. I turned about to get the bobbin, and when I came to the drawer I missed two pieces of ribbon, which I charged the prisoner of having in her possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she the only customer in the shop - A. No, there were two in the shop at the time: my wife was serving them. The prisoner denied having them, and wanted to go out of the shop. I jumped over the counter and stopped her: in presenting her from going out of the shop, they dropped out of her apron. I saw them drop from her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of yards did these pieces of ribbon contain - A. Fifty yards; twenty shillings in value. A constable came by. I gave her in charge of the constable. He has the ribbons in his possession.</p>

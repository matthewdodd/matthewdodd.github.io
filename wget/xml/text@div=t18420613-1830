                  </hi>. I live in Wych-street, Strand. On the night of the 16th of May, about twelve o'clock, I fell in with the prisoner—she asked me to treat her to a glass of porter—I said I did not mind, I was dry myself, she might have one—we went into a public-house, and had a glass each—I did not stop two minutes at the furthest—we came out, and she walked a little way along Long-acre—I went up Belton-street—at the corner-of Belton-street she pretended to kiss me, and put her hand into my bosom—I was surprised when she began to kiss me—I went up Belton street, because she pointed up Phoenix-alley, and wanted me to go to a house there—I knew the house was not an honest one, as I have seen ✗ at the door—I crossed over to the corner of Belton-street, and she stopped, and said, "Well, if you won't go there, I shall bid you good night"—she kissed me, and took my pin, and went away—I called her back, and said, "You have my breast-pin"—she said, "No, you had no pin in your shirt when I met you"—she stopped, and began to talk about a young man that had lost a chain and pin—this was at the corner of Belton-street, where she kissed me—the pin was found in Broad-court, about 300 yards from there—we walked along talking about this young man—I gave her in charge of the policeman, in Broad-court, and she twisted her hand and threw something behind her—the policeman told me to run down to the station, to get a light, and we found the pin where she had thrown</p>

               <p>something behind her—this is the pin—it cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is a British diamond—I had given her nothing—I had not been any where with her.</p>

Q</hi> Where did I first meet you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Bow-street—I might have asked you where you were going—I do not recollect—you asked me to give you a glass of porter—I did not, when we came out of the public-house, say, "Don't go that way, they will think we are going to Phoenix-alley"—I said, nothing of the kind—you pointed to a house in Phoenix-alley, which I knew to be a house where they rob people, that was the reason I did not go with you—I did not, ask you to sleep with me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor say, "Go this way, you will find a room that is cheaper"—I said, "if I go to a house I will go to one I know"—I know several houses if I wanted to go—I was sober—I did not give you the pin, and say, "I will let you have it till I have more money"—I did not behave in a very indecent manner to you at the corner of Belton-street, nor say, as I could not stay all night, it was useless to go and pay for a room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About a quarter before one o'clock the prosecutor came up, and gave the prisoner in charge—he was sober—he said he wished to give her in charge for stealing a pin from the breast of his shirt—I made an attempt to take hold of her hands when she put them behind her, and appeared to throw something away—I asked him to go to the station for a light, which he did, and found the pin about a yard from where she appeared to throw something away—it was in a dark part of the court.</p>

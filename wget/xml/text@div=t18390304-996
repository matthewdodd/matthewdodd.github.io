                  </hi>. I live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's. On the 19th of February, I was taking a quantity of soap, belonging to my father, Ed<lb></lb>mund Fitzgerald, into Mr. Barton's shop, in Bishopsgate-street—my younger brother was with me—I received information, went out, ran across the road, and found the prisoner with a bar of soap in his apron—I believe it to be ours, but cannot swear to it.</p>

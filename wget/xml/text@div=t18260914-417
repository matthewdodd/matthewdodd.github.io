            . I am an officer, and live in Grenville-street. Somer's-town. On the morning of the 14th of July I saw five persons together, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, perhaps about one mile and a quarter from the prosecutor's house; two on them attacked me with the butt-end of this gun; I searched the prisoner, who was one of them - the others got away; I found this gown in his hat, and this gun was thrown at my feet.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to bathe - I met four young men in Maiden-lane - one of them had some birds; they said it was too cold to go into the water, and they asked me to go and catch birds; we went on to Camden-town, and one of them asked me to put the gown in my hat, and said it belonged to his sister; I did so, and when we got on further, the officer took me - the gun was thrown down.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

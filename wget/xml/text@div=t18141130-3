               <p>Q. When she came out of the stationer's shop, did she join the other woman then - A. Plank will speak to that. I went into the shop; I ascertained she had been changing some money there; I saw Mr. Kirby, and found she had passed a bad sixpence there. When she came out, she went into Albemarle-street, into a pastry-cook's shop, and the other woman walked on two or three doors following, waiting for her. At the pastry-cook's shop she uttered a shilling; she came out. I went into the shop to make enquiry, and when I came out, I lost the two prisoners, and Plank to. I kept strait down Piccadilly, thinking I should meet them, and when I came back again, I saw the two prisoners, and Plank following them, I joined Plank.

            ; I went into Mr. Spencer's shop; I discovered that some money had been changed there. The young prisoner was in the shop, she had got a large shawl on, and had got a loaf or a roll in her hand. Mr. Spencer was in the act of taking some halfpence out of the till to give her change; I laid hold of the prisoner's hand; I then desired Mr. Spencer to look at the money he had taken; I told Mr. Spencer that she was a common utterer, to be particular in marking the money he had taken of her. I told the prisoner that she had got something in her hand; she was scuffling with me; she dropped something from her hand upon the floor; it was money; I picked it up from the floor, and put it in my hat, and what I found upon her; I also put into my hat three shillings and two-pence in copper, that was the money that dropped down, and what I found in her pocket together; I had mixed them; there is one shilling bad; the others I believe are good, a three-shilling bank token, two good shillings, a counterfeit shilling, and two-pence in copper. The other prisoner was brought in by Plank. I searched the old woman; in her right hand pocket I found three shillings and two-pence three farthings in copper, in the same pocket eight good sixpences; I believe they are good. I then asked her in the presence of the other prisoner, if she had any counterfeit money on her person; she said, she had not. I searched her further; I found forty sixpences; thirty-nine of them appear to be counterfeit, and one good. I have them here. I spoke to both the prisoners; I asked them if they knew each other; they denied having any knowledge of each other. This is the shilling found upon the old woman; I looked at the sixpence uttered to Mr. Spencer; I desired him to mark it; he did, and delivered it to me. I have had it ever since, and have it now to produce.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that sixpence uttered to Mr. Spencer - A. It is a counterfeit, and it is likely to impose upon any body, and the thirty-nine are all counterfeits something like the other of the same materials.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Foy on Tuesday the 22d of November, in Bond-street. I first saw them in Oxford-street; they were together walking and talking. I saw the young one go into several shops. I saw her go into one shop in Oxford-street; the other waited for her coming out, two doors off; they joined immediately; they crossed Hanover-square into Bond-street. The young one went into Mr. Ward's shop, the other remained a short distance off as before; she did not stay a quarter of a minute in the shop. Immediately she come out the two prisoners joined; they went down Bond-street. When they came to the corner of Stafford-street, the young one went into the shop at the corner of it. The young one turned to the left into Stafford-street, and the old one went town into Albemarle-street. I kept my attention to the old one. I saw the young one come down towards her in about two minutes; the elder waited for her; they joined company immediately; the younger one gave the other some money; what it was I do not know; by the whiteness it was silver. They conversed a minute together or so. I saw the elder receive something from the younger; they stopped at the White Horse, and close to that there is a confectioner's shop. The young one went into it; she come out very quick, and was eating of something; and she delivered something from her hand to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could you see what it was - A. No; I did not go near enough for fear of being known; they then passed on together. I told the last witness to go into the shop; they passed on towards Hyde-park corner. There is a pastry-cook's shop in Piccadilly; they passed the pastry-cook's shop; they stopped and consulted together; the old one gave the young one a piece of money what it was I do not know. I was on the other side of the way. Stanley then went to the shop window, took up a cake, and gave something into the hand of

             delivered the sixpence into my hand; I returned it to her, and desired her to keep it in paper until I called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Tuesday the 22d of November. On the Thursday following I called again; I received the sixpence of her which I had desired her to mark before she gave it me. I have had it ever since. On the Tuesday after I came out of the shop, I immediately pursued the prisoners; they went on towards Hyde-park. Foy was in company with me. I had just met with him. I kept near the prisoners; they passed on until they came to that gate; the young one received something of the elder prisoner again, I could not see what it was; she went to the lodge; I saw her take up some curds and whey at the window; she gave some money to a child at the window within the shop, that child is not here. The child gave her some change, I supposed it to be some halfpence, I was not near enough to distinguish; the other one was walking just round the corner, close to the lodge. The young one then delivered something to the old one; they passed on down the right-hand side of the road to Knightsbridge. When they came near to Mr. Speneer's shop, the baker, the elder one passed on about two doors past the shop, and the young one went in. Foy and I went into the shop after her. In about a quarter of a minute the elder one stepped and looked back. I went on to the elder prisoner; she was standing with her right hand in her pocket, and her left was closed. I went behind her, and took hold of the wrist of her right hand and drew it out of her pocket, and at the same time I took hold of her left hand, and with some difficulty, I opened her left hand. In it I found these two counterfeit sixpences. I took her back into Mr. Spencer's shop, where I found Foy and the other prisoner. I held her hand while he searched her; I heard Foy ask the question which he has stated; each of them denied any knowledge of each other. I never heard them acknowledge they were relations.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. Bridgman, a pastry cook, Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 22d of November, a person coming to your shop window - A. I recollect a person; I do not know the person; she asked me at the window for a penny almond cake; she gave me a sixpence; I took the sixpence and gave her fivepence change. I put the sixpence into the till; there were two other sixpences in the till, and three or four shillings in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the two other sixpences before that - A. I know the two other sixpences that I before had taken were different from this other. I knew the two sixpences in the till by being large sixpences, and much battered. Plank came immediately to the shop window, after I had served that person. I shewed him that sixpence I received of that person. I am sure the sixpence I received from that person I shewed to Plank. He desired me to put it by, for I should be called on again. No person had come to the window between the time I took it and the time I shewed it to Plank. I rolled the sixpence in a bit of paper, it was put into a box in the parlour. On Thursday afterwards Plank came to me, I delivered him the sixpence; he desired me to mark it. I did so; this is the sixpence to the best of my belief; I put a cross upon it; that is the sixpence I received of the young woman that came before Plank.</p>
               <p>COURT. Look at the prisoners; might it not be one of the two - A. It might be, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. It is a counterfeit sixpence, like the one produced first with the same mark; there is a figure of 8 upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the sixpence uttered to Mr. Spencer A. Yes; the two sixpences produced by Plank are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300006"></xptr>counterfeits, with different marks upon them, like some of the thirty-nine.</p>

            . I am a baker at Knightsbridge. On the 22d of November, the young prisoner came into my shop, she asked for a twopenny loaf. I served her; she gave me a sixpence, I gave her fourpence change; no person came in after before Mr. Foy; he came in in the space of a minute or less; he said this is an utterer of base and counterfeit money, I should be glad to look at the sixpence. I turned round to get the sixpence; I had put it on a bit of paper in the bowl of money, it was mixed with no other sixpence. I shewed Foy the sixpence, and by his desire I marked it. I gave it Mr. Foy. This is the sixpence, I marked it at the edge with a knife. In the scuffle the fourpence and the loaf were put on the counter both; some customers came in, and there was a confusion.</p>

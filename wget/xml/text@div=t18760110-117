                  </hi>. I have been called to the Bar, and live at 14, Albert Mansions, Victoria Street—in the year 1867 I was visiting at the house of a lady in St. George's Place—the prisoner was a footman there—about a year afterwards I met him accidentally in Piccadilly—he addressed me and said he had been dismissed from the service of the lady where I had seen him as footman, that he was out of place and in want of money—I gave him something, I cannot remember what-from that time down to 1871 I saw him perhaps three times; I can't say positively, they were acci<lb></lb>dental meetings—I gave him other monies, altogether perhaps a little over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not as much as 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in 1871 I was living with my mother at Rutland Gate—I was possessed of a gold watch, chain, and latch key—I wore it in my waistcoat pocket, without the chain being attached to my button hole, the watch in one pocket, and the latch key in the other—I can't say what the value of the watch was, I did not purchase it—it was worth more than ten guineas—I recollect walking from Hyde Park Corner towards the Albert Gate in the Park roadway about 11 o'clock one night in the beginning of August, 1871—I was wearing my watch as I have described—I met a soldier in the uniform of the Horse Guards Blue—he was not known to me—he made some remark to me which I answered—I do not remember what the remark was—he was only a minute in my presence—I went straight home to Rutland Gate—I found I had not my latch key with me, and 1 suspected that the watch was gone, and it was not there, the key and chain and watch were gone—I have no positive know<lb></lb>edge when or how they were taken from me, I had not felt them taken—I saw the prisoner two or three days after my loss; it was an accidental meeting—I told him of the loss of my watch, I thought he might be able to recover it, that he might go round to the pawnbrokers and try to recover it—I did not know the number of the watch; I could not tell him the number—I told him to make enquiries about it—I saw him again a day or two after wards—when I first met him I pointed out the man I believed to be the man I had seen that evening, who I believed to have stolen the watch, I meant the soldier—the prisoner told me he thought his name was Dale—when I saw him again he said he had been unable to find the watch at the pawnbrokers—I had described it to him—I told him I was leaving town and he said he would write to me if he heard anything of it—I did get a letter from him—I don't know what has become of it, I suppose I destroyed it—I came up to town and met him by appointment in the street, I think it was in the park—I never saw him in any house from the time I saw him as footman, down to the time when the detective Butcher was at my lodging—on meeting him he told me he thought he would be able to get the watch back for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him the money and it was arranged that he was to bring the watch to me at a certain place, I think at the South Kensington Station, some time that afternoon—he did not come, I did not see him till nearly a year after, nor hear from him—I then met</p>

               <p>him accidentally in Piccadilly—he addressed me, he gave no explanation about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the watch, hardly any conversation passed—I can't re<lb></lb>member what was said—nothing was said about the watch or the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was only a minute or two with me, I went away and went home—I do not remember anything that was said, it is nearly five years ago—I can't be certain when I next saw him, not for many months—I can't remember where it was, it was in the street accidentally—I never had any conversa<lb></lb>tion with him in reference to my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or the recovery of my watch, I always avoided him afterwards—I went to reside at Albert Mansions in April, 1872—I never gave the prisoner my address—in June and July, 1872, I re<lb></lb>ceived two letters—I received no letter after that until the one dated 7th December—I have given the prisoner a small sum once or twice since I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when I met him by accident, and he asked me for money, when he was out of place—I gave him small sums—he had always some story about being out of place, and about getting something out of pawn—the largest sum I have given him on those representations has been perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't say exactly the maximum amount I have given him, perhaps over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I say I avoided him after he had the money, I mean I never spoke to him unless he spoke to me, and I only re<lb></lb>mained in his presence a few minutes—he followed <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about—I was not exactly alarmed at him, I endeavoured to get rid of him—I was out of town on 7th December, I returned about the 14th, and found this letter awaiting me at the St. James's Club, but it was directed to Victoria Street—I then consulted my solicitor, and afterwards addressed a letter to the address given, Nutford. Place—Sergeant Butcher was brought to my rooms at an appointed time—the prisoner came to my rooms—I held in my hand the letter I had received, and I said "Did you write this letter?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "Did, you send this letter?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "What do you want?"—he replied "Whatever you like to give me"—I said "Supposing I refuse to give you anything, what will you do then?"—I cannot remember what he said, he gave some vague answer—at that moment Butcher came into the room, he had been in the adjoin<lb></lb>ing room—I had never given the prisoner my address—beyond pointing out the soldier who I supposed to be the person who had accosted me I had never seen or spoken to that person afterwards—I don't remember that the prisoner ever gave me Dale's Christian name. (<hi rend="italic">The letter were read as follows:</hi>" 3, Nutford Place, Edgware Road, 7th December, 1875. Sir,—I am sorry to inform you that I am very ill, I hope you will assist me, if not I will write to the Club and tell them the number of your watch, how you lost it, and who took it, and where you lost it.

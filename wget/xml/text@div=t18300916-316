I was going round my beat, from Tottenham-court-road to the New-road - I tried the doors and windows, and found the door of this shop open; this padlock was hanging to the door- it had been picked; I pushed it open, and saw the prisoner standing inside the shop; I asked him what brought him there - he said he was Mr. Fowler, from Hampstead, and he was going to shut up his shop - I said he was not Mr. Fowler, for I knew him; I met the policeman, and gave him into custody - another Policeman then came with a light, and we found these two sacks of harness; the prisoner said he was going to Hampstead, and if I would go with him he could prove he was Mr. Fowler; at the station he gave his name as

On the 9th of September I saw the prisoner at the King's Head; we staid there about an hour, and then went to the Adam and Eve - he left my company about a quarter-past eleven o'clock; he was drunk, and no one who saw him could avoid seeing that he was so - Tinson was with us; we had a great deal of brandy and water - it was a wet night; we were all nearly drunk - I went to get a coach, and when I came back the prisoner was gone; I have kept my present shop five years, and lived seven years eight doors farther on - I have known the prisoner fourteen or fifteen years; he is a hackney-master, and has had a very good character.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TINSON. My father is landlord of the Old Bailey public-house. I was with the witness and the prisoner at two or three public-house; we parted from the prisoner a little past eleven o'clock - the house was about shutting up; the prisoner was drunk.</p>

               <p>Who were they? - Women of the town and pickpockets. I brought them back about seven at night. When I set them down, I went into the house to get my money, as I was to be paid separately. I got the money of two of them. I heard the coach move, and I ran out of doors.

She said, if I would not meddle with her, she would get down; and I went into the house again, to get my money, and left her on the box. I received money for one more; then I heard the coach move again. I went out, and took hold of her petticoats, to pull her down, and she dropped into the boot. While I was doing this, Cox came out of the house behind me, and took my handkerchief out of my pocket, and ran into the house. I let go Hanslow, and ran into the house after her. I was afraid to accuse her in the house, there were so many bad boys and men in it. I took her by the shoulder, and desired her to come out, to speak to her. She came out with me, and I charged her with having my handkerchief. She denied it; and then Ann Hanslow came down off the box, and they both jostled me; and Cox got her hand into my pocket, and took out 6 s. 6 d. or 7 s. I got Cox down, and sat upon her: the other I had across my knee: 1 s. fell on the ground, which Hanslow took up. I called out then, George! three times: that was for a man who is my fellow-servant, who rode behind the coach from Peckham fair. He and

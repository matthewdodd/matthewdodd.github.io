               <p>Court. How long has he been in this business of putting up letters. - A. About nineteen years by me, and about four months by my father, before I came home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then he had nothing at all to do with letters that had been received by others that were put in the drawer; therefore of course what might have been done he could not know any thing about it. - A. He could not till he come.</p>
               <p>Q. And after he had done he used to go away. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right with respect to the receiving of letters (and yours is a very large receiving house) during the whole course of time, from eight or nine o'clock in the morning, from the time they receive letters, till half after three, he had nothing at all to do with letters. - A. Nothing at all till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. All that he had to do was to take the letters and get them ready for this bag. - A. That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nothing on earth to do with the receipt of any letters. - A. Nothing, except the time he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. That half hour that he was there. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. You will admit, my lord, that it was towards the evening Mr. Snell put in that letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(to Mr. Snell) You thought that it was in the evening that you put in that letter. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190017"></xptr>Q. What part of the day was it, evening or afternoon; was it before three or after three; will you venture to swear that it was before one or the other. A. I cannot charge my memory either one way or the other, I believe it was towards the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Stevenson). Have you in the course of your business (that speaks for itself) entrusted this man with large sums of money. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always found him honest. - A. Always; I have given him large sums of money, and always found him honest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. I believe after the time that the prisoner came into the shop, he had the whole custody of the letters, I mean from half past three to five. - A. He made up the bag, and had the care of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When he was making up the letters for the messenger, before they were dispatched, they went through his hands while he put them up, A. Yes, and then he went away, after five o'clock he had not the care of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. What did he do when he came at five o'clock. - A. The paid letters did not go at four o'clock, he used to come again at twenty minutes, or a quarter before five o'clock, to make up the bag of the paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner send the bill with the paid letters and the money. - A. I do suppose that he did, it is his own writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. After he put the letters in the bag, and before he came at five o'clock, in whose possession did the bag remain in. - A. The bag goes at four o'clock, and from that time till five, the paid letters remain in the same position as all day long, in the drawer in the shop, till he comes to put them up at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. So that they remain in the open drawer from four o'clock, when you send the unpaid letters, till five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is absent from four to five. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. So you keep them in an open drawer. A. It is a way they have been kept for many years.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very bad way; here is a list of letters sent on that day. and in this list this letter is not given.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first averment in the indictment is, that he had it in his possession, whether there is any distinct evidence of it ever having been in his possession.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I stand before you charged with the commission of an offence which the course of forty years of my life, and the uniform habit of distinguishing between the property of others, and the little I could call my own, has ever been regarded by me in common with every other breach of moral rectitude in the intercourse between man and man, with the utmost abhorrence. This misfortune has so destroyed my hopes of future peace, that had I not yet left sufficient to attach me even to a miserable existence, in the craving wants of a numerous and unprovided family, I should hardly care to preserve a life stained with the imputation of this crime: (for there are many who are always willing to judge harshly with the merely unfortunate and with whom 'tis the same thing to have been suspected as to be guilty) but would resign myself to either fate, and console myself in the reflection that, if I could live without reproach, I should die an honest man; but a wife and six children, the youngest not six years old, without a shilling in the world, call upon me to maintain my innocence; that upon you decision I may still have it in my power to perform for them the common duties of nature, as far as my lessened means and declining spirits may enable me to procure them bread. A father too of seventy five years of age looks to my acquittal before we part for ever. - For their sake and for his I am chiefly desirous to prolong my days, ever under the pressing and painful reflection, that I have stood before you arrainged for a capital offence and received from yourselves the judgement that gave me to my miserable family, or left me to prepare myself for another tribunal; where the innocent and the guilty cannot be confounded; and where the secret actions of all men are known.</p>

               <p>My health is too much affected by this change, and the confinement I have suffered and labouring under, an habitual difficulty in delivering myself in any situation not occurring to me in ordinary life, I beg the indulgence of the court, while I humbly state the ground on which I apprehend it will plainly appear that the prosecution is so far causeless, as respects the object now unfortunately before you.</p>
               <p>My situation has for the first time in my life taught me the necessity of calling to my memory the manner in which I have lived, 'till I had the misfortune to come under the suspicions of any man, and at the same time pointing out the circumstances connected with the prosecution against me, that shews the extreme improbability of my being at all connected in the offence that I am called upon to answer; for after having regularly served my apprenticeship to Mr. Wallis, of King-street, St. James's, who was a hair-dresser, I entered into the service of Mr. Stevenson, the father of the present Mr. Stevenson who keeps the post-office at Charing Cross, where the property in question is stated to have been lost; that was in 1786. The post office business was then received by him, so continued at his house, and by his son till the year 1803, when Mr. Stevenson removed into Panton-street, Leicester-square, during all which time I was constantly employed by the father and son, and for a considerable part of the time was desired to make myself useful to my master in the post office business; and I may safely and truly say, without the least doubt being entertained by either of my employers as to my fidelity to their private concerns, or to the public trust.</p>
               <p>In 1804 Mr. Stevenson returned to Charing Cross, and entered into business with Mr. Bird as a cheesemonger, in which line I could be of no use to them or to my family; Mr. Stevenson therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190020"></xptr>gave up his business as a hair-dresser to

             (another old servant) and myself; in March 1805 Mr. Stevenson again took the post office business as before, and being fully satisfied of my honesty, I was engaged by him in the afternoon, from about half after three or four till five o'clock to make up the letters in readiness to be sent to the General Post Office; Mr. Stevenson having, from the length of my employment in that duty, found me of service to him on account of my ready knowledge of the rates of postage for paid letters. - During the long acquaintance with the nature of the post business, it has frequently happened that letters have been found in the box with property enclosed, but not sealed or made up, and it has occurred to me to meet with an instance of a letter being open, and without any direction, although it contained bank notes to a considerable amount; I discovered from whom it came, in the presence of Mr. Thomas, one of the witnesses, and the neglect of the writer was corrected; but I have never yet found any temptation that led me to forget my duty to others nor to myself. - None of the property which is the subject of this prosecution was put into my hands, nor did I ever see it unless it was with the other letters, and then I assert, with the confidence of a man who is conscious of his integrity, that it must have passed from my hands unnoticed and undistinguished from the rest, and that I am no more guilty of embezzling any one letter or its contents, than I am chargable for embezzling all the letters in the office. I understand the letters are stated to have been left at the office, and paid for some time (perhaps several hours) before I went to attend the forwarding of the letters received in the course of the day. Every person in the shop took in letters; it is the practice when paid letters are brought into the shop, in which there is only one counter, to put them into a loose and open drawer, which is placed on a shelf on the opposite side of the shop, not so high as to be out of the sight of any person of common stature.</p>
               <p>The money received for the postage of paid letters is generally put into the box with those letters, but as change is often wanted, it is not always kept apart; the account is made good out of the till, where in the hurry of business the postage are often thrown; but if I had been base enough to think of withholding any letters, I could not have found an opportunity in a retail shop, where there is full employment for two active partners and two servants, situated in a most public part of the town, and at the very time when the letters were crowding in from the different public offices, banking-houses, army agents, and other persons having considerable correspondence, especially of the common soldiers from their quarters at the guards, who for a quarter of an hour before the close of the post, are thronging into the office with letters. - Besides his business as a cheesemonger, Mr. Stevenson has been many years a collector of the house and window tax, and the tax upon property, for the principal ward in St. Martin's parish, and I have very often been entrusted by him with large sums of money to take to his banker's, and when he has had his receipts to pay over I have been sent by him with drafts on his bankers for seven or eight hundred pounds at a time; the neighbours did not think me unworthy of their trust, for I have frequently been sent by them with money for similar purposes, and other pecuniary affairs on their behalf, all of whom I believe have regarded my poverty and incumbrance as my greatest misfortune, and my integrity during more than twenty years knowledge of me, as my best and constant companion.</p>
               <p>I will not refer more to the actions of my life to shew how undeserving I am of this ruinous prosecution; but leave it to the witnesses, who in the hour of adversity have not forsaken the cause of innocence.</p>
               <p>The offences imputed to me are said to have been committed in November last. On the 17th of December following, 
               <persName id="t18060219-16-person219">Anthony</persName>
             the officer told me he had directions to take me to Mr. Parkin's, solicitor for the Post Office, and who I believe had previously examined every person in Mr. Stevenson's employ. After being examined, I was discharged, but the officer returned with me and searched my lodgings; I do not remember all the streets in going or returning; nothing appeared in consequence of these steps to impeach my conduct, and I was set at full liberty - to my wife I returned a husband, to my children a father, and to my master a servant, without any thing to disturb the peace of my mind. As my examination was the same as the rest, I resumed my employment without any reproach. The next day, as I was shaving Mr. Stevenson, I perceived a letter upon the table, from Mr. Parkin, the solicitor to the Post Office, on the subject of former enquiries; I observed to him that I saw he had another letter from the office about the money, and that they were determined to plague him; he answered, that he was called upon the business again.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of Dec. I was apprehended afresh, my person and lodging was searched as before, and when I had got into the office at Bow-street, I was astonished to find it stated before the magistrate, that a five pound note and parts of a two pound note had been found by some persons the next and following morning after I had attended Mr. Parkin, rolled up and in pieces, and that other pieces of the said notes had been found the following Thursday morning, and that they were found in or about the direction the officer and myself had gone, but at some distance apart, as I understood the examination at the time; upon this examination I was committed to prison, and remained in custody till the 7th of January, when I was a second time discharged, and returned to my business as usual, unconscious of any guilt or any danger. On the tenth of the same month I was taken into custody again, and committed to prison, and am now standing in the awful situation of one indicted for the commission of a felonious offence, and to answer with my life for the verdict of my country. - Here I may remark, that the man who can be dishonest, generally, as I imagine, resorts to some artifice to conceal it, and makes some attempts to escape punishment. Can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190021"></xptr>it be believed that a man who had stolen a bank note, and of such a value as to be of easy circulation, without exciting any suspicions of the means by which the humblest individual could obtain it, would keep it by him for a month, although the common wants of his family required him to be constantly putting his hand in his needy pocket; that I who had been the last person called upon, and had previous information of the examination of others on the very same charge, should not remove every method of detection, if I had been guilty; that after being discharged I should return to my ordinary pursuits, and even after I had seen a letter on Mr. Stevenson's table, by which, and by his own declaration, I found the enquiry was not relinquished; that after all these warnings I should be so regardless of my personal safety, as to stay and meet the prosecution, rather than to have fled from justice, and have effectually destroyed the evidence that might tend to criminate me, unless I could rest my security upon my innocence!</p>
               <p>I must observe that on Tuesday evening, when I went to Mr. Parkin, the weather was frosty, that it thawed on Wednesday, and so continued on the Thursday; but as I know not whom to suspect of this offence, I shall confine myself to my own vindication, and to remark, that from the appearance of the notes they did not seem to me, when the pieces were produced at Bow-street, to have lain in the public streets, and particularly for so long a time; if I had forgotten my proper duty, and broken through the limits which every principle of common honesty prescribes, I must have had some motive in view, some purpose to gratify, that would have caused a reasonable suspicion of the means by which I lived; my weekly income did not exceed the sum of twenty-five shillings in the whole, and my mode of living kept pace with my circumstances; but notwithstanding I disposed of my income with a hand accustomed from necessity, as well as inclination, to make the most of every thing, I am in debt some few pounds to my baker and my butcher; and if I could reconcile an act of dishonesty to my conscience, I think I could not have been involved in difficulties of that kind - thank God, those persons have been indulgent to me, and though they find me without money, they do not suspect me of being without honesty.</p>
               <p>I have never known the feelings of a man who had offended the laws of his country, nor have I ever concerned myself about the means that such a man would probably take to screen himself from a deserved punishment, till within the walls of a prison, with nothing left to employ my mind but the sufferings of a miserable family, and the trouble of an almost broken heart: - these reflections have occurred to me, and I now present them to the consideration of an impartial judge and jury, into whose hands my fate is entrusted.</p>
               <p>The tears of a father, wife, and six children, call upon me to offer these observations, and although the peace of my mind is for ever destroyed, yet before your verdict shall restore me to my liberty, it is my duty to declare - and I now most solemnly declare, in the presence of Almighty God and my country, that I am not guilty of the offence for which I am indicted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Q.(to Moss) From the inspection of these pieces of paper, are you able to say that they are all a part of the note put together again. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Snell) Do you remember whether you put it into the drawer or give it to any body. - A. I threw it on the counter, it was post paid, and marked with red ink.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Whiston) Do you at all times receive the letters. - A. I do sometimes, and sometimes the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer kept open or shut. - A. The drawer was kept open, there was no covering to it, so that any body might see the letters.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Stevenson or Bird) Did you ever take the money out of the drawer for change. - A.(Mr. Bird) We must do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put change of equal value in it again. - A. We ought so to do, but I suppose sometimes we missed it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

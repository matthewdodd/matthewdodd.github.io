                  </hi>. I live at 31, Great Dover Street, and am manager in the hat department of Messrs. Dunn, the clothier, at Newington Causeway—the prisoner is my wife, and has been for the last fifteen years—I lived with her till a fortnight before this occurrence—I had more than one reason for being dissatisfied with her, and we agreed to separate—I allowed her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—my salary was two guineas—I was afterwards compelled to seek the protection of the Magistrate, and then I allowed her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I told her if she annoyed mo I should have to send her back to prison—she said "The next time I go to prison it will be for your death"—I refused to see her after that, and on 20th January she came to my master's premises—she came first of all at 9.15, but I would not see her then—she came again at 12 o'clock in the day, and I went to the door to see her—I said "What do</p>

I am a cutter at Mr. Dunn's—I know the prosecutor—he has been many years in that employ, and bears a very good character—I remember the prisoner coming on 20th January—her husband went to the door and then ran back, and I saw her throw something over him—the cashier took hold of her, and held her till the police came—she said "I don't care what you do With me if I have injured him, if that has not done for him I shall get something else"—I had some of it on my face, and my clothes were spoilt, and property in the stop was damaged to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—a little after 12 o'clock on 20th January, the prisoner was brought to the hospital—she was burnt very much—about half-an-hour after Richard Grange was brought in—he was burnt very much on the left side of the face, but worse on the scalp—it was done with nitric acid—I was shown a jug in which there was about a tea-spoonful of nitric acid.</p>

The prisoner, whom I had known before, called at my house on the 15th of June, about nine o'clock in the morning to see a lodger. I was then in the back room; a customer had been there a short time before for a pair of shoes, and gave me a sovereign. I had not got change, and asked my sister for change; the sovereign laid on the table when the prisoner came into the room, there were some mackerel on the table which the lodger had brought, and he said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"Bint, you may have some mackerel if you like;" the prisoner went round the table to smell it, and I saw him take up the sovereign with one hand, and the mackerel with the other. I said</p>
               <p>"Bint, you are fond of sovereigns, are you?" he said rather; he then walked round the table to go out. I said leave the sovereign. he said if I would get the mackerel ready at one o'clock he would come and dine; he then went away, and I thought he would return the sovereign at dinner time. I called after him again, when he got into the street to leave the sovereign, he held his hand up but did not speak. I saw him no more till half past six o'clock, when he came to his lodgings, opposite to my house; he was then cleaned, and in company with a young woman; I went and asked him for the sovereign; he said he would give it to me in half an hour; I said that would not do; he said so help him God, he would bring it in half an hour, he was going to the Lion and Lamb. I did not see him again till half-past twelve o'clock at night, when the constable had charge of him. I have never got the sovereign again.</p>

            . I live at Barking, in Essex. I was at Hounslow on a visit to my sister, Mrs. Underwood. I saw her give change for a sovereign, and it laid on the table - the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, came into the room about ten minutes afterwards - I saw him take the sovereign from the table - my sister said he was fond of sovereigns; he said,</p>
               <p>"Rather so." About eleven o'clock he came in, and asked if dinner was ready; he had promised the boy to come and dine. My sister asked him in the evening if he had got the sovereign; and she said he had not given it to her. I was with the person who took him at twelve o'clock at night. I asked him to give me the sovereign, and he said he had given it to my sister - the man who was with me was not an officer - he walked with us as far as Richmond, and then said he would be taken into custody - I enquired for a constable - he then said he would go back to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness met me, and questioned me about the sovereign; I said I would settle it with Mrs. Underwood.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am quite sure he said he had given the sovereign to Mrs. Underwood - he said, upon his soul he had.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of him; he acknowledged that he took it, and changed it at the Cricketers, public-house, at Richmond Green - but said, that when he took it he did not intend to keep it. I had known him before - I believe his master had discharged him that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came backwards and forwards to Mrs. Underwood that day and she never said any thing about the sovereign. I met her sister in the evening, and she said part of it was her's - I said I would go back and settle it. Mrs. Underwood said, before the magistrate, that she did not think I meant to steal it, and asked if I could replace it - I said I thought I could if I wrote to a friend. I was then asked if I had a watch to leave, which I had not.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and keep a shop at No. 9, Marylebone-lane. On the 15th of November the two prisoners brought in four books, and offered them for sale - they said they had been their uncle's, who had died, and left them to their mother - I saw they were four odd volumes, and asked what they had done with the others; they said they were worn out, and they had sold them for waste-paper - I detained the books, and told them to fetch their mother; I went out to tell a Policeman to follow them, but they had got out of sight; they appeared to me to stop and talk with two young men, but I could not be positive - they were taken next day, and I was sent for.</p>

               <p>Corbet's Defence.

               <p>Murphy's Defence. The gentleman asked us how much we wanted, and we told him - he said we must send our mother, and we said would our eldest brother do - he said Yes; we were to meet the young men the next morning at the same place - we went for the books, and were detained.</p>

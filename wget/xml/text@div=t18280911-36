            . I am warehouseman to Messrs. Deacon. On the morning of the 7th of August, the prisoner came to my room, as usual, for the keys of the warehouse - I sleep there; I gave them to him - he went to open the warehouse, and about a quarter or twenty minutes after seven o'clock he came into my room, and wished me to step down, as the officers had stopped him as he was going to sell some old wrappers and cords; I went down: the officers asked if I allowed him to take them; I said No, I knew nothing of it - they produced a bundle of wrappers, which are worth at least, 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he was going to sell them? A. Yes, after he was stopped; we use them to pack bales; goods do not come to us in them - they are outside and inside wrappers: we generally return them, or they are charged to us.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my father. I never gave the prisoner wrappers. About two weeks previous to this he asked me what was to be done with the rubbish of the warehouse, when it required to be swept away; I said, "Have it examined by the warehouseman; and what we cannot use in packing or otherwise, you may have;" he has been three or four months with us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Deacon told me where the other porter used to sell them; I was taking them to the same place - the apprentice was in the warehouse when I took them out.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ALEXANDER FAITHFUL. The apprentice was either in the warehouse or counting-house.</p>

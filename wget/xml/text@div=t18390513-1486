                  </hi>. I am in partnership with John Hammersley, but the instruments were his private property. On the 2nd of March, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the house, and inquired for my partner—I said he was not at home, but I expected him soon—I asked him into one of our surgeries—another person came into the other surgery, and I fetched the instruments to perform an operation—after the other person was gone I asked the prisoner into that room where there was a fire—I was then called out to visit a case—I left the case of instruments on the table with the prisoner, at half-past twelve o'clock—I returned at four o'clock, and found the case of instruments was missing—it has never been found.</p>

I was at Mr. Hammersley's on the 2nd of March—I saw the prisoner in the surgery, about half-past twelve o'clock—I saw the case of instruments there—there were two persons came into the dispensary, and then the prisoner passed through, and said he would call again—I then went into the room, and the case was gone—no other person had been in the room from the time that I saw the instruments there, till I returned again.</p>

               <p>The Prosecutor being a Frenchman, a Gentleman was sworn to interpret betwixt him and the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Joseph Andrews. On the 2d of July, between 9 and 10 Night, I was attack'd near the <placeName id="t17320906-26-crimeloc128">Bason in Marybon-fields</placeName>

I could not understand what they said; but I cry

             my God! O my Dear! Then the other three fell upon me, and the little one beat me on the Head with the Pistol, and they all got about me, and pull'd me on the Ground. They took off my Shoe-buckles, took away my Hat, my Watch, my Pocket Looking-glass, my Handkerchief, 6 s. 6 d. and 2 French Pieces of Silver, one of 24 Sols, and one of 12 Sols, and then were going away; but just as I was getting up, one of them came back and took one of my Knee Buckles, thinking it had been Silver, and then gave me 2 or 3 Knocks on the Face, and so left me, and I went home. After this, one Kirk, a Bailiff, came to my House, and ask'd me if I had not been robb'd at such a time? I said, Yes. And did not you lose a Watch? said he; I told him, Yes. He shewed me a Watch, and ask'd me if that was mine? And I said, Yes; and then he told me, that he fetch'd it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I ask'd the Prosecutor if he knew the Marks of his Watch? And he describ'd it to me, and said the Maker's Name was Lugg, and he shew'd me a Piece of String that match'd with the String of the Watch. Sutton told me of the robbing this Man in Marybon-fields, and by Sutton's Information I found this Watch at the Rose in Stanhope-street, where it was pawn'd for 38 s. which I paid, and took it out.</p>

I and Wils Booth, and the 2 Prisoners robb'd the Prosecutor near the new Bason in Marybon-fields, of a Watch, a pair of Shoe-Buckles, a Knee-Buckle, a Pocket-Glass, a Pocket-Piece, and 3 s. 6 d. in Money; for 3 s. 6 d. was all that I saw. Patrick presented the Pistol, and then knock'd him down with it; and then we all fell upon him, and while he was down, tore off his Knee-Buckle with part of his Garter.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prosecutor swears, not that he left the Knee-Buckle when he was down, and you were all about him, but that you were going away, and then one turn'd back, and took it from him as he was rising.</p>
               <p>Sutton. Booth took the Watch and Glass, and the Pocket-Piece, and I took the Money. That Day as I was taken ( which is 6 Weeks ago) I came from Paddington-Fair with the 2 Prisoners, and parting with them near my Lord Bingly's House, I had not gone far, before I was apprehended by 3 or 4 Men, who carried me to the House of one Brock*, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060014"></xptr> Drury-Lane, and took me up Stairs, and there (before I was examin'd by a Justice)

               <p>Will Booth. We all met at one Buck's, a Gin-shop in St. Giles's, where we use to drink; and from thence we went towards the Bason in Marybon-fields, where we met this French Gentleman. Patrick held a Pistol to his Head, they struggled, and Patrick knock'd him down with the Pistol. I took his Watch, and a Copper Pocket-Piece, and Glass; Sutton took his Handkerchief, Hat, and 3 s. 6 d. and Meeds took his Shoe-buckles, and one Knee-Buckle, and tore the Garter off with it. Then we went over the Fields, and hid the Hat by a Bank; so to the Two Brewers in Holborn, where we had 2 Pots of Beer, and then went to the King's-Arms in Laurence-Lane, where we all lay in one Bed for 1 s. Next Morning Sutton went to the Three Cocks, near Hicks's-Hall, and pawn'd the Hat for 2 s. 6 d. the Buckles in Chick-Lane for 3 s. 6 d. and the Watch by Clare-Market for 38 s. and I sold the Pocket-Piece for 10 d. in Holborn. Then we went to an Alehouse over the Water, kept by Meeds's Mother's Acquaintance; there we eat Bread and Butter and Cucumbers, and drank Bottled-Ale, and shared the Money: We threw away the Handkerchief, and threw the Knee-Buckle over St. George's Church, and the Pocket-Glass over a House in Holborn.</p>

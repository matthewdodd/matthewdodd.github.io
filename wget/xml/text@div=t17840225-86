                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250160"></xptr>Did you see any thing of the prisoner? - Not till I saw him the next morning at the justice's, I went there about ten.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Roberts, a constable.</p>
               <p>Did your brother go with you? - No, he was left with the bag at the White Lyon; I think the prisoner's house is in Church-street St. Giles's, there I found fifteen sacks, and three bags, which are chiefly used for flour; we brought them all to the White Lyon, the prisoner was in the round house; Mr. Morgan came and saw the sacks and bags, and said they were his own property, I was present, they have been in possession of Mr. Morgan, with the constable's seal on them, one of them was half full of pollard, I did not observe the mark on them then, but some of them have Mr. Morgan's name at full length on them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. The prisoner had lived with you four years? - Four years and four months.</p>
               <p>Except as to this business, what was his character, if he had left you and had applied to you for a character, what character would you have given him? - I only can say in a few words, that he was the best servant I ever had in my life, I placed a great deal of confidence in him, he never lost me an hour when in health.</p>
               <p>Might it not happen, that this man, being in the employment of collecting of sacks, might have carried them to his own house, with a view afterwards to have brought them to yours? - Those fourteen sacks had not been in my possession for more than a twelve-month, nor of any of my servants to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Your business is very extensive? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What part of the prisoner's house were they in? - We went through the first room into the parlour, which was their bedroom, they all stood in that room, they were all taken to Mr. Morgan's house full the same night, and emptied; I was not present when they were emptied, I saw them the next morning at the Justice's, there were several of them marked with a customer of Mr. Morgan's name at full length, Mr. Holding, but he only brought them that had his own name on; there were fifteen of them that belonged to Mr. Morgan, some had Holding's name that I observed the night before, Mr. Morgan came to me and desired I would go, I told him he did not need a constable, as a neighbour I went along with him, we secured the first man and put him into the round-house, then I went along with him to his own house, and we had not been in a minute before the prisoner came into the house; when he came in Mr. Morgan gave charge of him to me, and he seemed very much alarmed; I said to him, I dare say you are very sensible what this is for; he made no answer at all, Mr. Morgan then began upraiding him, and said, Joe, I have used you exceedingly well, and I think you ought not to use me in that manner; he immediately fell down on his knees in the shop, I do not know that he said any thing particular with respect to confessing, but</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Before you went to Mr. Morgan's house the other man was in custody? - Yes, that man had confessed.</p>
               <p>We are not trying him now, that man had been apprehended for coming out of the granary with a sack on his back? - He fell on his knees upon being upraided with his ingratitude and ill-usage, but was not charged with any felony, I do not know that that had been mentioned to him.</p>
               <p>Now there had been a man seen coming out of the granary, which granary this man had the key of? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where was you to get the bag? - He asked me to go to Mr. Morgan's granary, and he would give me three pence to carry that bag home, I went to the door about a quarter after eight, I had just left work, and his master's granary looks through into my master's yard.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - I just came out of my master's gate, and he was coming out of my master's door, and he called to me; my master is a coach-wheeler.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you? - He asked me that very night to carry a bag home for him.</p>
               <p>What that very night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was he to give you for this? - One time two-pence, and another time threepence halfpenny for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Did you carry a bag that night? - I had it on my back when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that bag? - The prisoner gave it me on the outside of the door, the bag was full, but I do not know what it contained.</p>
               <p>How many times did you carry bags for the prisoner? - Three times, I think, I carried them to his house and set them down.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord, till this unfortunate affair, I held the prisoner in the highest esteem, and he has a wife that now lays in, that was brought to bed a day or two ago, and has a family besides, I beg leave to recommend him to your lordship's mercy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I have no disposition whatever to be severe upon people, but you must consider we are bound to do our duty for the good of the public; and of all the offences that I have heard tried this sessions, I think this stands in the most flagitious light; a man whom you have shewn such indulgence to, one on whom you reposed such confidence, and whom you would have trusted to any extent, that he should be guilty of such an act of treachery as this, and it would be a very bad example indeed, to let him go unpunished; therefore, though for my own part, I feel as much as any man can do for the miserable condition that prisoners bring themselves into, yet it is necessary that such offenders should not go unpunished.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My Lord it is merely out of humanity to the poor woman, and the situation she is in; I shall leave it to your Lordship.</p>

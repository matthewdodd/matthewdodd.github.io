                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, a meat sales<lb></lb>man, in Newgate Market. Ramby and Wilson were in our employment many years; Ramby was a collector of money, and had also to hang up in the shop—Wilson was scale man; it was his business to weigh the meat and deliver it to the buyer, to stand between the sold and unsold goods—after meat is sold and weighed, it is in his charge—he would not notice the name of the consignor at all—on 23rd March I received a communication from Newbiggin, a butcher, in consequence of which I went that evening to his house in Harford Place, and saw two flanks of beef there; one was part of a consignment from Goocher, of Ipswich, and the other was Scotch, I could not swear to it—Mr. Goocher had consigned beef to us on that very day, and the flanks could not be made right, but I did not count them over—on Friday, 24th April, I missed four quarters of Scotch beef, consigned by Mr. Liddingham, of Huntley, which were received that morning in my presence, between 5 and 7 o'clock—I sold two quarters of beef, about 7 o'clock, to a person named Gregory, and when he came to weigh his quarters, between 7 and 8 o'clock, he could only find one, and we let him take another, to make up the one that was short—Ramby was there, and Wilson also—I went down to Newbiggin next evening, and saw a quarter of beef, one of the same lot—on 6th May I called in Ramby and Wilson; I told Ramby that it was my painful duty to give him into custody, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150092"></xptr>
               <p>Wilson also, though I did it with much pain and sorrow, but there had been so serious a defalcation of meat abstracted, that it was impossible for me to look over it—they said that they knew nothing about it—I said that Pluckrose, who had been the receiver of the meat, was already in custody, and I could not proceed against him without putting them with him; that they had been watched for several weeks, and opportunities had occurred from pressure of business and every one being greatly engaged; that they had <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> meat by the side door, and that it had been Ramby's custom to seek Pluckrose and tell him that something was ready; that he then sent his lad or a porter named Slark, and Wilson or Ramby had delivered the meat to these porters when they came, and received from Pluckrose a portion of the proceeds—they were very much affected, and so was I; perhaps I was more so than they—they begged I would think of their families—I told them I had thought of them while this was going on—I showed them a written list of meat delivered to Pluckrose, in which were two flanks of beef on 23rd March, four quarters on 24th April, and a flank on 1st May—Russell, an officer, was present, and I gave them into custody—Pluckrose has a stall at the other corner of the market; we are south-west, and he is north-east—I have never sold him any meat.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any mark on this meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We know Goochers meat the same as a tailor does his clothes; there is a peculiarity in the cutting of it; we have paid them thousands of pounds—it was conveyed to us in hampers containing 70 stone—I should know that the hampers came from Goocher, the name is painted on them; but I was not there on Monday when the consignment arrived, I was in the cattle market—I only know from my books what it contained, and they are not here, and if they were the entry would not be in my writing—there are two Goochers at Ipswich; they are brothers; but the other never con<lb></lb>signed meat to us; he does to other people—the quantity we receive of a morning is very various, from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; from 100 stone to 2, 000 stone—the flanks come on the hind quarters; we receive about twenty or thirty of a morning—a flank weighs from 16 lbs. to 40 lbs.—on 24th April we missed a fore quarter of Scotch beef, when we made the book up at 10 o'clock, that came from Liddingham; we received fourteen or sixteen fore quarters from him that morning, and I know what we sold—I do not know what my father sold, but the book will show—I sold two quarters to Mr. Gregory; there was a lot tied together, fourteen or sixteen quarters, all from Mr. Liddingham, and he picked two out; they were all Scotch—he had marked them with a skewer, and I told Ramby to come for them in half an hour, and then I could only find one—Ramby was to take them to the usual place, inside the shop—all the meat that is sold is taken in there, as fast as it can be—a large quantity of unsold meat is put there also, and they are very often mixed up together—they take the unsold meat out again to sell it—when Gregory came back we only found one marked quarter, the other was inquired for, and could not be found, and he took another—there have been a good many mistakes occur of that kind, and when the customer cannot get what he originally purchased, he frequently takes something else—Ramby has been in our employment twelve years, and Wilson more than that—it has happened that mistakes occur in delivering meat to a wrong consignee—if we find meat at our house consigned to another person, we send it to him—it happens once in a year that the meat has been all taken out and mixed with the meat of other consignees, as well as with our own—my clerk and myself keep the accounts—if a stranger, a butcher,</p>

               <p>comes to get a quarter of beef he would come to me or my father first to buy it, and not to Ramby, or Wilson—we are always there of a morning—I am there about 6 o'clock, business begins about 5—an hour's business takes place before I get there, but my father is there—the place may be opened at 3 o'clock, but no one would sell meat then—Ramby's special duty is to carry meat into the sold room, and to hang it up on it's arrival—Wilson carries it in to the customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of No. 2, Harford Place, Haggerstone, and have dealt with Pluckrose for meat since last summer. On 23rd March, in consequence of some suspicions I had, I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Mr. Hicks, and he came and saw two flanks of beef at my place, which had been put into my cart that morning—Pluckrose had told me that his boy would put them in—I saw Pluckrose that morning near his stall, in Newgate Market, near the Red Cross public house—I do not think I saw either of the other prisoners there that morning—I left him there, went round the market, and met him again, and he told me that there were two flanks of beef put into my cart by his boy, and that they were coming from Mr. Hicks's—I shortly afterwards went to my cart, and saw the two flanks of beef, which I afterwards showed to Mr. Hicks—I paid the boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Pluckrose told me they weighed 6 stone 6 1/2 lbs.—I paid Pluckrose for them the full market price—I on each occasion paid the ordinary price—I had before that occasionally seen the other men in Pluckrose's company; I have seen them go in and out of the Red Cross public house, and drink with Pluckrose occasionally—I do not remember seeing them that morning, or that day—in the evening Pluckrose called at my shop to see the flanks weighed—that is not the ordinary practice; meat is generally weighed in the market—he did not receive the money till the following Sunday morning—on 24th April I saw Pluck<lb></lb>rose again at his stall in the market, and while I was there I believe Ramby went into the Red Cross public house with Pluckrose; they came out together, I think—Pluckrose told me that he should have something for me that morning, some beef—I saw him again three or four hours afterwards, and he said that he had been down to my cart with a very good fore quarter of beef, which came from Mr. Hicks's, and he had been down to my cart that I should not have to pay a porter for putting it in, and would call in the evening and see it weighed—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a stone for it—I saw him next morning, and told him that it weighed 16 stone 1lb.—he said that Hicks's man told him that it weighed 17 stone 4lbs.—on the following Sunday he came into my shop, and I paid him some money for some meat which I had previously owed him for—that money included the 16 stone—he brought me a bill, which Mr. Russell has, as he took it away again at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150095"></xptr>
               <p>night, having the quarter of beef in it—I made entries of all these transact<lb></lb>tions in my books—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill he first gave me; it does not contain the 16 stone 1lb.—he took it away, and gave me this other on the next morning, including the 16 stone 1lb. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the only difference in them—it is adopting the weight which I had stated—when he took away the first bill he said that his brother had made a mistake, that he had omitted to put in the quarter of beef from Hicks's, and he gave me this next morning, which I afterwards showed to Mr. Hicks and his son—on Friday, 1st May, I was at the market again, and bought a sheep and some other things of Pluckrose—I saw Wilson at the Red Cross—he said nothing to me when he came out—he told Pluckrose that he had left him something to drink; Pluckrose was then at his stall outside—Pluckrose told me he should want to see me again, as there would be a flank or two of beef, but he should want to see Hicks's man first, and that the boy would put it into the cart—I waited some time at the cart—I had been about the market, and I went back to Pluckrose, who was in the tap room at the Red Cross at that time—he gave me a bundle, with a piece of beef tied up in it, a cloth—he had got it in the tap room with him, and the boy put it into the cart for him, and Pluckrose said that he would call in the afternoon and see it weighed, but, instead of coming himself, his brother came—I found in the cloth a flank of beef, weighing 2 stone 4 1/2 bs—I saw Pluckrose at his shop next morning; he asked me the weight, and I told him; he said that it ought to have weighed 4 stone; that the scaleman told him so, and that it came from Goocher, at Ipswich—his brother saw it weighed—there was a "G" on the cloth in black—he told me that the skirt was in it—I said that it was not—he said that the scaleman told him it was—I believe he said that he was to pay for it, I understood him, to Wilson, but it is so long ago I do not recollect—this bill is 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I objected to the price—I showed that meat to young Mr. Hicks, and the cloth also—Pluckrose gave me this bill of the beef (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him again the following Sunday; something was said about his charging too much, and he agreed that I should have it at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a stone—when I had meat of this description it was always carried to to my shop before it was weighed, as far as I know—the other meat that I bought of him was weighed at the scale opposite his stall—on Monday morning, 4th May, I again saw Pluckrose—he said that he should have nothing more to do with any meat from Hicks's, for he had heard that there would be a regular <hi rend="italic">smash</hi> there before long, and he should get into trouble if he was found out—next morning he said that he had stopped just in time, as a friend had told him that there were three policemen in private clothes watching him, and that one of them had been locked up in Mr. Hicks's shop all night watching.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On Friday, 1st May, I saw the boy Hawkes place a piece of meat in Mr. Newbiggin's cart—I looked at it after he had gone, it was a flank of beef and I put a mark on it—on 6th May, I took Ramby into custody at Mr. Hicks's—I took him to the station and he said that he wished to speak to his master—I asked him what he wanted to say; he said that he only wished to ask him to be as lenient as possible—I searched him and found 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I saw Pluckrose at the station, and saw 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him, and this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found at his house, but I was not present—it was given to me at Newgate by Spital, in Pluckrose's presence—Spital has gone abroad—he said that it was Newbiggin's bill, and that this book contained New<lb></lb>biggin's account; it does contain an account.</p>

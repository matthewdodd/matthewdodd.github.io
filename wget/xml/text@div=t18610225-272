About a quarter to 12 o'clock, on the night of Friday, 8th February, I was on duty at the village of Lee—I saw the three prisoners standing at a corner—I am quite certain they are the men—I have seen them before several times, they live in Lee—I had suspicion that something was wrong—I watched them for a short time—I got behind some fence opposite the prosecutor's shop—I stopped there a few minutes, and saw Wells and Wadman go up to the shop, leaving Hearnden at the corner of Boon-street—Wadman and Wells sprung the bar of the shutter—Wadman tookone shutter down and then got on to the board, handed the meat off the hooks, and passed it down to Wells—knowing all three prisoners, I did not make my appearance at the time—they came out shortly afterwards,</p>

               <p>and Wells and Hearnden ran up Boon-street, Wells having the meat under his coat—I went then and called up the prosecutor—I saw the witness Brown there, I called him downstairs—I told him what had happened—I went in quest of the prisoners, and met Wadman coming down Boon-street—I told him I wanted him for breaking into Mr. Hancock's shop—he said, "Very well"—he did not deny it at all—I took him to the station, and then I went up to Hearnden's house, which is in Boon-street—he was in bed—after my standing there a little while he came down—I told him I wanted him for being concernedwith two others in breaking into Mr. Hancock's shop—he said he was very sorry, it was a drunken job—I then went up to Wells' house and knocked at the door—he was two hours before he came downstairs—I then went into the house, and told him what I wanted him for, for being in Mr. Hancock's shop—he said it was a bad job—I went into the back place, and one of the sergeants with me—I found one leg of mutton and a piece of beef.</p>

I went to Ingram, and asked him how he came by them? he said he bought them of my apprentice, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Ingram here?</p>
               <p>Lamb. No, he is not. I went back again to the piece-broker, and got a constable, and took my young man up: we found all these pieces at the broker's; the man delivered them up to me. The prisoner owned before the Justice, that he took the pieces and sold them to Ingram.</p>

In consequence of instruc<lb></lb>tions I received, I watched the prisoner—I knew him as driving a horse, and he usually carted leather for Messrs. Mortimer—they use the yard No. 3, St. Mary Axe—it is the yard of Warren &amp; Co., the prosecutors, who also occupy a portion of the yard—they are in the provision trade—in com<lb></lb>pany with another officer, on the afternoon of 12th September, I saw the prisoner—he was then about twenty yards from Warren's warehouse, going towards Leadenhall Street, driving his horse and van—I followed him to Bermondsey Street—I saw him go under one of the railway arches—he stopped and removed his van; it was apparently empty, except some straw in the front part, and a tarpaulin—he shifted some straw, and I saw him roll a large box from the front of the van to the back—it was covered over with some straw and some matting—he then drove on again as far as Bermondsey New Road—he then went into a public-house—I called him</p>

At 9 o'clock, on the morning of 12th September, I was watching the place, and I saw the prisoner drive a van into the yard—there was then a tarpaulin rolled up in front of the van, and a little loose straw, about an armful, lying spread out on the floor of the van—he left the van there, and went out to a public-house, about 11 o'clock—he went out with two of Warren's workmen to the George public-house, St. Mary Axe—the men went back—he then went on to the Lamb public-house, at Leaden hall Market, and there met Joseph Hawley—he then returned to the yard about 2 o'clock—he remained there till about 2.40; the tarpaulin was then unrolled, and there was a large quantity of straw bulging this through the sides, and the prisoner was sitting on the front rails, driving—I went with Packman, and was with him all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Warren &amp; Co., provision mer<lb></lb>chants—on 12th September I saw the prisoner with a van, in the yard—he backed the van into a recess, at the top of the yard—I saw him go to the side of the van and put some straw there—shortly after that I saw one of Messrs. Warren's men come out from the loop-hole, the place where they load and unload vans; that was some twenty yards from the van—he was carrying a large cheese-box, exactly resembling this—he took it into the recess, on the other side of the van—the prisoner was not there then; he came there after him, almost instantaneously—I then saw the man come back with an empty box, quite different to that I had seen him carrying—I spoke to Mr. Bodle, the manager—I examined the stock afterwards—the boxes and packages were similar to those we have in stock.</p>

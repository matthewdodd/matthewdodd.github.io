On Monday, 5th Sept., 1853, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Cannon-street West—I heard a crackling noise inside the premises of the defendant, No. 21—the door was fastened—there was no one residing on the premises—policeman Russell came up, and called out, "Fire!"—I remained at the door while he went for the fire engines and the turncock—the engines arrived in about five minutes—the fire brigade is almost close to those premises—when the firemen arrived they broke the door open—I went in with them, and observed several large boxes of lucifer matches on fire, and part of the par<lb></lb>tition—there were about fifteen boxes—they were about four feet long and two feet high—we took them out of the house after we had worked upon them with the engine—a great many of the neighbours came out—the fire continued burning two or three hours—the engines were playing upon it during the time—besides those boxes that I observed when I went in, there were a great many smaller boxes—they were taken away in two or three vans, which were partly filled—I should think there were about two van loads—I was on the same premises on 29th July—I then observed several large packages of lucifer matches—some of them were open—I had been on those premises three or four months before the fire in Sept—I then saw nearly twenty of those large packages—they contained lucifer matches—some were open, some were closed—I recollect attending the inquest held before Mr. Payne on 9th Sept., 1853—MR. Bell was examined before Mr. Payne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firemen at the Watling-street station—I recollect the fire on the defendant's premises on Monday morning, 5th Sept, 1853—I was called out about half past 1 o'clock—I was there with the first engine—I found the fire issuing up at the back part of the premises—it was what we term a small fire—I saw the flames issuing out of the back premises, going up from the skylight, which is over the ground floor, at the back of the premises, over the back warehouse—I broke open the front door, and discovered the lower part of the premises all on fire—I worked the engine upon it—it was at work, on and off, for I suppose about an hour—I observed the partition between the shop and the staircase; it was nearly burnt through—I should think the adjoining houses were not in any immediate danger—I saw some packing cases, as I term them; they contained lucifers—I cannot at all account for the cause of the fire—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180096"></xptr>
               <p>was nobody in tire house at the time that I am aware of—I saw nobody come down stairs—there were about twenty of our own men there to extinguish the fire—I observed the lucifer matches; part of them were burnt—there was a very disagreeable smell, I should say of phosphorus—there were a great many of these things burnt—I do not think any of the boxes were closed—the lids were burnt off—I should think the boxes were about there feet square—they were not four feet long—besides the lucifers in the boxes there was a great quantity on shelves; some in tin cases, and some in wooden boxes—a great portion of them were on fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you get more when there is a large fire than when there is a small one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a farthing—the boxes that I saw were all full—I did not see any that were empty—I did not look into them, I had no occasion—we carried them into the street—I cannot tell whether there were any cases which did not contain lucifers—the adjoining houses were not more in danger than they would have been in an ordinary fire—I cannot tell about the number of the boxes—I would not swear there were fourteen or fifteen, or that there were two van loads—I dare say there were two van loads of rubbish, and boxes, and all—there was a great quantity of ceiling and stuff fell down—I could not say what the origin of the fire was; I first saw it through the skylight in the yard, and that covered the continuation of the ground premises—I did not see anything like candles there, or anything that had the appearance of having been lighted—the premises are lighted with gas—the place is about forty feet long, and from fourteen to eighteen feet wide—a portion of the boxes were under the skylight; that part is very small—the shop is larger than the warehouse; the shop is three or four times as big as the warehouse.</p>

I am retired from business, and live at Holloway—I have premises next door but one to Mr. Bell, in Cannon-street, West—I occasionally sleep there—I slept there on Sunday night, 4th Sept, 1853—I had known Mr. Bell for years as the keeper of No. 21, I knew the nature of the stock he kept on those premises—I did not like it much—on Monday morning 5th Sept., I was alarmed about half past 1 o'clock—the flames were issuing out to a very great height, and the smell was suffocating—I was considerably alarmed, I considered the premises all around to be in very great danger—there was a speedy alarm, and assistance as speedily as pos<lb></lb>sible—but for that, the whole neighbourhood must have been destroyed—I opened the window, called the police, and desired them to go round to Mr. Braidwood, and to bring all his force immediately in consequence of the danger I thought the neighbourhood was in—I got up, went down, and went out—I should think it was about an hour before they got the fire under—I saw Mr. Bell in the course of the morning—I saw a great many things that had been brought out, and thrown in the street, such as boxes, partly broken, and partly burnt—there were a great many lucifers on fire in the street, and the engines were playing on them—there was a strong smell for some days—I had some conversation with Mr. Bell some time on</p>

               <p>the Monday—he told me that he considered that the nature of the business was of so dangerous a character, that he declined to let the upper part of his premises, or to let any one reside there—he stated that the business was of an unprofitable character, and it was his intention to give it up after what had occurred—I consider it was a dangerous stock to be kept there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. I have the remains of lucifer matches which I obtained from Mr. Bell; I got them on 13th April last—they are made of slips of wood, the composition on them is chlorate of potash; blue and colouring matter which is a preparation of iron—they are very combustible—I have made experiments as to under what circumstances they will ignite—the tempera<lb></lb>ture at which they will take fire varies from 140 degree to 200 degree, according to the condition of the atmosphere—the temperature of 140 degree is one that may exist, or may be produced in a shop window exposed to the sun enclosed in glass, so that lucifer matches may take fire when exposed in that manner to the summer sun—I found also that they were fired by very slight friction—some of Mr. Bell's matches have fired in my house from falling from the chimneypiece though I did not see them—the maid has told me so, and brought the box to me—I can also state that some of Mr. Bell's matches were standing on my laboratory table, and I was making some experiments with the pestle and mortar merely shaking the table, and they went off</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180099"></xptr>
               <p>spontaneously, and set fire to the paper and everything about them—I be<lb></lb>lieve from this that the falling of a box from the chimneypiece might fire them—supposing there were a place where there were a great number of these, the rats running about and throwing down the boxes, might fire them—the phosphorus exists in the matches in the state of a powder, and if any of the powder remains on the surface uncombined with the other materials, it may take fire spontaneously at an ordinary temperature without any friction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If these matches had been kept for some time perfectly dry, would the phosphorus become powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly tell, but if it has not been carefully prepared it will do so—in my judgment it is dangerous to the house and the neighbourhood to have large quantities of these things kept.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness here poured some liquid phosphorus on a sheet of paper, and when it was dry it took fire and burned.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say if there were dry powder on the match it might ignite, but if there were none it would not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is phosphorus, and oxide of iron, and chlorate of potash in these—oxide of iron is known under many names—a man might purchase it and not know it—I cannot tell what other matters are in this preparation—I only sought for those things which I know to be mischievous—there is nothing that can be introduced into these lucifer matches, in my judgment, that will reduce the disposition to ignite—I have seen matches made in most of the large factories—I never attended Mr. Bell's—I have had to attend to the diseases of many persons employed in match factories—I do not know how Mr. Bell makes them, but I think there is no great secret in it—it is my opinion that these matches have no controlling matter in them to prevent the ignition—they will ignite at 140 degree—if they were in these boxes, enclosed in another box in a window, and there were a thermometer of 140 degree, they might ignite—I have only known by report of matches igniting in a shop—I have known a heat of 140 degree in a shop, and I have had it on my own premises, in my glass case outside my drawing room window, which, I believe, is in a southern attitude—140 degree is not an immense state of heat—the temperature in this Court now is, I suppose, about 89 degree—I know that the Germans make those matches also, but the Germans have no chlorate of potash in them; they use nitre instead, and, as a rule, they require a higher temperature than others do—they are what are called silent matches—the defendants shop was shut up, and it was in the night—there could be no 140 degree then.</p>

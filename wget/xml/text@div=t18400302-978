                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Plumstead-common. On Saturday, the 15th of February, I was at Mr. Davis's shop, and saw the prisoner there with another man—I saw the prisoner take a smock-frock off a pile on the counter, fold it up, put it under the frock he had on, and go out with the other—I told Mr. Davis, and went with him after them to the Shakspeare public-house—MR. Davis fetched a policeman, and went in after them—I waited at the door—I did not lose sight of the prisoner all the way from Mr. Davis's to the Shakspeare public-house, which is about a hundred yards—I did not know what became of the other man—I did not see him at the public-house.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Bird's premises, and I asked him what he had got - he said a pair of boots and shoes, and a bag, which he said had been dropped by a cart which had just passed, and which I knew to be a butcher's cart - he was coming from Bird's house, near the out-house door, some distance from the road.</p>

               <p>"I have found a bag with something in it, which I suppose dropped from the carriage - I am going after it; but they don't belong to me, if they belong to you take them." I was returning from Portsmouth, and saw them on the road - I took them up, and thought they belonged to the chaise-cart.</p>

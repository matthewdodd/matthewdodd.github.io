                  </hi>. I am a biscuit-maker, of 88, Wheeler-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields—on 3d November, at half-past 8, I saw my premises secured, and went to bed—about 3 o'clock, or a quarter-past, I heard a noise at the shutters, but did not pay attention to it, being a market street—a constable soon came, and I got out of bed to answer him—I then saw that the shatters had been opened, and the window raised—I missed these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my property, and were safe on the table when I went to bed—I had fastened the shutters the night before; but the bolt does not go far into the socket, so I have a string to it, and fasten it to the window.</p>

About 3 o'clock on the morning of 4th November, I saw the prisoner go, with a female, from 88, Wheeler-street, where the prosecutor lives—I examined the shutters, and found them broken, and the window open—I awoke the prosecutor, who said that it was all right; but he afterwards missed these things—I then went to the prisoner's room, 9, Fleur-de-lis-street, Spitalfields, and found him there, and the things in the room—it was then 4 o'clock.</p>

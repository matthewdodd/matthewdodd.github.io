            , it was about half after eleven on the night of the 19th of November, we have a half door before the street door, a hatch that was shut, I am positive it was shut, and the door on this side the hatch was shut, and locked; and suddenly as we were sitting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190099"></xptr> by the fire, I observed both the doors, with a great rush come against the wall of the passage, the street door is about eight yards from the place where I was sitting, I had an opportunity of seeing the door burst open, I jumped up immediately, and the prisoner was at the kitchen door in the house, and I seized him by the collar, I discovered the prisoner immediately after the door was broke open, I said to him, you villain, are you come to rob me, what brought you into my house, and my gown being long my lodger could not get out behind me to take them, because the place is but narrow, the other men were outside of the door coming to rush in upon me, my lodger went out into the street, as I thought to take some more of them, but he returned, and the prisoner was trying to get from me, and he forced the prisoner into the kitchen, and called watch, and he was taken into custody, I keep lodgers, seafaring men, I had two at that time, but they were both in bed.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - All the knowledge I had of him, was by his passing the door, we have two bad houses near.</p>
               <p>Jury. Please to put that question very close to the prosecutrix, whether she does not know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, prisoner's counsel. I was going to ask that question? - I have seen him pass before in bad company, but I never said a word to him.</p>
               <p>I believe at this time you was in high conversation with several of your lodgers? - We were in conversation.</p>
               <p>Were not you speaking rather loud? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Could not any body going by hear you? No, Sir, they could not.</p>
               <p>The lights were not out? - No, Sir, thank God.</p>
               <p>You have seen this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what he is? - I do not look upon him to be good.</p>
               <p>That is no answer, do you know what he is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Has not he frequently played a tune to you? - Never in his life.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this man is frequently playing opposite to you on the clarinet? - Yes, but that is not to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know that this man plays upon a musical instrument, near your house? - He never played to me, I have seen him playing in the open street.</p>
               <p>As you knew him as playing about, are not you convinced by his being in your neighbourhood, that he knew you too? - Yes, he knew me to be a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Was not he very well acquainted with your person? - No, Sir, he was not, why should I make him acquainted with my person.</p>
               <p>I did not ask you as to any improper acquaintance; did not he know you in the street, when he met you? - I am a person that have lived near twenty years in that parish, and have always lived in credit.</p>
               <p>Do you think that he has had an opportunity of seeing you often in the street, as well as you saw him? - Yes, Sir, I say so.</p>
               <p>At the time this matter happened, did not a great many of your neighbours tell you who he was, that he was there upon a frolick? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Has not this gentleman told you so? - Upon my oath no such thing, not Mr. Dick, never opened his mouth upon the subject.</p>
               <p>He did not make any demand of your money at that time? - No.</p>

               <p>You do know? - I know there is a bit of a quarrel between Mr. Dick and my mistress, but not the prisoner; I have seen the prisoner very often, he is constantly in the neighbourhood, playing in the street, or in that gentleman's house, or at the Crown, we were all talking together; our light was not out, we never burnt but one candle.</p>

            . The Prisoner came to my Master's Shop, on the 18th of October, about nine at Night, and ask'd for two Pounds of Tea for Mr. Jones, of Stepney; we refused to send it by him without the Money; so I was to go with him for it; and as we were going along a Field, he on a sudden tripp'd up my Heels, fell on me with his Knees, and put a Knife to my Throat, and bid me deliver. He took from me 16 d. a pair of silver Shoe Buckles, a pair of white Metal Knee Buckles, my Stock, and a silver Clasp. The two Pounds of Tea he took from under my Arm when I fell; I had it under my Arm, and in the Force of the Fall it flew from me. About a Fortnight after this, I saw the Prisoner in St. Giles's Round-House , and knew him to be the Man who had robb'd me, and he said, D - n it, it does not signify denying it, for I did do it.</p>

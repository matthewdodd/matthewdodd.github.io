             sworn. - I am a lighterman: On the 23d of last February, a little past two o'clock in the morning, I was going with that barge to Wandsworth; it was Mr. Eddington's barge, and contained Mr. Yerraway's coals; I know they were Mr. Yerraway's property, because I have the sale note in my pocket; I was going to take them to Wandsworth for Mr. Yerraway's own use; when I got to the parapet of the bridge, I distinctly saw three persons getting coals out of a craft into a boat lying along-side; it was the Henry barge, lying sixty yards from the parapet of the bridge; I got into a skiff that was lying close to the stairs, and rowed under the light craft till I was close to the prisoner at the bar; I saw a boy handing a basket of coals into the boat, which was placed upon the boat's well; it was a fishingboat; then the boy jumped in also; I never saw the prisoner in the barge at all, he was receiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280067"></xptr>the coals from the boy; we all drove away together, and, being full tide, we both came athwart the bridge; he then dropped upon his knees, and begged for mercy, saying, he had a wife and a large family; he told me his name and plate of abode, and said, for God's sake, have mercy on my wife and children; I told him to go away; he said, I will be d - d if I do, for you will bone me; we drove together as far as the patent shot manufactory; it was moon-light; I saw his face as plain as I see it now; I let him go, and he was taken by an officer; I knew him again immediately; I took one basket of coals that was upon the well of the boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are a lighterman employed by Mr. Eddington? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The coals had not been delivered at that time to Mr. Yerraway? - A. I was present when Mr. Yerraway bought them of Mr. Eddington.</p>

               <p>Q. You were threescore yards from the barge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The parapet was considerably below the lamps? - A. We did not want lamps, there was a moon.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that you observed his face at that distance? - A. No; I would not have sworn to him if I had not been near him; I was close to him for a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner said his name was

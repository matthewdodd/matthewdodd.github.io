               <p>Q. I want you now to confine your attention to the carpetting and canvas. - I see them and examined them at the police office, Hatton-garden, on the 9th or 10th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at the police office? - I found Mr. Good, the prisoner. Some things were produced, I examined them all over, and I really believe them to be the property of Mr. Leader.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where they were taken from? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these things present? - They are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are foreman to Mr. Leader. Can you say that he has lost carpetting or canvas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of that pattern? - Yes, I can say that, but I cannot swear to the articles for want of the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago do you think these things have been lost? - Some of them between two and three years ago.</p>

            As to this carpetting and this canvas, when do you apprehend that may be lost, if it was ever lost at all? - We cannot say to the time when it was lost, because we have a great deal in at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say when this was lost at all? - I cannot notice it particularly, we have such a quantity, and such a number of hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Till this was found you did not even miss these things? - No, we have frequently missed things, but never that in particular.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you tell us what past at your house that you was privy to? When did you commence partner with Mr. Leader? - The 2d of November 1793; the robbery was committed in September.</p>

               <p>Q. The carpet and canvas was stole before the time you was in the partnership? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you first to suspect the prisoner? - From missing sundry articles we believed the prisoner not to be honest, and going to search his premises we found some property in his house; we suspected the prisoner about three days before we searched his house.</p>

               <p>Q. What led you to the pawnbroker's? - Some duplicates which were taken out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course the things were produced and carried to the office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the carpetting that you produced at Hatton-garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you it from? - I took it in of the prisoner, he pawned it with me, I knew him, I had it of him on the 20th of July 1793; this is the duplicate I wrote for the carpet at the time I took it in. When they came to enquire, they produced the fellow duplicate of that, which I gave to the prisoner; I have had the things in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was the 20th of July, last year? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards are there in that piece of carpetting? - Better than four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long he had it by him you don't know? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Lucas. This is a pattern which we use a great deal of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of carpetting of which you missed any? - We missed a great deal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At that particular time did you miss it? - I cannot say, having such great quantities.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that ever was in Mr. Leader's possession? - I, don't know that positively; we cut a great deal of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen it in my house, you would not have suspected it to have been Mr. Leader's at all? - I don't know any thing about that. Of course you being a gentleman, I should suppose that you came by it honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark on it? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know, it might be lost in the year 1791, if it ever was in Mr. Leader's possession? - I don't think we used that pattern so long as that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Northcott, a colonial-broker, in Rood-lane. He was in the habit of advertising in the <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Chronicle</hi>, and owed money for advertisements—on the 4th of Oct. the prisoner called at the office, and said he came from the office of the <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Chronicle</hi> for the quarter's advertisements then due—Mr. Northcott was present, and re<lb></lb>ferred to me to know if I had the account—I had none, and he requested the prisoner to call again on Monday the 6th, which he did—I said I had not got the account, and Mr. Northcott objected to pay him—he pressed it very earnestly, and Mr. Northcott desired him to make out an account, which he did, for thirteen advertisements—this now produced is it—Mr. Northcott gave him a check for the amount, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which has been returned by the bankers as paid—the prisoner wrote on the account in my presence, "Received, William Underwood, 6th Oct., 1845"—I was afterwards applied to by the <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Chronicle</hi> for the proper account—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was in custody.</p>

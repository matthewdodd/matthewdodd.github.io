                  </hi>. I am a sadler, of Baker-street, Enfield. On 27th June, between nine and ten at night, I and some others left Waltham Abbey in a chaise, we took the prisoner up on the road—I had three sovereigns, half-a-crown, and some pence in my right trowsers pocket—I afterwards paid for half-and-half, and got a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in change—I gave the prisoner sixpence on the road—I and the prisoner left the chaise about a mile from Waltham<lb></lb>cross, and went down a lane; my money was safe then—I was with her ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I missed my money, and charged her with it—she denied it, and after some resistance put her hand in her pocket, and took out a sovereign, a half-crown, and some halfpence, and was going to throw them away—I caught her hand—she said, "You b—r, here is all I have got of it"—I collared her again, and she drew some more money out of her pocket—I put my hand in, and got the rest and the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I had given her no money but the sixpence.</p>

I was with Bur<lb></lb>ridge—he was quite sober—I had paid him three sovereigns and three shillings before we got to Waltham Abbey—we met with the prisoner, and took her into our chaise—the prosecutor and her got out about eleven o'clock, and I saw no more of them.</p>

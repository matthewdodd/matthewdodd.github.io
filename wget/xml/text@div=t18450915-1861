                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Thomas Coxhead—we live in Queen-street, Golden-square. The prisoner was in my employ for about nine weeks—I have seen this table-cloth, two purses, and two pocket-books—they are mine—I had left these things with other linen in care of the prisoner, when I left town on the 17th of Aug.—I was sent for by the Magistrate on the 3rd of Sept.</p>

               <p>prisoner was in the room where I was, and she left the room for about a moment, while Mr. Coxhead gave me a description of the robbery—a foreign gentleman went then into the room where the prisoner had been, to fetch the coffee-pot—he tried to pour out the coffee, and found he could not—he opened it, and found some papers in it—he called my attention to it, and I found they were duplicates—I asked the prisoner if she had put them in—she said yes, she had, they were not hers, and she wished to be rid of them.</p>

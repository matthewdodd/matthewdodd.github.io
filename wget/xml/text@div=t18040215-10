               <p>Q. Do you remember losing some watches? - A. Yes, about a quarter before six on the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at that time? - A. I was in my house drinking tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop? - A. No, I was in the first floor, the shop is below; I heard a window break; I cried, stop thief! and ran down stairs through the passage into the street, and observed a pane of glass broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was that pane of glass broke in? - A. The shop-window; it rained exceeding hard; I missed several watches from off the rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the rods near the window? - A. The rods are close to the panes of glass in the shop-window; I looked on the pavement to see whether I could discover any of the watches missing; I discovered this (shews the watch) on the foot-path, near Suffolk-street; I put it in my pocket, and continued at the window to secure it; I ordered the boy to put the shutter up; Walter ran after the prisoner; he returned in about three minutes, and brought the prisoner at the bar in the custody of two men; he came back with them; I asked the prisoner for the other watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first question you asked him? - A. No, the first question I asked him was, what was his name, and his family, as he appeared in a midshipman's dress; he would not tell me his name; one of the men told me he had thrown some thing away that jingled on the ground; then I asked him for the other watches, but he would make no answer. On taking off his glove from his hand I found it bloody; this is the glove (shews a glove); I found nothing on him but duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the right hand or the left? - A. The right hand glove was cut through and bloody, and his hand was cut and bleeding. A gentleman came in, and said, he was a captain of a man of war, he wished to converse with him; the gentleman wished to get his name; he said his name was Scott, that he came from Greenwich; I am not sure whether he said James or Thomas; he was taken then from thence to Bow-street before Sir

I went out into the yard between eight and ten in the evening, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130021"></xptr>heard a monstrous beating, which appeared to me to be in Mr. Pritchard's room; I staid, and continued some time listening, about a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts; and I heard Mrs. Pritchard's voice, crying out, O dear! O dear! I know I deserve it, several times; I heard him say something, and am certain it was the prisoner's voice, but do not recollect what he said; I was out in the yard also on the Friday night, and heard him quarrelling with her; it might be six or seven o'clock; I did not see him, but I heard him, and I did suppose that it was in the shop; I went round into the yard and I saw Mrs. Pritchard lay at the bottom of the stairs; the prisoner was behind her; she lay with her head up the stairs, and seemed very near spent; I saw her gasp a little; on which some assistance came, and I went away.</p>

               <p>You did not judge it any thing uncommon to hear a quarrel between the prisoner and his wife? - I had heard them several times before.</p>

             called me into the yard, and told me Pritchard was beating his wife; and I went into an apartment, a two pair of stairs room, and looked out of window, and heard Mrs. Pritchard say, I know I deserve my beating, pray have mercy upon me, and do not beat me so; I went out of that room into the shuffle-board room, which window was nigher to the prisoner's apartment, and there I heard her say so several times, and heard the beating, and heard the prisoner swear very much.</p>
               <p>How long might this continue? - I cannot positively say; I thought it was near half an hour; it ceased for some time in the course of the half hour, and then it began again.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might there pass between the beating ceasing and its beginning again? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was it a few minutes? - It is impossible to say.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said between the beatings that you could distinguish? - I heard the word child mentioned once.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These unfortunate people had a child? - Yes. At last her voice grew so faint I could not distinguish what she said; on the ceasing of the beating I saw the prisoner come down into the one pair of stairs room, and stand at the window with the candle in his hand; this was between nine and ten at night; and the upper room was left dark.</p>
               <p>What more past? - I do not know, I declare, I was so frightened; I went down to the bar, and waited a bit, and looked out, and saw no light, and they were quiet, so I thought all was over. I never saw her past Thursday morning: I know nothing of Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In answer to what he said, you heard the woman say she deserved it? - I did.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner. On Thursday night, between nine and ten, I heard a noise, as though it was a person beating another with a stick; I stopped and listened a bit, and heard the sound as though it came from Mr. Pritchard's back window; I opened my window, and called out Mr. Pritchard several times, but nobody answered me; this was from my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130022"></xptr>back window, up one pair of stairs; I shut my window and went up two pair of stairs, and called out Mr. Pritchard again; and I heard Mr. Pritchard say, do not you deserve it? I heard no more that night. On Friday evening, about seven o'clock, I heard Mr. Pritchard swearing at his wife; they were then down stairs on the floor where they shoe the horses, damning and swearing that he could not help her up; I opened my back window, and called out, Mr. Pritchard, what are you doing to your wife? he answered me, that she was in liquor, and asked me if I would come round; I went round to his house, and saw Mrs. Pritchard lay all along on the bottom of the ground where they shoe their horses; I did not see her face till they began to move her: when I first came in he was trying to lift her up; when I saw her face, I said, Mr. Pritchard, if she has been a drinking, it is not that that has made her so, she is a dying; he told me, that she might die and be damned; I told him that was a very sad situation; that she was not to lie there in that manner, that she was to be taken, or something to be done with her, up stairs; after that some other people came in, and he brought down a pillow; she had an handkerchief about her head, which was stuffed with hard dry blood; the pillow likewise was stained with dry blood. I came away and saw no more.</p>
               <p>You told us that you expressed yourself to the prisoner, that she was a dying; did she appear to be in that state at that time? - She appeared in that state; as though she was well nigh dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never went into the house on Thursday evening? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor did you hear the answer that the wife made when he told her she deserved it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>It was on his request you came into his house; the prisoner calling you? - It was on his calling me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, else you would not have gone in? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner never went away from his house? - He did not.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger to Mrs. Axtell. On Friday evening I heard the prisoner swear very much at his wife, about eight o'clock, damning her eyes that she was drunk; I went into the house, I saw the deceased lying on the bottom of the stairs, on the ground, and her husband over her with a candle; and when I saw her I thought she was dead; I called Mr. Bush and the neighbours in, and I went away, and came back again in less than a quarter of an hour; Mr. Purcell, the surgeon, was there then; he was there at the time she spoke; when I came the second time she was carried up stairs, and on her bed, and the prisoner there too.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did she die? - It did not exceed half an hour from that time.</p>
               <p>At the time that the conversation passed between her and Mr. Purcell had any observations been made on the state of her bruises? - All her side was of one blackness, up to her arm pits, one of her fingers broke, the back of her hand bruised, a cut over her eye, on her head, and her eye black: Mr. Purcell asked her who made her in that manner? she said, her husband; he asked her who gave her that cut in her head? she said, her husband.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner at the bar to the bed, at the time this conversation passed? - Standing over the bed with a candle, assisting the doctor while he bled her arm.</p>
               <p>Could he hear the questions and answers? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Did he make any answer or observations on it? - He went and sat down in a chair, and I cannot tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Yes; I told him, if he did not run away he would be hanged; he said, if he was, he would not run away.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him about the condition his wife was in? - I believe I did; but I cannot recollect it, I was in such a fright; he went out of the room, and I did not know what became of him, and I continued with the poor woman till she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130023"></xptr>died, and that was within fifteen minutes after she spoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The time you saw the prisoner assisting at the bed, he was holding a candle, seemingly assisting the surgeon as much as he could? - Yes; he was.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon and apothecary: I am an assistant to Mr. Thistle on Snow-hill. On Friday evening, the 18th of March, I was called upon to assist this poor woman; I saw her lying on the bed in a languid state, apparently dying: when I first went into the room, and seeing her in that situation, I administered something to her, and she seemed to come to herself very much; on which I thought bleeding might be of some service to her; I turned up her gown, and perceived a little blood on the shift sleeve; on that I turned to the prisoner, and asked him what was the cause of that? he said, in a whisper, that she had her courses on her a day or two before; the words he used was, that she had got her months; I ordered all the men in the room out, and had her stripped, and found all her side and her arm very much contused and black, and lifting up her petticoats I perceived her thigh to be in the same situation, very black, and also her arm, and all round entirely from her breast round to her back all the way the same; I did not observe the condition her belly was in till the next day; one of the women said, she had received a wound on her head, that led me to take off her head clothes and examine, on which I observed a contuse wound on the side of the head, the back part: I will not take upon me to say whether it was done by a blow with a blunt instrument, or by a fall.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long did you suppose that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179104130024"></xptr>bruise might have been given? - Not that evening.</p>
               <p>I observed the scull; the scull laid perfectly bare about a quarter of an inch, the inner membrane that covers it being divided.</p>
               <p>You put some questions to the woman? - I did.</p>
               <p>At the time you put these questions was the prisoner at the bar in a condition to hear? - He was, certainly.</p>
               <p>At the time you put these questions did it appear to you the woman was in a dying state? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to be sensible at the time? - As much as a dying person possibly could be so; I saw no symptoms of derangement.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - I knelt down by her bed side, and said, in the name of God, my good woman, if it is possible for you to speak, tell me who it was that bruised you in this manner? she said, my husband; I asked her again, who gave her the wound on the head? she said, my husband: on that the prisoner at the bar got off from the bed, and went towards the fire, and sat down, and said, he wished she had been dead seven years ago; I gave her some more stuff, and each time I gave her the stuff the husband procured me the water; I shortly after went, and when I was going I said, my good man, do not be under any apprehension, she will do very well; I told him so because I was afraid, after the confession of the woman, that he would make off; but I told the women she would not live above ten minutes. The next day on taking off the cap of the brain I found a small quantity of extravasated blood lodged in the brain; externally there was a very slight fracture; internally there was no fracture, but a rupture of one of the blood vessels by a fall, and this rupture was just immediately under the part where the membrane had been divided; I also then observed that the bottom of her belly was very black, by a lodgement of blood; the middle finger of her hand likewise broke, and her hand very much bruised.</p>

               <p>I would ask you, though that cannot be necessary, could all this complication of bruises be occasioned by a fall? - No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell, by your judgment what occasioned the death of this woman? - I believe the blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. From the appearance you was not capable of saying whether that fracture on the head arose from a blow or a fall? - I could not, only as she told me.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, in King-street, Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body of the deceased after her death? - I did; and I found a wound on her head, and under the wound was a fracture in the bone of the scull, and very much contused; after I had raised the scull I found the membranes quite broke, and I saw some extravasated blood, which proceeded from a rupture of some of the vessels; I desired the gentleman to open the body and on the side there was many bruises and much extravasated blood.</p>
               <p>What occasioned the death of this woman? - No doubt from the external violence of these bruises, the situation of her body, without the fracture on her scull, must have so affected the internal parts, particularly the thigh and groin, that I should judge she could not survive; but more particularly by the fracture on the scull.</p>

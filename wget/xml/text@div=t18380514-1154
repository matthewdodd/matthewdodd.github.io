On the 2nd of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs—I showed some to her, and found her pulling one off the counter—I asked her for it—she said there was not any fallen down—I said there was—she then gave me one off the floor—I showed her several others, and then I saw her take this piece of black silk handkerchiefs, and put it under her shawl or dress—she then looked at some more, and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one, and said she would call for it next morning—I went to pay the sixpence at the desk, and told Mr. Manning, and one of the young men went out and brought her back—I searched her with assistance, and after we undressed her, on her stepping out of her clothes, we found these black silk handkerchiefs lying by her feet—she said, "For God's sake, don't tell Mr. Manning"—she was given into custody.</p>

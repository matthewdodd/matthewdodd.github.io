            . On the 29th of October my master sent me out to watch; some people had been breaking his fence. I was armed with a musket and a bayonet; I heard some people breaking his fence about eleven o'clock; I pursued them, and overtook them; I saw two men at the near the end of the field; I saw Remington with some fence under his arm; he was one, and

             was the other; Remington had the fence under his arm; I charged him with having part of the fence; he threw it over into another man's garden, then he came up to me; Barnfield seized my musket; he got it at one snatch; I have never seen it since. I saw Barnfield the next morning at Bromley; I asked after my musket; he said he fancied I was in a dream; he went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people by at the time he took the piece from you - A. No; I did not follow him. On the Wednesday following I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Barnfield got the musket from you, had you threatened him at all - A. No; I charged Remington with having part of my master's fence, that is all I said.</p>

            . I went after the two prisoners on Wednesday; I found them in the outward bound East India Dock. Pittman pointed out the two prisoners to me; they did not offer to run away. I told the prisoners the charge as we went along; they said they knew nothing of it.</p>

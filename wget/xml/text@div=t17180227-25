             on the 21st of December, Ann Mabe complained of being Ill, and kept some time above in her Room; upon which she went up to enquire of her how she did, and that she answered her she had the Tooth-Ach, and that going another time she said she was something better, and soon after came down, took a Pan of Coals, went up, warmed her Bed and went to bed; but that she suspecting for three Months before that she was with Child, did observe that she was fallen in her Bulk, and going to her the next Morning taxed her with having a Child , asking her where it was: But the Prisoner deny'd that she had had a Child, or was with Child; but she pressing her very hard she at last own'd that she had Miscarried , and show'd her something which she said was the Abortion, but she being not satisfy'd Ann Mabe got up and took the Opportunity to go away; upon which she acquainted Sir George with her Suspicion.

             depos'd, That Sir George gave him Orders to search the Vaults, and that in one of them he found the Child. Mrs. Lucas declar'd. That Sir George sent for her to view the Child, and she gave her Opinion that it was at its full Time, and did believe it might have been alive had due Care been taken of it, tho' she did not perceive any Violence had been offer'd to it; that one of the Cheeks was indeed a little pushed; that the Tongue lay between its Gums exerted to the exterior part of the Lips, and the Hands clenched. The Evidence deposed, That Sir

             sent after her and got her apprehended, and that she then confessed that Sir George's former Coachman had gotten her with Child and afterwards went away; that she sent several Letters to him to come to her, but he came not near her, and that she going to the Vault the Child dropped from her. Upon her Tryal she pleaded the same, and that she had been very much frightened about a Fortnight before by a Quarrel that had happen'd between two of Sir George's Servants, and that was the Occasion of her being so Delivered ; and that she never heard the Child cry, nor could tell that it was alive. It was the Opinion of the Midwise and Court, That a Child that is new born, if alive, came into the World with its Hands expanded; but, if dead, with its Hands clench'd.

The prisoner came in on the 21st of November, and looked at some prints; she said she did not like any of them, and I got some others from the warehouse; when I returned I missed one of those I had shewn her; I then showed her what I had brought from the warehouse; she said she did not like them, and would call another day; I said it was odd none of them would suit her - she then said, "Cut me off seven yards of that," which I did- she paid for it, and went away. I went after her, and brought her back; Mr. Shoolbred said he thought she had got more than she should have; she said she had nothing but what she had paid for. We took her to the watch-house, and met the constable. As we were going along she dropped this piece from under her gown or her shawl.</p>

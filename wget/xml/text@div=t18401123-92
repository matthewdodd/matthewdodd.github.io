                  </hi>. Sen. I am a baker. I have one shop in Cow-cross-street, and another in Monmouth-street, which is attended to by my son and daughter—the prisoner has been in my service for three or four months—the shop in Monmouth-street communicates with the bakehouse, by two trap-doors, one of which is in constant use, and the other not in ordinary use—I was not aware that it could be opened—on the 3rd of November, in consequence of information, I marked some copper-money, in the presence of my son and daughter—I gave it into my daughter's hand, saw her put it on the mantel-piece, and told her to put it into the till the last thing at night—it was the prisoner's duty to work during the night in the bakehouse, and to call my son when the bread was ready—his usual time of coming was eleven o'clock at night.</p>

Weight of copper money in the till over-night, and 1lb. weight was missing—I did not ascertain what amount in value there was, but I weighed it, which is my invariable practice—the money was not marked on both sides—I know of no quarrel between my son and the prisoner, of any consequence—I never heard of any thing of the kind till since this occurrence—I have been told by the prisoner's friends that ray son has taken this <hi rend="italic">plea</hi> against him out of spite—persons who are working together will occasionally have words, but I never knew there was any serious dispute, or any fighting, nothing more than ordinary words.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter. On Tuesday, the 3rd of November, my brother and I marked eight pence and eight half-pence, about nine o'clock in the evening—I placed them on the mantel-piece, where they remained till the last thing at night—I then put them into the till with other copper money—I weighed the till, and it weighed 13lbs.—I then put it in its place again—I did not lock it—the pri<lb></lb>soner came between eleven and twelve o'clock that night to shut up the shop—when he had done it I let him down into the bake-house by the trap-door which was in usual use—I placed some pieces of wood over the other trap-door—next morning when I came to the shop I weighed the till, and found a deficiency of one pound weight, and all the marked money gone but a halfpenny—I also found the pieces of wood gone from the trap-door, which showed it must have been opened—I had left the shop last at night, and locked the shop up—there was no means of communication with the shop except by those trap-doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Any body in the shop could have moved the pieces of wood without coming up the trap? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—because they were not put there till the shop was shut—nobody could get into the shop—it was ex<lb></lb>amined before any body came into the shop in the morning—I never heard of any squabbling between the prisoner and my brother.</p>

               <p>the till—the prisoner called me up about half-past one or two o'clock, when the bread was ready—previous to going to bed I marked the trap-door with two pieces of wood—I left my sister in the shop to see that it was right—next morning I came into the shop with my sister—we weighed the till—we examined the trap-door, and found the wood disturbed—after we had weighed the till I opened the shop—the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me for sixpence—I gave him six penny pieces—my father came about eight o'clock, and I made a communication to him—the prisoner was taken into custody about an hour afterwards—I fetched the officer—I saw him searched, and two penny pieces were produced which I recognized as two of the marked ones which were put into the till the night before—I afterwards saw some penny pieces produced from a handkerchief in the bakehouse, and recognised six of those and four half-pence as part of the marked money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I am told you and the prisoner have not been the best of friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing particular—it was his duty to call me of a night when the bread was ready—I was not in the habit of putting a chest of drawers against my bed-room door to prevent his getting in to call me—they never were against the door when he came to call me—there was a piece of iron, which I used to put to catch the door, because I would not trouble myself to lock it—I placed it to keep the door from opening, not to prevent the prisoner coming in to call me—we have had words—I never said, if I was not man enough to beat him, I would do for him some way or other, nor any words to that effect—he has said that he called me up, when I do not believe he has—there was a <hi rend="italic">fuss</hi> about that—I believe Mrs. Best, who lodges in the house, made some complaint to my father be<lb></lb>cause she did not much like me—she had a kind of spite against me, because I was rather sharp with her about the rent—we wished her to go, and she did go—I got the coppers which I gave the prisoner that morning from the till after we had examined it—it was before the shop was opened, and before he was charged—the short weight had then been found—I stated that to the Magistrate.</p>

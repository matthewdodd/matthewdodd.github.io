The Evidence for the King made it apparent, that the Prisoners at the Bar, for some time, had made it their business and trade, in the aforesaid nature to leave young Infants (which they had gotten under the species of Nurses) to the Mercy and Commiseration of a Parish, after they had got a considerable Sum of their natural Parents; where, after they had left them, they would one way or other engratiate themselves with the Overseers or Church-wardens of the Parish where the Child was left, that the Nursing might once more be committed to their Charges, by which means they would engross to themselves a double Pension, one from the Parent, another from the Parish where it was left. The Prisoners could make little or no defence that was any way pertinent; all that was said, was in Confutation of one who gave Evidence against them, that they had served him so in two Children that were laid to his Charge, being Twins basely born, he agreeing to give the said Prisoners five pounds to acquit him of the Children; which after he had done, and delivered the Children to one of their Custodies, they agreeing together, carried and left the Children in the Parish of St. Botolph Bishopsgate; but the Prisoner said, he ordered them so to do: which with all their other Evasions being look'd upon as fostered, they were brought in all <rs id="t16850826-18-verdict88" type="verdictDescription">

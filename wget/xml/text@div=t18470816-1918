                  </hi> I am second mate of the <hi rend="italic">James Edwards</hi>, which is in the St. Katharine's Docks; the prisoner was steward. On the 26th of July I lost a half-eagle, which is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had wanted to borrow money of me the day before, and I told him I had not got any—he had no business in my berth that I know of—I missed this piece of money—I took the prisoner to my room and spoke to him—he stated at first that he had not taken it—at last he said he had taken the half-eagle piece, and told me to say nothing about it, that he might not have discharge—I told him there was no necessity for it, he had been bad enough without—he had put the money in a house, and spent a cent of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never took it all; I went to speak to the mate, and this witness called me into the state-room, and had a rope's-end; he said I had taken the piece; I said I had not, but sooner than have a piece of work I would pay more than the value of it.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No.4, Neptune-court. On Sunday night the prisoner came to sleep in that house, and he left his coat for the price of the room, he had no money—on Monday night, the 26th, he came again with a gold piece.</p>

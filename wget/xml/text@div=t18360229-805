                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Rowlett's-buildings, York-street, Westminster. On the night of the 16th of February I was at the Adam and Ere Public-house, in York-street, and saw the two prisoners there—I went from there to the Blue Anchor—when I left there I went in a direction towards my own home—I passed the two prisoners as I came out—there were three together, if not more—it was about twelve or a quarter past twelve o'clock—it might be later—I had got up my own court, about forty or fifty yards from the house—just as I turned up, I heard same people behind, and heard a person say, "There goes the old <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>"—I was turning round to go up the court—I had not gone above a dozen yards up the court, before one or two came up behind me, and caught me fast by the back part of my collar and kicked my heels up, and I felt on my back—I saw both the prisoners, and a third person with them—after I fell I received several blows and kicks from the parties—I caught James's hand in my pocket, and caught it by the wrist—there was one sovereign 2 half sovereigns, and some shillings and sixpences—I had get change at the Bell about nine O'clock—I had to the amount of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. alto<lb></lb>gether in silver—he got his hand out of the grasp of my hand, and I caught him fast by the leg, and I felt in the meantime the watch pulled out of my pocket—I felt it go—it was fastened by my brace button—I felt it is, I think, James's hand—I cannot be certain it was his—I did not see it—not when I was down—I felt it in one of the prisoner's hands—I endeavoured to recover it—I said as they had had my money, I prayed them not to take my watch—I cannot swear I saw it in the man's hand, but I felt in—I endeavoured to raise myself, and the moment I raised my head, I was struck in the forehead by a kick and a blow, as well from the first—then was an alarm of "Murder", and the police came up—I turned over on my right side when I found them at my watch, and by that means I got the watch out of the prisoner's hand—it was fastened to my brace button—I recovered it in consequence of that—the sovereign and silver were gone—some of the money dropped on the ground when he got his hand out—I am certain some of my money was in his hand at the time I caught hold of it—some of the money had been removed from the bottom of my pocket by the hand before I seized him—that was James's hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any dispute at the public-house about a man the prisoners were speaking to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had at the Adam and Eve—I had gone in which a neighbour of mine, to have something to drink at the bar, and there was what we call a <hi rend="italic">free-and-easy</hi>—I happened to be standing at the door where the society was held—I saw these two men and several others short a man about—he was quite a stranger to me—I caught him by the arm, and said, "My man, you are very awkwardly situated here, and seem a stranger, I advice you to leave this party"—the prisoners were pushing him—I brought him away—he said, "I thank you, my master, "and he came with me and sat down by the door—he called for half-and-half, and made me drink with him—while I was having the half-and-half, the prisoner Roberts came, and wished him to toss for half-and-half—I said, "You see the man intoxicated, and does not wish to have any thing to do with you,—I heard the words used in the middle of the room, "Take and knock his b—head off."</p>

On the morning of the 16th of February my attention was called to a passeage in York-street by a cry of "Murder"—I found the prosecutor there lying on his right side on the ground—he had hold of the prisoner James by the leg—he said he had lost a sovereign and some silver—he said the prisoner James and two others had knocked him down in the passage, and robbed him of a sove<lb></lb>reign and some silver—the prosecutor was lying on his right side, with his face covered with blood—he was bleeding a great deal—he had a cut is the eye, and three or four grazes about the forehead, as if he had been kicked apparently—it was the mark a shoe would make, or by knocking his head against the wall—the skin was grazed, and it was bleeding—I told James in the direction of the station-house, and as I was going along the prosecutor pointed out Roberts, who was coming round the corner of Great Chapel-street to meet me—about a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty yards from the spot—that was in a direction from Broadway into York-street—he was almost at the corner—not five yards from it—it was in the Broadway, coming to meet me—he was coming on the road as I was coming along—coming up to me, I saw his face towards me—the prosecutor pointed him out, and said, "That is one of the others"—I said to my brother constable, "Go and catch hold of him"—he said, "You know him, you had better go yourself"—as soon as he saw me advance towards him he ran away—I ran after him, and caught him just at the corner of St. Orman's-hill—it might be a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards—when I got nearly to him he stopped and walked, and I told him into custody—he asked me what I wanted; what had he done?—I told him he must go to the station-house, and there he would be satisfied—when I came up and saw the prosecutor on the ground, his watch was of his fob, hanging by a button or guard like a ribbon—I saw a black rib<lb></lb>bon attached to it—it was four or five inches out of his fob—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.31/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Roberts, and 11/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on James—I did not take the third man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker, and live in Broadway, Westminster. I was at the Adam and Eve on the night in question—I happened to want to go to the back part of the premises—I was in the bar—I saw Foulkes was very tipsy—I said, "You had better come out of there, you will get the worst of it;" and I rather fancy he did strike a man, but I did not see it—I passed the door at the time; there was a regular fight between Foulkes and one or two bricklayers—I am sure of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Adam and Eve. I remember the night Foulkes and these men were in my house—Foulkes left about a quarter before twelve o'clock, as I was called into the parlour by my maid servant to say they were about to fight—they were not fighting when I went in—I was obliged to turn Foulkes out of my house, he was so quarrelsome and fitting with one of the these masons—I saw him myself fitting with the furthest prisoner(James) in the passage—I have known the prisoners eight or ten months as using my house—they appeared well-conducted men.</p>

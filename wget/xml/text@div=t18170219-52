I told him he must go to the Lord Mayor - He referred me to some persons where I might find my things. I found some of them at several places, by his direction-most of them are finished; they are worth 35l.</p>

            . I am a silversmith in Whitechapel. On the 26th of January I went with Mr. Gerrock to the prisoner's lodgings, in Compton-street. I told the prisoner it was clear hat he had been imposing on Mr. Gerrock, and that he had better tell him where he had sold the property, that he might take steps to recover it. I held out no promises to him. After a pause, he said he had pledged about two dozen six-key flutes at Mr. Cordy's, on Snow-hill, besides eight others. I asked him what he had done with the tickets, he said he had sold them to Cordy, and that he pledged the flutes in the name of Simpson-he said he did not think they asked him where he lived - I went there and found the flutes, the desk, and several of the books.</p>

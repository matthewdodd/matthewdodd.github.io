                  </hi>. I like at 1, Riley Street, Bermondsey, and am a journeyman lighterman—I was in charge of a barge called the Humber, belonging to Messrs. Ward &amp; Son, on the evening of 2nd October—she was laden with coffee, raisins and figs—I left the barge about 7 o'clock, to go on board the ship to the mate—there were 50 boxes of figs on board the barge—I loaded and counted them—when the boxes were delivered there were only 48—I went on board the ship about 7 o'clock, and was about an hour away—when they were counted afterwards, there were only forty-eight—I told the mate of the ship, and my father told the police—this box resembles one of the fifty boxes I had in the barge—it is one of the parcel of boxes—I saw the prisoner about 7 o'clock—he crossed my barge to take this barge away—the brand on this box is the same as the brand on the boxes I had on the barge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was alone in charge—my barge had got athwart hawse of the tier—there was a good many barges in the tier—there were—I several other vessels near me—I could not say that they had man on board dare say I was absent three-quarters of an hour—I said I went at 7 o'clock, and returned at 8—it might have been longer than that—I have worked with Bush before—I worked for a fortnight in the same firm he was working in about three years ago—I did not speak to him on this evening—it was getting towards dusk when I left the barge—the figs were not under a tarpaulin; they were in oases—I tallied the oases in myself; no one helped me—I tallied them out—I did not see the two boxes afterwards—I knew the boxes contained figs—I did not go on shore—I had to go on board the ship.</p>

On the evening of 21st October, I took the last witness into the police galley, and rowed up to Blackfriars Bridge—I saw the prisoner in a skiff near the bridge—I found under the thwart that the prisoner Was sitting on, this blue pocket handkerchief, containing the figs produced—I asked him bow he accounted for the figs being there—he said be took them out of the barge he had just left—that barge was laden with bricks and sand—we took the prisoner into the police galley, and examined the barge—while we were doing so, the constable called out; "Make haste, he (meaning the prisoner) is taking the figs out of his pocket, and throwing them overboard"—I returned to the boat immediately, and took from his pocket a quantity of figs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him how he came in possession of them, and he said he took them out of the handkerchief—this box corresponds with the two that were stolen.</p>

I was with Inspector Bennett, in the police galley—we went alongside the prisoner's boat, and I saw the hand-kerchief under the thwart—we then rowed back to the barge containing the sand; and while the inspector and the lighterman were on board the barge, I heard something being thrown overboard—I said to the prisoner "Don't throw any more over," and I went aft, and found that his pockets contained figs—I called to the inspector, and we took the figs out of his pockets.</p>

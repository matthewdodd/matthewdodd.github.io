                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Laundy, of 164, High-street, Borough; he is in the service of Mr. Joseph Sterry, an oilman—on 7th May the prisoner Brown came to the shop and asked for some soap and soda; the soap was one penny and the soda a halfpenny—he tendered a shilling, and I gave him change—I put the shilling in the drawer with others—I saw him again about an hour, or an hour and a half afterwards—he asked for a Pennyworth of chloride of lime, and gave me in payment a bad shilling—I I kept it in my hand, gave him the change and he went away—I then called to Carney, an assistant, to come and look at it—after marking it, I wrapped it up in paper, put it in a desk, and looked it up—I then went to the drawer, examined the money there, and found a bad shilling—I know Johnson—I have not seen him with Brown—I saw him at the shop on the same day; he asked for a pennyworth of soft soap, and I served him; that was between 2 and 3 o'clock, after Brown came—I saw Johnson served by Carney—he tendered in payment a shilling—I saw, as he laid it on the counter, that it was bad—Carney took it, put it in his mouth and broke it, and said it was bad: that was in Johnson's presence—I afterwards took the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, at 7, White-street, Southwark—on 21st May, I saw the prisoners outside my window, looking in; Johnson came in and asked for half a pound of sixpenny steak—I served him, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him ninepence change, and put the shilling in the till; there was no other silver there, only coppers—he then went out, taking the steak with him; not a minute afterwards Brown came in and asked for half a pound of sixpenny steak—I served him, and he tendered me a counterfeit shilling—I looked at it, put it in my teeth, and said, "This is a soft; one"—he said, "Well, if it is, there is another," and threw down a good one—I said, "If you will fetch me a policeman, I will give you the change; I lay a guinea your <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> has just now given me another one"—I opened the till and there was another one—I took it out, and was about showing it to him, and he said, "Well, I want my change"—I did not give him the change—I had taken up the good shilling—I gave him the bad one back, and he broke it up before me, and went out for a policeman—he came back and said that he could not find one—I refused to give him the change, and took him in custody myself—we did not meet a policeman till we got to the station-house; he was there locked up—I am quite sure the shilling he broke up was a bad one—I marked the shilling that Johnson gave me, and gave it to the constable at the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Brown. Q.</hi> Was there anybody else in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a man buying a pig's face; he gave me sixpence, not a shilling—I did not pull out any silver in a bowl; there is nothing of the sort in my till—you did not attempt to run away going to the station; you have got a wooden leg, and my brother was behind you all the way.</p>

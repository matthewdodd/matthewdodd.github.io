                  </hi> I am a millwright, I lived at the prisoner's aunt's, 6, Burton-street, Walworth. On Sunday, 23rd April, the prisoner came to my window and tried to get in—he said I was a government man, and said, "I belong to O'Connor, and O'Connor will be hung and I too"—I told him to go—he went away—in about ten minutes I went out for some milk with a jug, leaving my wife in the room—as soon as I got out the prisoner rashed at me and struck me with a piece of chair, three or four inches thick—my wife came out—he shut the door, leaving me outside—I heard my wife scream—there had been no quarrel between my wife and me—there was between her and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came to the window and threatened my husband—he went out for some milk and locked the door, and I saw the prisoner in the middle of the street heating him with a stick—I unlocked the door and went out to protect him—the prisoner came and shut the door, leaving me in the passage with him, and my husband outside—he pushed me down, walked over me, and struck me with a stick on the top of my head—it bled very much—I put my hand out to save my head, and received the next blow on my hand, here is the mark—a third blow came on my arm—I was down—I saw the stick</p>

               <p>raised over my head, and begged for mercy—he said, "Will you go into your own room?"—I said, "Yes"—I went in, jumped out of the window, and called "Police!"—he did not follow me—I think he went into his own room—there had been no material difference between my husband and him—he called me very bad names—I have been informed that he has been in a lunatic asylum.</p>

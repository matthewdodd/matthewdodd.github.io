               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have about one hundred workpeople altogether; about fifty in London—the prisoner had to settle with from forty to fifty, but not in the same way as he did with Bass—there would be about thirty or thirty-five people to pay every week for work done—they did not come in regularly every week—the number of workpeople I had would not be shown by the week—I dare say thirty-five to forty were paid weekly, and it was his duty to pay them—he had other duty to perform also; to cut up bristles, give out work, and take in work—he has been with me nearly twenty years—he has not assisted me materially; he has been in the habit of cooking my books, and making it appear so—I was insolvent in 1855, and in Whitecross Street Prison—the prisoner was one of my bail for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might have lent me money occasionally since that time; the books will show—he has never given me his name to accommodation bills—he never discounted a bill for me; he filled one in in my absence, and put his name at the back—I don't remember his lending me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in October, 1871; I have no knowledge of it—the cash-book is here, and will show every transaction—how could he lend me money when he was indebted to me?—I have no recollection of his lending me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 23rd October, 1871—I don't swear that he did not: if he did he should have entered it in this book—the cash-book shows him a debtor to me of 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that moment—I have do recollection of his lending me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in October, 1871—will not swear he did not—it would not have come into my hands if he had; it would have gone into the bank—I have not got the pass-book or the paying-in book for that year—I was away eight or nine months, and sent money to my wife—I don't think my wife knows whether he lent me 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or not—she is here—she would not know—if he had done it, it would have been in the book—I have no recollection of his lending me 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd October—there is a cheque here, written "Collins," but I say now that at that moment he was indebted to me in 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he frequently kept back sums and entered them in the wrong dates, and made a fictitious balance every week—he did not lend me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th January, 1872—the balance at that moment was</p>

I have no knowledge of them—I don't think they did—I won't swear that not one of them did—they might have been used for me, but I have never seen them, and I don't believe it—there is no evidence to convince me that those cheques were used in my business—the balance that I find is a balance in my favour at the end of the year—the accountant has gone through the books—the prisoner had notice that the books were opened when the new cases were presented—he was not present when the accountant was going through the books—I did not let the prisoner know at any time that he was going through the books—I might have borrowed money from the prisoner over and over again to pay the wages on Saturday night for a day or two—I don't recollect distinctly; if he did, did that justify him in robbing me?—he might have lent me money; certainly not as often as thirty times in the year, nor twenty; he might have done so a dozen times in the course of fifteen years—I produce an acceptance of Matthews &amp; Blight, and also some letters, which I have had notice of—this is a bill drawn in my name and accepted by Edward Matthews—they did not pay the bill at maturity—very likely Matthews &amp; Blight wrote and told me they did not pay it—I believe the prisoner discounted it at the bank—it might have been at my request—I must have known it certainly; it must have been with my sanction—I might not have been in London when it was done—I don't remember now whether it was done at my special request—I must have known it certainly—I have exchanged cheques with the prisoner now and then—when my cheque would not be paid, I have got a cheque from the prisoner on two or three occasions—I don't recollect to what amount—there was another transaction with Matthews &amp; Blight in April—the two transactions amounted to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not aware that he has accommodated my wife with money; I believe he has lent a few pounds occasionally, and he has as often borrowed of her if he wanted money—I suppose my wife is a witness; she was a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

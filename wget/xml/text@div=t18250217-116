On the 12th of February, I missed a coat, a waistcoat, a handkerchief, and a hat. John Spinks also lodged in the room. Some of the things were in a trunk, and some hanging over the bed, I saw them safe when I went out, between eight and nine o'clock at night. I went to the Hand-and-Flower public-house: I returned a little after eleven. The prisoner had <rs id="t18250217-116-deflabel672" type="occupation">worked in the garden</rs>

When I went to the public-house, he was there, and went out about nine o'clock, and returned in about an hour, and said, "I have been out, and got my Sunday hat on: it will fit you Duncan." I then took notice of the hat - it was different to the one he had on before. When I went home, I lighted a candle, and missed my things directly. I called a young man, named Foster; we went into the room again, and found two hats there: one of them was mine, the other was the prisoner's, and one of mine was gone. We then went down to see if the prisoner was in his lodging, at the Hand and Flower public-house - he was not; we then went further, and found him concealed in some straw; we asked him, what he did there; he said, as it was late, he did not like to disturb the people at the public-house. Foster brought the hat down, and asked him if it was his - he said, it was, and a handkerchief, which was in it. He denied having been in the room. I did not lock the door when I went out. He said, he knew nothing about the property - we found it concealed in the nursery the next morning. I cannot say whether he was drunk or not. We took him to the watch-house, and he said, we might do our best.</p>
               <p>JOHN SPINKS. I lodge with Duncan. I left the room about eight o'clock, and left my property all safe. I went to town, and returned a little after twelve. I met Duncan and Foster at the gate, who told me of the robbery. I found all my property concealed in some straw, about seven o'clock the next morning.</p>

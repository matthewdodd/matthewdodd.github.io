                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 541). On Sunday, 12th March, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Savage-gardens, and saw some marks like footsteps on a crane in front of No. 2, which led me to believe somebody had gone up the crane—I looked up to the first floor window, and saw a small hole in the side window over the crane, just by the window fastening—I called the assistance of a brother officer, and sent him for the sergeant—while he was gone I heard a great smashing of glass, appa<lb></lb>rently at the back of the premises—the other officer and the sergeant then came up—the officer went into French Horn-yard, Crutched-friars, at the back of the premises No. 2, where there are stables, and sergeant Pole stopped with me—I looked up, and saw a man going along the parapet of No. 7 in the same row, between a walk and a run—I sprang my rattle, and Mr. Smith, of No. 5, Savage-gardens, came down, and let me and the ser<lb></lb>geant go on to the roof of the houses—we went from the roof of No. 5 to No. 1, Muscovy-court, Trinity-square, and there found the prisoners standing in a gutter on the roof; Amos was bleeding very much from cuts on his face and hands—I took them to the station, searched Jones, and found on him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on Amos 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., forty-three cigars, some lucifer matches, and in one of his shoes these peppercorns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards examined the premises, and found a hole six or seven feet square in the glass roof at the back of No. 2, Savage-gardens—I found on the floor two or three bushels of peppercorns spread out loose—at the place where they were lying there was a tub close against the wall, and by getting on to that there was a beam going across the room to an upright shaft, from which a person could get on to the glass roof—that would enable a person who had fallen through to get</p>

               <p>out again, and then, by going up a water spout he could get to the parapet of the house, and then could easily get where I found the prisoners—the water spout is perhaps twenty feet high—it would not be a very easy ope<lb></lb>ration, particularly if a person had had a great fell—I found marks of blood on the water spout and over the roofs of the houses; the whole distance to where I found the prisoners there were drops of blood and marks of hands—on the same morning I found, on the parapet of No. 11, three small keys—after the prisoners were committed, I went on the 14th to examine the place again—I examined the whole of the roofs, and at the spot where I apprehended the prisoners I found, between the tiles, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land notes, stained with blood—I also found three keys on a desk in the office of Messrs. Magnus and Marshall, who occupy the first floor—there was also under the tiles a French silver coin, a French copper coin, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 520). I was called to assist Scarborough—I went to the back of the house, No. 2, Savage-gardens—I heard a crash of glass—I saw a man on the top of the house—I called to him, and he turned and went on to the parapet of another house in the direction of Muscovy-court—I then heard another crash of glass much louder than the first—I left another officer in French Horn-yard, and I went to the front of the houses, and then to the top of the parapet, and found the prisoners in custody of the last witness and Lloyd, at the top of No. 5.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector</hi>). I was at the station in Seething-lane, when the prisoners were brought in custody—I went to the premises, No. 2, Savage-gardens, immediately after the charge was entered—I went to the first floor of Messrs. Magniss and Marshall's place—they are corn<lb></lb>factors—I found their counting house in very great confusion, all the papers scattered about, the drawers open, and two iron safes were open—this cash box was on the desk, in the state it is now—I went there about 4 o'clock, or a little after—there was no one living in those chambers—there is a female living at the top of the house—there are two doors—I went in at the one which leads up the stairs to the dwelling house, got out of a window at the top of the stairs, and got into Mr. Marshall's—I found a pair of scissors there, and marks on them, as if they had been used for the purpose of breaking open—I found four sovereigns and two half sovereigns, and a 20 franc gold piece in a part of the cash box which had not been opened, and on a ledge near the safe I found a piece of candle—a lucifer match was picked up in my presence—I have compared it with the matches produced by Scarborough, and it is similar—I found some cigars—I examined the front window, and found a hole just opposite the fastening of the window, large enough to admit an arm, to enable a person to undo the hasp of the window—I saw the glass roof which was broken, and some paper underneath—the door going from the room to the place where the paper was, was secure—I</p>

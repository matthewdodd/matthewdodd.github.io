                  </hi>. I have been a sailor, on board his Majesty's ships, for many years. On the 6th of January I came up to receive my pension—I received six sovereigns and two shillings—the prisoner was a watchman of the Sailors' Home—he came with me, of his own accord, to take care of me—we met Mary Crawley on Tower-hill, and went into the Phonix public-house, St. Katharine's—the prisoner asked me to give him the money for him to take it home safe to one of the officers for me—I did not give it him—I had five sovereigns, and my pension ticket on the table, and he snatched it up—I asked him for it again—he said he would not give it me, he would take it home—I could not get it from him, and he went away in about five minutes with it, and never brought it to me again.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 2, Whitmore-street, Whitmore-road, in the parish of Shoreditch; the house belongs to a man named Osborn; I occupy the first floor; I rent it under the prisoner; he occupies the lower part with his wife and children. On the 5th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came home with three men—I had just got to bed, and one of his friends came and called me—I partly dressed myself, went down stairs, and found the prisoner in company with three men, his wife, and an<lb></lb>other woman—I took some beer with them in his part of the house—I re<lb></lb>mained with them about an hour—the prisoner and Mr. Clarke were quarrelling—when I left I said I would go to bed—after I had been in bed about a quarter of an hour the prisoner called to me to come down—I did not answer him—he called again, and said if I did not come down he would set the d— —d house on fire—I said nothing—in a short time he called out to me from the foot of the stairs for a drop of water—I immediately got up,</p>

               <p>opened my door, and the suffocations from the smoke was so great that I could hardly get down stairs—when I went up stairs every body was gone but the prisoner, Clarke, and Clarke's wife—I only left three persons below—they were at the front door—the prisoner's wife was on the staircase, the prisoner stood inside the passage, and Clarke and his wife outside in the act of going—when they were gone there was nobody there but the prisoner—when I got down stairs I found the prisoner in the passage—I opened the street door, and called, "police! fire!"—a policeman came directly—I told him what had happened—he came in, and I gave the prisoner in charge—the fire was ex<lb></lb>tinguished with water by some men who stood there—I found part of the floor of the front parlour was burnt—it was on fire when I saw it—the wood<lb></lb>work was not burnt a great deal—a deal box, which stood on the floor close to the bed, was scorched—those were the only places which seemed to have been fired—the prisoner told the policeman he did not intend to set the house on fire—I could perceive from his manner that he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 233.) I was called into the house by Mr. Holman, and found it filled with smoke—the fire was put out by somebody by throwing a pail of water over it—I examined it—the floor<lb></lb>ing was burnt—I found some pieces of burnt rag lying in the fender—when I entered the room I found some rags burning on the floor near the foot of the bed. about a foot and a half from the fire-place—there was no fire in the grate—I did not see any candle at the bottom of the house—there was about a handful of calico rags—there was a box which was a little burnt; the rags were lying very near it—the floor which was burnt was near the rags—there was a great quantity of smoke when I went in—I was obliged to leave the the house—it was confined to the room and passage—I found no other floor with smoke in it.</p>

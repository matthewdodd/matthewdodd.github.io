On the 9th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, a pane of glass was broken in my window, by an intoxicated man. I put a board to it, and some paper, and other things, to keep it up; it could not be moved without pushing them away. About nine o'clock, a boy came from the hole, and told me I had been robbed. I went out, and observed the board had been pushed away, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, out of my window. There were two panes of glass, from which a man by putting in his hand, could reach them; they were worth 3l.3s. The officer brought me the paper next morning, which has my name on it. The boy said, he had not seen any one do it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am a constable of St Giles's. On the 10th of February, I was at the corner of Short's-gardens, Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner and two others come running up Short's-gardens; it was about ten minutes before one o'clock in the morning. The prisoner had a bundle wrapped up in a blue apron; I followed him to the Black-dog; there, as he was running in, I secured him, and asked, what he had there; he said, "Paper." I asked where he got it; he said, he bought it of a strange man in the street, for 16s. I told him he must go with me; he resisted a little; he then said he would go if I would not choak him-the other two ran away. I took him to the watch-house, and found a latch-key on him. Mr. Brooks's name being on the paper, I took it there; he claimed it. I produce it.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOKS. This is mine; I remember the prisoner coming to my shop, about a week before; he asked the way to some street. I missed all the things at the same time - I saw them safe at seven o'clock in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in Holborn, who said he found it, and sold it to me.</p>

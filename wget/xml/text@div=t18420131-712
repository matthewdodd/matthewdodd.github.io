                  </hi>. I live with John William Fryett, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road. On Saturday evening, the 22nd of January, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I was standing minding the door—the prisoner came into the shop and looked about—I asked what he was looking for—he said, for his mother—I knew nothing of his mother—I said, "She is not here," and as he went out I saw him pull down the trowsers, which hung two feet inside the door, on a piece of wood—I ran and caught hold of his coat—he tried to get from me, and hit me on the head with his elbow more than once—there was somebody else standing in a dark part at the side of the doorway—I called for assistance—Reardon, the foreman, ran out and</p>

               <p>caught hold of the prisoner—he said, "Oh, take me into the shop, come inside"—the foreman picked up the trowsers under his feet, which he had thrown down, about two yards from where they had hung, just outside the door—they were worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found the nail pulled out of the board on which they hung, and the board was split—these are the trowsers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When he collared me, a gentleman at the door said, "That is not him"—he said, "Yes, I think it is him"—the gentleman showed him three lads and said, "There they go, they have just <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them down." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw no boys running, and nothing was said about any—there were two others outside, and when I caught hold of him they hit me several blows over both arms, as I held him—the trowsers produced are what he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to Mr. Wood, next door to Mr. Fryett. On Saturday, the 22nd, after nine o'clock, I was standing at my master's door, and saw the prisoner in company with two others, come up and lurk about Mr. Fryett's and my master's some time, watching for something, looking in towards Mr. Fryett's shop particularly, all three of them—I am sure the prisoner is one—I had never seen him before—I saw one about the same height as the prisoner inside Mr. Fryett's door—he looked about, and I saw him come out again—the prisoner was standing outside at that time—one of them had an umbrella, which he held sideways to prevent my seeing any thing—this was a quarter of an hour before the robbery—I saw Garrett seize the prisoner, who was talking to a countryman a few minutes before—after the scuffle I saw the foreman come up, collar the prisoner, and pick up the trowsers underneath his feet, about the middle of the pavement—the prisoner was trying to get away, and cried out, "Let me go, you know my mother"—I did not see any blows struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I left my work about half-past seven o'clock. Coming up Whitechapel I met three young men looking about the shops, and watched them; one, thinking I was watching them, came and struck me. I followed them to this shop. I went to a gentleman and said, "There are three young men after thieving something." I went in at the door to tell the master of the shop, but before I could get to tell him they took the trowsers from the door. I immediately ran out, and had almost got hold of him, when the boy seized me, and said it was me; he is mis<lb></lb>taken in me..</p>

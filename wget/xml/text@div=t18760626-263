I live at 63, Hatton Garden—about 11 p.m. I was in Pentonville Road by the angle of the reservoir, and saw six or seven young men and the two prisoners; the prosecutor was on his back, and when six or seven of them got off of him, I saw that it was Mr. Capon—Harrison was lying down by his side, and just getting up as the constable came up, and drawing his hand apparently from Mr. Capon's trousers' pocket, and Brasstock was stooping and looking over him, and when he saw me he tried to pick him up—I followed both of them to the end of Claremont Square—they ran to Middleton Square—the constable took one and I took Brass<lb></lb>tock, and handed him over to another constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler to Mr. Bottom, of Windmill-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On the 29th of October I was returning to town with a horse, and stopped at the Red Lion tap at Ilford—I gave my horse to the land<lb></lb>lady's son to hold—I had a coat attached to the saddle—I came out in a quarter of an hour, and it was gone—I have not seen it since, but I saw the prisoner with the horse coming up to the door—he had taken the horse from the boy that I gave it to—he gave the horse to the boy, and the boy ran into the house, and said my coat was gone—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 29th of October, Read sent for me to take the prisoner—there was the rope, and the loop in front of the saddle had been cut—I took the prisoner—he swore he would not go—he was with several navigators in the house—I had a desperate struggle to get him out—I was thrown down, and was obliged to call other people.</p>

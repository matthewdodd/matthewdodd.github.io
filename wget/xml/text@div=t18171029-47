I went into St. Paul's Church-yard with him, he pointed out the two prisoners, and said they were the men, I seized one and he the other, and we took them into a house, and searched them - They denied having it - We found it on Crooks. I gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARLISLE. I am an officer. On the 8th of October I was coming down Fleet-street, from Temple-bar, and observed the prisoners following several gentlemen, and feeling their pockets; they went as far as Fleet-market, returned again nearly as far as Chancery-lane, and then went down Fleet-street again; I missed them just by Fleet-market for half an hour; I watched about Ludgate-hill, and saw them behind the prosecutor, who was with a lady, just by St. Paul's Church-yard, Bartlett lifted his pocket up, went a little farther, and pulled the handkerchlef about five inches out, just by Ludgate church, Crooks took it quite out and ran across the way. I told the prosecutor, and desired him to return with me to look for them-they had gone towards St. Pauls. We came up with them in St. Paul's Church-yard, laid hold of them, and took them into a public-house, searched them, and found the handkerchief at the back part of Crooks' breeches. The prosecutor described it before he saw it.</p>

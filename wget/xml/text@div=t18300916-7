On Saturday, the 10th of July, I sat up all night to watch; the prisoner had been out that night, and came in between three and four o'clock - he went up stairs, and took off his shoes - came down directly to the shop, and opened the lock of the shop door with a false key; it is an inner door, leading from the shop to the passage - I am sure that door was locked, for I was particular with it; I was down in the kitchen below - we have no parlour; I heard him unlock the door - I ran up stairs; he is rather deaf - I got up in an instant, and told him he had made a bad job of it; he had no light, nor had I - it was break of day; he stood at the door very much concerned, but said nothing for some time, and then asked me to forgive him - I put my hand outside his coat, and he drew out this pair of shoes, and put on the show-board; here they are - they are mine, and had been in the shop about two months; I took the key out of the door - it had been prepared for the purpose; it would not fit the door of itself - it was not my key; I did not know he had it - I keep the regular key of the door myself, and had it at that time; I delivered the shoes to Hainsworth, the officer.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge, with the shoes and key, which I have had ever since - no threat or promise was made to the prisoner; Baker said he had entered the shop with a false key - the prisoner said he hoped he would not give him in charge, he knew the consequence if he did - I afterwards took the key and tried it; I found it would unlock the door, but not lock it.</p>

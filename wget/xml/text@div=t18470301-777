                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>) On the morning of 23rd Feb., in consequence of direction I received stationed myself in sight of the prisoner Filmer's house—after waiting some time, at a quarter before eight o'clock I observed Filmer to go into his house—after he had gone in about half an hour, Newitt came up in one of Pickford and Co.'s carts, No. 22—I saw Pickford's name on it—he took a bag, which seemed to be heavy, out of the cart, and carried in into Filmer's house in Cross-street, then came out and drove away—I am sure he</p>

               <p>is the man—after that, Sergeant Brannan came to me—we saw Filmer come out, and stepped a few paces back—he crossed Leonard-street, and went into a public-house opposite—Brannan went in, and called him out—I went with Brannan and Filmer to Filmer's house—I called a man to our assistance, and did not hear what passed between Brannan and Filmer—I went to the house, and in a shed at the rear of the premises saw a bag, which I believe to be the one Newitt took into the house, it resembled it, and was about the same bulk—I opened it, and it contained peas—Filmer was asked what it was, and where he got it—he said he bought them over the water at a marine store shop—I after<lb></lb>wards went with Brannan to the Castle, in Wood-street, to Newitt, and told him he was charged on suspicion of stealing a bag of peas of Messrs. Pickford and Co.'s, which he had taken into Filmer's house—he said he knew nothing about it, that he had not been in the neighbourhood that morning—I saw Filmer go in and come out—nobody had been in but Newitt in the mean time—Cross-street is altogether cut of the way from the City-road to the Castle in Wood-street.</p>

I gave direction to Hawkins—I afterwards saw him standing at the corner of Cross-street—gave me information—I saw Filmer come out of his house and go down Cross-street, into the Griffin public-house at the corner of cross-street and Leonard-street—I went to him and said I belonged to the police, and asked him about the bag Mr. Pickford's man had brought—he said he knew nothing at all about it, he had not been at home all the morning—I said, "I just saw you come out"—he said, "That you have not, I have not been at home all the morning"—we took him into his house, an I through the house to a shed, where Hawkins said, "I believe this is the bag," and commenced opening it—I asked Filmer what it was—he said, "Old marine store"—Hawkins held some of the peas up, and said, "I never saw such marine store"—Filmer said, "I bought them of a marine store dealer over the water"—Hawkins took possession of the bag, and I took Filmer to the station—I then went to the Castel, saw Newitt, and charged him with taking the bag into Filmer's—he said he was not in the neighbourhood that morning.</p>

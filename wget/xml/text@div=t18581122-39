                  </hi>. I am a tea-merchant, of 35, King William-street, in the City. The prisoner was in my employ—I have here the articles of agreement which he signed—he was one of our van men—he was to take out goods as per orders, to deliver them, to receive orders for the following week, and every evening, or on the following morning, to hand out the money he had received to the cashier—he had to take out a way-bill, and to cast it up and deliver it to the cashier—he had to carry out the accounts of the money he received in the way-bill—</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your house the London Tea Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I drew up this agreement; it is signed by my brother—I think there was no person present on behalf of the prisoner—it is stated here that he was to have a commission on articles specified in the schedule, but there was no schedule made—he applied to us in distress—I could not get a character, and I thought he had been hardly used by his employer—I made a special provision, to employ him for one month, and then if I thought proper I would give him a commission according to the schedule; but, prior to the expiration of the month, I repeatedly called the foreman into the counting-house and told him to tell Robinson that we should not continue him; and the foreman told him we should not—the prisoner came into the office, and begged very hard to be continued—I told him the amount of the sales he effected was so trifling it was not worth our notice—he pleaded again to be continued, and I said, "If I do it will be with a view of befriending you, but there will be no commission"—I did not pay him the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; it was not in my department—he was not paid the first week, the second, or the third—I told the foreman to pay him the four weeks, and he misunderstood me; he should have paid him the month, and he paid him only one week—since then he has been paid every Saturday night—he was to have paid half the bad debts of the sales effected by him out of the commission, but he had no commission—I am not certain about the date, but it was on a Saturday he was suspended, and on the Tuesday he was given in custody—I did not ask him to go over the books with me—the books were all in our office—the prisoner would have an order book to take out each day; he would call on families and take orders and enter them in his order book, which book he would return at night, and the next morning he would have his way-bill—if he received money he would not enter it in his book, but in the way-bill which he gave in—the way-bills were made out by our junior clerk, my younger brother—these are the way-bills—here is the column in which he entered the money he received—he should enter these sums at the time he receives them, or at some time previous to balancing the way-bill—when he came home he had to account to the cashier—the order-book is the book in which he entered the orders he received—he would leave the order-book at home, and the orders would be entered in the way-bill for the next day—our cashier is never out of the way; if he had been out of the way I should have attended to it—in the event of our both being out of the way the foreman would have taken it—there is no other person who would receive it from the travellers—we have another cashier who receives the accounts in the house—the orders the prisoner got and entered, are from persons whom he introduced to the firm, I should presume entirely so, and that business did not pay—he made not one-fourth part of the average of our carts—he entered into our service in July—on 21st August, he received payment for one week instead of the month—I believe it was prior to that being paid, that I told him there should be no commission—I kept him on after that for his own benefit—I believe the bad debts were not mentioned—the commission was destroyed, and therefore the bad debts would be destroyed—we had a bond which was for his honesty only—our attorney has the bond.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Mrs. Lockhart had only paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would you have known if he had paid the whole sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if he had, he would have entered it on the way-bill—the accounts which are due are put down as owing—he would have it before his eyes every day—the name of every debtor would appear every day—on 12th October it appears as owing, and there appears nothing received on that day—this other way-bill of 16th October has Mrs. Lockhart's name returned as being indebted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and here is no receipt of money on that day—in this way-bill of the 19th, here is Mrs. Lockhart indebted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and nothing paid—in this way-bill of the 21st here is Mrs. Lockhart indebted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and nothing paid; and on each of these way-bills here are the names of the other two persons who have been examined, their accounts as due, and not paid.</p>

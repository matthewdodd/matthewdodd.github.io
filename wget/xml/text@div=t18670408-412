                  </hi>. I am an inspector in the employ of the Metro<lb></lb>politan Board of Works—about 10 p.m. on 19th February I was in the King's Cross Road, walking in the direction of the Great Northern Rail<lb></lb>way—when opposite Britannia Street I received a blow from behind, and fell on my hands in the mud—whilst in that position the prisoner came up and said, "I will help you up"—I turned round with the in<lb></lb>tention of striking him, when he snatched my guard, which broke, and he ran away with my watch—I wore an Albert chain—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of Rogers, 217 G—my watch was picked up.</p>

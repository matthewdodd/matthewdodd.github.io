                  </hi> I am a butler—on the night of 22nd July I was in the Fountains Abbey public-house, and saw the prisoners there—I was foolish enough to smoke a cigar the wrong way, that is, putting the lighted end in my mouth—that did not make me unwell—I went outside, and saw the prisoners there, and four others—Napton passed a handkerchief over my face twice, and after he had done it a third time my senses were taken away, and I did not know where I was—when I came to I was in a coffee-shop alone—somebody came in and asked me if I had lost anything—I went outside, and saw the two prisoners close against St. Mary's Hospital, by the side of a dead wall—I ran after them with Harvey, and asked them for my watch and chain—they said they had not got them, and I gave them in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It was two or three minutes from the time my watch and chain were taken until the prisoners were given into custody—I am sure I was in the Fountain's Abbey—I was sick in the street, and the prisoners and six others gathered around me—I had only been drinking cyder—I do not remember about dancing in the bar—I have not said a word till to-day</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, of 13, Upper Mews, Paddington—I was in the Fountains Abbey about 10 o'clock on the 22nd July, and saw Cooper there and the prisoners and others—Cooper went outside, and the prisoners and several others with him—I went out and saw the prisoners take Cooper to a post—he vomited there, and then Napton put a handker<lb></lb>chief across his face—I only saw that done once—two of the others went up Praed Street—the prisoners went by St. Mary's Hospital, and a tall man with a moustache who is not here—I took Cooper to a coffee-shop—I informed a constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When he was sick Napton drew a handkerchief across his face—other persons were round them—some of their backs were turned to me—I was about 15 yards off—the prisoners were taken between five and eight minutes afterwards—Cooper was not drunk, but he was excited—he had not been drinking in my presence—I had never seen him before—I saw him smoking a cigar in the public-house—I was drinking there about 20 minutes before he came in.</p>

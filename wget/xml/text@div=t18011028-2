               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Smith. Q. Have you examined into the character of this man? - A. I have been at a great deal of trouble to enquire into his character, and I have found, that, till this time, he has always borne the best of character; he is in the watch-making line.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280004"></xptr>(

               <p> - sworn. - I saw the prisoner behind the prosecutor with a silk handkerchief in his hand, which he was endeavouring to conceal; he then ran down the south side of the Mansron-House, and going out at the back part of it; I observed the prosecutor looking for his handkerchief, and asked him whether he had lost his handkerchief; upon which he said he had, and I shewed him the prisoner; he then went after him; I saw the handkerchief taken from his bosom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. (To Brown.) Q. Have you not said, within forty-eight hours, before the Grand Jury, that you could not swear to the handkerchief? - A. I recollect saying before the Grand Jury, there were a great number of handkerchiefs of the same kind, and if it was among a hundred I might not be able to pick it out; but if it was produced to me, I should know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The handkerchief was my own; I had holes in my pocket, and I put it in my bosom for fear I should lose it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

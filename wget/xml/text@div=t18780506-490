                  </hi>. I live in Bartholomew Road, Kentish Town—I have no business—my wife has private property—I have known the prisoner seven or eight years—he is a money lender—I have had many money transactions with him—on 20th August, 1875, I was given into custody by a lawyer's clerk—the charge came before Mr. Vaughan—a remand was granted for a week, and the case proceeded on the 27th, and was withdrawn—I attended and was represented by Mr. George Lewis, jun., and a Mr. Allingham prosecuted—I met the prisoner on 18th March, at Messrs. Digby's, 35, Lincoln's Inn Fields, the solicitors acting generally for my wife and me—we talked about the Grand National race—Mr. Carr, the managing clerk, had to pay the prisoner some money—the prisoner said he could not take interest, but would further advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Carr said the prisoner had better back "Jackal" sfor 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said "I have left off" backing horses, I am not going west, I am going into the City; if you like to risk a telegram I will send one to Atkins "—I did not then know who Atkins was—I know now that I had seen Atkins once before that—he is the manager to the Mischief Tavern</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060027"></xptr>
               <p>—I said I would put the matter beyond a doubt, and would ask Messrs. Digby's permission to allow the answer to the telegram to be sent there—I did so, and then left the office, leaving the prisoner and Carr there—I afterwards went to a public house near the Bankruptcy Court, Portugal Street—the prisoner and a few others were there, backing horses—we discussed about the winner—from there I went to the Napier Hotel, in Holborn, with the prisoner—a Mr. Makins was in the bar—I, the prisoner, and Makings, went to the telegraph office at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, and the prisoner dictated a telegram and I wrote it—it was sent—I and the prisoner then went to Mr. Hooper's, the prisoner's solicitor, 35, Newgate Street, about 12.30—I met a Mr. Lee there, a solicitor, and some others—we went across to the Seven Stars—I there said to Mr. Hooper, Mr. Potts, the landlord, and others, "I have sent a telegram to back 'Jackal' for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they asked if we thought he was likely to win—I, Mr. Hooper, and Mr. Lee, then went to a betting club in the Strand—the prisoner had then left—when we were discussing the merits of Jackal Mr. Hooper said that he should back the horse for two sovereigns—Jackal did not win—Atkins made no demand for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I occupied the same premises both before and after March, and in May I was in treaty with the prisoner to advance money with regard to my wife's pro<lb></lb>perty, and I had an appointment for me and my wife to meet the prisoner to execute a deed at Messrs. Digby's, at 11 o'clock one day in May—Mr. O'Brien, the prisoner's solicitor, went with us—the prisoner was to meet us there—a conversation took place with respect to the deed with Mr. Digby, in consequence of which I, my wife, and O'Brien left the office—on coming away we met the prisoner—he apologised to Mrs. Parker for being late—Mr. O'Brien said "No matter, Mr. Martin, Mr. Digby will not allow Mrs. Parker to sign the deed"—the prisoner flew in a great rage and said "By God, Mrs. Parker, if yon do not sign that deed I will charge your husband with having given a false name to a telegram, and that will give him seven years—Mrs. Parker said "You may give him 20 if you like, I will not sign that deed"—we then left—I met the prisoner frequently between that interview and when I was taken in custody—he said "There will be a warrant against you one of these fine days"—between 5th July and 20th August I lived at the Hermitage, Epsom—during the remand, when I was on bail, I did not see the prisoner—Chancery proceedings have been taken with respect to the deed, and those proceedings were decided at the beginning of the year—the prisoner swore "I never authorised or requested him," meaning myself, "to send the before-mentioned telegram"—that was false—this was also false, "I never authorised him to use my name for that or any purpose"—I appeared against the prisoner for perjury at the commencement of this year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was liable to the prisoner for the bet on "Jackal"—I stood to win or lose—I lost—I paid the following day or the day after—I sent Mr. Carr to pay Atkins—I did not telegraph in my own name because I did not know Atkins—when I laid the information I swore I did not know Atkins by name or sight—I had seen him once, but at that time I thought I had not—I did not owe him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not swear Atkins had not a dishonoured cheque of mine; I was told he had—I was never asked to pay it—I do not know that it was dishonoured; it might be, I cannot say—that was not the reason I did not put my own name</p>

               <p>on the telegram—I gave Atkins a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the August Bank Holiday in 1874—I had an account at the London and County Bank, Holborn branch, at the time I gave the cheque—I do not believe it was paid—the account might not have been sufficient to meet it—I forget all about it and all about the circumstances of meeting Mr. Atkins; I only saw him for about five minutes in a public-house next to the Beaufort Club—I did not know Atkins's address till the prisoner dictated it, and I believed I was a perfect stranger—I was a civil engineer 30 years ago under Robert Stephenson—since that time I have lived upon my private means, not by attending races—I have not been on a racecourse 10 times in the last seven years—Makins, I believe, used to keep the St. John of Jerusalem, Clerkenwell—it was seven years ago—I was in his house twice—I was not intimate with him—I do not know whether it was a sporting house—the bet was not compromised to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—in May, 1875, I went to Messrs. Digby's office to execute a deed—Mr. O'Brien was there before me—my husband came afterwards—in consequence of what passed between me and Messrs. Digby I did not sign the deed—after leaving we met the prisoner in Lincoln's Inn Fields—he said "I must apologise, Mrs. Parker, for being late"—Mr. O'Brien said "Oh, you need not apologise, Messrs. Digby would not let Mrs. Parker sign"—the prisoner said "Never mind, if Mrs. Parker will sign"—I said "I shall not sign"—he said "If you do not sign, by God, I will give your husband seven years for forging my name to a telegram"—I said "You may give him 20 if you like, I shall not sign"—I saw the prisoner several times between May and August—either the prisoner or Hooper said it would be bad for Mr. Parker if I did not sign, as they would prosecute him for forging the prisoner's name to a telegram—after my husband was arrested I saw the prisoner, and also Mr. Hooper, in the prisoner's presence—on 27th August I went to Mr. Hooper's office—the prisoner there said if I did not sign the deed he could not assist me; and Mr. Hooper produced the deed with some erasures and said it was altered; and as the time of the remand was running out I signed, and three minutes afterwards the prisoner went to Bow Street, and at 12 o'clock the charge was withdrawn and my husband was discharged—proceedings have been taken in Chancery, and the Master of the Rolls gave a decision on 14th February—my husband took out a summons a mouth before that.</p>

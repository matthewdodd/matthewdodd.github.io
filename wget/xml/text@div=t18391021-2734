                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live in Gloucester-street with the prisoner who is my father. My mother has been dead two months—I have two sisters younger than myself—since my mother's death, may father has ill used me—he has come home intoxicated—I have attempt to escape out of the window, but he was not aware of that—I recollect his coming home about ten o'clock, one Thursday night, in September—I do not now the date—he went to bed in the back room, first floor—I slept on the same floor with my sisters—after I had been in bed two or three hours, my father came into the room (I went to bed almost directly after he came home) he said "You b----, where is ray money?"—I had not got any of his money—I had laid it out for bread, tea and sugar, and I told him so—he had sent me—he dragged me out of bed by the hair of my head, swung me round the room, and struck my temple against the bedstead post—he then dashed me on to the ground, and jumped upon my stomach with his feet—when he swung me round the room, I fell against the bed-post, and my temple was cut—it was rather a deep cut—he did it on purpose—I got under the bed when he let go of me, and he pulled me out again by the hair of my head he pulled my hair out by the roots—he was not drunk at this time—he was drunk when he came home, but when he came up to me, he was quite sober—when he pulled me out, he struck my head</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Russell, and lives Gloucester-street, Curtain-road-the prisoner lived next door to me with his three children. About one o'clock in the morning of the 19th of September I was awoke by the screams of the children—I heard the prosecutrix's father beating her—I heard a fall and a blow—I got up and opened I window, and asked a man who was passing to knock at the prisoner's. door—a policeman was sent for—he knocked at the door-a young child opened it, and Rebecca ran out—I took hold of her, and took hold of. our house—she was in her night dress which was covered with blood had a cut over her right temple, her head was cut in places, and bleeding—part of her head was bald from the hair being torn off—she was crying, and complained of a blow at the bottom of her belly, which made her stoop very much—she could not stand upright at all—there was a mark at the bottom of her belly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the G division. About half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 19th of September I was at the station-house, in Featherstone-street, when the prosecutrix was brought there—her face was covered with blood, she had a cut over the right eye, and two cuts on the left side of her head—her arms were bruised, and there were several bruises on her back—the back part of the head was com<lb></lb>pletely bald, as if the hair had been dragged out—she complained of pain in her belly, and kept leaning on one side—she was unable to sit up—I sent for a doctor, and had her wounds dressed—she was then sent to St. Luke's workhouse—next day I examined the room, and, for between two and three feet square the floor was smeared with blood, and there was blood on heed-post—the prisoner said he had not touched her at all—that she had injured herself by getting under the bed to get away from him—I asked what could account for her trying to get from him—he said he did not know, she was a very good girl, and a mother to the other children, and he never touched her, and never would touch her.</p>

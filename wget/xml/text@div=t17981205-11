               <p>THOMAS ROBGEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am assistant brewer at the brewhouse of Sir Benjamin Trueman; Samson Hanbury, John-Trueman Villebois, and Henry Villebois, are the only persons concerned in the business. I was going by the tun which contained the ground malt in the brewhouse, on a Saturday, about half past eight in the evening, and I perceived some malt had been taken out of the tun.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you perceive that? - A. The tun was left in a level state about two o'clock in the afternoon, and this was about eight or nine; when I saw it, it appeared as if six or seven bushels had been removed; I asked two men who were loading the carts with grains, whether they had seen any thing of the malt; they said, no; the value is about twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your brewhouse to sell ground malt? - A. Never.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Forsyth. On the 14th of January the prisoner came into the shop, she asked to look at some narrow ribbon, I shewed her a drawer of ribbons, she told me to cut her three quarters of a yard of this ribbon, it came to three-pence; I cut it off. She then told me that she wanted some narrow short ribbon; I had to turn my back to get that drawer. I produced the narrow short ribbon, she looked at the second drawer sometime, and told me there was none narrow enough. I put the second drawer away, that occasioned me again to turn my back upon her. Upon my coming back to the counter she then looked over the first drawer again, she then told me she would have a yard and a half off a piece in the second drawer; I turned my back again to get the piece of ribbon out, and while I was measuring it

            . When I came from dinner into the shop the lad was serving the prisoner; there was another customer in the shop which I was serving with black thread; I saw the prisoner take up a piece of grey sarcenet ribbon and put it into her apron; I asked her what she was going to do with it; she said she was only going to look at it. I took hold of her apron and there were five other pieces of ribbon in it, the boy took them out. When I looked at her I am sure she took only the grey ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Aslett. You took the ribbons out of her apron - A. Yes, they were plain ribbons that I had shewn her in the first drawer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

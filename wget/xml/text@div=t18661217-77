                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). When I examined the prisoner's premises, among other things, I found a quantity of jewellery in the way described—amongst it was five earrings, all odd ones, five brooches set in stones, two lockets, and three gold pins—they were found under some loose rags, between the rags and the safes that were broken—when they were found the prisoner denied all knowledge of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Faraday and Davey, wholesale jewellers, Hatton Garden—on the 21st September I sent out a quantity of goods by a young man in our employment, to the value of between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon his return he reported that he had lost them—I can swear to this brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a turquoise, and was made expressly to order—those other articles are of exactly the same pattern as those I lost—the earrings are odd—they would be sent out in pairs—I circulated a handbill directly afterwards, giving a description of the property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any particular mark on this broach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I know it from the centre; it had formed a bracelet centre, and I took it out—I can swear positively to it—I advertised them as being lost or stolen—only about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of what was lost has been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of No. 24, Pakenham Street, Isling<lb></lb>ton—in September last I was in the employ of Messrs. Davey and Faraday—on the 21st I took out a quantity of jewellery for them—it was stolen I believe—I returned home and reported the loss—I was discharged, I believe, upon the representations made to my employers by the police that it looked very suspicious against me—I had gone to the West End first, to Regent Street—I discovered my loss opposite Whitechapel Church, at Fryett's, the jewellers, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—they were in a bag—there was no name on the bag—they were goods the same as these produced—there was a brooch in the bag similar to this, and I believe this to be the one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You don't swear to that; for aught you know it may have been sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it may have been—I told my employers it may have dropped off, because I carried it on the footboard of the trap, between myself and the man, and there was just a possibility of its falling off, but only one chance in a thousand—it was a very peculiar trap, it was full of other goods, and there was no room for the bag inside—the bag contained between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery—I had sold some out of the bag that morning—I am positive I did not sell any of these—I told my employer that there was about a chance in a thousand of the bag having fallen off, or words to that effect, but I was almost positive it was stolen—it was advertised as lost or stolen—that was done to induce any one who had it to bring it back—there was nothing on it to show to whom it belonged.</p>

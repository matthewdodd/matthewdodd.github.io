                  </hi>. I am a quartermaster in the merchant service, and was paid off last Wednesday fortnight—I was at Woolwich on Friday night, 6th August at the Steam Packet public-house—I left when the house closed at 12.30—I was making my way quietly along Beresford Street by myself when some one knocked me down from behind; they rifled my pockets and took 1 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a silk handkerchief, and cigar-case—I may have spoken to some one on my way before any one touched me—Ford knocked me down from behind—I seized him as he struck me, and I held him several seconds; that is how 1 know him—I am perfectly satisfied that Dunn was one of the men; he assisted in rifling my pockets—after that they ran away, except one, whom I kept in my grasp, but he afterwards got away—I then gave information to the police—I called out "Police" when they attacked me—I went across to the alley and stopped there; I cannot say how long, whether ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I then went away, found a policeman, and gave him a description of Ford and Dunu—he then took me to a house where I found Ford in bed with his mother—I recognised him as the man—his mother said to the policeman "What are you doing there?" and Ford, who was putting en his boots, said that if she didn't shut up he would put the heels of his b----boots in her mouth—I afterwards went to another house with the policeman and stood on the stairs, when Dunn was brought down—I said he was the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Nelson Street, Woolwich—I am married—on the night of the 6th I was in my house, and about to bolt the door when I heard a woman scream out "Murder!"—I ran up the street and saw a man knocking a woman about—a seafaring man, who was passing, wanted to interfere on her behalf, but she objected to it, and did not want him to interfere with her quarrels—I stood for a few minutes and saw some young fellows in dark clothes—one dressed in skin trousers and waistcoat came and took the man who offered to help the woman by the arm and tried to make him go up the street—they all went up together, and some short time after I heard the man or some one halloo out "Police!"—I cannot say who it was—I could see them there; they were not very far up—I can swear that Callaghan was the man whom they persuaded to go up the street—when I heard the scream I spoke to the young woman and said "You had better send some one up, that man is being murdered," and then I came away—I could not swear to the man's face who came and took the prosecutor up the street—this—was a little after 12.30—it was 12.30 when I left my house—the prosecutor was near a boot shop when the men took him up the street.</p>

I am married, and live in Beresford Street, Wool<lb></lb>gone wich—on the night between Friday, the 6th, and Saturday, the 7th, I had to bed, and was awakened by the cry of "Police!" about 1 o'clock—I got up and looked out at the window—I saw one young man on the pavement, and another had hold of a man's arm, and shortly after the others came up—they knocked him down, and were pushing him along—one held on to his legs, and one across his chest with his hands across his mouth, while the man tried to call "Police!" and a third was leaning across his head, and seemed to be robbing him—I called out to them several times that they were villains, and for the police—the tall young man came away first towards my window, and muttered something—I do not know what; and the second one followed him—I recognise Ford—they went up the street towards the arsenal, the others following—the seafaring man got up and went after. them—it was Callaghan—the affair took place facing my window, and I was near enough to see.</p>

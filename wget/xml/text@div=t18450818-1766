                  </hi>. I belong to the <hi rend="italic">Mary and Margaret</hi> sloop. On the 22nd of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was employed with some other persons to unmoor the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>—I was in the long-boat of the <hi rend="italic">Cul<lb></lb>loden</hi> with three other men from the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>—she was about sixteen feet long—I cannot say what width—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was moored at the upper tier off Horsleydown—I had seen them unmoor the head chain a little before—I was not with them then—I went with them to unmoor the stern chain—we had not got quite to the bend of the chain—we were under the chain getting towards the end—that is the way we usually go to unmoor the chain—while we were doing it a steam-boat passed by—I do not know the name of her—it caused a heavy swell, which filled the boat, and it sank—we were under the chain—the chain was not quite <hi rend="italic">taut</hi> before the steam-boat passed—I do not know whether the swell had any effect on the chain—we were overset, and the boat sank—I hung hold of a waterman's boat, and was saved—the other three men were lost—I have unmoored vessels before, and went to work exactly in the same way as I did on this occasion—I have seen the same steps taken to unmoor vessels as we took—we unmoor the head first, then the stern—I have got under the chain before—I have unmoored vessels in the Thames before in the same way—I cannot say whether any steamer had passed before this.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have seen steam-vessels navigate the river before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—some large steamers are very sharp at the bow—the principal swell is made by the paddle-wheels—it is accord-ing to the breadth of the place—I am a stranger to steamers—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was lying the last but one next the shore on the Surrey-side—I cannot say whether there were six vessels in the tier—I dare say there were four vessels between the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> and the centre of the river—there was room for more than three persons to sit on a seat in the long-boat—she was sixteen feet long—her breadth answered to her length—I do not know how broad she was—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> head was lying down the river—she was not an-chored—there are no anchors put down there—moving the head chain did not bring her head round—she had no room to bring her head round—a rope passed from the bow, and made her fast to the other vessels—the moor-ing chain was not very large—it was the vessel's working chain, her chain cable—she is a brig, a coaster, and was carrying oats from Ireland—a chain lighter is much larger than a long-boat—a chain lighter is not the proper vessel to take up mooring chains—I have seen them used to moor them, but not to unmoor—it is easier to unmoor them with a long-boat than with a lighter—I do not know that it is done to save expense—I never saw any danger in it—the long-boat was not rotten—my captain sent me to help them—we got under the mooring chain with the long-boat—we were hauling at the chain, having got it into the rullock at the stern of the long-boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And as you pulled it, it drew the stern of your boat down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were not doing it so fast as that—the mooring-chain would not press on the stern of the boat—we were not strong enough for that—I cannot tell what length the chain was—we were pulling her fore-and-aft, all four of us, one behind the other—we were not pulling at her as hard as we could—we did</p>

               <p>not break in the stern of the long-boat—it was broken when the swell came, the chain pressed the boat down—the boat by which I was saved was a water-man's skiff—it was about two or three yards from me—I jumped as far as I could, and got into her—the skiff rose to the swell, being loose—she was right astern of us, between us and the next tier—I was not near enough to the skiff to jump into it—I jumped into the water, and reached into the skiff—our boat was going down when I jumped—it sunk down when I was jumping—the head<lb></lb>chain was resting on the stern of the boat at the time—I did not see a Greenwich steamer passing up—I saw the guard-ship of the Custom-house there—I did not see the Custom-house cutter—I have seen many steam-boats pass by before, when we have been rais-ing the chain—the chain was over the bow, and the stern too, when the swell took place, and kept the boat down—it went over the whole length of the boat—the gunwale was twelve or fifteen inches out of the water at both ends.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the effect of the swell on the water-man's skiff after you got on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good deal of the swell was past at that time—the skiff was a good deal affected by it, pitching up and down—I rowed the skiff in—we tried to pick up the other men, but the tide took them under the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the stem-chain, was it nearly level with the surface of the water, or was it higher at one end than the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One end was in the ship, and the other on the ring—it came out of a hole in the ship, higher than the stern—the chain was aslant, not near level—the ring was below the surface of the water more than a fathom—the water did not get into the well of the skiff which I got into—I was more tban five fathoms from the post the ring was fastened to—I could see from four to six feet of the chain out of water from the stern of our boat—I cannot say how far the bow of our boat was from the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>—it was more than four fathoms—the head was towards the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, and the stern towards the ring—I jumped from the seat into the stern of our boat—the water was over the seat at that time—I was above my knees in water then—the other men were then in the boat—I and the mate stood foremost in pulling in the chain—we stood two and two.</p>

On Tues-day morning she was lying in Upper<lb></lb>tier, Horsleydown, close alongside the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, on the south side—I was on board my own vessel—I knew David Davis—I saw him, and Evans, and two others in the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> long-boat, in the act of unmooring the stern chain—I had seen the fore-chain unmoored about a quarter of an hour before, I was down with them, and helped them—they did that safely—I had known the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> long-boat before that time—in my opinion she was big enough and stout enougli for that service—the men appeared to be unmooring the stern chain quite in a proper way, as I should do it—the usual way is to get the chain into the scullage—they were hauling on the stern—they were under<lb></lb>running the chain—the boat was under the chain—they must put her in that position—there is no other way of doing it—as they get the chain in, it passes over the stern of the boat, one end hanging over the bow, and the other over the stern—about a quarter after ten I saw a steam-boat, but did not notice her name—I saw the swell coming from the steam-boat—it was a very heavy swell—it was after the steam-boat—I could not observe at what rate she was travelling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman on the Thames. On the morn-ing of the 22nd of July, about ten o'clock, I was off St. George's-stairs—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> steamer come by—my boat was still at that time—I was in it—the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> did not make a great swell, not more than 1 have seen her make—after she had passed I looked up the river, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> coming down fast, at about twelve miles an hour, I imagine—she produced a very great surf, which caused me to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> from the shore, to take care of the boat and myself—she passed me outside, in the middle of the river—as she passed I saw the boat which was unmoor-ing the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>—she was pressed down in the water by the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> flying ahead, and turning, and her chain pressed her down in the water—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> drove her down—it was an hour and a half before low water—the tide is strong at that time—she was pressed down, and the boat went into the water—the boat threw her ahead, and tightened her chain, and pressed down the boat—the young man who was saved got into a boat—I was in another boat at that time, not in my own—I rowed towards the others, and endeavoured to save them—the swell of the Prince of Wales prevented my going as fast as I could—when I was within about twenty feet of the men the <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> came down, and the chain tightened under my boat—the river is not crowded near Horsleydown-pier—there were six or seven vessels there—I think the speed at which the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was going was not proper, because it causes such heavy swells and jerks to the boats on shore, and damages them—the swell of all the steam boats does that—the swell is in proportion to the speed and size of the boat—it is more necessary to use caution, and to go slowly at this state of the tide, than at other times—the tide itself would drift a boat four or five miles an hour down the river, without working the vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why is it more necessary to use caution an hour before ebb than any other time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the water is lower, and there is not so much room for it to expel itself—the narrower the water the greater the swell—at ebb it would require more caution—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was lying the last vessel but one in the tier, next but one to the shore—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was not above forty feet from the outermost vessel of the tier—those four vessels are about twenty feet each in the beam—I saw the Custom-house cutter—she was lying astern of the tier, on the outermost side—she was about twenty feet wide—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was just about leaving the tier at the time I saw the men sinking—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180171"></xptr>
               <p>was passing the tier—the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> had passed rather more than half a minute—it was the swell caused by the passage of the bow of the vessel through the water which caused the accident, by the effect of the steamer carrying her headway through the river—all the steamers go fast down the river, but sometimes they are forced to ease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A boat getting from London to Black wall in forty minutes would not show the pace she was going through all the voyage, as she would be obliged to ease at times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they would make greater speed when they got below the tier—Evans did not get into my boat—my boat was hanging on to the stern of the barge—it is a wherry—I was about fifty or sixty feet from the long-boat that was raising the chain—the boat the man taved himself in was touching the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat—I was not touching that—he got into the boat by laying hold of her and scrambling into her—he was half in the water—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was moored stern upwards with the previous tide—in my judgment it was the swell the steamer threw forward, when she passed by the tier, that capsised the boat—it lifted the boat forward first, then tightened the chain, and threw her down—this was between London-bridge and Limehouse<lb></lb>reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the swell of <hi rend="italic">the Prince of Wales</hi> made the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> heave ahead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she could have flowed ahead if her head had been moored downwards—the mooring chains gave sufficient play for any vessel to go ahead with any swell—I observed the swell of the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi>—I believe that had no effect on the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, it made so little swell—I did not notice much whether any head was made by that swell—I did not get my boat from the shore then—I did not observe any swell from her at all—I cannot say at what rate she was going down the river—I took very little notice of her—I saw her go pa%t, that was all—she might be going at eight miles an hour at the time she went past—I mean eight miles down the river, including the speed of the tide—the spring-tide goes about four miles an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider it prudent when steam vessels come down the river to get under the chain of a vessel in this way in a boat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen the same thing done with boats before and afterwards—I do not consider it prudent, if they know the boats are coming down—persons acquainted with the river would know the time the steam-boats were to be expected down, and then it would not be prudent to get under the chain—I do not know that there is any part of the day at which steam-boats do not come down the river—I have seen them at all hours, from day-light to dark, one boat or other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working barge-builder—I am a good deal afloat on the river—I have been out of my time twenty-four years, and have been on the river about thirty-five years—on the morning of the 22nd of July I was on shore near St. George's-stairs, repairing a barge, rather above Horsleydown-tier, and not more than fifty or sixty feet from it—I first saw the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat, with four men in her, under<lb></lb>hauling the stern chain—they were doing it as I have seen it done scores of times—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> go down the river—she went at a good speed, from ten to twelve</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180172"></xptr>
               <p>miles an hour—she made a tidy swell—it had the effect of moving the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat, but did no mischief—after the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> had passed I saw the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> come down—I should say she was coming at twelve miles an hour—the tide was an hour or a little more before flood—it runs pretty strong at that time—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> made a very heavy swell—it was caused by the force of her paddle-wheel, I suppose—in coming down, passing the tier, she draws the water off the shore before she comes to the tier, and when she goes by, what she has pulled off the shore comes in again, and that forces the vessels ahead—I observed that she did draw a quantity of water off the shore, the length of twelve or fourteen feet—she made bare the shore, I should say she flooded; and threw up against the piles, as the water returned on the shore—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat laid astern of the tier—a Custom-house cutter was between her and the tier—she was moored head and stern—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat went down by the stern when the back water went on the shore—I should safe it was not safe for a steam-boat at that part of the river, and in that state of the tide, to travel at twelve miles an hour—in my opinion, if the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> had been going only five or six miles an hour, she would not have caused the least injury to anybody—five miles an hour is the proper speed in the Upper Pool.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames-police. On the 22nd of July I was near St. George's-stairs, about a quarter past ten o'clock—I saw some seamen in a ship's boat underrunning a chain, I suppose to cast the chain off—I have been familiar with the river some time—it is the usual mode of unmooring small vessels—this was not above 100 or 110 tons—I never saw it attended with danger before—I have seen it done many times both before and since—it is done by a chain lighter in large vessels—they do it in small vessels to save the expense—it generally costs</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames-police. I was on board the Thames-police cutter, on the 22nd of July, with inspector Mad<lb></lb>dox and another, about fifty or sixty yards from the upper tier, Horsley-down, on the Surrey shore—I saw the four men in the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat underrunning the chain—they had very little of the chain in when I saw them—I have been familiar with the river sixteen or twenty years—what they were doing is what I have usually seen with small vessels, coasting vessels—they underrun the chain, and let it go from the ring—we very often see the boats do it—from what I saw of their boat I should say it was sufficient for such a job—as I put my head round in rowing I saw the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> coming down, just above the Horsleydown tier—it moved the boats off the shore then—she was coming perhaps at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour—it was within an hour of low water, and I believe it was spring-tide—the tide does not run more than four or five miles within an hour of flood—she would not exactly drift at that rate unless there was something to draw her on—if a boat was coming down with the tide at five miles an hour, a power of two or three miles an hour would carry her</p>

               <p>through—to the best of my belief she was coming at the rate of eight or trn miles—when she got opposite the Billy-buoy tier above where the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> lay, the water began to draw off the shore, and after she got by the tier a very heavy swell came in—I could not see whether that swell had any effect on the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat, for I did not see it after that—I saw the swell when she passed the Billy-buoy tier—she drew the water off there, and after she came about there she made a swell—the Billy-buoy tier is above—after passing the tier I heard a cry of "Men overboard"—the draw off of the water had no effect on our boat—we had to keep the oar to keep us dry, to get out into the water further from the shore to get out of her way.</p>

               <p>great—we should have risked our own lives in so doing—we rowed round—we saw three persons in the water—the swell of the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> caused the boat to overturn—if she had been going along at a moderate rate the unmooring might have been safely done—there would have been no danger had she gone at the ordinary speed—eight or ten miles an hour is a speed dangerous to the navigation of the river—there must be great danger from a steamer going at that rate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal harbour-master of the City of London. I have been familiar with the river twenty-six years, and with the mode of navigating steam-boats—I should say eight or ten miles an hour is too great a speed for steam-boats 200 feet long to navigate through the Upper Pool—it requites less speed when going with the tide than against it—they are not so much under control—if the tide is running from four to five miles an hour, I should say a power of three would be quite sufficient to give her steerage-way—the run of the spring-tide, with a favourable wind, hardly exceeds three miles—I know it, because I have tried it with a log—when there is a strong gale down the river, it may run a little stronger—I never heard of its making six—to<lb></lb>day is the first time I ever heard an opinion that the tide runs six miles an hour—if the tide runs at three miles, I should say a power of three more would be employed to make her answer the helm—it depends on the vessel—at times they require more speed to avoid danger—if there is nothing in the way, three miles would be quite sufficient to make her navigable—I have seen considerable space made in the water by sailing vessels, but not so great as by steamers.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I dare say you have seen a boat towing along the Regent's-canal throw the water up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I have been on board steamers—I have taken the helm—not in the Pool—out in clear water—the swell caused by the steam-vessels throws the water on the shore on either side of the wake after they have passed by—that is the principal danger—some of them have heads sharper than a saw—the swell is all abaft the paddle-wheels.</p>

               <p>a notion of their different tonnage—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> going through the water—that certainly makes some commotion particularly at that hour, ten o'clock—the whole Pool is stirred up at ten o'clock, almost like the Bay of Biscay—I certainly do not think it a prudent act for men to place themselves under a chain in this way at the time these vessels are going, because there is a safe mode of doing it by a chain lighter—it is what I would not allow any man to do if I was a master of a ship—the weight of the chain over the boat must weigh it down—the chain lighter is the proper way—we have chain lighters belonging to the Corporation, and always moor vessels with them—if I had been commander of the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, I would not have allowed the men to get under the chain in this way, particularly when steam-boats were passing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, is it consistent with the safety of small boats and people in them that a boat sixteen feet long should be employed to un-moor a mooring-chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have done myself many scores of times—it is certainly safer to employ chain lighters—I unmoored the ves-sel with a chain lighter after the accident, but I under<lb></lb>run the same chain with a small boat afterwards, to get the chain off—that was after flood, not at dead water—the flood was running up, about an hour after the tide was turned—the water would be deeper then than an hour before the tide was turned.</p>

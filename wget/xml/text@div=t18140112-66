            Never to my knowledge. Near eight o'clock I was going out for some tea and sugar, a ring came to the door; a man came in and asked for one of the gentleman's hats; he said he came from the hatters in Cheapside. I called up the house-maid to answer the man; the house-maid came up: I went out. I did not like to go far from the house, for fear my mistress should find me absent, as I was going without her leave. I was absent about three minutes, and when I returned to the door the man was coming out with a parcel under his arm. I asked him, was he a thief, because I saw he had got the great coats and the umbrella I am sure the bundle was not a hat. He knocked me down with an umbrella he took out of the house. When I got up I ran after him; he got out of my sight. There was a great crowd; they got the prisoner; he was taken to the watchhouse. I saw the prisoner at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the watchhouse, did you believe him to be the man that was in the passage - A. I believe he was not the man, only his face was paleish like the man that was in the passage; his face resembled the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a reason to believe he is the man - A. I believe he is not the man; his features resembles the man that knocked me down. I cannot say he is the man.</p>

            . I am house-maid at 21, New North-street. My fellow-servant called me up stairs; I saw the man on the stairs; I asked the man in the passage what gentleman's name was whose hat he wanted; he said he did not know. I went up stairs, and asked what gentleman's hat was wanted, and when I returned the man was gone.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHITEHEAD. I am a watchman; my beat goes from the corner of New North-street. On the 25th of December, about eight o'clock at night, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a great mob coming from Theobald's-road; I ran to them. The prisoner tumbled down; the mob said he was the thief. I laid hold of him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASHLEY. I was constable of the night. I was in the watchhouse when the prisoner was brought in; he was charged on suspicion of stealing two great coats and an umbrella. I asked the prisoner what he had to say; he said he was running with the mob, he knew nothing of the charge. The property was produced by Burdon, another watchman. The prosecutor said the coats were his; the umbrella was his friend's; he did not know that the prisoner took them.</p>

At Devonshire-street there was a mob of people; I was endeavouring to disperse them; a woman came and threw these coats in my arms; she said, take care, there is thieves in the house.</p>

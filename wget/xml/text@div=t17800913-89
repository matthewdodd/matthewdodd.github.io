On Monday the 11th of this instant, I went at dinner to fetch a bottle of wine out of a cellar even with my kitchen; I brought up a bottle; I found I had made a mistake, the cork was wrote on, red wine. Parsons perceiving I had made a mistake, asked if he should go and change it; I said no, I would go myself. I went and brought up another; then I went to Slough on the Thursday following; when I returned, I missed a considerable quantity of wine; I took Parsons into the cellar, and observed that I had not used above five bottles, and there was a decrease of above two dozen. We looked over the wine, and found five bottles of Sherry deficient, and fifteen bottles of Madeira; there was a deficiency<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130087"></xptr> of claret, but I cannot tell the quantity; there was a large quantity of port deficient; I said, George, you cannot have drank this wine since Monday evening; I said I was sure he or Molly had taken it, and I would find it out. He said he knew nothing of it. I examined their boxes, but found none there; I then went down into a vault under the street, and found a bottle of port, with the mouth downwards, and another half full; I said I was clear he knew something of it. He said, no, indeed, he did not; I said I would go and search the hampers in the other vault. He then said if I would go up stairs, he would tell me something; he did not say what. I said, could not he tell me in the vault. He said no, he had rather go up stairs. Going up stairs, I said I supposed there was some in the cock-loft. He said, no, there was none there. I opened the door of my one-pair-of-stairs room, and went in. He then said, Sir, should not you be sorry to hang me? and I should be very sorry to hang Molly. I said, yes, I should be very sorry to hang him, or for him to hang Molly. Then he said that as he was rubbing the table he found a sort of a pick lock key; that he told Molly, and she said she had got a smith to pick the lock of the Pembroke table, where I keep all my keys, and had a key made to it; I went and fetched Mr. Bond, and he examined them both; he then told the same story. She then said, George, how can you be such a villain, did not you hide yourself in the area while the smith attempted to pick the cellar lock? He said, no, he knew nothing about it. Then she said, he told her that he could not pick it, nor all the people in the kingdom. She said, that then she got the smith to pick the lock of the Pembroke table, and to make a key to it, which they always used, and all my other keys. I had a dozen of keys lay there; I always carried the key of that drawer in my pocket; by means of this key they could get at the key of the cellar, and open it at their pleasure. She told me they had given two bottles of wine to the milk-woman; the milk-woman was sent to, and she brought the two bottles of wine to my house; she said she had given three bottles to a

             in Queen-street, Great Russel-street; I sent my man for her; she denied knowing any thing of it; I went and searched her room, and found seven or eight bottles, one with a cork marked, wine bottoms, that I can swear to; when I came back, she said, George, you have given your brother a great deal of wine, there is wine there. He said he had done no such thing, that she had given it to his brother. She said, you know, George, two of your brothers were here on Monday, and a friend of mine, and we drank about six bottles of wine made into negus, that was while I was out of town. He said they had not drank so much wine as six bottles; she said one of his brothers had a bottle of white, and a bottle of red wine home with him, and she gave her own friend another bottle. He went with me to his brothers. I said, you have got a key of George's box, I insist on having the key; I got the key, and examined the box, and found a pint bottle and a phial full of brandy.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises, or threaten her to induce her to make this confession? - No; I always had an high opinion of the boy, Parsons; the smith said he never saw him when he was there.</p>

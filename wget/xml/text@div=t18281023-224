On the 11th of September I had a basket, which contained these articles; I met the prisoner in the White Horse public-house, Chiswell-street, about twelve o'clock in the day, I had been having some bread and cheese - he came in with his wife and an old man, who he called his father - he asked me to have a glass of ale, which I refused at first, but afterwards took; his wife went out and got some meat - I had some of it and gave them some cheese- we drank together; his wife went out and brought in change for a 5l. note - I played at skittles with him; then we went to another public-house in Bunhill-row, and took me down to a dark place - I saw the woman put her hand into my basket; we all went into <placeName id="t18281023-224-crimeloc1310">Old-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. As soon as you called him, he stopped with the basket? Q. Yes - he had got about six yards: we went to four public-houses - I drank a quartern of brandy at each house; the prisoner was not tipsy - he knew what he was about.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in Goswell-street; the prosecutor's nose was bleeding - he went to Worship-street; we had been to Hatton-garden by mistake, and therefore the basket was given up to the prisoner.</p>

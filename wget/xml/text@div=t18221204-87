I have known the prisoner a year and a half; I used to see him at the Globe coffee-shop, Beech-street, and at the St. John's, Cowcross-street. In August last he made an application to me, which I communicated to the police, and by their instructions I met him at the Globe coffee-shop on Monday evening, the 9th of October. I met him on several other occasions, and always with the knowledge of the police. On Friday afternoon, the 18th of October, about two o'clock, I met him at the St. John's, Cowcross-street, to receive the remainder of some money I had received the day before, two counterfeit half crowns and a shilling. I was to pay 10 d. for the half crowns, and 4 d. for the shilling. I met him on Friday to receive a half crown and a shilling more. I had given him 3 s. 6 d. on the Tuesday, to supply me with as much as that would produce at the rate I mentioned; three half crowns and two shillings were to be given me for 3 s. He then owed me 4 d. I had met him on Thursday and Friday to receive counterfeit money for the 3 s. 6 d. which I gave him on Tuesday. It was marked money, given to me by Armstrong. I gave the counterfeit money I received of him to Attfield, but what I received on the 18th I gave to Armstrong. He did not give me the 4 d., as he had not got it, and said the next purchase I made he should want 3 d. for the stuff to do the money over with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STIRLING. Q. You was not present when he was searched - A. No. I am a smith by trade, and now work for one Burt. The prisoner asked me to buy counterfeit money. I occasionally get jobs for myself. I never informed against people. I got money from the officers to buy the counterfeit money. I believe I have had about 22 s. from them besides, for loss of time. This is the only transaction I had with the police. My reason for informing of him was, because he asked me to go out with him several times, and afterwards asked me to buy money.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Being out of employ, he asked you to pass had money with him - A. Yes. I refused, and thought it my duty to inform.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have heard Eyles's account, it is correct. He first gave me information on the 8th or 9th of October. I informed the solicitor of the Mint, and supplied him with money from time to time to purchase counterfeit coin. On the 10th of October I supplied him with 3 s. 6 d. to purchase, and 2 s. 6 d. for himself to spend. I marked the 3 s. 6 d. so as to know it again. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23 d. Eyles had given three half crowns, and 2 s., on the 18th of October, all counterfeit. I gave him two marked shillings on the 23d of October, at night, (about two hours before I took the prisoner). I told Vann to go to St John's Coffee-shop to watch, and after waiting some time, I saw the prisoner and Eyles, and another man, come out together. I followed them up a court; Eyles and the prisoner were talking together. I followed them to the Queen's Head public-house, where I had stationed Attfield. I secured the prisoner, and took him into that house. Vann junior was with me. I said I must take him for uttering bad money to the carroly man who had just left him, he denied it, saying, he never sold any in all his life, that he had all good money about him. In his right-hand breeches pocket I found a purse, containing five or six shillings of good money - it was not the silver I had marked. In the same pocket, I found two loose shillings, which he said he had had some time, I found that it was the money I had marked and given that night to Eyles. I said that very money had been in my possession not an hour ago, and he said,</p>


               <p>"Lord bless me! the man who was walking with me must have put it into my pocket." I have kept the 2 s. ever since, I gave Attfield the counterfeit money I received from Eyles on the 18th; I could not take him on the 18 h, as it was very rainy, and I did not see him come out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say how the two marked shillings got into his pocket - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did he say he had but five shillings and not seven shillings - A. No. The purse and the two shillings were in sight when I asked how long he had it; he could not avoid seeing them; he was much agitated at the time.</p>

            . My father is an officer. On the 23d of October, Armstrong gave me information, and I went to St. John's coffee-shop, in Cow Cross-street, and saw the prisoner standing in the coffee-room. Eyles was sitting down, and I sat directly opposite him, about four yards from the prisoner, who was talking with Eyles for about ten minutes, and they appeared well acquainted. I heard the prisoner say he could not get them without - but I could not hear the rest of the sentence. Eyles gave him a paper over the settle; he took it and put it into his pocket. In about five minutes I came out and went to the Queen's Head, at the corner of St. John's-lane, where I saw Attfield, and I told him the prisoner had received a paper from Eyles. At that moment the prisoner came by, and Armstrong was behind him. Another man besides Eyles was with him. Armstrong then took him into the Queen's Head. I held his hand while Armstrong searched him; his account is correct. I saw Armstrong give Eyles the two shillings about an hour before he went to the house.</p>

            . I am assistant to the solicitors of the Mint, and have been so thirty-two years. The three half-crowns are counterfeit, and of the same die; the two shillings are also counterfeit, and from the same die; they are merely washed, and have not been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The charge is totally false. I never had any dealing with the witness, and only know him by seeing him at the coffee-shop, where I went to look at the advertisements for a situation. The man came and sat down by me; he had been drinking, and said some friends had been treating him, which I suppose was the officers. I came out in a quarter of an hour, and was followed by him. I was seized and taken into a house. The officers asked what money I had, and took out my purse, containing 8 s. 6 d., and at the same time he had 2 s. in his hand. I said the money and papers belonged to me, and I did not know I had more than was in my purse, and if it was in my pocket it must have been put in. I received this man in the light of a friend at first, but find him a villain. Under all the circumstances, what credit can you attach to such a man.</p>

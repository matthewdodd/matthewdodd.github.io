               <p>Did you know Wilson before? - I never saw him before to my knowledge; when these men had passed me, I said to the watchman, these are the men, it is necessary we should follow them; I said, you follow them that way; I will go round and get some more watchmen; I went round by Saint Thomas's square; I heard the rattles, and ran after them, and just about a quarter of a mile I could see them; I made up to the man with the rattle, and we pursued them, and came up with some men at Kingsland, but I could not say they were the same; there we had information of them; I saw them at the back of Pigwell-field; we heard they were gone to Newington-green; I pursued them till we came to Clerkenwell; when we came into the street, I went into a house and saw Collins; these two men were taken about half after six; I was not present; I saw Wilson after he was taken at the publick-house; I am quite sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>How was he? - He seemed very much fatigued with his journey, and very much dirtied with running across the fields; he seemed all of a sweat; I know nothing of the other prisoners.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of March, about a quarter after six in the morning, I heard the cry of stop thief; I was just gone into my counting-house, and I opened my garden door, and I saw the man in the blue coat, Wilson, in company with another in a brown coat, run by me close; there were another or two in pursuit of them seemingly; they run down the ruins down a hill; in going along, the man in the brown coat, in company with the man in the blue coat, threw some things over the charter-house-wall at twice, which he took out of his pocket, and they appeared to me to look like silver, but to be sure I could not tell; I was afraid to stop them, though I believe I could have taken the man in the brown coat, Robinson, at my parlour window; it was the other that is not here that I saw throw the things over the wall; the prisoner was carried to a publick house; I told the patrol I was sure that one of them threw some things over the wall.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the man in the blue coat was in company with the man that threw the things over the Charter-house-wall? - Yes, and they had both boots on, and seemed very dirty with country mud.</p>

               <p>I am gardener to the Charter-house; I searched the garden on the 15th, and found nothing; the day after I found three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180037"></xptr>tops of crewets, a pair of salt spoons and two odd tea-spoons; I found them in the lower part of the garden, near Saint John's-street; I took them to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Neave. To the best of my recollection, I suppose it might be about a dozen yards from Wilderness-row; that is the place within a yard or two, where I saw the man throw over the things.</p>

               <p>I was waiting for the time to get into my mistress's garden, and while I was waiting, the two prisoners and two more men came past; I never lost them out of my sight for above a minute, till they were taken; I pursued them, and I asked the man if he was able to run any further; he said, he could not go any further; I run down to the City-gardens, and at the bottom of the City-gardens, I got sight of them again, and I called out stop thief, and I pursued, and came to them in about a minute and half, or a couple of minutes, after they were stopped, the man in the white coat, Robinson, was stopped first; I left him, and I met a man that had hold of Wilson; he delivered him to me; I examined Wilson, and I took this wrench and the stock of a center bit out of his pocket; his boots were all over dirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Robinson. When you was at the Justice's, did not you say you did not know me? - Both of them are the same men that I pursued all the way across the fields, down to the City-gardens, and across the dead part of the wall, while I went into Red Lyon-street.</p>

               <p>I went to this Lady's house, and compared the crow to Mrs. Combrune's garden gate, and it fitted the part that had been broke, the wood work was broke and dented in very much, and this fitted; and I tried it likewise to the back parlour window, and the large end fitted the window exactly; at the small end withinside the parlour, is a brass lock, and an impression had been made to force off the lock; and the small end fits in the brass work of the lock; every part that was forced, one part or the other fitted.</p>
               <p>It is not a common crow, I believe? - It is what is commonly made use of in that business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. I know nothing at all of the affair; I found some things going through Islington; I know nothing of this young man, nor he of me.</p>

               <p>I was running in the streets, and these people stopped me; I run with others; I said, I was going about my business; they took me to the publick house, and brought this young man to me; I never saw him before; we were cleared of the robbery before the Justice, that we were.</p>
               <p>When were these men committed? - They were committed the 15th, but our evidence was not compleat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 20th of October, about half-past seven o'clock at night, I was in Vine-street, Chandos-street, with another man, and saw Cowley behind the counter of an iron shop - there was a woman in the shop; she gave Cowley a cloth; he shook this metal out of it, and put it under the counter. I was looking through the window. I went in, and asked what he had got from that woman - he said, Nothing. I said I was sure he had, for I saw it, and shewed him my staff - he then handed two or three gas-pipes from under the counter. I said they were not all, I was sure; he then gave me seven cocks and a tube from under the counter, where I had seen him put them - I asked if they were all - he said Yes, they were all he had received; that it weighed 3 lbs., and he had given 1 s. 6 d. for it. I cannot say whether he had paid the woman any money, as I turned my head to call Godfrey. I took the things into my possession, and gave the woman in charge of Gray, and went with her to the White Horse, public-house, St. Martin's-lane - I saw Winstanley there; Gray shewed him one of the cocks, and asked if he had sent his wife to sell anything; he said he had; that he worked for the Gaslight Company, and had picked them up by a little at a time. They weigh 3 lbs., and are worth 1 s. 6 d.</p>

            . Winstanley's wife was given into my charge. I took her to the White Horse, and produced the cocks to the prisoner; he said he gave them to her to sell; that he worked for the Gas-light Company, and picked them up about the premises, but previous to that I took him and his wife to Cowley's, and asked him if he bought that metal of the woman, and produced it to him; he said he had bought the cocks, which weighed 3 lbs., and gave her 1 s. 6 d. for them, but did not own to the pipes. He promised to appear next day, but did not. I went to his house, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He told you he had sent a message to the office - A. No, he said I never told him to come.</p>

            . I am store-keeper to the Company. Winstanley was employed as a labourer. About the 19th of October, I ordered him to clear out a room at the Horseferry-road station; I had put three dozen old cocks into a drawer there, the week before; he had access to them. Upon hearing this charge, I missed ten - here are seven of the same description. I have no doubt of their being the Company's property, and here is a burner I know well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are men they call fitters-up - A. Yes; they work for anybody, and take away old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220043"></xptr>materials. It is not unusual to find such things in old iron shops. I only know the cocks by their general appearance, but this burner I am sure was in the room a week before.</p>

               <p>WINSTANLEY's Defence. I have been seven years in the service, and two years ago, I was at work in the street with the fitters-up, and have had some of these things ever since.</p>
               <p>COWLEY's Defence. I considered it nothing but old metal. The woman said her husband picked it up among some rubbish - I gave her 6 d. a pound, which is the full value.</p>

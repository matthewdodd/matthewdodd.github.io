I live at 16, New Cavendish Street, Marylebone—on Saturday night, 13th September, between 10. 30 and 11 o'clock, I shut and locked the inner counting-house door—I had a quantity of plate there in an iron chest, which I had seen safe a day or two before—I returned at 9.30 on Sunday morning, and found the inner counting-house door broken, and the place in perfect confusion; the iron safe broken open, both drawers in it broken open, and the contents thrown about—the entry had been effected by a window which was broken—I cannot say whether it was closed when I left on Saturday—the inner counting-house door was split by a chisel—I missed two dozen silver forks, thirty-two spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, a sauce ladle, a gravy spoon, butter knife, a silver ladle, a plated silver fish slice, a silver dredger, a pair of nut-crackers, fourteen knives, fourteen forks, eighteen hatbands, a coat, a waistcoat, a knife, and a walking-stick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Williams's Defence.</hi> I received this plate and other articles from a per<lb></lb>son named Jones, about 15th September. He told me that he received them at Doncaster races, and that if I would keep them safe for a week he would make me a present of the coat which they were wrapped in. I put the coat on, and made a small parcel of the other things, put them in a bag and left it at the Feathers. I called for it next morning, and the landlord said he had given it to the police. I could not get any information about Jones. I met Evans, and was going with her to the Feathers to ask what I had better do, and the policeman took me in charge. If I had known them to be stolen I had the whole of Wednesday to escape. I had been wearing the coat for three days in the neighbourhood where it was stolen.</p>

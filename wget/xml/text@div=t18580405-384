                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of No. 10, Whitmore Street, Hoxton Old Town. On Saturday, 20th March, I was on Dyer's Hall Pier, and the prisoner came up and asked me if I had got my watch all right; I said, "Yes, thank you"—he pressed against my left breast, and I saw my watch in his hand—I was so <hi rend="italic">stagnated</hi> that I had not the presence of mind to lay hold of him—my chain went with my watch—the prisoner was stopped—I am certain he is the boy—the officer produced my watch to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a railway guard. I saw the prisoner running in Thames Street, followed him, and caught him—he asked me to let him go, but I gave him in charge—the prosecutor came up a minute or two afterwards, and said that the prisoner was the man that had got his watch.</p>

I have known Kemp six years; about the 1st of August last I employed him to assist me in the sale of some pictures - I went to Bristol with him, and took the paintings with us; after being there some time I had occasion to come to town, and left him there with them - he went to Weymouth, Exeter, and Southampton, then returned to London, and delivered me forty-three paintings, at the Gerrard's-hall, Basing-lane, about the middle of October; they were Flemish and Dutch paintings chiefly - he said, "There they are for you, safe and sound;" I said they were not sound, for one was badly packed - I went to Gerrard's-hall on the Tuesday, and cleaned it - they were all there then: on the Sunday following I went to Gerrard's-hall, and they were gone; I found them next day, the 29th of October, at Mr. Smart's, Titchbourne-street - I did not then know Malcolm; I went and saw him at Greenwood's, a map-seller, in Regent-street - I then went to a Police-man, called on Malcolm, and asked him about my pictures: he said he had them in his possession, and I might do my best - I asked where they were; he would not tell me - he said he got them from Kemp, and had given him 80l. for them; and that I might go to law to recover them; I said I would get a warrant to apprehend him - he said that was not the way, that I should go regularly to law: the pictures are now in the officer's possession - they are invoiced to me at 457l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you ever advertise in the Times for a situation as lithographer? A. Yes; I never proposed to Kemp to go to Dublin and set up as a surveyor and architect - he made such a proposition to me seven years ago: when we went to Bristol our agreement was that I was to give him one third of the profits on pictures he sold: they were mine - they were sent to me by Cune and Marniffe, at a certain price; they have often drawn bills on me for pictures before I sold them - they sent me some on commission, and some at a certain price; these were sent at a price - I was to have all I could get above that sum, and agreed to give Kemp one third of that profit on what he sold; we travelled together - I never heard of his pawning his watch to keep me from starving, or a double-barrelled gun; I heard of a gun being parted with - I did not get the money; I received 20l. from him when he sent me an account of pictures sold - I do not know who had the delivery-ticket for the pictures, or whether there was one: I was not told there was one, and I could not have them without it - the prisoner had brought them from Southampton; he did not tell me there was a delivery-ticket - I told the people at Gerrard's-hall they were to remain there a few days.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not Kemp a claim on you for 79l. and upwards? A.After Malcolm was arrested he made that claim, but never before - he has paid me 54l. 2s. 8d., on account of pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not produced an account of a payment of 54l. 2s. 8d. by Kemp, and yourself of 61l. 4s.? A. I do not recollect the items; I have given the account that was settled by Kemp - I have got 31l. 10s. above the invoice price on a picture, but, calculating the expences, there was no profit - ten guineas of that was Kemp's property, but the expences were to be borne equally by us; he was only to have a share in the profit on what he sold - I told him I was not obliged to pay Cune and Co. for them, till I had sold them, and that I was at liberty to return them: I never said, if sold at less than the invoice they reduced them -Kemp participated in the difference between the invoice price and what they sold at; they were consigned to me by them - I told Kemp I had sold a pair of pictures for 35l. which were marked at 15l. I frequently go to the Shades, in Westminster-road; so does Kemp - we have met there a dozen times, I dare say; I never took my invoices there, and could not have shown them to him there- he has had them in his possession; he was to have one third of the profits - he was engaged as my agent or servant, and I was the agent of Cune and Co.; the pictures left in Kemp's custody, were what he was to sell- he told me he was in the habit of canvassing for Greenwood and Co. at Bristol, which induced me to employ him; it was never proposed to allow him one half the profits - I got a 45l. bill discounted with Mr. Tenant; it was not that money that took me to Bristol; I received it about a week before I went, and left it in town - Kemp paid the expences down and at Bristol; but he kept an account of it, and the expences were to be divided; it was done with my money, but his hand paid it - it was not his money; I gave him money as soon as we got to Bristol - he was to pay one half.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not pay 20l., out of his own pocket, towards a bill of 80l., drawn by Cune and Co., that was dishonoured? A. Yes, when he came to London - it was not dishonoured; I had received 60l. at Bristol - he said he wanted to come up to see his wife and children, that he had a 20l. bill in London, which his friend Malcolm would discount, and he would advance the 20l.; I had only three day's notice of the bill - I did not tell him if he could not advance the 20l. they would send no more pictures, for I knew they would; I had 400l. coming due in a very few days - I never had an execution in my house; I never produced a letter to him stating that there was.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The pictures were consigned to you, and were your exclusive property? A. They were: he had not the least title to them - he was not at all responsible for the payment of them to the consignees; he sent me an account of money due to him, three days after Malcolm was taken - here is an account I settled with him before Malcolm was taken; it is the final settlement, when he came to town, and by this he makes himself a debtor to me of 8l. 15s. 9d., and adds 3l. odd for expences, making 15l. - that is his settlement, in his own writing; I then discharged him; I paid him the 20l. he advanced - I never intimated that he was to consider himself my partner; he had no authority from me to do any thing with the pictures, after delivering them at Gerrard's-hall.</p>

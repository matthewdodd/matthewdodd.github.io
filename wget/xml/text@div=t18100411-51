On Saturday, the 10th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to the hair dresser in Essex-street, Whitechapel, with intent of having my hair cut, and finding the house full, I went to the Catherine Wheel public-house and called for a pint of beer; the prisoner brought me a pint of beer; I thought her to be a servant in the house, but she did not prove to be so; she sat down by the side of me; we had a little conversation together. She then persuaded me to go over the way with her, I told her if she went out first I would follow her; she went out and in about five minutes I followed her out, she stood opposite of the house; we went up the court into a house, we were together in the house about ten minutes and then I missed my watch; I charged her with taking it, she denied it; she stripped, and nothing was found. Two watchmen came in, and the watch was found up the chimney. There was no one in the room to take the watch but her.</p>

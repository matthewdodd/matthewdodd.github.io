                  </hi>. I am a carrier. On 18th Nov., about a quarter to 6 o'clock in the evening, I left the premises of Mr. Warren, in Jewin-street, with my horse and cart; I had to call and take up some fenders at Mr. Hoole's, in Aldermanbury, for which purpose I took out two coppers which were in my cart, and put them on the ground; I afterwards put them over the fenders in the cart—when I got about half way up Aldermanbury Pos tern, I was walking at the side of my horse, and heard a ringing sound such as copper would make, proceeding from the back of my cart; I looked round, missed the coppers, and saw the prisoner about twenty-five yards <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, walking along the pavement with them under his right arm—I called out, "Stop thief!" and he put them on the pavement, and ran on as hard as he possibly could!; he turned to the left down London-wall, and kept running in the road—I did not lose sight of him till he was taken—I picked up the coppers, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the gas lights were burning, and I had the opportunity of seeing him—I only saw his back when he was running.</p>

On 18th Nov., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in London-wall—as I came out of Old Basinghall-street, into New Basinghall-street, I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running in London-wall, from Aldermanbury-postern, about forty yards from it—I took him into custody, and took him back to where I heard the cry, which was about sixty yards—there was nobody else running—Lacey was there, and said, "If you are the man who I saw running, and was stopped by the policeman, you are the man who stole my coppers; because I did not lose sight of you till you were stopped by the police."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer and lodging house keeper; I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction thirteen years ago next February—I was then a policeman, and took him into custody; it was for stealing nine yards and three quarters of cloth from a cart in Basinghall-street—he pleaded Guilty, and was sentenced to be transported for fourteen years—by the time of his coming back I was out of the police—I did not see him from his conviction till I saw him at Guildhall for this offence—when I had him in custody he went by the name of Henry Daniels; the party who drove the cart on that occasion has gone to Australia, but I had the prisoner in my custody four or five days; he was put back to the Computer, and was afterwards taken to Guildhall again, and committed—since I was a policeman I have been carrying on a boarding house, and have been a greengrocer.</p>

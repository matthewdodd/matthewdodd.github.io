               <p>I am a police-officer; (produces a box of soap); I found it at the prisoner's lodgings in Dog-row, Bethnal-green, on the 10th of this month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. The box was not locked? - A. No; it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor.) Q. Look at that box; you had such quantities that you could not miss it, I suppose? - A. We missed a very considerable quantity; here is one piece that I can swear most unequivocally to, because it is misboiled; it is not the article it was intended to be; we have a part of the same boiling in the house now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are in a very large way, and boil a very large quantity together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The misboiling must have been to a very considerable extent? - A. I suppose 2500lbs.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep some person I suppose for the purpose of sending out those particular articles; you don't send them out yourself? - A. I don't.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140103"></xptr>Q. You cannot say that this was not sent out by any body else? - A. No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore such soap might have come into the world in an honest way? - A. I cannot but admit your argument,</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith.) Look at that examination? - A. It was taken at our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write his name? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw him write it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith.) Did you hear this read over to the prisoner? - A. Yes; he made no objection to signing it.</p>
               <p>The examination and voluntary confession of William Freggleton read.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Smith.) Q. Was there any inducement held out to the prisoner to confess? - A. No; the magistrate cautioned him against it, and told him it might be brought in evidence against him; and that he would not persuade him to make a consession; if he chose to do it voluntarily, the clerk might take it down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My master used to make exceeding good weight, and when I have carried quantities of soap home, the over weight I have brought home to my own house; but I never took a piece off my master's premises.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

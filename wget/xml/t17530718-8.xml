               <p>J. Gilling. Yes, he was; he ran down a lane, and went a-cross two fields, and instead of going the right way to the church, he went down a little lane ; when we came up with him he turn'd upon us, and said something, but what it was I cannot say; then he drew a pistol out, and said something about shooting. (The pistol produc'd in court, it was a long horseman's pistol). Then he made off; I said here is four of us, let us take up stones and go after him again, for sure four of us with stones is a match for one with a pistol. We did, and run after him down Salmon's-lane, and there is a little lane that leads to Rogue's-well, just by there we took him.</p>

            . I had been at work upon a ship lying off the Tower, and was going home to Limeho use-hole ; coming down the lane that leads to Limehouse church, we heard some people cry, Stop thief ! I said, I had a good mind to run after them; I did, and I met a man on horseback, and people said, He is the man; I stopt him, and said you are the man; he said no, that is the man, pointing with his finger to the prisoner. I ran after him, and just as I got to him, he pull'd out a pistol, and said he would shoot me, if I did not turn round ; I stoop'd myself to the ground, thinking he then would shoot over my head, but he made off; then I got up again, and went after him, and threw him down over a bank, and took the pistol out of his hand.</p>

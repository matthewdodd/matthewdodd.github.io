                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, South-place, Finsbury, and am a silk manufacturer; there are two houses adjoining each other; I reside in one, and the business is carried on in the other; there is a communication internally. On Friday night, 13th April, I examined the premises—they were all closed up and fastened—next morning my man sent a message, and I went and found the next house in confusion—the door of the weavers' entrance was unfastened, and three other doors opened—the top room was kept open by a stool, it was never locked—the two rooms had been entered by a centre bit from the inside—a person could get to the inside from the window which opens on to the parapet—that window was open—the next house but one was unoccupied at that time—persons could get to the roof of the unoccupied house, there is a parapet five feet nine inches wide from the window of my house—there were footmarks in the gutter, and some tow which had dropped off the thieves' feet—there were footmarks in the warpers' room—the door of the warehouse had been broken open, the drawers opened, and 130 dozen scarfs and 100 or 200 lbs. weight of silk missing, amounting to between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed from the warehouse a canvas bag, containing waste—I had seen it the night before—it was partly filled—the contents had been turned out on to the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, employed by the last witness. On Friday, 13th April, I left at a quarter to 9 o'clock at night, leaving the premises fast—I went up to the weavers' and warpers' rooms, the windows were fastened down, and the door of the winders' room was double locked—I came in next morning about 7 o'clock, by the house entrance—I first went to the ware-house,</p>

               <p>the door communicating with the house was locked; I went inside, and found the drawers open, and the lobby door, where the work people are served, open—there was a bundle of scarfs, and pieces of velvet were lying about—the lock of the street door had been picked, and opened from the inside—the first door of the winders' room had not been touched, but in the top winders' shop the lock had been cut out from the inside—in the warpers' room, I found the window open—I went and told Mr. Phillips, and he came in with me.</p>

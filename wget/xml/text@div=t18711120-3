I did not authorise the prisoner to sign the name of the firm at the back of this cheque; it was not done with our authority—I communicated with Mr. Shrewsbury with reference to his account, and received an answer from him—in consequence of which I wrote to the prisoner, and received from him this answer—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th, August</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">and stated that he had forwarded the amount of shrewsbury's account with other turns, in Sank of England notes for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the numbers and dates of which he gave</hi>)—We did receive two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes about that time for a Mr. Ladkins' account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never told the prisoner not to endorse cheques—we did not take any means to trace the Bank of England notes he mentioned, because we did not believe his statement—this 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was included in the amount, for which we asked for a bill of sale—the idea of forgery did not occur after we had seen our solicitor—I sent cheques to the bank by my clerks—I have not sent cheques not endorsed by me which they have en<lb></lb>dorsed—Mr. Becker, my partner, is not residing here—a Mr. Rummell has his procuration to sign cheques.</p>

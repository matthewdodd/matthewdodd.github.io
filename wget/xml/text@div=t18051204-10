We drank half a pint of gin together; when I was at the play house, after setting there a little while, I fell asleep, when I awoke I felt my watch was gone, and the girl was gone away; I went out to look for her, but could not find her, I went up to the play house again; I asked the young man that was sitting there if he would go with me in pursuit of the prisoner; me went into several public houses; at last we found her in a public house at eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch again? - A. Yes. As soon as I came into the public house, I asked the girl for the watch, and she then went out, I went out after her, and told her that she should give it me; she told me that she had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in liquor? - A. I was a little so.</p>
               <p>Q. You was so much so that you fell fast asleep? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I was sitting in the seat behind this young man in the sixpenny gallery of the Royalty Theatre; I saw the prisoner's face at the play-house, the prosecutor laid fast asleep in the prisoner's lap; I knew her again when we saw her again at the public house, she there put her hand on the bench where she sat, and the sailor that sat on the same bench opposite to her, took the watch from her and put it in his left hand pocket; she asked me what I wanted with her husband; when I spoke to her about the watch, I said I wanted nothing with her husband; she seized me by the collar, and the sailor that had the watch then says, come along with me to the Blue Anchor. He took the watch then from out of his left hand pocket and put it under his arm-pit; I then said, here is the watch, give it to the young man; when they came to the corner of Well-street, he put his hand to the waistband of his breeches, and took out the watch and gave it again to the prisoner. I said the woman had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040015"></xptr>got the watch; a great many people came up, the prisoner denied having the watch, the officer who was standing by, said he would search her, at last she put her right hand into her pocket and gave the watch to the watchman, and the watchman gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am headborough of Whitechapel; I heard them opposite to my own door; I went out and asked them what was the matter; the sailor said that the woman had got his watch; she denied it; I said if you do not give it up I will search you; she put her hand into her pocket, and gave it to the watchman, and he gave it to me. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>(The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He treated me to the play; after I got to the play-house, he gave me his watch to take care of; he said take care of it till I awake; he laid his head down on my lap, and his hat fell down; I picked up his hat; after that I put his head in my lap again. A man asked me to go round and have some drink; I went, and in the mean while I went out to drink he charged me with his watch.</p>

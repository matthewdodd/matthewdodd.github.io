Pearce came for a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loaf, about 9 o'clock in the evening; I served him—he gave me a coin resembling a shilling, I told him it was bad, and asked him where he got it; he said, "From a gentleman, for carrying a parcel"—a constable was present, but I declined to give him in charge, as he turned out his pockets, and had no more bad money—I marked the shilling, kept it till next day, and gave it to sergeant Lee—I did not see Scott.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Cock and Magpie. My wife, who was in the bar, gave me a bad shilling, about 5 minutes past 10 o'clock, and said, in the presence of Scott, who was there, that he had given it to her for a screw of tobacco, and half a pint of beer—I asked him where he got it, he said that a gentleman gave it to him—I asked him if he had been to Westminster or Holborn lately, he said that he had been to West<lb></lb>minster once with his father—I said that I should keep the shilling, and if he did not like that, to go out and meet a policeman, and I would give him the shilling—I saw a policeman about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards, and gave it to him.</p>

On 16th Feb., about half past 10 o'clock at night, Pearce came for half a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco—he gave me a bad shilling—I opened the door to look for a policeman, saw sergeant Neave at the door, he came in, and I gave him into custody with the shilling, which I marked—going to the station, Scott came up to me, and said, "What has that young man been doing?" I appeared to know nothing about it; the officer spoke to him, and I gave him in charge.</p>

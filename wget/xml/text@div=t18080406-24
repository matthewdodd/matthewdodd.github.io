            . On the 27th of September the prisoner came to my father's shop in the name of Mr. Wild of Enfield; he said he wanted fifteen pound of pickled pork.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pork taken from you. - A. Yes, my father cut him fifteen pound of pickled pork; he told my father that I was to take it along with him into Bishopsgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your father consent that you should take it to Bishopsgate street. - A. Yes, I took it in the tray; he said my father should give change for a pound note; the price of the pork came to twelve shillings and sixpence; the change was seven shillings and sixpence; he said the cook should pay me; he took me into a shop and gave me a twopenny bologna sausage; then he went on further to a public house and called for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060016"></xptr>quartern of anniseed; he gave me one glass, then he went into Shoreditch and up a court, and told me to wait till he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at that time taken the pork from you. - A. He was taking the pork from my shoulder, I told him he must not take it, I must go with him; he said he must take it or else they would think he was drunk; he took it from me, carried it up the court, I followed him, he let it fall in the mud, then I took it again; he took me further up some other courts and down a street, and came into Shoreditch again; then he went down a court with bushes in it; I held him and cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the pork from you. - A. Yes, in this court. I asked him to go into a public house and buy a penny candle; I got him into the public house and then he took the pork away again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never lost it. - A. No, I got the pork again; I took it off his shoulder when he was standing in the public house to get the candle; I went out of doors, he wanted to swindle me out of the pork and the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer you the one pound note or the change. - A. No. I cried outside of the door, and at last a gentleman came up to me. I told him what was the matter; a watchman was going by, I gave charge of him. He never offered me the seven and sixpence; he told my father he bought the pork for his master.</p>
               <p>- HILLIARD. On the 27th of February, I was coming home, near one in the morning. Going along Bethnall green road, where I live this boy, was standing just by the turnpike, he was crying. I asked him what was the matter, the boy told me this man had been buying some meat of his father, and he had got seven shillings and sixpence change; the boy got the meat, and he said he could not get the change from him, and he said he must not go home without the change; when I saw how the business was, I said you had better give charge of Elam. The only complaint that he made was not paying the one pound note, or returning him the change; he did not charge him with stealing the meat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live in White's gardens, Bethnall green road; I brought the lad there with the meat, I asked his father to give him the change, not to give it to me; he said it made no odds which of us had it; when he came to this place it was dark, he did not like to go down; I had no intention of taking it from him; I sent in no name; he asked me if I knew Mr. Wild of Enfield, I said I did.</p>

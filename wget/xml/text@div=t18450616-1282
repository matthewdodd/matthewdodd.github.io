On Sunday morning, the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the White Hart, at Ponder's-end, in the road coming to London—he had something under his flannel jacket—I walked with him a short distance, and then I asked what he had under his jacket—he said, "A fat hen"—I took hold of him, and found the fowl he had was warm—he said he bought it at Royston—I took him to the station, and found this knife and two brushes on him.</p>

On 11th June I was on duty in the Poultry, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and met Wilson coming towards the Mansion-house—a lady was walking just in front of me; Wilson looked at her dress, turned round suddenly and followed her through the Poultry towards Cheapeide—she went to her right side, pressed close against her, and left her—in a few minutes she was joined by Thorn, and they both went up Cheapside—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">here stated that Wilson wished to plead guilty</hi>)—they passed up and down Cheapside several times—Wilson went on one side of several ladies and left them, and then they spoke together and went away again; they then went into St. Pauls-church-yard together, and Wilson went to Mr. Williams' right side—I saw Wilson's shawl project on this side, she pressed up against her for a second and Thorn was close to her—I was not above a yard from her—they then suddenly left the lady, and both walked together towards Ludgate-hill—I followed them; they got about 100 yards from where I left Mr. Williams, and I saw them walking together looking at a purse which was open in Wilson's hand—I heard them say something, but could not tell what—I stepped in front and took the purse from Wilson's hand, saying, "What have you got here?"—she said, "Oh, I have just picked it up"—I said, "No, you have not picked it up, you have picked the lady's pocket"—Thorn said, "Dear me, I do not know anything of the young woman, I was merely asking her the way"—I said, "But I have been watching you"—I then went to the lady—the purse contained a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I found on Wilson a sovereign and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but nothing on Thorn.</p>

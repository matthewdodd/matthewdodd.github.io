            . On Monday, the 25th of March, I was going home - I live next door to the Falcon.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found Saunders' father in trouble about a row? A. Not at that time, Saunders was discharged after I pointed him out to Gates; he went down to the cage after that - he was about ten minutes in the house before I directed Gates' attention to him, but there was a row; he was twelve or fourteen feet from Gates, and several people were passing and a crowd round him; he was agitated and flurried.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Darvill, the officer? A. Yes; he came to the Falcon after Gates - I did not see Barton there for a considerable time after some others were taken to the cage - Moses Gates said that he was one of them, but did not speak positively that night; he said that night, some time after he was searched, that he had held his mouth - he said he believed him to be the man, and then that he was sure of him.</p>

               <p>Carter's Defence. I was at Uxbridge fair and got drinking; I went to the Jolly Ostlers about half-past eight at night, and never left it but for about five minutes, to go into the yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES. I am a pig-dealer, and know Saunders - I saw him about four o'clock in the afternoon, at the Lion, and went with him to the Falcon about nine; I did not go in there myself, but about nine a person came into the Lion and said Saunder's father had got into a row at the Falcon - he and another or two directly went down to the Falcon; I walked down, and when I got there he was kicking at the door to be let in - he got in at last; I left him - he had been at the Lion more than half an hour when he was fetched from the Lion; I had been in and out of the Lion, and he was sitting there every time I went in.</p>

            . I am an officer. There was a row at the Falcon, and I took Saunders' father to the watch-house for breaking a glass - Saunders followed him, and was taken into custody; it was from half-past eight to ten o'clock - it was above half-past nine when I went to the Falcon.</p>

            ? A. Not by name. I saw Barton at the Falcon that night- he asked me for a night's lodging at about a quarter or twenty minutes past ten o'clock, after the charge of robbery; he was not in custody at the time - he was at the cage when he asked me for a lodging; I took him to the Falcon and saw old Gates, who said he could not speak to him - if young Gates had said he was one of them, I should have taken him into custody; I then told Barton to go about his business - I searched him, and found 3 1/2d. upon him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was young Gates asked if he knew Barton, at the Falcon? A. Yes he said he could not speak to him; he said nothing about his voice there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMPSON. I was in Barton's company on the 25th of March, at Uxbridge, at the Red Lion - we remained there till half-past seven o'clock, and went from there to the Falcon; I did not see Gates there - we staid there together till half-past nine, or a quarter to ten; I saw Thomas at the Falcon - he staid there till near ten; Barton did not go out of the Falcon till he left at half-past nine, or a quarter to ten - he followed old Saunders to the watch-house, and asked Darvill for a night's lodging.</p>

            . I was with Carter, at the Red Lion, on the 25th of March, in the afternoon, and left him there - I saw him at half-past seven at the Jolly Ostlers; we staid there about half an hour, and then went to the Falcon together, and staid about a quarter of an hour - he then left me for eight or ten minutes, and returned; that was about a quarter-past nine - he came to me at the Red Lion, and asked if I was ready for bed; we both went to bed together about half-past nine, or rather later.</p>

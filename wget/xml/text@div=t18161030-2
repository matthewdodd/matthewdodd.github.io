            . I was employed by the Bank to detect the prisoner. I met him on the 5th of September, but not to purchase any of him. I also met him on the Tuesday, and I met him on the next Thursday; the first of these times, I met him in Moorfields; he and his wife were together; he promised to meet me again that night in Cloth-fair, and I went, but could not find him. On the Sunday morning I met him at the Two Bells in White Chapel. On the 19th, I met him in the Tower at Artillery lane; and on the 12th, I was to have met him there but I met him as I was coming out.</p>
               <p>Q. did you make any appointment to meet him any day after the Thursday-A. yes, I made an appointment to meet him at night o'clock on the sunday which was the 15th, at the George near <placeName id="t18161030-2-crimeloc10">White Chaple Church</placeName>

             and Mr. Cox followed me. Both went into the house after I got into the house; I found the prisoner there sitting with two women, one of whom I believe to be his wife. We asked each other how we did first, then the box where we sat was full of company pretty well, for Mr. Cox sat in the same box, and I believe there were two other persons. The first question he asked me, after we had asked each other how we did was whether my friend was handy, that is near at hand, I said yes, he was at no great distance; because he said I have brought you forty; I had had a conversation with him before about a friend. After he had said this, I said I was not prepared for forty then, as I thought proper not to bring my friend with me; I said I would take twenty to night and twenty in the morning; and I asked him if that would do, and he said it would. Now you give me thing meaning the money; I gave him two pound in silver, and eight one pound notes. He said I should have one out of every score; he said it collectively but I perfectly understood that he meant one forged note in every twenty. Then we all came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300007"></xptr>out of the house together; I mean the prisoner and I and the two women.</p>

               <p>Q. did you see anything as you come out of the house - A. yes; I saw him stop to speak to his wife at the door, and said to me go a little higher up to the Church, and wait for me half a minute. I did not see anything while he was speaking to his wife, I was to go towards the church; I went about a dozen yards; he came up to me near the church; he then gave me a roll of paper, and said here is a nice little cartridge for you; I put it in my pocket; we then went on together; we went down <placeName id="t18161030-2-crimeloc11">Bricklane</placeName>

Then we went to a cookshop window to look at the impression, to see if it was not a very good one; then he gave me an eighteenpenny piece, and I looked at that also. I gingled them as we were going along, and it rolled upon the pavement; then we went on into Union-street, and there we were taking together, and then Mr. Christmas came up to me and took hold of me, and Mr. Foy and Mr. Jefferson took hold of the prisoner. They took us to a wine vaults in Shoreditch, and Mr. Foy searched the prisoner.</p>

             was close by. We were there about half an hour when the prisoner came out; two women were also with him. At the door he stopped, and gave something to a woman, who I understood was his wife; he then went on; Charles was just before, and he joined him; Charles came out with him; but had gone on a few paces. The prisoner joined company with Charles by the wall of Whitechapel Church; I did not see what became of the woman; Jefferey's was following the prisoner, and Charles and John Foy, and myself were close behind. They crossed over into Brick-lane together, talking all the time. They stopped at the window of a cookshop in Brick-lane, and I saw the prisoner give Charles something at the window. They then went on, and as they crossed to the wall of Spital Fields Church, they both stooped down and sounded something. I heard that; they then proceeded down Church-street, towards Bishopsgate; they stopped at nearly the end of-street, to speak together. Foy and myself crossed immediately; the prisoner was taken into custody by Foy and Jeffrey's, and I took Charles. We then went to a house in Bishopsgate-street, near Norton Falgate. They were taken in, and the prisoner was searched. He was first asked by Foy, who, and what he was, and what he was doing with Charles; he denied all knowledge of him, and said he never saw him before. There were found on his person, a small pocket book, twelve shillings and sixpence in silver, and a small key. In fact, there were three keys; one was of a street door; Foy then searched Charles, and on searching him, he found this roll of paper in his pocket, and I saw it found on him. Charles was asked where he got them from; and he said from the prisoner. He was asked for what purpose, and he said he had bought them. Foy again asked the prisoner two or three several times, where he lived; who he was; what he was; and what he had been doing with Charles. He refused to give any account of himself whatever, and still persisted in denying all knowledge of Charles. Upon Charles saying that the prisoner gave them to him, I saw the notes taken from Charles; I marked them; they are all forgeries, and I have the same observations to make with respect to them, that I made with respect to the others.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched Charles; I searched him in such a manner as to be certain that he had no roll of paper about him; I heard the account of these witnesses, and that is correct as far as came within my observation. During all the time I was following Charles; there was not a possibility of receiving from any person this roll of paper. I produce a pocket book. On Charles I found a paper, which on opening, contained twenty forged notes; they were on a small roll, and tied up in the paper. I asked him where he got it, and he said, "from that man," pointing to the prisoner. I asked him for what purpose, and he said he bought them. The prisoner did not then say any thing to it; but I asked him where he got them from; and he said he knew nothing about them; I asked him what he knew of this man, meaning Charles; and he said he never saw him before. I said, you must know him; and he said, "no, he did not, for he had never spoken to him in his life. I said, that can't be, for you were speaking to him when I took you into custody, this moment. He said," he was not." I said, what is your name, and where do you live. He said, "he should not give an account of himself." I said, you must; that my name was Foy, and that I was a police officer, and he was suspected to be a seller of forged notes, and if he did not say who he was, I should state that in my evidence against him.</p>

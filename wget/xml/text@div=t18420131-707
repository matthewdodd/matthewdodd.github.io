                  </hi>. I am the wife of Moses Myers, a black-lead pencil-maker, in High-street, Shadwell—I keep a clothes-shop. I have known the prisoner about six months—he came to me last Saturday night week, and asked me if I would cash this seaman's note which is now produced—I said, "Yes; you know it is all right?"—he said, "Yes, certainly"—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and the remainder in seaman's clothes—on the Wednesday or Thursday after, my daughter showed me a note—I went to the owners of the vessel, and then went to the prisoner—I saw him on Thursday morning at his own house, in Sophia-street, Poplar—I said, "Mr. Baron, this is a pretty thing, I have two bad notes; your men are not on board"—his wife said, "We cannot help that; if a man chooses to give you a forged note we cannot help it"—I said, "Well, you seem to know nothing about it; I am doing as the police advised me, and if you will replace the money for my two notes I will not give you in charge"—he said he could not replace it—the prisoner keeps a lodging-house for sailors—he said he could not pay me—I sent my daughter for a police-man, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner came to me either on Wednesday or Thursday, the 27th, I think, to have a seaman's advance note cashed—the seaman who was with him produced the forged note—I cannot say the seaman's name—it is on the note, I be<lb></lb>lieve—the prisoner said, "I have a note to cash for you"—I said my mother was not within—the prisoner asked me if I could oblige him by doing it before-my mother came in, as he and the seaman had been on board the ship the whole morning, waiting for the note, and that he saw the captain give the seaman the note—I said to the prisoner, "I hope it is right"—he said, "It is quite right indeed"—I said, "Sign your name, if you please"—he did so—I asked the seaman also to sign his name—he could not write, and the prisoner wrote it instead of him, and he marked it—the prisoner told me to get down two pairs of drawers for the seaman, which I did, and he said, "Don't you want some trowsers?"—he said, "Yes." and I got him two pairs down—he picked out other little things to make out the amount of the note, except 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I laid on the coun<lb></lb>ter—the note produced is the note which was given me—I know it by the day of the month on it, the 27th—I have known the prisoner about six months—I have cashed about three notes for people at his house before, which were right.</p>

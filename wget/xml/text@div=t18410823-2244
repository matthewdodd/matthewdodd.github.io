                  </hi>. I live in Leicestershire. I brought a white sow from there on the 10th of August, and she was left at Mr. Flight's dairy at Islington—it was of a particular sort, and was going out to New South Wales for breeding—it was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw her safe on the 17th of Au<lb></lb>gust—I have since seen a carcass which I supposed to be the same, in New-gate<lb></lb>market—I have examined it, and have no doubt whatever about it being mine—there was a mark on the near ear.</p>

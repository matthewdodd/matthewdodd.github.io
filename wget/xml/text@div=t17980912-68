No, it is a private room, where we carry on our business; we have no shop; that room we seldom admit any body into, unless we know them, or unless they are people of fashion. On the 19th of May, the two prisoners came to our room; -</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known them before? - A. I had seen them before, unfortunately, in another house that we had, in the same street. When they came in, on the 19th of May; I had been shewing some lace to some ladies of fashion, I did not much like their appearance, and I put this lace into a drawer, and placed it at the far end of the room; as soon as I was disengaged, I went up to these women, on purpose to get them out of the house; I went up to

            , and asked her very sternly, what she wanted; and she immediately turned round hastily from the table where the lace was; they both seemed very much confused, but more particularly the young one, Lister; she told me, she wanted a bonnet; I told her to make choice of one, if there were any there that suited her, and to leave the room; she fixed upon one very improper for her; I had a very strong suspicion that she had robbed me; the price was to be eighteen shillings; I told her, she could not have that that she had fixed upon, and she desired to have one made like it, and she would call for it in the evening; she gave me a guinea. I then called two or three of my young people into the room, who were my apprentices or assistants; I was looking about the room, to see if the lace veils were safe; we found the veils, but did not look into the drawer where the laces were. I was conscious they had robbed me of something, but did not know what; when I was at leisure, I went up to this drawer, and upon opening it, I missed the two cards of lace that I have named; they did not come that evening. On the Tuesday following, I went to the door by accident, and they were just passing; I do not believe it was their intention to come in, had I not seen them; they came in, and appeared very much confused; indeed, I asked them the reason they did not call on Saturday; they said, it rained; I then asked them if they wanted any thing else; they seemed both to answer the question; I had not change, I told them, I must send out for it; they then seemed very anxious to get away, without the change; while I sent for the change, I called up a boy that we have, I desired him to go to the front door, and take particular notice of these women, and to watch where they went to, after they left our house. When I went back into the room, they said, they would not stay longer for the change, they would call again; they took the hat away, and went without their change; the boy watched them into Mr. Gray's, a silversmith, in Bond-street; they had been in a great number of shops; then they met a post-boy with a returned chaise, who went with them into a public-house at the top of the Hay-market, and there staid some time; the boy then followed them to the White-horse Cellar; he lost them there, and returned home; they went into the Richmond stage. Some weeks afterwards I heard that two women were in custody, and I went to Bow-street to hear their examination; there was an advertisement in the paper, cautioning shop-keepers, and saying they were in custody; I immediately knew them to be the same women, and I was bound over to prosecute. I never found my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any body else in the room? - A. Only the two ladies that were there when they came in, Lady Carhampton and her friend, nobody else had been near it, there were a number of persons near the drawer of our own people, but they were perfectly honest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where is your shop? - A. <placeName id="t17980912-68-crimeloc401">No. 142, New Bond-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. This happened so far back as the 19th of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a number of people that serve in your shop? - A. I serve myself principally, I have a number of people that make up the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say you saw them take this lace? - A. I have no doubt but they did, for they turned from the place where the lace was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw them take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that they took it, though you did not see them? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. If any of the veils you have been speaking of had been missing for five minutes, you would have charged them with it? - A. If I had known there had been nobody left in the room but themselves, I should most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 19th of May, of course you had mentioned your suspicions of these people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday following they came in again, without your calling them? - A. Yes; I looked at them very earnestly, but I did not say any thing to them before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. And they paid you? - A. They had left a guinea the first time, I sent out for change.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they wait for change? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. The change was only three shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were going out of town? - A. They went by one of the short stages, I think it was the Richmond.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Mr. Baker's house; I saw Mrs. Baker put the laces into the drawer just after the prisoners came into the room; she put it upon the table where the women were trying the hats.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120072"></xptr>Q. Were they covered with any thing? - A. No; there was not any body at that end of the room but the prisoners; I was taking down a lady's address, and Mrs Baker was taking down another lady's address; we could not then see the drawer, because we were both writing at this end of the room; there was then nobody there but the two prisoners; the ladies went away instantly; they were not at that end of the room where the box and women were. When the ladies were gone, Mrs. Baker, as well as myself, saw the women coming from the drawer; they turned from the table just as we turned from the ladies; I went and looked in the drawer before any person came in afterwards, and I missed the two cards of lace.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else of your own family in that room, or near the drawer, after the ladies went away, and before your mistress searched? - A. Certainly not, for the people coming from the work room go a round about way, because of distinguishing the people in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were a number of other girls in the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And they had access to this room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are there backwards and forwards occasionally? - A. It is very seldom that they do, they were not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had been in after the ladies of fashion went away, and before you missed the lace? - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the laces, you did not see them yourself? - A. Yes, I saw Mrs. Baker put them in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop might the looking-glass be? - A. The glass they were looking at was close by that table.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore they might be near the table without any dishonest intention? - A. Certainly.</p>

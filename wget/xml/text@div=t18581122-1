                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at 119, Oxford-street. On 14th April, the prisoner came to my shop—he said he had been recommended to me to buy a good lever watch, and he understood that I kept at times very good second-hand watches, and he preferred having a second-hand watch—I said I had not one then, but I knew of one that I thought I could obtain for him—he stated that he was Dr. Rees, professor of chemistry at the University, at all the Colleges, pointing in the direction of Gower-street, where the London University is—he did not name any particular College—I asked him if he knew several parties—he said yes; he knew Dr. Bachoffner, and Mr. Pepper, and several others—he said he would call again in a few days, which he did on 20th April—I then told him I was not able to obtain the watch spoken of, but I showed him one of our own make—he agreed to have that, provided that I could guarantee it to perform to time at 110 degrees of heat—I said I could not do that, but I would undertake to make it perform at 96 degrees of heat—he said he must have it to perform at that at least, because it was necessary in his profession to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220006"></xptr>
               <p>lay it before that heat—I then undertook to compensate that same watch at 96 degrees—he called again, I think on 4th May—he then saw the watch and was perfectly satisfied—he came in several times every day till the 6th May—he kept coming in to see if the watch performed correctly with one of Le Roy's, which he pulled out of his pocket, and which he said Mr. Le Roy had entrusted him with, in fact he was not to pay for it until he had quite satisfied himself that it went correctly—I asked if he had a bill of it—he said no, but I could go to Mr. Le Roy, or I could go to Claude Scott's for his reference; that he was in the habit of banking at Claude Scott's—I think he said that in the first instance—he also said so on 6th May and I also offered to go over to Mr. Le Roy's—that was only just across Regent-street—he asked me to value that watch, which I did at thirty-six guineas—the value of mine was twenty-six guineas—the prisoner said if I would allow him to put it in his pocket for a few hours he would see if it went correctly, and if it did, he would give me a cheque for the whole amount of the goods on the following Tuesday—I let him have the watch—I let him have it in consequence of the representations he made, particularly that he had this watch from Mr. Le Roy, and that he banked at Claude Scott's, and also his being professor of chemistry—if he had not represented that he had banked at Claude Scott's, and that he was professor of chemistry of the University, I do not think I should have allowed him to have the watch, but his introducing Mr. Le Roy's watch helped it—I certainly should not have parted with it, if he had not represented that he banked at Claude Scott's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. De la Fontaine 296, Regent-street, as watchmakers. In April last, the prisoner came to our shop—we had a person named Hochstetter in our service at that time—he is now at Manilla: when the prisoner came, he said he had selected a watch and wanted to know if it was ready—I told him it was not—he came several times to see if it was ready—he told me that he wanted a watch to go very well, on account of his being a medical man and making experiments in chemistry, and if it did not go quite right, it would be inconvenient to him, and put him in danger in making his experiments—he wrote his name in my book in my presence—this is it "Dr. Rees, 36, Bernard-street, Russell-square"—he said he was professor in a college and he could call every morning to compare the watch with me regularly, as he was going every morning to his hospital—and he did in fact call every morning at the same time—he did not say of what college he was professor; he very likely might mention it, but I do not know—I was not present when the watch was delivered to him—I did not give any directions to Hochstetter as to whether he should part with the watch with or without the money.</p>

On the 2d of November, in the evening, I went to bed the last of my family, at about eleven o'clock. I had been out, but came home about tea, and found my house fast as usual. I got up in the morning about seven, or rather better. My child, who is about thirteen years old, was with me. She said she believed our house was robbed. We found a gun, a pistol, and a naked sword, lying on the table, in the fore-parlour; overnight the sword was hanging against the wall. I missed 130 ounces of chippings of silver from out of a mahogany bureau, which was broke open in the fore-parlour, and a pistol, which hung with the sword. I lost a pepper-box, four common spoons, a large soup-ladle, a mother-of-pearl snuff-box, set in silver, a box with mourning-rings and some ear-rings, and a morocco pocket-book. I found the window-shutter was wrenched open. It being a dirty evening, I observed a good many marks of feet on the window, on the inside, and on the ground and carpet. There were two chisels found near my house by the watchman; by the marks on the window, it seemed as if wrenched open by them. It was a sash window. I gave notice of it to Sir

In Underwood's pocket were found twenty-seven guineas and a half, ten shillings and sixpence in silver, a chisel, and a center-bit and stock; and that upon Burton they found a very remarkable guinea, a center-bit, and the stock belonging to the bit, with other bits, which were found in a table drawer in the room; also a tinder-box, an iron crow, a match or two, some gunpowder, and two pistols (one of which the prosecutor owned). Graham did not come in till six o'clock, when they took him.</p>

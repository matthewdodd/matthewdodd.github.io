On the evening of the 23rd of June I was at the William the Fourth, in Ship-yard, Fleet-street, waiting for a friend—I had another friend with me—we waited some time, and I went to sleep on the form—I was awoke by a pricking on my thigh—I turned, and saw the prisoner leaning over me, pretending to be picking up a piece of paper—I went to sleep again, and was again awoke by a pricking on my thigh—I saw the prisoner, and he had some halfpence in his hand—my pocket was cut, and he was leaning over the table as he was before—he had an open knife in his hand, which was near my thigh pocket, in which I had six halfpence and two penny pieces—I had two shillings in my left waistcoat pocket, and seven shillings in my fob, and they were all gone—when I got up the prisoner went out, and dropped some coppers—I went after him—he went into a chandler's shop, and called for half a pint of small beer—I asked him to give me my money, and if he would not I would give him in charge—two pence fell out of my pocket, and</p>

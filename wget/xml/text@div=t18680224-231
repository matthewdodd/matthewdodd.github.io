I am cab driver 15, 246—on the evening of 15th January I was in Goodman's Yard, at a little before seven o'clock, and saw the prisoners there talking—Sullivan took a comforter which Smith had round his neck, and put it round her's—he stood on the opposite side, and she went into the Coach and Horses and called for three-halfpennyworth of rum—I followed her in, and fastened the door—she threw down a florin—the woman said, "This is a bad one, and you have been here before"—she said that she had never been in the house—I went over to Smith, and said, "You are wanted in the house, there is some rum and water for you"—as we passed through the cab-rank I heard something drop, and said, "You have dropped something"—he said, "I have not"—I saw a florin, which was wrapped up in a torn piece of tissue paper, and gave it to the constable—he said that he did not know the woman.</p>

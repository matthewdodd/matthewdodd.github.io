            . I live at Elizabeth Perfect's, the Crane Inn. I came down stairs between five and six o'clock, on the morning of the 26th of February; I had gone to bed at eleven, and saw the house all fastened; I got up first in the morning, and found the kitchen window shutters broken open, two panes taken out, and the window standing open - any body could get in - the kitchen is part of the dwelling-house: there is a bed-room over it; I went into the parlour, and missed a bit of cheese which I had left on the sideboard the overnight, and three pork pies, off the parlour table; I had seen them there the overnight - and about three-parts of a ham out of the safe; there were footmarks by the kitchen window - it appeared somebody had got into the house through that window; I traced the footsteps away from the window to the bottom of the garden over into the stable-yard, and from there to Fox-meat barn, which is about a mile of; the ground was all grass - it was very wet weather, and we could trace steps the whole way; it was at first of only one person apparently; when I got to the barn, I found

On the night of Saturday last, I retired to bed about ten o'clock. I have no doubt but that all the doors were fastened; my daughter resides in the house with me, and no one else; I think it was my daughter who closed the back door; I fastened the stair-case window myself before I went to bed; my daughter went to bed at the same time. I found the door of my house broken the next morning. After I was in bed I was alarmed by a noise below, like a person attempting the house; I listened again, and heard a noise such as I could imagine might be that of a door being attempted to be wrenched, upon which I sprung a rattle. I think it might be after two o'clock, it was very foggy; I could see the lamp a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any other name but Mary - A. No. I closed only the staircase window; I have no servant, we have a young person who comes to assist in the house to do the domestic business, she came that evening and brought some oysters.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness I remember retiring to rest last Saturday night; I fastened the door which was broken open, and I believe the others door were not open when I went to bed. I was alarmed in the night; we had no property taken away. I was present last night when a dark lantern was found near the front door, it was about six o'clock; I saw part of a centre bit near the dark lantern, and part of it was found in the garden, it was all iron; I saw the pieces put together there was a pannel taken out of the coach door, this is the pannel, (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There is a servant who comes occasionally to the house - A. She came about eight o'clock that night, and went away directly. The door which was broken had been locked, barred, and bolted; I did it myself, and I am almost positive that I fastened the other door; I am positive all the doors were fastened when we went to bed.</p>

            . I am the watchman. In consequence of some alarm while I was crying the hour of three o'clock; I came to this house, and Low came with me; I went to the back of the house, got a ladder, and got over the wall; when I came to the back door of the house, I tried, and found it open; I heard somebody walking in the passage, I asked if that was Mr. Treacher, a man's voice answered Yes, I then went forward and saw a man, I said</p>
               <p>"You are the man I want," he went up stairs and jumped out of the staircase window; I returned to the back door, thinking he was gone into the garden, but he had gone into the next garden; I went after him but he escaped; I heard some other persons in the house, but could not see them. I am sure there was more than one; I afterwards went round to the front of the house. I took Martin about six o'clock the same morning on the road going towards town, about sixty yards from the house, he had no hat on; I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you lost your hat," he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he had been in an affray about three hours before, and lost it;" I took him to the watch-house, he did not say where the affray was. I went back to the house as soon as the patrol had taken Richards to the watch-house, it might be then about four o'clock, the thieves were gone. I found the front door open, and this dark lantern near it in the passage; this part of a centre bit there, and another part of it in the back garden; a crow bar was in the stair-case window. I found two hats in the passage, and a shoe on the landing place; one hat I have brought, the other I gave to Martin, as he came to town, because it rained; he claimed it as his own, at Queen-square. I believe what he said was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it you who addressed this young man about where he was going - A. Yes, he was about sixty yards from the house; he said he had been in an affray, and lost his hat - he openly owned it; it was then day-light. I was crying three o'clock when I was first called; it was last Saturday morning, and was very foggy. I do not know that I should know the features of a man ten yards from me.</p>

            . In consequence of some alarm, I came to the house about three o'clock. I went to the back of the house, and also to the front of it. I saw Richards and some other man come out of the front door. I got over the rails, between the two persons, and secured Richards. I asked him if he knew the others, he said that it was all right. I went back to the premises - went in at the front door, and through to the back door. I saw they had broken the door with a crow-bar. I tried the bar, and it corresponded exactly with the mark in the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which did you apprehend - A. Richards. I do not know that I had ever seen the other man before, but I have seen him since. I was half a minute securing Richards, and the other ran away instantly - I could not swear to his person.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I went to the house about three o'clock. I saw Price the patrole there. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160114"></xptr>at the front of the house when the two men came out - I saw Price take one. I ran after the other across the road - he got into a ditch close to the hedge; he then got out of the ditch and ran. I picked up a stone and knocked his hat off. I took up the hat, and a phosphorus box was in it. Martin afterwards owned the hat. I carried it into the house, and put it into the passage. About six o'clock I found a handkerchief against the street-door, outside - Martin claimed that also at Queen-square, before the Justice, while I was there. I was present when Martin was taken, close against the Hand and Flowers public-house. Jenkins and myself went across to him - Jenkins asked him where he had been, and what he had done with his hat - he said he had lost his hat in an affray at a lady's house - he then went to the watch-house, he had not any hat on at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Jenkins hear him say this - A. Yes; I am sure he said he lost his hat at a lady's house - he spoke loud enough for Jenkins to hear him; he is one of the men who I pursued. I am certain, I saw him by the gas-light, and knew him directly I saw him in the morning. When he was running from me his back was to me - I had observed him for about five minutes; he ran across the road, about twenty or thirty yards. I picked up a stone to knock him down. I saw his face by the gas - he came full in my face coming over the pales.</p>

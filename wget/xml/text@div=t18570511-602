                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Coutts and Co. A gentle<lb></lb>man named Trognon keeps an account there; he is an officer in the house of the Prince de Joinville—on 21st April the prisoner came and presented this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is a translation of it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I request that Messrs.

Moro owed him 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and bad written to him to meet him at the South-western Railway station that morning at 7 o'clock, and that he (the prisoner) had come up from Southampton, but not that morning—I asked him where he had slept the night before; he said, "At a small hotel in the neighbourhood of the railway;" that M. Moro met him at the South-western Railway at 7 o'clock, gave him the cheque, and told him to pay himself the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to take him the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to No. 72, Regent Street; and if he had left, to send it to him at Geneva"—I consulted with the partners, and then accompanied him to No. 72, Regent Street, but found nobody named Moro there; the servant had been there three months, and the landlord twelve years, but they knew nothing of M. Moro—we went into the shop; the shopman spoke French, and the prisoner asked for M. Moro—I then inquired where the prisoner lived; he said that he had come up from Southampton, and that he had come from the</p>

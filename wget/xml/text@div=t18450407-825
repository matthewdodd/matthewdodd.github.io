                  </hi>. I am a clerk in a mercantile house, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. On the 28th of Feb., about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going home from the City—I had been drinking somewhat freely. I remember reaching Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury—I went into the Blue Boar there, and called for a glass of gin and water—whilst I was standing at the bar, Darby came in, and asked me if I wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I declined it—he still wanted me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was very importunate with me to have one—I do not remember his having any of my gin and water, or his bringing in any other person—I cannot recollect how long I was in the house—I remember coming out of the Blue Boar, and going to the Blue Posts, at the corner of Hanway-street and Tottenham Court-road—I was followed by Darby, who still wished me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I do not remember seeing any second man before I got to the Blue Posts—I left the Blue Posts, and went straight along in the direction of Crown-street—I there turned up a court, for a natural purpose—after I left the Blue Potts, Darby still wanted me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and he was joined by another man—I observed that before I turned up the court—whilst I was up the court I remember receiving a blow on the head—I then lost my senses entirely, until I found myself in a chemist's shop—I was taken home that night—next morning Stack was brought to my bedside in order that I might look at him—Sergeant Wells asked me if I could identify him as the man who was drinking with me on the previous night; and whilst I was looking at him very earnestly, he said, "I did not strike the blow."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure Wells did not ask whether you could identify him as the man who struck the blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not say that—he said, "Can you identify this man as the man who drank with you in the Blue Posts;" and before I answered, while looking at him, he said, "I never struck the blow, I never saw the gentleman before I met him at the Blue Boar"—I said, "You vagabond, you are one of them, you have com<lb></lb>mitted yourself"—he made no answer to that—I cannot recognise Stack as being either of the men—I have no doubt about Darby—they were per<lb></lb>fect strangers to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time the second man appeared was after you had left the Blue Posts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was about half-past ten o'clock when I first entered the Blue Boar—I had been drinking freely before that—I had a glass of gin and water at the Blue Posts, as Darby asked me to treat him—I cannot recollect whether we had one each—I have no recollection of stopping and speaking with any party when I came out of the Blue Posts—I did not stop, talking to Darby, or any one, for ten minutes, or five minutes, or for any time—I do not recollect stopping—I can take on myself to say I did not stop—after leaving the Blue Posts I went immediately over to Crown-street—I did not go to another public-house opposite, to my recollection—I cannot undertake to say I did not—I had been drinking freely, and might not recollect it—this court in Crown-street was not in my way home, but I had been accustomed to go that way formerly, and it was very natural for me to go that way, to avoid High-street, St. Giles, which is not a respect<lb></lb>able neighbourhood—that was when I lived in the same place—it was my intention to turn down Sutton-street, but I went into George-yard, which is, I suppose, not more than a dozen yards beyond Sutton-street—I never remember seeing George-yard before—I have seen it since—it is a broad</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070065"></xptr>
               <p>entrance from Crown-street, not very broad—it is not quite so broad as Crown-street—I turned on the right side of the entrance—I went down, I should say, about three, four, or five yards—there is a stable door on that side, and some wagons at the extremity of the yard, but not near the entrance—I examined it about a week ago, in the middle of the day—at the opposite corner to where I was there is a gin palace—I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect whether it extends considerably below where I laid—I do not know whether there is a fire-station at the lower part of the yard—I only examined it in a casual way—I observed a projection on the side where I was supposed to have laid—it is a round pipe—I observed's grating before I came to the pipe, a little below the surface—the surface of the yard is all even, quite as even as Oxford-street, I should say, except this small grating, which is an interruption to it—to the best of my recollection, the grating is about half-a-dozen yards from the entrance of the yard—I cannot say positively whether I observed a sharp ring round the pipe, about two feet from the ground—I had no ap<lb></lb>pointment to go to Hendon, or anywhere, next day—I do not recollect speaking to Darby about meeting me next morning with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I will not swear I did not speak to him about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> nor that I did not treat him to a glass of rum and water at a public-house, after leaving the Blue Posts—there is a public-house at the opposite corner, just as you turn down Crown-street—I think it was with half-a-crown that I paid for the glass of gin and water at the Blue Boar.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Cannot you recollect whether you were looking down the gateway or towards the wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only recollection I have was the sense of very acute pain on the head from the blow—I do not recollect going up there—I suppose I went up there for a natural purpose—I have no dis<lb></lb>tinct recollection of any thing after I left the Blue Posts till I was at the surgeon's shop, except having received the blow—I remember the fact of the blow on my head—I do not remember how I fell, whether I fell or not, or whether I was struck after I fell.</p>

I keep the Blue Boar in Great Russell-street—Mr. Green came into my house on the 28th Feb., about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—he called for some gin and water—whilst serving him I heard the noise as of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopping at the door—it came up not more than a minute after Mr. Green came in—on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopping Darby the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man came into the house—I did not then perceive that Mr. Green was labouring under the effects of liquor—Darby looked in Mr. Green's face and laughed rudely—he persevered in laughing—at last he touched his</p>

               <p>hand to his hat, and said something to Mr. Green which I did not hear—in consequence of this conduct I paid rather particular attention to him—I thought it looked rather strange—Mr. Greeen offered him his glass to drink—he then asked if he might not let his mate drink, and he called Stack from the other door which opens into Caroline-street—he called him by some Christian name, but I cannot recollect what—upon that Stack came in and drank—the glass was then given back to Mr. Green, he put it to his lips, gave it back to Darby, and went out of the house—Darby then said to Stack, "Here, catch hold," he gave him the glass, and followed Mr. Green quickly—Stack emptied the glass, and followed quickly after Darby—I recollect their persons—Mr. Green paid me for bis liquor with a half-crown, and I gave him change—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were present at the time he pulled out the money—it was paid for just as I gave it to him—I think I was giving Mr. Green the change when Darby came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Blue Posts public-house, in Tottenham Court-road. On the 28th of Feb., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, Mr. Green came there in front of the bar—there is a tap-room which lies backwards towards Hanway-street—about the time Mr. Green was at the bar, Stack was in the tap-room—Darby was with Mr. Green at the bar, drinking gin and water—I knew the prisoners before by their using the house—they are <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> men—they generally came into the tap-room together, and were acquainted with each other—on that day Darby had been driving Stack's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they were at our house together about twelve o'clock in the day—Stack said he would go out to the bar, to see if his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was on the rank, and get his money—I do not know who was driving the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the day, but Darby drove it at night—whilst Mr. Green and Darby were drinking at the bar, Stack came out of the tap-room to the bar, and said he would go out for a cigar—he asked Darby for his money, Darby would not give it to him, but said, "Will you have a drop of gin and water with us? "which he did—I was shutting up the house, and Mr. Green called for another fourpennyworth of gin and water—they had two fourpennyworths altogether—Stack had some of it, and Darby also—I shut up the house, and about five minutes after twelve, I let Mr. Green out—I opened the door for him—he was sensible enough to know where he was, and what he was about—I could see that he had been drinking—there are two doors to our house—Mr. Green went out at the Hanway-street door—Darby</p>

               <p>coming up towards Oxford-street—Darby was sitting on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I came in sight of him, I heard him call out, very quick and sharp, "Here, here, here's the <hi rend="italic">Bobby!</hi>"—they call the police <hi rend="italic">Bobbies</hi>—I had my uniform on—he turned his head towards George-yard, as if speak<lb></lb>ing to some person up the yard, and I immediately saw Stack run out of George-yard, and spring on to the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, with a whip in his hand—I could not say exactly what kind of whip it was—he had it in his right hand—the thong part was before him, and the butt-end behind him—he was holding it near the middle—he took the reins from Darby, (I did not know Darby at that time,) and attempted to drive away—he started the horse, turned it round, and was driving it furiously away, whipping his horse, during the time I was after him, down Crown-street, towards Tottenham Court-road—I followed and overtook the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, at the end of Sutton-street, which is about fifty yards from George-yard—I there stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and found the two prisoners on it—I am quite sure they are the men—Stack was driving—I asked Stack what was the matter, as he was driving away in such a furious manner—he said, "Nothing at all"—I asked him again, and he made no answer—I then asked him to show me his badge—he took it out from underneath his coat, and showed it to me, without making any difficulty—I saw his number, and took the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and seeing no one inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I told him he might go—he said, "You b----and so can you"—he then drove on towards Tottenham Court-road—I immediately returned to George-yard, and there found Mr. Green, lying down on his side, with his hat off, and a pool of blood under his head—I noticed a wound in his head, from which the blood was proceeding very fast—he was very insensible—I procured some assistance, and had him taken to Mr. Kenny's, a surgeon, in the neighbourhood, where his wound was examined—he was nearly ten minutes, after he got to Mr. Kenny's, before he came to his senses, sufficiently to tell me where he lived—I then went home with him—he had one sovereign, four shil<lb></lb>lings, sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and one penny in his pocket—I noticed blood three yards before I came to the pool under his head—he was lying with his head towards the buildings down the court, and his feet outwards to<lb></lb>wards the carriage-road—I noticed blood about three yards from his feet, towards Crown-street—I suppose he must have gone or staggered those three yards, whilst he was bleeding—on the right-hand side of the court is a plain brick-wall—his head was about a foot and a half from the wall—I noticed no blood whatever near or on the wall, nor any pipe handy—there is a rain-water pipe near the top, but that is ten yards from where Mr. Green was found, ten yards further up the court from the street—it is a round pipe, that comes down by the engine-house—I did not notice any projection of any kind from the wall near where Mr. Green was found, or in any part of the line marked by the blood—there ia no projection on the ground at that part—his head was on a flat paving-stone, two feet square, as plane as a deal board—there is not the least unerenness in the surface.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>yards from the entrance—there is no pipe, between the entrance and where I found Mr. Green—there is a grating on the ground, about three yards below the pipe, towards Crown-street—I saw the blood before I took Mr. Green up—there was no gas-lamp near—there was one about ten yards from him, at the top of the yard, on the left-hand side—I did iot take him up towards the lamp—I held him against the wall till I got the assistance of a brother constable, and then I took him down towards Crown-street—I had examined Mr. Green before that, and seen the wound in his head, and the blood running from it—I lifted him up before I ex<lb></lb>amined the yard, but I saw the blood three yards before I came to his head, before I lifted him up, while he was on the ground—the first objects that caught my attention, on going into the yard, were the spots of blood on the pavement—his feet were about three yards from the spots of blood, or rather better, perhaps—his feet went across towards the carriage-road—there is a fire-station in the yard—the firemen are generally up of a night, but they are very often asleep—I have been on the beat some time—there is a large public-bouse opposite this place—where I found Mr. Green is beyond the public-house, on the opposite side of the way, not far beyond—I pointed out the place where I saw Mr. Green to one of the firemen, next morning—I found an umbrella sticking in the grating—that grating wss about three yards before I came to Mr. Green, and is below the sur<lb></lb>face of the yard—it would not be easy to stumble over it—it is a very little below the surface—I did not measure it—I will, swear no portion ofit is three inches below the surface—it is nearly level—the portion nearest the wall inclines rather more than the other end—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> had gone fifty; yards when I came up to it—I was about thirty yards from it when I first noticed it, and when I heard the words, "Here's the <hi rend="italic">bobby</hi>, "I ran. after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and while it was traversing a space of fifty yards, I had tra<lb></lb>velled eighty—there are one or two small courts on the other, side of the way, much narrower than George-yard—I do not know that the public-house at the corner is in the habit of being open late—I never saw any persons in it after twelve—I have seen their own people up, and talking after twelve—this was about half-past twelve—they always close their doors at twelve.</p>

In consequence of information I received, I looked after the prisoners—Stack lives at No. 3, Petty's-place, or court—I went and found him there in bed, about half-past nine on Saturday morning, the 1st of March—I asked his name, which he told me, and also the number of his badge—I had seen him driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> be<lb></lb>fore, but I did not know him by name—I asked whether he was at Crown-street last night with his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he was, he had followed a gentle<lb></lb>man down Crown-street to know what time he was to fetch him in the morning, and that there he had lost sight of him, and had not seen him since—I told him he must dress himself and go with me—I took him into custody, and conveyed him to Mr. Green's house.</p>

Mr. Green was brought to my house early in the morning of the 1st of March by the two policemen—he was bleeding profusely, and completely insensible)—I immediately per<lb></lb>ceived a wound on the side of the head—I examined it and probed it—the bone was denuded, but did not appear to me to be injured—it was not fractured—it seemed to have been caused by some blunt inttrtmeot having struck it—it was partially contused, but was completely divided in the centre—the edges were partially jagged—it was a contused and lacerated wound, such as might be caused by a hard blow from a blunt instrument—it was a very severe blow—the butt end of a whip might have produced it—the wound was perpendicular—I eould not positively say in what way the instrument struck the head—I think a similar wound might have been received by a fall, if he had fallen against a sharp projection—I do not think a fall on a smooth paving-stone could have caused it—I have not seen the spot where this occurred—I attended Mr. Green for about a week afterwards.</p>

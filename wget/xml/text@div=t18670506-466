                  </hi>. I reside at 13, Hayward Street, Shoreditch—on Saturday night, 6th April, I was at the Red Lion public-house—the prisoner came in while I was there; he was not quite sober—we had a few trifling words—I called to James Ellis, and he interfered—I believe they went outside—I afterwards saw Ellis in the chemist's shop, with his head bleeding—I don't know whether he had any wound before he went outside; I did not see any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 1, Elm Cottages, Kings<lb></lb>land Road—on 6th April I was in the Red Lion public-house—Ellis and the prisoner were there—an altercation took place between them—I saw them come out and scuffle; they went down, the prisoner atop of Ellis—as they got up I saw the prisoner draw a knife and strike him on the top of the head with a hacking knife; the blood began to flow—a</p>

               <p>man named Brown came and caught Ellis—the prisoner made his escape and took refuge in the dining-rooms opposite, and was apprehended by 131.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass maker in the Hackney Road—on 6th April I was at the Red Lion public-house, and saw Ellis and the pri<lb></lb>soner on the ground—when Ellis rose from the ground he staggered back<lb></lb>wards and said, "I am stuck in the head"—I asked him who did it—he said, "That man"—I saw no knife and no blow struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see Tolliday there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was on the other side of the bar—I saw an iron bolt in the door with a piece of broken iron in it, projecting—I have seen it three or four times since this occurred—I can't say whether Ellis fell against that—I did not see him till he was on the ground. James Ellis. I am a painter, and reside at 14, Ely Street—on 6th April I was at the Red Lion; I was sober—the prisoner was there—Mary Ann Howard called to me for assistance—I went to her assistance, and tried to prevent the prisoner striking her—he was in the act of striking her, and I received the blow on my face—we struggled and fell between the counter and the door—I was picked up by some one, I can't remember who—we got outside, and then saw the prisoner rush into the eating-house opposite—I was bleeding, and was taken to a chemist's to have my head dressed—I first found that I was bleeding as I was getting up from the struggle; that was after he had struck me—I felt the blow as I fell down—I could not say whether I struck my head against the door as I fell.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 131). On 6th April I saw a crowd in front of the public-house, and saw Ellis bleeding from the head—I went to the cook shop opposite and took the prisoner into custody—I told him a person was stabbed, and I should have to take him to the station—he said he sought refuge in the cook shop from the crowd. Henry Sedgwick. I am a surgeon, of 79, New North Road—on 6th April I was called to Ellis—he had a wound across the top of the head, extending from the inner front part of the ear directly across—it was about three-quarters of an inch long—it was a long incised wound, but in the middle slightly lacerated; the two ends only were incised—it must have been done with a blunt instrument of some kind—I should not think a broken bolt of a door would do it; the head of a screw might, or a blunt knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If he had fallen sideways against a jagged piece of iron, would not that have done it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say; a very sharp pointed piece of iron would have done it if it was parallel to the head—I have since looked at the bolt and found a screw projecting about three-quarters of an inch—the head of the screw projects about half an inch—that was the most likely thing to cause it.</p>

I keep the Red Lion, at Hoxton—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling at my bar and locked in each other's arms—I saw no knife in the prisoner's hand; if he had had one I must have seen it—I saw them fall, and the prosecutor's head went against the bolt of the door; it made me shudder at the time—it was a violent fall—there were about fifty persons in the house.</p>

I am manager of a lodging-house, 34, Wellclose<lb></lb>square—I sleep in the back room up-stairs—the prisoner lodged there one week—he slept in a top room; not my room—he lodged there on the night of the 25th Dec.—no one slept in the top rooms but him and me—he went to bed first that night, and when I went to bed I observed his door was wide open—I told him so, and there was a great draught—he said he liked air—I left the door open—I went to bed about half—past 11 o'clock—he had not slept with his door open before—after I had been in bed about half an hour,</p>

               <p>I beard some one go down-stairs—there was no other lodger in the house but the prisoner—I did not get up; the prisoner had shown me this weapon (<hi rend="italic">dagger</hi>), the night before, and said that was his preserver; I was afraid to go down—shortly afterwards I heard footsteps coming up-stairs—the prisoner went into his own room, and he called out, "George, George! there is a thief in the house;" he put his band on my face; I touched hit shoulder—I said, "Why did you not hold him?"—he sung out for a light, and my aunt, Mrs. Waters, came out of the first floor, and brought a light—the prisoner went down with his drawers and stockings on, and took the light from her—I went into the room with him—the sheets of the bed were turned over, and his things were just polled out of his trunk—he said, "Look here; there have been thieves in the house"—I said, "You art the Yankee thief;" and I said I would go for a policeman—I came down, and the prisoner came down too—I went out, but did not find a policeman—I came back, and Mr. Cook went out and got one—there were no strange persons in the house but Mr. and Mrs. Cook, myself and the prisoner, my uncle and aunt, and the niece and servant—when I went out to get a policeman, the back door was wide open—I bad gone down into the kitchen the night before to turn the gas off, and as I came up I bolted the door—that door opens into a back yard, which is enclosed with a wall, eight or ten feet high—I did not observe anything that would enable a person to climb up to the wall—there was a ladder, but it hung up by the side of the house—it was not moved—the next house is not inhabited—it belongs to my uncle—that house was all secure—no one could get into that house from the house I was living in.</p>

He sleeps at the top of the house—on the erasing of Christmas—day I went to bed between 6 and 7 o'clock, as I was not wall—I took my watch out of my pocket, wound it up, and hung it where I always do, at the head of my bed—I was awoke between 12 and 1 by a noise on the stairs—my wife was in the room—she got a light—I wanted to see the time, and my watch was gone—my room door hid been shut, but not locked—I went out on the landing, and saw the prisoner—directly I said my watch was gone, the prisoner went down-stairs—I saw him go—he was not down more than one or two minutes, and I saw him come up again—this is my watch—it is not in the same state that it was when I hung it up—it is all damaged and broken—when you get in the yard at the bottom of the stairs, there is a small dust-tub; what we call a beef-tier—it is a small cask, which we put the ashes in from the fire—it is not far from the wall of No. 34 to the wall of No. 35—the wall is eight or ten feet high; but from the top of the tub to the top of the wall it is four or five feet—a person might gut on the top of the wall from there; but they could only get into the other yard, they could not get into the street—there were no marks of anybody having got over.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the morning after Christmas-day I found this watch in the yard at the back of my house—tho case was about two yards distance from the watch; they were on the ground, near the water-butt—it might have been thrown there from the other yard—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

"Have you been in my room? he said, "No, go to the devil;" I said some one had been in my room; Mrs. Waters had a light; I got it, and looked round my room, and found no one; Mr. Cook got a policeman, and I went to the station; the sergeant asked Mr. Waters, "Do you persist in giving this man in charge?"

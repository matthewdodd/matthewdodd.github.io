            . I keep a chandler's-shop in Little Arthur-street. I saw a crowd in Ball-yard as I stood at my shop, the prisoner and Harris were there, they ran out of the crowd together, and came up towards me. I knew them both perfectly well. In five or ten minutes, I heard the prosecutor had lost his watch. As they came towards me, opposite the Crown and Sceptre door, I saw Harris give the prisoner something which appeared to be a watch. They were about ten yards from me. I informed the constable.</p>

Tweedy and I went to the prisoner's lodgings, he was denied to us, we went up stairs, and found him concealed under the bed clothes, with all his clothes but his coat on, it was in the afternoon. I told him what Hill said, he said he knew nothing of it, he did not take it.</p>

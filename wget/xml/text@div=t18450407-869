                  </hi>. I live at Harmondsworth, and am a farmer in partnership with my brother; the prisoners were my servants. They were employed to go with a cart and team on the afternoon of the 24th of March—about five o'clock Whatmore came with another man, and asked me for a quantity of corn to take up with the team—I sent him to my nephew—early in the morning of the 25th of March, I was called up by the policemen—I re<lb></lb>ferred them to my nephew, and they went and called him—I have seen</p>

               <p>these oats and refuse of oats now produced—some are bruised and some not bruised—I have no doubt they were had from my barn—they are similar to a large heap that was there for the horses—this sack is ours—this clover hay is the same as that we have in the stable to rack up with at nights, but the men are not allowed to take it out—Whatmore was allowed to take a truss and a half of meadow hay with him, but no clover-hay nor corn—this barley is grown for the sheep—it is mixed with black and white oats—I believe it is ours.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 24th of March, I was at the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoners leave his premises about half-past eleven o'clock, with a wagon drawn by three horses, and two loads of barley straw—they proceeded along the road—I stopped them, and asked Whatmore what he had got—he said, "Two loads of barley straw"—I said, "What else?"—he said, "My truss of hay and my swinger"—I said, "Have you anything else?"—he said, "No"—I saw a quantity of clover-hay pushed under the load, and asked what that was—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I asked what he had got in this basket, which I saw there on the side of his wagon—he said, "I have got my <hi rend="italic">tommy</hi>" meaning his victuals—I found in it about a peck of mixed oats and barley—I asked how he came to have that—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I told him he was not allowed to bring corn away from Mr. Tilyer's premises—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I said, "I shall take you for stealing it"—he said, "You won't hurt me any more than you can help"—I said any statement he made I should make use of again—he then said, "I stole the corn out of the bin"—Dutton was close by him, and said he knew nothing about it.</p>

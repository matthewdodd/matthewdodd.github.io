             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live as servant with the prisoner in June last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. State what you know of this transaction? - A. I saw him take Mr. Pedder's gun about five weeks a before I left his house, on the 28th of June; it was about seven or eight in the morning, when I was washing my pots, and putting them up to dry; I saw him take the gun through a hole in the tiling of Mr. Pedder's kitchen; he carried it under his coat, and I said, ah, master, what are you there? he said, hold your tongue, in a very crabbed way, to me; he carried the gun into the room called the double-bedded room, and I saw it and had it several times in my hand; there was an iron plate put on one side where it was split a little, and there was a waxed string round the flint, and some silver very near the flint; I had it in my hand when I was cleaning the room, and I saw it clearly when my master took it, and observed those marks on it then when he was concealing it under his coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first mention the circumstance? - A. I was coming by Mr. Pedder's, and heard him say he had lost his gun; then I said I knew about it; he and his wife were the first I mentioned it to, as they stood at their own door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you and Mr. Pedder acquainted much? - A. No; I have been there on errands for my master about three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at the time you told him? - A. I lodged down the town, and was going up the town on an errand for myself, and crossed over the way, because it was the cleanest walking.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in August? - A. Yes, it was very wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was very wet on the 25th of August? - A. Yes, it was quite wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with Mr. Pedder? - A. His wife, and one of the horse-keepers.</p>
               <p>Q. That was John West? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Lander? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in company with Mr. Pedder? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the prisoner's service? - A. Nineteen weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. The stealing of the gun was a very dishonest thing, you knew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go and tell the baker of it? - A. No; I thought he had given him leave to take it, because he was often with Mr. Pedder, and I believe he asked him to lend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said he took off two or three tiles, for the purpose of taking the gun out? - A. No; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Evans? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you never said your master took some tiles off, for the purpose of taking the gun? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you dismissed from the prisoner's service for? - A. For his ill behaviour to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He charged you with stealing something, I believe? - A. He charged me with stealing a bonnet; my mistress said, the cover of a muslin bonnet was her's, though it was given to me by a girl he cohabited with in the house; I was not turned away, but would not stay; there was not a word mentioned about the bonnet till I came down stairs and received my wages.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never charged with stealing any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any soldiers billetted on your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not accuse you of stealing the liquor, to regale the soldiers? - A. No; I never wronged him of half a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen the prisoner between that time and this? - A. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Brentford before the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Dr. Glasse, that it was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, and not six or seven, that he stole the gun? - A. No, I said between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said you thought Pedder had given him leave to take it? - A. I thought so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270025"></xptr>Q. Were you not surprised when he told you to hold your tongue? - A. It did not strike me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not surprise you that he put it under his coat for concealment, if he had liberty to take it; did it not strike you as very odd? - A. Yes, to be sure it did; I thought he had stole it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not mention it? - A. It did not make any difference to me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You overheard their conversation as you accidentally passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you at the door? - A. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw nobody else but Pedder, his wife, and the horse-keeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If Lander had been there, you must have seen him? - A. Yes; he might be in the passage, and I not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see a tile moved? - A. There was tiling off the place.</p>

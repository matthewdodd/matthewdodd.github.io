                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the General Post Office. The prisoner was a sub-sorter in the circulation department in the Inland Office—in consequence of information I made up a letter on Friday, 7th Dec—I put in it a sovereign, two shillings, and ten penny postage stamps—I directed the letter to Mr. T. Higgins, fishmonger, No. 3, Albion-place, Hyde-park-square, London—I had marked all the money and the stamps—it was a note with an envelope made of the other half of the paper—this is the sovereign, and these are the two shillings that I so marked and put in that letter—I marked them in presence of Mr. Gardner, and he marked them also—I sealed up the letter, and took it into the hall, and gave it in at the window to Mr. Gardner—that is the window where letters are posted for sending out—it was prepaid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers at the Post Office. On 7th Dec. I received from the last witness a letter—I locked it in an iron chest till the next morning—I then gave it to Mr. Scales, a sorter—I desired him to place it with other letters that the prisoner would have to take to another office—I then went in the letter carriers' office, where it was the prisoner's duty to bring those letters—I saw the prisoner come up and put some letters on the table—he then left the room, and I found that the letter which I had given to Mr. Scales was not amongst them—I came down and called the prisoner into my room—I told him that one letter which was known to have been in his possession was missing—he said he did not know anything about it—I said I was satisfied he had had it, and I asked if he had any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—he was searched in my presence, and this sovereign and two shillings were found in his coat tail pocket—the officer Smee took them—the prisoner was asked whose money that was—he said it was his own.</p>

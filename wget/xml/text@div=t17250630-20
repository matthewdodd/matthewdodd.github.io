At this Place they and Stockton (the other Prisoner) were drinking together upon the Saturday Evening that the Deceased was kill'd. Some Words pass'd betwixt them in Dutch, which I did not understand; but afterwards the Deceased got up, and challeng'd Smith to go into the Privy-Garden and fight him. Smith appeared very unwilling; but the Deceased went out at the Door, drew his Sword, and swore that he would fight with one of them. Smith went with him at last. Stockton follow'd them, and so did I and two or three more. When they came to the Privy-Garden, the Deceased stript, and drew first; but Smith said, We had better let Fighting alone, Peter: - The Point of my Sword is broke: - We have seen old Comrades, and why should we fall out? However, Peter would needs fight, and so they shook Hands and made several Pushes at one another. Smith wounded him. I was sent for a surgeon; and when I came back the Deceased was dead.</p>

             thus deposed: Peter Colme (the Deceased) and the Prisoners were quarrelling at the Bell Alehouse, and says Peter to Stockton, You think yourself a brave Fellow, but if you fancy you're a better Man than me, come out and I'll fight you. Stockton declin'd it; upon which Peter grew very passionate, went out, drew his Sword, and challeng'd either of 'em. I went up Stairs, and quickly after I was told, that Peter and Smith were gone to the Privy-Garden to fight. Stockton was still in the House; I desired him not to meddle. I do not intend it, says he, for I shall get no Credit by it. He and I follow'd the other two, and found the Deceased stript, with his naked Sword in his Hand. I had rather forbear Fighting, said Smith, for the Point of my Sword is blunted.</p>

             thus deposed: As I was coming by the Privy Garden, Stockton stood at the Gate-way, thro' which I saw two Men in a Posture of fighting. I had a mind to have gone in that Way; but Stockton having a Stick in his Hand, and looking very sower, I was afraid to venture by him, and so I ran round another Way. When I came to them, the Deceased was wounded.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners then made their Defence. While we were drinking with Peter, (said Smith) I gave the Maid Half a Crown to change for some Meat; upon which Peter bid her take all the Reckoning out of that Money. I ask'd him what he meant by it, and he told me that I was the Man that he took me to be. What Man is that? says I. Why, a Rascally Fellow, says he again. But if you are so bright a Man as you think yourself, come out and I will see you. I had no mind to quarrel, and so said but little more. Then Stockton and he went to Cards; Peter won several Games, and Stockton would play no more. Peter then ask'd me to play; but I deny'd him; upon which, some other Words arising, he went out, drew his Sword, and cry'd, Come out if you dare fight me. I went out and desired him to be quiet. He put up his Sword, and beckoned me to follow him, which I did to the Privy Garden, and there he drew again, and strips himself. Comrade, says I, What makes you so quarrelsome? You don't use to be so. If I have offended you, I will beg your Pardon. - You are a Coward, says he, to ask a Man's Pardon, before you have ty'd what he can do; and I will post you for such as one, if you don't fight. The Thames was just behind me and a Wall on each Side of me, so that I could not get from him. He stept up to me, and swore he would fight now. I told him the Point of my Sword was broke; but all that I could say to prevent the Engagement, signify'd nothing. I told him we would shake Hands first, which with much ado he did, and then we went to it. The Jury <rs id="t17250630-20-verdict110" type="verdictDescription">

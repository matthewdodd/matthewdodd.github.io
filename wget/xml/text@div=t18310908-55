               <p>ELEANOR TITTERTON. I am the wife of George Titterton; we live at <placeName id="t18310908-55-crimeloc324">57, Exmouth-street</placeName>

Last Friday week I was at home with my two children, and had three people at work in the workshop at the back of the yard; about five o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after, I called the prisoner to get tea, and heard a dreadful noise in the kitchen - I went down, and she laid there apparently in a fit, whether she was really so or not I cannot tell; the cry must have been heard by any person in the house - I went up to my bed-room on the first floor, to fetch her some brandy, and on opening the door I saw smoke; it was so great I did not see from what part of the room it came - I did not see a blaze; I saw it afterwards - it was put out by the inspector and serjeant of the Police; it had burnt the bed in part, the blankets, sheets, and a wool mattress, a chair, and several articles of apparel, but not the whole of any thing; the blankets,&amp;c. were on the bed - the wearing-apparel, when I left the room, was part on a chair, and part on the bed; a small part of the floor was seorched, which might have been done by the clothes falling from the chair; whether the wood-work of the floor had been on fire I cannot tell - I had not heard any body in the room; I was there for about ten minutes, about three o'clock, and all was safe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080040"></xptr>then; there had been an alarm about the kitchen chimney being on fire about two o'clock, and the prisoner helped Mr. Titterton to put it out - Jesse Davis, who was at work in the back shop, had given that alarm; there had been a disagreement between the prisoner and me on the Wednesday, and on the previous night I gave her warning to quit on the Wednesday - she did not use any particular expression then; she had gone out without leave.</p>
               <p>Q. If she meant to burn the house, can you conceive any motive besides the words on the Thursday night? -A. No; she never threatened me in any way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUSAIN. I am an inspector of the Police - I went to this house with the serjeant and constable; I got there a little after six o'clock, I think - I went up stairs, and found the back bed-room on fire; the blaze was ascending from the top of the bed and about the bed, about three inches high; there were no curtains nor hangings to the bed - the cane bottom of a chair, about a foot and a half from the bed, was burnt out; there were fragments of wearing apparel burning on it - I produce a piece of the floor that was burnt; that was all the damage that was done to the floor - it is deal wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose the wood itself has been in a blaze? A. No, I will not say that it has; it was immediately under the chair, and might be occasioned by the burning clothes falling on it; the chair was on fire when I entered, and the back nearly burned - the clothes were burning on this part of the floor when I went in; I threw water on the chair and put it out; this is the only damage done to the house, except that the door which was near the bed was scorched - there is hardly a doubt on my mind but if it had not been put out it would have set the house on fire, either by communication with the floor, or the chair communication with the closet, which contained a dozen or twenty pounds of candles; the chair was close to the closet - the bed was on fire; I extinguished the whole of that, and then saw the prisoner - this was about ten or fifteen minutes after I arrived - she was in the back kitchen, and appeared labouring under intoxication, and pretended fits - it was pretence, in my judgment.</p>
               <p>MRS. TITTERTON. The chair with the clothes on it was near the closet when I was in the room; I keep my candles in that closet - the prisoner knew they were there- the cupboard is locked occasionally, and I think it was so then.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOOTMAN. I am a Policeman. I went with Busain, and found the bed on fire, and the chair - I did not notice whether any part of the floor was burnt - I saw the prisoner in the kitchen as soon as I entered the house; she was stretched on the floor, screaming and hallooing, and when the serjeant left me in the kitchen, to take care of her, she was sitting in a chair, and cried for George - I asked what she wanted him for; she made no answer, and presently afterwards she said, "What shall my mistress say? Oh dear! what shall I do?" she called for George again - I asked what she wanted him for; she said the house was on fire, and to save the children - I said the fire was out, there was no fear of the children; there was a smell of fire, and the house was all in a smoke at the time; she afterwards called for George again - I said, "Here he is, what do you want him for?" she then held up her head, which was down before, looked about, and said, "He is not here;" he was not there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I went with Busain - I got there, to the best of my recollection, about five o'clock; the boy went up and opened the back bed-room door; the smoke was so strong he shut it again; Busain opened it - the room was full of smoke; we extinguished it a little with water; the smoke having disappeared, I could see fire on both sides of the bed, and in the middle of the bed; the fire on the left side was nearer the head than the other part; there was fire at the foot of the bed, and on a chair which stood by the fire-place, about two feet from the bed, and another chair at the foot of the bed was also burnt.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not the fire have communicated from the bed to that chair? A. I think not: I saw fire in six places; a piece of the floor was burnt - I think that had been done by the clothes falling off the chair; the floor had been on fire, but I did not notice it on fire; it was under the chair, and might have been done by the flames from the clothes which was burning on the ground, and had fallen from the chair; it might be done without setting the wood itself on fire.</p>

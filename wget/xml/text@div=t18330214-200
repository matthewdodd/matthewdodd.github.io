On the 7th of February the prisoner came into the shop, between four and five o'clock, and asked for a quarter of a pound of butter - I served him with it, he gave me a shilling, and I gave him sixpence, and 3d; he said, "I don't like the sixpence, give me copper," which I did; he then said, "You are charging me for 1s. butter" - I said Yes; he said he wanted tenpenny. - I then changed it, and gave him one halfpenny back; a man in the shop said something to me, and I looked into the till, where I had no shilling except the one he gave me; I perceived that it was bad, marked it, and put it on a shelf by itself - it remained there till I gave it to Smith, the officer.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Shaw. The prisoner came to the shop again on Saturday, the 9th of February, about half-past four o'clock, for half a quartern of butter - I said we did not make half a quartern, I would make him 1 1/2d. worth; he gave me a shilling, which I saw was bad immediately, and my fellow-servant spoke to me as I passed him; I immediately told the prisoner it was a bad one - Smith was called, and my master came up to me- I gave it to him; he held it in his hand, beckoned Smith in, and gave it to him in my sight; no money was found on the prisoner - the shilling was not out of my sight till the officer had it.</p>

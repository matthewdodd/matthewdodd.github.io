                  </hi>. I live at 10, White Lion Street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner came into my shop about nine o'clock on the 24th October, and asked to see some boots—I showed him some—he looked at one pair, and said that was not good enough—then he looked at another, and they were too large—my husband asked him to buy a new pair—he was about five minutes in the shop—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I am a shoemaker at 10, White Lion Street, Clerken<lb></lb>well, and carry on business in the shop under my dwellinghouse—when I went to bed on the 24th October I saw all fastened up—next morning, about half-past six, I found the shop door ajar, and seven pairs of boots missing from the shop window—I then went into the parlour adjoining, and found the shutters taken down and put under another person's premises—I think the persons got in at the parlour window—that was fastened the night before, and the shutters closed—I identify these boots as my property—they were in my shop when I went to bed, I am quite sure—I saw the</p>

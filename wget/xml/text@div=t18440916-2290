                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Hackney-road. John Cockran was my errand-boy—he went to school, but came to me when he was not at home—Mercy Cockran is his mother—on the 20th of Aug. I found two pairs of boots at Mrs. Hodges', in the Hackney-road, and one pair of boots at Mrs. Hockley's, and one pair Mrs. Foster brought to me—John Cockran was in my service at that time—I had not sold either boots or shoes to these parties—my wife and I sell boots—these are in a state to sell, and in a perfectly fit state to be sold—some of them have a stamp on them—these are the two pairs of boots and two pairs of shoes.</p>

I have known Mercy Cockran two or three years—on Friday, the 23rd of Aug., she came to me, and said she had got a boy at a shoemaker's in the road, and sometimes they had soiled shoes to sell cheap—I said, "If he has, he may bring them over to me, as they will do for my chil<lb></lb>dren as well as the best"—John Cockran was standing by her side at that time—on the Monday after John brought me a pair of boots, and said would they do for my children—I did not see those shoes in possession of Mercy Cockran—I had no dealings directly with her, and never saw any shoes in her possession.</p>

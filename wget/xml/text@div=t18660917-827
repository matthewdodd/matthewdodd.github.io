               <p>said, "Jones, have you paid the cheque away?"—I told him I had, and he said, "Mr. Day has given me the money; I will go to the City Bank and take it up"—I went to Whitechapel, to see if I could find the man—I walked all up and down Whitechapel—there is no such person there as Day—I then went to the City Bank—I did not know it was a forgery till the manager told me—I went and searched for the prisoner, and found him the next day—I said, "Prickett, you ought to be ashamed of yourself; I am a poor man"—he wanted me to give him till the next day—I said, "If you don't give it to me in ten minutes I shall give you into custody"—I advanced the full amount, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

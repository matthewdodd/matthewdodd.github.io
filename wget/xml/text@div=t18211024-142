            . I am surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 26th of October, I was attending the Session House Clerkenwell, as a witness, and had thirteen sheets of copper there, twelve were in a basket, and one was wrapped up in brown paper, and lay on the basket - it stood near the Grand Jury room; I did not observe the prisoner there, till I saw him with the parcel in his hand - I was two or three yards from him, he was carrying it out of the hall; he took it and put it on a persons knee, who sat in the hall - I took him in custody; he said a boy asked him to bring it to him, it is the property of

            . I am an officer. Moody called me, I took the prisoner in charge - he said a little boy desired him to carry them for him; I am sure he said carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before the Magistrate, that he said he was asked to remove it - A. He said "Carry it." I said I did not believe him, he then said a man offered him a pot of beer to carry it. I never used the word "Remove," before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your deposition read to you before you signed it - A. No; the clerk wrote as I spoke. I asked the prisoner to point out the boy, who asked him to carry it - he could not. I have not signed the deposition.</p>

On Friday evening, 17th Aug., I was on duty with Clifford, in Kennington-lane, at a little after 10 o'clock at night, and saw both the prisoners, and a third man—Robert was driving a cart on the other side of the road, and John and the third man were at the back of a waggon, which was standing about thirty yards from the cart—I saw them take a bale of goods from the tail of the waggon, go across the road and put it into the cart—I spoke to my brother constable, and immediately went and laid hold of the horse's head—while I was doing so, John Hackett was cutting at me with the whip—as I was getting into the cart, he and the man not in custody got out—I was knocked down with a life preserver, and then they ran to Clifford, and began beating him about the head with a life preserver—I immediately got up again, got into the cart, and as I got in John Hackett got out at the back—Robert escaped after getting out of the cart—the prisoners were right under a gas light, and I had full oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing them—I have no doubt they are two of the three men I saw—I saw Robert eight or nine days afterwards, about 1 o'clock in the morning, in the Borough-road, and took him into custody—he was with a female; and as I went up to take him, I heard him say to her, "I know the br wants me——"—I laid hold of him and told him I wanted him for being concerned with his brother, for a robbery on the 17th—he made no reply—John was taken that night.</p>

How often have you seen him in company with his brother, John? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six months ago, I think—I went with him to John's house, which was then behind a church in the Waterloo-road—it was just about tea time, about 5 o'clock—I had been taking a walk with Robert during the whole of the afternoon; it was on a Sunday—I saw John—I stopped about two hours—I never went there with Robert on any other occasion—I have never been walking with Robert and John—that is the only time I have seen him—he has never visited at my mother's house but once, and that was the same evening as I went to his house—John and Robert walked home with me—we all three went to my mother's—he did not stay there above five minutes—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. IVORY</hi>. That is false)—if my mother has sworn that he staid there for a couple of hours, that is not true—I am at Mr. Smith's, a brush finisher, in Osborne-street—I have lived with him ten months—I never was in a Court of Justice about any other matter.</p>

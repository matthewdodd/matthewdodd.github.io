On the evening of the 28th of June, Sarah Parry was brought to the hospital; the index finger of her left hand was shot off, and there was a wound on the left side of her neck; it was such a wound as a pistol shot would produce - the ball had been extracted before I saw her - I was obliged to take off the remainder of the finger; it was very much shattered indeed - the wound in the neck was a small wound in the centre, rather behind, it had penetrated about three inches; she was in danger for some time - the prisoner was brought to the hospital about an hour afterwards; he appeared to have been wounded with a pistol on the left cheek, just by the angle of the eye, and on the upper lip; the shot had passed from one to the other, there was a communication between the wounds.</p>

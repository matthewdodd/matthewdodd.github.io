            's between 11 and 12 o'clock, I heard there were several smugglers in town: I had been at the farmer's house about a quarter of an hour, when a man came and knock'd at the door, and told me, there was a messenger came, and wanted to speak with me at the next house; the answer I return'd was (it was only Dick Costings, and if he wants me I should be glad to drink a tiff of punch with him, for I should not stay here an hour.) Mr. Manning reply'd, you silly rogue, he will not come alone, for here are many rogues in town now. After this there came eight or nine men to the door, some I knew, and some were strangers; they wanted me; the farmer kept the door lock'd and said I should not go out, I saw the prisoner at the bar amongst them they broke into the house, and I fled into the barn.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you remember the prisoner from that time among so many?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He was remarkably dress'd, being stuck out with pistols and other arms in an uncommon way; he had a great many of them; they found me in the barn, and brought me to where they were assembled together at Mr. Pearson's; the first thing they, they block'd my face and put me across a stick, and made me what they call their member of parliament; they kept me there that night, then th me go to the farmer's house again one of who was a Yarmouth man; we smoak'd a pi ther, then I went to bed, and I had not there above a quarter of an hour before they and took me out of my bed and me in el manner, and carry'd me, and tied a rope about me and hang'd me across a tree, where I hung some time in much pain; the next day between twelve and two o'clock, they went to the Beech; there were upwards of forty of them, and I saw the prisoner at the bar among them; according to the best of my knowledge. they were one and all arm'd, but I will not swear particularly as to the prisoner being arm'd; some had blunderbusses, some one thing and some another; I went that way and saw them load there goods; it was in my way home; I saw the cutter come in, and told the smugglers of her as they were going along. According to the package of the tea and casks, it was intended to be run; the tea was in oil-skin bags, which held about 26 or 27 pounds weight each, and the casks were slung with ropes; I saw a general loading, and saw them go off in form, two and two, towards Winterton side.</p>
               <p>Cross examin'd. Should you remember the faces of either of these seven or eight you saw at that time, was you to see them now?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The prisoner was arm'd at that time in a very particular manner, which makes me remember him.</p>

               <p>Benjamin Rackstrow. On the 21st of April I was gone out upon business; when I return'd, I was told a person had stolen a little figure of Shakespeare, which I sell for about twelve shillings, and that the man was taken and committed. I went to Guildhall; there I saw part of the figure; I know it to be mine, by the manner of it's being repair'd; I know nothing of the prisoner, but by seeing him at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Wilkins. This was about a quarter of an hour before two in the afternoon, on Saturday last.</p>

               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. Because I was told there was a man suspected to be upon the same lay on the Friday, and I went on without disturbing him to tell them of this man.</p>

            . On Saturday the 21st of April I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr Rackstrow's shop, with a figure in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What figure was it?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. It was a figure of Shakespeare, about twelve inches high. As I did not know but that he had bought the figure, I did not stop him; I went in and ask'd if that man had bought a figure; they said, no; then I went to pursue him; he went up Flower-de-Luce-court with it in his hand; then I follow'd him, and took him almost at the bottom of Fetter-lane; I did not see him sling the figure away; I brought him back; then the people said there was a figure in an entry belonging to a Corn-chandler's shop; I went and found it, and brought the prisoner and that to Mr Rackstrow's shop; the figure being made of plaster, was broke by the fall; but I knew it again to be the same, and that it was in his shop when I went to dinner that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his shop?</p>
               <p>Hoskins. In Fleetstreet.</p>

               <p>I was going to Charing-Cross; I saw some people stop at this shop; I look'd into the shop, but never went in. Then I was thinking to go and see an acquaintance in Holborne, to have a pint of beer; so was running along to go there, when they stopp'd me; I never saw the figure?</p>

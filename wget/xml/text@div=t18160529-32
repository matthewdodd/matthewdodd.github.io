They were marked on the near hip with a wheel pitch mark. I left them in the care of Colman, my drover, and I never saw the lot again until they came to Smithfield. Then two were missing from the lot belonging to Tuckwell. I afterwards found them at Uxbridge, at a butcher's of the name of Maden. They were the same sheep; that was on the 21st.</p>

            . I am drover to Mr. Ebsworth. I saw the sheep on the night of the 17th, going down the lane, leading to Mr. Phelps's field; my brother took them out of the field the next morning. I did not miss any until they came here on Thursday night. When I droved them, I found two missing; They were Mr. Tuckwell's; that was Thursday night, the 18th. On friday afternoon, I enquired after them. On Saturday morning, I went to Maden's, and found the two sheep; they were the two I had lost; they were wethers.</p>

He told me that they were tired sheep; my master did not kill them. They were the sheep Colman saw. Winter told me he should call again by and by. My master went up to town to him.

            . On the Friday morning, my boy told me what had happened. Upon that, I went to the pig-stye, and saw the sheep. They were what were clamed by Mr. Ebsworth. I saw the prisoner the same day. He told me he had put in two tired sheep out of the drove, and wished I would kill them and send them to London. He wanted me to make a dead bill of them, and give him the money. I did not consent to that. That is not the regular course of business. We never give a dead bill before the sheep are dead and sold. He left word for me to kill them, and send them to London. I suspected something, and therefore would not.</p>

            . That is in the way from Southall to Uxbridge. In the afternoon of Thursday, I saw the prisoner at about two o'clock take two sheep athwait our green. I had seen him before, and knew him. He had only two; he and is dog were after them. He appeared to come from Southall, and went off for Ryslip, instead of going the nighest way to Uxbridge. That is the farthest way; It is going crossways; I think it is seven miles, or more, to go by Ryslip, and by the nearest road, it is only five miles; Ryslip way is a bad road, but is more private.</p>

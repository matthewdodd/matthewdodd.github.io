Near one o'clock on the 1st of July, my wife awaked me out of my sleep. I went to bed between ten and eleven, she told me to get up for she thought she heard a shoe fall, I got up and I went to the stairs and I looked down and I called to the apprentice,

            , and I asked him if he had been down stairs? he said no, he had not been down. I could see no light, and I went to bed again and told my wife I thought it was the rats; she was heavy with child, so with that I got into bed and told her to compose herself and go to sleep, and I almost got to sleep, and she said, Jim, get up for I cannot sleep; with that I heard a chair fall down and shoes on it, which made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you hear that there were thieves in the shop? - I jumped up immediately to the window and called watch, and while I was opening the window I heard the door bang, the outward street door, I called watch as loud as possible for the space of a minute, there was no assistance came, but the lamplighter was going by with his lighted torch, and I asked him for a light, and he told me my door was broke open, and I went down stairs and found my door wide open and my shop stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much you lost? - Yes, a great many things; here are some things found which are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know of your own knowledge who it was that did this? - I never saw any body.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When the lamplighter was going by I take it for granted if any man had been there you could have distinguished the features of his face, even without a light? - No, I could not, it rained very fast, I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. But perhaps the day might have been so far advanced as you might see a man's face that was at my distance from you? - No, I could not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Phipps sent for me on the morning that the robbery was done, I came to his shop, there was nothing particular then occurred till the pawnbroker stopped two women, and took one of them into custody, she is not here now, she is not one of the prisoners; I went to Ferns house in Parker's-lane, about two hundred yards from where the prosecutor lived, I believe he looks after a cart and horse for Mr. Maccoul, the builder, I searched the house and found nothing, I then asked Mrs. Ferns if she had not taken rooms somewhere else? I went to two other rooms which they had taken of Mr. Maplebank, there was a pair of shoes and a tea chest in the drawers which were in one of the two rooms which the prisoner Ferns said he had taken of Mr. Maplebank.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rooms locked? - Yes, they were, Mr. Maplebank had one key, I could not tell who has the other.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Maplebank? - He keeps a public house, and I believe he lets out horses and chaises, I have one pair of shoes that were found there, and here is another pair that was taken off his feet, them I have had in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say? - No more than apprehending him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended him what did he say? - He said very little to me, his chief discourse was to Mr. Perry.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray what are you? - I was an officer at Marlborough-street at that time</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been discharged for misconduct from Marlborough-street office? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Maccoul? - Mr. Maccoul was a builder, and Ferns was one of his labourers, I was told so, I believe he has worked for him this fourteen years; It was a woman that was stopped with the shoes, of the name of Pope.</p>
               <p>Q. That led you to Ferns house? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how comes it that Pope has not been produced here? - She was bound over upon evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken any pains to find out this Pope? - I called upon her and told her to mind and be in time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mrs. Doggett that has been in court, and received a reprimand? - Yes. This woman Pope swore she was sent by Ferns.</p>
               <p>Q. These pair of shoes that were found on the man's feet, was found eight days after the robbery? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. They were old shoes? - They had been worn.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you have known much of this man? - He was a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then this property that was afterwards found to be stolen, was lodged in Count's cellar, and not in Ferns's house? - Mrs. Doggett was in possession of the property, till noon day, and then it was removed to some other place.</p>

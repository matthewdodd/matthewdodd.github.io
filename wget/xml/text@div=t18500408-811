                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Greville-street, Leather-lane. On Sunday morning, 31st March, I was with Burge, going into a coffee-shop in Holborn, facing Gray's-inn-lane—the prisoner and a female were standing talking just inside the passage before you come to the inner door—the prisoner said to us, "Where are you coming to?"—we said we were going in to have some coffee—the prisoner said, "You are not coming here"—we said, "Why not?"—the prisoner hit Burge, and said, "That is why not"—Burge's nose <hi rend="italic">sprung out</hi> with blood, and three more from the street came upon Burge—I said to the prisoner, "That was a cowardly action;" and he rushed upon me, struck me, and threw me down—while I was down, the female who was with him struck me on the head till it bled—while I was down, the prisoner's hand was in my pocket—I had two half-crowns and a crown-piece there—I felt his hand there, and I took hold of my clothes to prevent his taking my money—he took his hand out, and I felt in the pocket, and missed a half-crown—I had had my hand in my pocket just before, feeling my money—the half-crown was found at the station—I did not carry that half-crown to the station only the one that I had still in my pocket—the policeman came up while I was bleeding—I said I had been robbed of a half-crown—the prisoner was brought forward, and I said, "That is the man,"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Shoe-lane. I saw Colby on the ground—I was first struck by the prisoner—I had not done anything to him—Colby spoke on my behalf, and then three rushed out on him—whether they knocked him down I do not know—I saw them on him—when he gave the prisoner into custody I was in the mob, looking for my hat, which I had lost—I saw the half-crown found under the prisoner's feet at the station—I did not carry it there.</p>

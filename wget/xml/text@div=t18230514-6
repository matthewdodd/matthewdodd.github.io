Anderson had them in his hand; they were delivered to me. The pocket book was inside the jacket pocket. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a shipwright. I was at work on board the Governor Harcourt. I frequently saw the prisoner lurking about the docks. On Saturday morning, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was coming ashore, and thought I saw something bulky in his breast - I looked and saw he had a new jacket on under his own. I told the chief mate, and we followed him to the bottom of Fox-lane - he turned into a stable yard; we went together, and met him coming out at the gate. I said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who had the jacket on" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I had no jacket on but this," and opened his breast to shew us. I said,</p>
               <p>"You must have left it in this stable," and went to look for it; but there was a passage leading from the stable where I did not search. Wood found it there.</p>

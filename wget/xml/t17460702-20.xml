               <p>Shelmondine. My Lord, I was coming by that Way, and saw the Prisoner by Mr. Tyler's Stall.</p>

               <p>Shelmondine. Yes, my Lord, he made Shoes for me. This Man (the Prisoner) was going from the Place, and the Door was left open; and away he goes, and I follow'd him; he walk'd pretty brisk ; there was a little Alley, and he goes across to the Market, and I lost Sight of him; but I came in Sight of him again: So I was going along by the Dead-Wall by Lincoln's-Inn; he thought he was pursued; he said, Good Morning to you; and that he had found some Shoes upon a Bulk : When he was ask'd what he had in his Lap, he let down his Apron and there were five Shoes.</p>

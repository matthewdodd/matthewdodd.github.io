                  </hi>. I am one of Her Majesty's Royal Body Guard; I live in Thomas Street, in the Borough. On 26th June, I was coming to London Bridge—as I was leaving the steam boat at Dyers' Hall Pier, I saw the prisoner steal my watch from my pocket—it had been secured by a guard—I felt the watch going from me, and felt the chain hanging down—I saw the prisoner leaving, and I rushed and seized him immediately—he was rescued from me by several of his party—I caught the ring and the guard chain, the watch was dragged violently from the ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I was on board the boat, and as the last witness was leaving, I saw the prisoner snatch the watch from his pocket—directly he did so a crowd surrounded him—I tried to get to him, but I was shoved back—the last witness seized the prisoner, and he was rescued by his own mates—I afterwards saw the prisoner in charge of Knight—he got away from him, and Knight was struck and knocked down—the prisoner had the watch in his hand—I took him—the watch was passed away—I held him till the officer came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police on the Eastern Counties Railway. On the evening of 2nd Dec, from information I received, I proceeded to the house of Mr. M'Namara—I went with him and a constable and a private individual to Bluegate-flelds, Ratcliff-highway—I found, on the top of a ladder leading to a loft, a number of bundles of baskets—that was the usual entrance to the loft, and that entrance was blocked up by those baskets—they were packed in bundles—there were ten or eleven bundles—I suppose about a dozen in each bundle: dry fish baskets—I pointed them out to Mr. M'Namara—I obtained permission to go round to the front of the loft—I got in, and found many hundred baskets—I could not get far enough in the loft to count them—numbers of them were marked—I took one, which is called a tally, off one bundle; this is it—I went from there to the Bird-in-Hand beer shop, in Church-street, Stepney—I found the prisoner Parker there officiating as landlord—I asked him if he were the owner of the loft where the baskets were—he, said he was—I asked him if he were in the habit of dealing in baskets—he said he did—I requested him to accompany me to the loft, which he did—when we got to the ladder that the baskets were on the top of, I took him up, and when he saw these eleven bundles of baskets on the top of the ladder he said, "I did not buy them, I did not take them; I know nothing about them; some of my <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> must have taken them in in my absence"—we then went round to the front of the loft, and on gaining admission I showed him a number of baskets, which I got from the piles marked—I asked him how he could account for the possession of them—he then commenced crying, and said, "Oh, don't ask me any questions; I am sure I cannot say; you see what is here"—Mr. M'Namara asked him what he gave for the baskets that were marked—he said 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—Mr. M'Namara said, "You know well, Parker, you had no business to buy them at 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they are worth a shilling each"—Mr. M'Namara identified all the marked baskets—I then asked Parker if he had bought any baskets from <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell (meaning Hyams)—he said he had repeatedly bought from Mitchell—I asked if he expected any from Mitchell that day—he said he was not quite sure, but he thought he did—he then asked me to allow him to have his wife brought into the loft—I did, and when she came he said to her, "Oh, my dear, see what trouble I have got in; I expected that b—y <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell would</p>

               <p>do this for me some day"—he said, "Was he here yesterday?"—she said, "He and his wife were at our house yesterday" (this was between 12 and 1 o'clock on the Saturday morning)—I asked him if he did not consider he was doing wrong in buying so great a number of baskets at so low a price—he sat down on a bundle of baskets, and cried a great deal, and said, "Ask me no more questions"—I told him to consider himself in custody, and took him to the station—I went from there to Mitchell's residence—I took Bounce about 6 o'clock on the Saturday morning, on the platform of the Shoreditch station—I asked him if he had delivered any baskets on the previous evening to any person on his way from Billingsgate to the Eastern Counties station—he said "No"—I told him to consider himself in custody for delivering eleven bundles to the other prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the first thing you said, that you charged him with an offence in delivering these baskets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I charged him with delivering the baskets, and I asked him if he knew me—he said, "Yes; you are Mr. Gavin."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not the first words used by Bounce, "Very well, Sir, I must go?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not to my recollection—I stated all that was said in an<lb></lb>other place, as near as I can recollect—I am not quite certain that I put any questions to him till I told him he was in custody, but I believe I did—I think I can swear that I put questions to him before I told him he was in custody—I will swear it—I touched him on the shoulder, and said, "Rounce step this way with me"—I said, "Do you recollect delivering eleven bundles of baskets on the way to the station last night"—he said, "No"—I said, "Not to <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell"—he said, "No"—I said, "You may consider yourself in custody for having delivered eleven bundles of baskets to <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell, in the Tenter Ground, Spitalfields"—this is my signature to this deposition. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition being ready contained these words:</hi> "This morning I took the prisoner Bounce into custody on the platform at our station, at 10 minutes past 6 o'clock; I told him I charged him with stealing a quantity of fish pads last night from a van he was driving from Billingsgate to the station—he said, 'Very well'—I asked if he knew me—he said, 'Yes; you are Mr. Gavin'—that was all that passed.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is quite true, but I ought to have added what I have stated now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to the prisoner Parkers public house, the Bird-in-Hand, you addressed him on the subject of these baskets, and he voluntarily gave answers to all your questions; and when you asked whether he was a buyer, or whether he dealt in them, he told you he was, and that he dealt with Mitchell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the baskets were blocking up the entrance—they were outside the door, standing on end against the door on the landing, so as to impede my entrance to the loft—Parker said they must have been brought in his absence; and he also addressed the owner of the shed, and said, "You know I have not been here the last three days;" and he said, "Yes"—and he said, "You can come to the police court and say so for me, can't you"—Mr. McNamara said to Parker in my presence, "You know you ought not to have bought them at</p>

               <p>that price," or words to that effect—I said the same words before the Magistrate—my examination was taken down in writing, and read to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that portion read to you before you signed the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly recollect it—my evidence was three-quarters of an hour in length—I think that statement was made by me before the Magistrate—I could not undertake to say—if I have not done so I ought, but I cannot undertake to say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you repeated the question how he could buy these baskets at 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would not answer; did you state that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—if I did not I ought to have done it—I believe I men<lb></lb>tioned the price, 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., before the Magistrate, but I cannot undertake to swear it—I should think if I heard the word reiterated once, I did eight or ten times—I believe I made use of the words 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before the Magistrate—I am not quite certain, so as to take my oath of it—I have taken a great many persons into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it, in the exercise of your duties, your habit to catechise prisoners in the manner you have told us you have to day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not my constant practice, but I do not wish to take a prisoner into custody till I have ascer<lb></lb>tained that there are lawful grounds for me to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you get to the loft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Through a gate which was opened for me—the loft is some distance down the yard—there were three examinations before the Magistrate; the case was remanded twice I believe—I attended the last two times, not the first—on the last examination an objection was made by Mr. Huddleston, that I had not given my evidence in full, but that you would examine me—that objection was then waived, and I was not further examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Arthur M'Namara, the prosecutor. He contracts largely with the mails, and other persons—he contracts to deliver fish at Billingsgate from the Eastern Counties Railway, and when the fish are delivered, it is our duty to take the empty baskets to the Eastern Counties Railway in bundles—on the night in question Bounce was in my father's service; he was driving a van that afternoon from Billings-gate—I went that evening to a yard in Bluegate-fields; I saw a cow-keeper, who belongs to the yard—I saw several bundles of baskets in the loft, besides some loose; I cannot speak with certainty as to how many—I suppose 300 or 400, some were marked—all those I recognised as the pro<lb></lb>perty of the persons for whom we deliver fish—I made out a list of those that were marked three or four days after we took them from the loft—there were eight baskets marked with blue and red stripes; they belong to Mr. Old—no other person delivers the fish from Yarmouth from the Eastern Counties Railway to Billingsgate—there were twelve bundles marked "T. W." for Mrs. Wright; and there were a good many others that were marked—it was our duty to send these baskets back to Yarmouth—about half of those which were in the loft were dry baskets, which had contained dry goods—the wet baskets were smaller—Gavin went from there to Parker's house, and Parker came back with Gavin—he was asked several questions about these baskets, whether he had them from <hi rend="italic">Solly</hi> Mitchell's—he said, "Yes"—he said he had not bought any that day, but he expected him to send him some—I asked him who he sold baskets to—he said, "To a butcher, at Barking"—I asked him how much for—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen"—I said, "You must be aware that they cost 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a down"—his wife came up stairs afterwards—he was very much excited; but I under<lb></lb>stood</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of this building. The upper part is occupied by Parker—it is my mother-in-law's—I manage it—Parker has had the shed two years—I have known him fifteen years—I live on the premises—Parker had not been there for three or four days, for I had to complain to him of the dirty manner in which his man kept the premises.</p>

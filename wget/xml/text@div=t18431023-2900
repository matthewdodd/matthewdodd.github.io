                  </hi>. I am a horse-hair manufacturer, and live in Minton-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey—I first became acquainted with the prisoner about the 2nd or 3rd of June, 1842—he went by the name of Felgate in the first instance—I always addressed him as Felgate, and he answered me—I have no recollection of bis ever stating that it was Felgate, but I was in the habit of seeing him three or four times a week, and always addressed him as Mr. Felgate—he always answered to that name at that period—he did not say his name was anything else—between the 17th of June and the 8th of Aug. I sold him goods to the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards called on him with a stamp, and was about to draw a bill as usual, in the name of Felgate and Wood, when he stated that Mr. Felgate had left the concern, and that the firm was now Charles Wood and Co.—I said I was surprised, as I had always taken him for Mr. Felgate—he said, "Oh no, that is your mis<lb></lb>take, to think my name is Felgate; my name is Wood"—he said the bill was to be drawn on Charles Wood and Co.—I drew the bill on Charles Wood and Co., and the prisoner accepted it as soon as drawn—I saw him accept it—it has not been paid—(<hi rend="italic">the bill was dated Aug. 8th, 1842—accepted, C. Wood and Co.</hi>)</p>

Wood and Co." up there on several occasions—I saw the bill heads—I do not remember seeing the name there—I knew of no change in the name till this bill was accepted—the goods were all supplied to Felgate and Wood previous to Christmas—and some time after this bill was accepted, a party named Thomas Ackhouse called at my manufactory, and said I was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>—I never heard at the pre<lb></lb>mises at Holborn that the prisoner was not Felgate or Wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture salesman, and live in Tibberton-street, Newington-causeway. I was shopman to the prisoner in Holborn from July to Sept. 1842—I never saw anybody there of the name of Felgate—the prisoner's name is Ridgway—I knew that at the time—there was a person there who passed as Mr. Wood—he was a menial or porter, who washed the passage, swept the shop, cleaned the front, and washed the glass—he did the offices of a menial servant—I do not know what his right name was, but I know it was not Wood, because he would not answer to it when he came there first—he did not know what his name was—he answered to it afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did you live in this place in Holborn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three months—the prisoner carried on the business under the name of C. Wood and Co. at the time in question, and did so for the last two months, or it might be more—I have been getting my living for the last seven months as a salesman and manufacturer of upholstery goods at Mr. Stewart's in the Lon<lb></lb>don-road—I serve in the shop, and work at upholstery and mattress making—I went to the prisoner's to do the same—I served my time, seven years, to the trade—his was the first place I had in London—before that I lived is Worcester, and carried on the same trade there on my own account—I had difficulties, and paid my creditors so much in the pound—I shall not my what unless told to do to by the Recorder—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound as far as I was able.</p>

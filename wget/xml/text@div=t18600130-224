I live at Old Brentford and keep an ale house—about half-past 8 on the evening of 23d January, the prisoner came to my place, and asked for half a pint of beer—she asked if I would allow her to warm her hands anywhere—I told her we had no room, but there were a few respectable persons in the parlour—I allowed her to go into the parlour—she tried to go out the back way—my husband told her she could not go out</p>

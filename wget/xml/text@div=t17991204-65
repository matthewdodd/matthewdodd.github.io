               <p>Belton. That is my half-crown; I had seen it about ten minutes before I went out; there are remarkable marks upon it: and I am sure that shillings and sixpence is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your bar, I believe, is a place to which every person that comes into the house has access? - A. No, only friends; I admit nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons serve in your bar? - A. Only my wife and daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not accuse a man of the name of Bryant with taking this money? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons your wife might have given change to that evening you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>

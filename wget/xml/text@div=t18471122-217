                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Richard Mitchell, a draper, of 19, Newington-causeway. On the morning of 18th Nov., the prisoner and another person came to my shop, the other asked for some bundle handker<lb></lb>chiefs—whilst I was serving him, the prisoner walked down to the lower end of the shop, went inside the counter, took up some pieces of satinet, and put them under his great cost—he then walked up to his companion, who I was serving—I said to him, "You have some silks under your coat"—he made no reply, but his companion, who had selected a sixpenny handkerchief, threw down a shilling, and both ran out of the shop, leaving the shilling and handkerchief on the counter—I got over the counter and ran after them—I laid hold of the prisoner about two doors away, and said, "You must come back with me, you have some silks under your coat"—I brought him back to the shop, and left him in charge of a neighbour, while I went up stairs to inform my master—when I came down satinet was on the counter—I had not seen it before I went up—the neighbour is not here who I left in charge of the prisoner, but Mr. Stillwell was also present—the other man escaped—the satinet is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have patterns of it here, but the stuff itself.</p>

                  </hi> I am a leather-shaver. I saw Langley lay hold of the prisoner, and followed them to shop—while Langley was gone up stairs I saw the prisoner, in a stooping position, pull from under his coat two pieces of satinet, and place them on the counter—they were the same that were afterwards produced before the Magistrate.</p>

On the evening of the 5th of February I and another person examined that box - there were nine packages of vermillion in it, to which I had affixed my initials some time before; I locked the room, and had the key in my possession till between ten and eleven o'clock the next morning, when I opened it again, but I did not look at the vermillion at that time - the labourers are not permitted to go to the inner store-room, except by permission of Mr. Clutton or me; that is a well-understood rule in the factory, and applies to all the persons there - on that day the prisoner was sent to that room by Mr. Clutton, in my presence, for some nails; I was busy, and did not particularly notice the time he was gone - about half-past five o'clock, on the same day, I went to look at the vermillion, and there were only six packages - these three were gone; I went to Mr. Gibbins' house, which is about three-quarters of a mile off -I then came back, and in consequence of what Mr. Cluttion said, I went to the privy with a light, and found Turvey sitting on the seat; I said I wanted him - he said,"Very well;" he waited a few minutes with the door open - he then got up, and began to button his clothes: he then said he had a bowel complaint, sat down, and pulled the door too - he staid a few minutes, then followed me into the factory, and from thence into the kitchen, where Mr. Gibbins and the officer were; I went into the privy again, and saw these three packages of vermillion on a beam which runs through the privy, near the top of it - it is a broad stay-beam, of the factory; the prisoner could reach that beam, but a person an inch shorter, I should think, could not - these packages are three which I had marked; I then went to the kitchen, and called the officer - he went with me, and I saw him take the packages down; I examined them directly; the privy is near the bottom of the stairs, on the ground floor, not in any yard - there were four labourers employed on the premises that day, besides Mr. Clutton and myself; I should think no person could have gone to the privy without attracting the attention of some of those persons - there was no opportunity of concealing these packages, unless by putting them into the soil; from the front of the warehouse I think you go twenty-five yards to the steps, then up a flight of steps to the store-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. A man an inch lower than the prisoner could not have reached the beam? A. I think not - we had measured his height a few days before; he is five feet nine inches - I have had no quarrel with him; persons come to the factory to bargain for articles, but no one came that day - I was there all day; no one could come without my knowing it - I believe Mr. Gibbins has seven children, four maid-servants, and one man; I opened the store-room door in the morning, and did not lock it again - I left the key in the door; I cannot swear whether any body in the warehouse might have gone into that room - the prisoner went there about one o'clock; I was very busy, and did not go into the room for four hours and a half afterwards - I went to the prisoner in the privy, and do not know whether I disturbed him - the door was open, so that any one might have seen what he was doing; after he had shut the door he might have thrown it down the privy, but the soil was too stiff to conceal it, and he had nothing to push it in with; I had not seen Mitchell in the privy just before him - the prisoner lived near the factory; the men go to dinner at one o'clock - it was just before dinner that he was sent to the store-room; he went home, and had an opportunity of leaving it at home - we rub down the men before they go; I rubbed the prisoner down that day; I did not tell the Magistrate I neglected to rub him down at one o'clock- it was neglected when he went out at half-past seven in the evening with the horses; he had a coat on, but had no pockets in the tail of it that he could have carried the vermillion in; I have seen the coat, and he has told me so many times - he certainly might have put a package in the hind part of his breeches; I had gone into the room several times - I do not know of any other person going in but the prisoner; other persons might have gone - Mr. Clutton sent Turvey to the room.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Do Mr. Gibbins' servants live in the factory? A. No - they live at his house, which is three quarter of a mile from there; it is known that the men are rubbed down - the prisoner has told me he had no pockets in his coat, and I think he could not have had any packages without my knowing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whereabouts is the privy? A. I should think about twenty yards from the stairs, where you go up to the upper factory, and to the store-room - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190033"></xptr>look at the packages when I opened the door about eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Gibbins. On the 7th of February, about one o'clock, I desired the prisoner to go into the inner store-room for some nails; I thought him gone rather longer than there was occasion for - I and Millson are the persons authorised to give permission to go into the room; I did not desire or give permission to any one else to go that day; about half-past five o'clock three packages of Chinese vermillion were missed; I consulted with Millson, and he went to inform Mr. Gibbins - I remained in the factory; while he was gone I kept a watch upon the prisoner, but endeavoured to conceal from him that I was watching him till Millson's return; Millson rang the bell, which adjoins the factory where I reside; I went into the factory with him - I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing while Millson was gone; after his return he expressed himself as violently affected with the bowel complaint; but before that he had asked me whether he should not go and fetch in some tiles; I said No, as the following day would be Sunday, and there would be time for the truck to get dry- his going to get the tiles would have afforded him an opportunity of going off the premises to the front court: he also mentioned about going to fasten some doors, and I said I had seen to that - I think it was about a quarter before eight o'clock when he mentioned about this affection of his bowels; he repeated it soon after, and went to the privy - he did not take a light: I believe the lights were standing where we were, and where he had been at work - I did not go to the privy in consequence of what Millson said till after the men were gone; articles of this sort could not have been concealed under the soil without being hardly pushed down, for during the hard frost we had been very short of water, and had not let down more than was just sufficient to clear the pipe, and had not let the boy stir it up as usual, by that means the top had become hard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the trouble of measuring the soil in that privy? A. Yes; it was ten inches deep; all the workmen had access to that privy - the soil had not been frozen, but it was stiff; I suppose the storeroom is about twenty yards from where I was - I had only that distance to have gone if I had chosen to go, but we were busy, as we were fearful a load of goods would not be in time for the docks; the vermillion had been marked by Million, by Mr. Gibbins' orders; Millson was heading up a tierce - I believe the prisoner has been about twelve months in Mr. Gibbins' employ; persons do come to the factory - I do not know whether any person came there that day; Millson does sometimes rub the men down, and I do sometimes - I will not say I rubbed the prisoner down that day; I believe I rubbed one man down.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is there not a particular hour of the docks at which goods are taken in? A. Yes; they object to taking in goods after three o'clock; I was on the premises when the men went to dinner, and at two o'clock I returned to the factory - I was in the store-room the greater part of the time after that; I did not observe any one go into the store-room till Millson came in - the other men were in the factory at half-past seven o'clock; they leave at eight.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you were in the room, what is the reason you did not look at the vermillion? A. I was busy; I could have done it, but I did not.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Mr. Gibbins'. On the day these things were missed I was sent to the warehouse over the way, to pack two casks - the prisoner was with me; he asked me which was the dearest colour I ever knew; I said I believed crimson lake, and I thought it was about five sovereigns a pound; he then asked what vermillion was a pound; I said about eight shillings - I did not go that day into the inner store-room for any purpose; I went to the privy about ten minutes before eight o'clock, I believe - the prisoner came down soon after, and said he wanted to go down very bad, as he had had a pain in his inside all day; he said to me, "Make all the haste you can, as I want to go there very bad;" I went, and when I came back I met him going down - I know the beam which runs across the privy; it forms a sort of shelf- I did not observe any thing on that beam while I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you particularly observe the beam? A. No; if the prisoner had chosen, he might have waited till I went away, and then I should not have seen him; I cannot exactly say how high the beam is, but I do not suppose the prisoner could have reached it without standing on something - a person much less than him could have reached it by standing on the seat; all the most valuable colours are kept in the store-room - I do not know that we had any crimson lake; Chinese vermillion is the most valuable colour we have there.</p>

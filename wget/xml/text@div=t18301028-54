On the 13th of October I heard a noise in our passage, and the servant ran up to me; in consequence of what I heard I came down, and saw the prisoner in custody of two men - they asked if this coat and waistcoat were my father's; I said Yes; the prisoner was then taken to the watch-house - one of the men said the saw the prisoner come out of our house, but he did not particularly observe him - that he had these things under his arm; the girl told him the things had been taken, and he followed him, saw him stopped, and he believed he dropped something, but he did not see him - the other man said he saw the prisoner drop this coat and waistcoat; the prisoner did not say any thing till he was before the Magistrate.</p>

I saw this man running from the prosecutor's - I did not see him come from the house; I saw something dropped by him, as it appeared to me - there were several persons running, but the prisoner was the first; I really believe he dropped them - I certainly saw him stopped.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

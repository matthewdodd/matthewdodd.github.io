                  </hi>. I am a constable belonging to St. Katharine Docks. On the 11th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up the stairs in the Dock-house—the prisoner was a weigher in the Customs, but he was then acting as locker in the warehouse C—I believe he had no business through the dock-house—there is a regulation that they are not to go through the dock-house—as I was going up the staircase, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner going towards the back yard—he had his great coat on his arm—I watched him, and saw him underneath the door-way, between two doors, in a kind of arch-way—I saw him lift up his coat, and adjust it on his arm, and smooth it down—in consequence of what I saw and thought, I stopped him, as he was coming out of the gate opposite the Mint—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Pray let me go back; let me go back"—I said, "No; I will see what you have got: you must come into the office"—I took him into the office, and searched his great coat—I found in the pockets two quart bottles of brandy, and his other pockets were full of currants, principally from Zante—I found in the coat pocket he had on two pint bottles of brandy, and his hat was nearly full of currants; he could scarcely keep it on his head—these are the currants and the brandy—there is a box on the quay, letter C, which he had the key of—he gave me the key—I opened the box, and in his desk I found 5lbs. of loose currants, similar to those he had on him—when I found these things, I asked him where he got them—he said he had them given to him—I said, "By whom?" and he said he could not tell me—he said the fact was, it was no use to get others into trouble; he would not tell me; he did not intend to tell me—he said he was very sorry for it—in the C</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse-keeper of the letter C warehouse in St. Katharine Docks—it is a fruit warehouse—the prisoner was doing duty at that warehouse as a customs locker, that is to unlock the ware-house in the morning, and to lock it at night—the Dock Company has the care of the warehouse, but he would have a double lock over the warehouse at night against me and all the world—in letter C warehouse there were butts of currants—they are very heavy—most of them weigh a ton—if the prisoner had been disposed, he had opportunities of taking the currants—the casks are bound down, but we are frequently opening them for grocers and others to look at—I have known thirty or forty opened in a day—I have looked at the currants produced from the prisoner's hat and pockets—currants are very similar—these are such as were in the tons in the C warehouse—on the 11th of April some of these currants had been landed from the <hi rend="italic">Zante</hi> packet, but none of them had been warehoused—I suppose these currants were out of different casks, but they are so mixed you cannot distinguish them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I presume they are there till they are taken out of bond? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they are frequently opened during the day, for the purpose of being shown to customers—here are some which I took out of several packages and mixed them, to show that they will assimilate to those taken on the prisoner—I have taken some from the <hi rend="italic">Zante</hi> packet, but they will not agree with those taken from the prisoner—they come in large packages and in small ones—they never leave any quantity in the vessels—I know that a quantity escape on the voyage—they mostly fall down amongst the cargo, and are lost—if they were found they would not be of much use—when the gro-cery have looked at the casks, they are nailed up, at soon afterwards as it is convenient—I do not know that any were opened on that particular day—when casks are opened, the foreman of the warehouse is present—he is not here—the prisoner had full access to where the <hi rend="italic">Zante</hi> vessel was unpacking—I never heard of the mates of vessels giving a quantity of currants—I have heard of smuggling, which is getting articles out of bonded places, and not paying the duty-these currants were in a bonded place—the <hi rend="italic">Zante</hi> packet is a ship.</p>

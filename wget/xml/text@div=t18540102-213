                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at Deptford. On 22nd Nov., I was with a man named Thomas Brosnahan, at Deptford, he was brought up there with me from a boy—between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was with him coming through New King-street to go home—we had not been drinking together that morning, or the night before—I know a place called Barnes'-alley, Deptford, I lived there at one time—we were on the opposite side to Barnes'-alley, passing it going towards home—I heard persons talk<lb></lb>ing as we came towards the alley—I could see them, but I could not tell who they were, it was very foggy—I heard a woman speak—I did not go near them till I was called—one of the women called Brosnahan by name first, and then she called me—Brosnahan crossed over to them before me, and I followed when I saw him down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at No. 4, Banes'-alley, Deptford. On Monday night, 22nd Nov., or Tuesday morning, I was in New King-street, talking with a person named Mrs. Dyball—we were near the corner of the alley where I live—while there, three foreigners came up, and began talking with me—the prisoner is one of them—he asked me would I go home with him all night-—he spoke in English—I said "No"—at that time I saw Brosnahan and Sullivan on the opposite side of the way, in New King-street—I did not call to either of them—Brosnahan crossed over from the other side of the way to this man, and asked him what did he want to do with the two women that were standing at the corner of Barnes'-alley—the prisoner made answer, and said, "Nothing," and then Brosnahan hit him in the side of the head, and ran down towards the Dockyard.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Brosnahan a friend of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I knew him before, but he was no friend—I knew him before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was rather a dark foggy night was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not very foggy, nor very dark, because it was close by the lamp where Sullivan was stabbed—I did not see a brother of the prisoner afterwards; I cannot swear to <hi rend="italic">e'er a one</hi>, only to this man here—I saw him when he came up to me-—the other two men were with him at the time—they did not talk to me, only this man; the other two never spoke a word—that is the only reason I have for being positive about him—Brosnahan hit the prisoner on the side of the head; it was with his fist, he struck at him with his fist, it was not a violent blow, nothing particular—he then ran down to the dockyard, calling for Sullivan—the three foreigners ran after him as Boon as ever he ran.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then Sullivan did not come over directly and find them fighting on the ground by you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was then that Sullivan ran after them—I saw Sullivan on the opposite side of the way before he was struggling on the ground—that was while we were all standing at the top of Barnes'-alley—I did not see him strike any of the foreigners before he was struggling on the ground; he ran after them and followed them up—he caught the pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not see him catch him, I ran down and saw him lying in the gutter—I missed sight of the man he was following—I ran up and saw what I have described, it was a momentary thing—the foreigners then ran away—the prisoner was the first man that was brought back—I cannot say whether Brosnahan was drunk, or whether Sullivan was the worse for drink—I had not been taking anything—Mrs. Dyball was quite drunk, she could not recollect anything of the transaction—she followed after me—there was no other woman standing with me at that moment—the prisoner was dressed as he is now; he had his coat buttoned, and he had a red shirt on; I could not tell whether they had all red shirts—I cannot say whether foreign sailors generally wear red shirts—the one I saw had a red shirt on, I did not observe the others—I did not observe at all how the others were dressed: I did not take notice of them—they were not struggling with any one that I noticed—after Brosnahan hit this man on the head he ran away, calling out, "Help, Jack Sullivan!" and then Sullivan ran direct across the road after the foreigners—there were no others running after them besides Sullivan and Brosnahan, only me and Mrs. Dyball—I was not screaming out till I went to the dockyard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 27). I was on duty at the dockyard gate on the morning of 22nd Nov.—I remember a knocking taking place at the gate—I opened it, and went out into the road—I saw Sullivan and Brosnahan there—they were both wounded—Brosnahan was close to the gate, and Sullivan was across the road, about seven or eight yards from the gate—Bates ran after some men down Dock-street—I afterwards heard him call out, "Stop him!" and I knocked the prisoner down with my hat—I did not take him to the station, or search him—Hassell, 183, came up at the time—as soon as he was down I secured him—Bates came up, and he and Hassell took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the morning of 22nd Nov. I was called to the police station to see Sullivan—I found an incised wound on the right groin—I did not see any immediate danger—he was sent to the Hospital—I examined the wound—I found nothing but venous haemorrhage, and no communication apparently with the intestines, so I did not consider the wound dangerous—I introduced my finger, and it was quite lost in it, and could go no further—I mean, the wound was deeper than my finger would reach—there was no arterial injury—a sharp knife would inflict such a wound—it is very probable that the knife produced would inflict such a wound—it corresponds with the external character of the wound; the point not being sharp would have nothing to do with the external character of the wound—no one could tell whether it was done with a sharp knife, or such a knife as this—it was a clean cut—the wound was outwards and upwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital. Sulli<lb></lb>van was brought there on 22nd Nov.—he had a deep wound in the groin—when he came in, I thought it was a dangerous wound from the state he was in; he bled a great deal, and he was in a very weak state—he remained in the hospital till 26th Dec.—I examined the wound, and passed my finger up three inches—I should say the wound had been inflicted by a knife about four inches long, and rather more than an inch broad.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that knife (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not think this was the knife that produced it, from the appearance of the wound; it was deeper than this blade; the mouth of the wound was an inch and a quarter long; it might have been enlarged in drawing out the knife.</p>

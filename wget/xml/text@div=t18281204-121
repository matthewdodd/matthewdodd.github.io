               <p>Q. At the time you had him at the door was any other person near you? A. No one: while I was in the act of lifting the latch to open the door, I received a stab, but what with I do not know; previous to my getting him to the door, he held me by the collar of the coat with both hands, till we got to the door, and while I was in the act of lifting the latch he let go his hold altogether; and the door being locked and latched, while I was trying to open it, I received a stab - I left something prick me very sharply; I did not see the prisoner do any thing with his hands, as my head was turned towards the door: when I first removed him from the bar, he had some money in his hands - he put it into his pocket, and seized me by the collar; the other persons were about six feet from me at the time - I have measured it since; there was no one else near enough to have done it - I kept my hold of him all the time, and got him out at the side-door, which leads into a coach-yard; two brother watchmen and a patrol came to my assistance - I found blood running down my thigh; I moved my hand down, and found my fingers all over blood - the patrol and watchmen asked me what was the matter; I said, "This rascal has stabbed me!" I found my clothes had been penetrated - I turned them up, and saw blood gush out from my shirt - here is the shirt I had on, and my watch coat also; there is a hole in it corresponding with she wound in my side: I gave the prisoner in charge of Lyons, and gave the two young men who were with him in charge also - they were taken to the watch-house: I went to a surgeon, and got my wound dressed; I returned to my beat, and remained there the rest of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the two when your face was towards the door, as you were endeavouring to unfasten it? A. About six feet from me; I could see them - they were not behind me - I held the prisoner with one hand, and the men were sideways while I was opening the door; they used the utmost exertion to get him from me, till I got within six feet of the door - there was nobody at the door but me and the prisoner when I received the stab; I said the others were within three or four feet of me, but I have since measured it - he was examined three times; I said at all those examinations that it was three feet - I had not then been to the house; I did not measure the place till after the examinations: there was no rush forward at the time the door was being unfastened - the attempt to rescue was at the further end of the bar; they tried to rescue him from the bar, and have been held to bail for it: I went and knocked a surgeon up - he dressed my wound, and I returned to my beat; I have been on my duty every night- there was no occasion for me to be confined: the attempt to rescue was a long time before we got to the door- the waterman took off one, and I got rid of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you got to the door these men were quiet? A. Yes, and I afterwards gave them in charge; the prisoner held me by the collar, with both hands, all through the piece, till I came to the door - he had a kind of white frock-coat on, not a great coat; it was buttoned up: this is a watering-house.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. You took him in charge by request of the landlord? A. Yes, I took him out at his request; I was perfectly sober, and he appeared so.</p>

            . I am serjeant of the watch. I was on duty on the morning of the 17th of November, between one and two o'clock in Holborn, and hearing a noise. I went into the Coach and Horses; I found Baker and the prisoenr there - the first word I heard Baker say was, "I am stabbed!" he said to the prisoner, in a short time, "Come forward - you are the villian who has stabbed me; you know you are;" I did not hear the prisoner make any reply - if he had I think I must have heard it; I gave him into the hands of Lyon, another watchman - I cannot say whether he had a knife about him; I was not more than five or six yards from him, when the prosecutor told me he had stabbed him: after Baker gave him in charge he knocked at the public-house door, went in, and called me in - there were two men standing at the bar; he gave them in charge. I afterwards went to the watch-house - we searched all the three men; I found no instrument on the prisoner - I returned with Stiggell to search for the instrument Baker had been stabbed with; the house was shut - I knocked, and Scarf opened the door; I got a light, and found a knife in the passage, between the door and the end of the bar, not two feet from the door - it has two blades; one was open: the prosecutor examined it by the light at the watch-house, and pointed out one spot on one side of the blade - it appeared to be blood, and next day I examined it more particularly; it appeared to be blood, dried, on one side of the knife: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040054"></xptr>saw the cut in Baker's clothes, and saw blood come from the wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you get there? A. About a quarter-past two o'clock; the prisoner was then in custody - I saw nobody but two watchmen there; I should think it is not more than six feet from the end of the bar to the door; the place where they usually drink is five, six, or eight yards from the door, I should think - I found the knife between the end of the bar and the door; the door opens to the left, and immediately behind it was the knife: I did not hear the prisoner say he could not have done it, as he had no knife - Lyon had got hold of him; my attention was attracted another way - I might be four or five yards off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you saw the whole from beginning to end? A. Yes, in the house; I put the gas out to make them leave off tossing - that was before Baker came; it was lighted then - I did not hear the landlady ask Cole to light it - I do not know who lighted it; there was a candle burning in the bar - the prisoner and three or four more were at the bar when I went for the watchman; they belonged to the prisoner's party - I cannot exactly say how many there were; I told the Magistrate there might be six - there were more than the prisoner and two others - they all remained there till the watchman came; I recollect nothing about a rush towards the door when Baker was lifting the latch - he seized the prisoner by the collar of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seize him by the breast? A. Not till there was a general scuffle among the whole of them, then he first seized him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the morning of the 13th of November Baker came to me; he had a superficial wound on the right side of his abdomen, which I dressed - it appeared to have been done by some sharp instrument; I have seen the knife produced and his clothes together, and undoubtedly the wound might have been inflicted by such an instrument; the outer coat was extremely thick - it penetrated only one fold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a superficial wound? A. Yes - it had hardly passed into the integuments - it was a perfect cut, which you would ordinarily inflict on your finger; I put a piece of plaister on it, and afterwards put another piece on.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Gibson, a baker, who lives in Grenville-mews: the prisoner is my fellow-servant; I went to the Coach and Horses with him on this night - there might be eight or nine there with us drinking together - I did not see the tossing - I had my back against the settle; Scarf put the gas out, to get the house cleared - at the time the watchman was sent for, the whole eight or nine were about the bar; the watchman took the prisoner somewhere by the neckcloth, and dragged him away very violently; I look upon it, it must have gone so far as almost to strangle him - the prisoner resisted as well as he could; three or four more stood behind; there was a rush altogether towards the door - they all went to the door together.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time, while you were there, were the watchman and prisoner struggling together, away from the others? A. No - they were altogether when the watchman got out of the door, and complained of being wounded; Cole has been six or eight months in Gibson's service - I never saw him with a knife in my life, and have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040055"></xptr>reason to believe he had none, for I have known him borrow one of master to cut the washers for his wheels; he had his coachman's coat on, and it was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Mr. SMITH. Q. What colour was his coat? A.A drab one; my only reason for saying he had no knife, was his having borrowed one - during no period was he and the watchman separate from the rest; I persist in swearing that; I am a glass coachman, and was never here before.</p>

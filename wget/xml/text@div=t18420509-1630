                  </hi>. I live in Nowland-buildings, Leather-lane. I am a private watchman at Thavies-inn, Holborn—I saw the prisoner about a quarter before nine o'clock on Saturday morning last, in Thavies-inn, with these five books under his arm—there was another man with him—they stopped at No. 4, Thavies-inn, placed the books on the step of the door, and the prisoner put them in an old silk handkerchief—I spoke to the other man—they were three doors apart from each other, and the prisoner was not near enough to hear what I said to the other man—the prisoner went out of the Inn with the books under his arm in the silk handkerchief—I went after him—he went to the corner of Bartlett's-buildings—I took him, and told him I wanted him to come with me directly—I gave him in charge to an officer about four doors below Bartlett's-buildings—I then took the prisoner to Mr. Darton's, and asked him in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, whether the property belonged to him—he said "Yes."</p>

No—I spoke to the other man because he looked a suspicious character, and likewise the prisoner—he trembled at the time I spoke to the other man—I was at the door of No. 2 in the Inn, speaking to one of my employers there—they passed by me, and stopped—I asked them what they wanted—I did not speak to the prisoner—the other man made answer that he Came up the wrong turning—there is no thoroughfare through Thavies-inn—there is through Bartlett's-buildings into Fetter-lane—the prisoner was stopping when I overtook him in Bartlett's-buildings.</p>

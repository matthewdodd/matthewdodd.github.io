                  </hi> I am sexton for the time being of St. Matthias District Church, Bethnal-green. It has a district belonging to it—it is a new Church, and has been formed into a district under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners—the Rev. Joseph Brown is the minister—it is my duty to attend at the Church, to clean it, and see that the things are in proper order—I went in on Friday evening 20th of April, at five o'clock, and left at a quarter-past seven; I then left it safe, and in its usual state—I was called up by the police about half-past two, went to the Church with them, applied the key to the door, and it opened in the usual way; we went into the Church and found that an entrance had been effected by a window which had been forced open, and it appeared as if persons had been in the Church—we found that an upright gas burner near the window, which bad been forced open, had been removed, and we found another upright one, which had been fixed with screws to the pews, had also been removed—I also found that two money-boxes, which were fixed with screws, had been broken open; one was partly demolished, and lying on the floor—we afterwards found that another gas burner, which had been suspended from the gallery, had been removed and taken away, and four glass globes had been removed from their places; two remained in the Church, and the other two were broken—I have since seen the pipes and one of the gas pillars.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is Mr. Brown, the Incumbent, here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am confident he is the Incumbent—I have been there five years; he does duty, and is the head of the clergy attached to the Church, and he stiles himself the Incumbent—I believe the Church was built under Sir Robert Peel's Act—there are two churchwardens appointed, their names are Kilby and Evans—the clergyman generally takes the money out of the boxes on a sacrament Sunday, or perhaps two or three times a month—the last service was on Thursday week, 19th—I was there then—I cannot say whether there was any money in the boxes then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman H</hi> 91). On Saturday morning, 21st of April, between two and three o'clock I was on duty, and saw two boys walking backwards and forwards in front of the Church—I watched a few minutes, and hen heard the gate in the railings round the Church open—I watched a few minutes longer, heard the gate shut, and then saw the two boys coming towards where I was, outside the railing—I then ran across the road and laid hold of the prisoner, the other boy ran away—I asked the prisoner what he had got about him—he said, "Nothing"—I searched him and found two pieces of gas pipe underneath his coat, and another piece in his outside coat pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then took him to the station, and found a small screw-driver</p>

On Sunday morning, 21st of April, when I was going to my work about a quarter before six o'clock, I saw a gas pipe lying opposite to my gate, which is about 300 yards from the Church, and about 300 yards from the gate the policeman has spoken of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Henry Glue, a boot and shoe manufacturer, of 153, Euston Road—on 5th September, I went into the City with some notes for Mr. Glue, and I had to meet Miss Napper at 10.15, at the Mansion House, and receive a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note from her which I did, and then went to the London County Bank, Lombard Street, where I opened my book to look at the address, a man asked me if I could direct him to Mincing Lane—I heard some one approach me and turned my eye on to him—I directed him and noticed nothing further—the prisoner is the man-immediately I got into the bank I missed the M. note—I did not know the number of it, but I went to the Hampshire Bank and from there, to the Bank of England, where I arrived at 11.15 and found that the note had been paid in there—on 20th September, I went with Trafford to the prisoner's house at Upper Hill Street, Peckham, and from what passed, I gave him in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 281). On 20th September I went with Mr. Drake to Commercial Road, Peckham, where we saw the prisoner in his room—I told him I was a detective, and had come to enquire of him how he became possessed of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which had been traced to his possession—he said that he could not tell me how he got it, but he might have got it at the Streatham meeting, as he had been there with a gentleman from Tatter salts, and he could not account for it in any other way—I asked him if he knew a man named James Groom, at Bow—he said "No"—I asked him if he would be surprised to learn that a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at the Bank of England bore his endorsement; he said that he should be surprised, and after a little hesitation, Drake said that if that was the only account the prisoner could give, he would be given in custody—the prisoner then called me on one side and said that he might as well</p>

               <p>tell me all about it, that Groom was the man who brought him the note one morning to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he owed him, and he had accompanied him to the City to get it cashed, and he supposed that was how the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes went there; he heard that they went to Moses Son, and paid for some clothing, and he put his endorsement on it, and that he supposed I should not take him in custody—I took him to Bow Lane station; I went to 63, Kingsland Road, the address on the note and made enquiries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He suggested that I should go with him to a friend of his to try and find out where Groom lived, but I refused—I have received a description of Groom, and it tallies with the prosecutor's description of the man who robbed him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WARRINER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are an Excise officer? - A. I am inspector of the Excise watch: On Friday morning, the 13th of November, between twelve and one'clock, just after midnight, I was upon the quays; I saw the prisoner come on shore from the craft, his employment was to watch from six o'clock till twelve, when his partner was to relieve him; there were thirty-three casks of Spanish brandy in the craft just off Custom-house-quay, within five yards of the shore; I saw the prisoner come out of the craft when his partner came to relieve him; I took hold of him and rubbed him down, when I found a bladder in his coat pocket; he said, what do you mean by that; I told him he must go with me to the office; he went with me to the office door and then he got away; he ran up St. Dunstan's-hill as fast as he could; I cried out stop him, and he was stopped by two men in Cross-lane; I was very near him; I took hold of him again, and a watchman took hold of him on the other side and we brought him to the watch-house; I there searched him again, and found on the other side another bladder, the two bladders contained seven quarts of Spanish brandy; he then pulled out a gimblet and a tin tube, and said he supposed that was what I was looking for.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tube a perfect one? - A. No, it was a piece of one; the watchman afterwards produced another piece, which made it perfect; the next day I saw the casks gauged, and found six gallons deficient in one cask, we took off one of the hoops that we had a suspicion of, and found a large deal spile; the casks belonged to Mr.

               <p>Q. Do you know the names of the Commissioners? - A. Yes. (Repeats them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I think you said the prisoner was relieved by another man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you saw the prisoner come out of the craft? - A. I saw him come up the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a gimblet upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a tool used by carpenters and others? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And a tube would be used for drawing off ale? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to the brandy of course? - A. There was no other Spanish brandy but in that craft, and that in the bladders was Spanish brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. You did taste it then? - A. Yes.(

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went on board the craft I found my partner very much in liquor and three other men with him; when I came they went away; he was so much in liquor that I was obliged to assist him up the ladder; I found several spiles in the casks: he went away, and I walked about the lighters till after ten o'clock; I then had my supper and smoaked my pipe, and as I was putting my pipe down at the head of the barge I found these bladders; I put them in my pockets with intention to take them to the Surveyor's office; about ten minutes after twelve my partner called to me from shore, and I went on shore, and as I was crossing Porter's quay Mr. Warriner laid hold of me and said he should rub me down; I told him I had got nothing but what I had found; he then threatened to send me to prison, and put me in a very great terror, which made me try to get away; they had my name and place of abode registered in their books.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Warriner.) Q. Did the prisoner say he had found them? - A. No.</p>

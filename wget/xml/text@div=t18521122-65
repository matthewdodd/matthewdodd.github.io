                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, and live at 81, Leonard-street, Shoreditch. On 1st Nov., about half past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Holy well-lane, Shoreditch, in company with a friend—I had been drinking with some friends, and was not exactly sober—we saw a public-house open, and went in, and had some spirits—I remained there with my friend a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—as I was coming out, the prisoner was standing with his back against the door, and I pulled out my watch to see the time—it was then 20 minutes past 2—I went out at the door, leaving my friend inside, talking to a female—I crossed the road, and the prisoner came, pushed me by the side of my shoulder, and I fell down—I do not know whether he struck me, or only pushed me—he went down with me, and before I got up again there was a policeman at my side, and I missed my watch—the prisoner was brought to me in lest than two minutes, and I recognised him as the man immediately.</p>

About 3 o'clock on the morning of Monday, 1st Nov., I was on duty in Holy well-lane, and as I was coming out of a court I saw the prisoner knock the prosecutor over the shoulder with his fist, and knock him down—I made the best of ray way to him, and before I got up the prisoner set him on Ms legs again, and ran away, and before I could get to him he was stopped by another constable—the prosecutor was not sober, but knew what he was about—I was present when the prisoner was brought back—there was a prostitute standing by—I did not hear her say, "I won't be taken for it.</p>

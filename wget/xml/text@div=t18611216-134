                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. White, carpet and general warehousemen at 78, Watling-street—I know Mr. Churchill, the proprietor of the Calverly hotel, in business, not personally—the prisoner came to our place on 2d December, about mid day, and brought this order—on his producing it I supplied him with thirteen yards of silk—I believed the order to be genuine—the memorandum at the bottom is not the prisoner's writing; it was written by our firm afterwards—this is the same sort of silk that I let the prisoner have, and I believe it to be the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I plead guilty to obtaining goods under false pretences, but I most distinctly repudiate the charge of forgery. The name from whom that purports to come; has not been forged, it is an assumed name. I do not attempt to deny that I obtained the silk and pledged it, but I am not guilty of forgery. I left my situation and wandered about London to get something to do: hunger pressed me, and, in a moment of desperation, scarcely knowing what I did, I committed the act for which I stand before you; and even then I swear I did not intend to defraud Messrs. White; I trusted in the hope of obtaining a situation, and should have gone home and received from my friends the money to liquidate that claim, before Mr. Churchill could have known.</p>

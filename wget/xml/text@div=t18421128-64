                  </hi>. I am a miller, and keep a beer-shop at Ingham, in Lincolnshire. On the morning of the 16th of Nov. I missed a bay mare, three years old, worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from my stable, which is about eighty yards from the house—I also missed a halter—this is it—the stable was not locked—on the 28th I saw my mare again at Aldridge's Repository, St. Martin's-lane—on the 15th of Nov. the two prisoners came to my house, and asked if they could have a bed—they slept there that night, and left on the 16th, about five o'clock in the morning—I know the mare by different marks on it—I know the halter by this knot—I have had it some time—I broke it, and fastened it here—Garrard has been at my house several times during the last twelve months—Gibson has been at my house about twice—I do not know where he came from—he was quite a stranger—they both came together on the 15th, and asked for a bed—they said they wanted to get up at five o'clock—Gar<lb></lb>rard said he wanted to go to Leicester, or somewhere—I do not recollect exactly.</p>

I saw Garrard on Saturday, tae 19th, I believe—I knew him before—he said he had a mare coming up from the country on that evening, or early on Sunday morning—I saw him and Gibson about half-past ten o'clock on Sunday morning—he told me, in Gibson's hearing, the mare had arrived—I asked what sort of a mare she was—he said, "Well, I believe a light chestnut"—I said, "Bring her down to-morrow morning, and let me have a look at her"—Gibson said he had brought the mare up, or something to that effect—I saw him and Garrard again next morning, at the Ship, in Charles-street—the mare was brought to my house that morning by Garrard alone—he said he had had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bid for it—he wanted 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he could not take less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it belonged to his mother-in-law—I advised him to take it up to St. Martin's-lane, which he did, and there she remained till the Wednesday.</p>

On Saturday morning, last week, Garrard came and asked me if a person answer<lb></lb>ing the description of Gibson had been there with a mare—I said, "No"—he then asked if he did come would I take charge of her—I said I would—about one or two o'clock Gibson came with a mare—I did her up, and in the evening Garrard came to see her—he said he had brought her from Lincoln, and his wife bad rode her some hundreds of miles—on the Sunday morning Gibson came and asked me what the charge was for the mare standing there over night (I was not then aware it was gone)—I said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me two half-crowns, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—on Monday morning, Garrard came again, and asked me where the young man was that would buy the mare—I said I would find him—he offered her for sale—I spoke to my master, and he objected to have anything to do with it.</p>

               <p>and he asked me to take it to Mr. Wilson's, which I did; he said he did not want it, and I took it to Aldridge's, as he said it would fetch what it was worth there; the party in the counting-house asked me my name, I told him my name, and where I came from, but he never asked me if I was the owner of the horse; on Tuesday I was drinking with the man at different public-houses about town, and on Wednesday was going to Aldridge's to meet him, when I was taken into custody.</p>

            . I keep this house. I recollect the prosecutor coming with a bundle, tied in a blue spotted handkerchief - he kept it in his hand nearly all the time he was there - he spoke to an acquaintance, and laid down the bundle on the table to have some oysters. As I was going into the tap-room, I met the prisoner going out with the bundle, but I did not know, but that she was a friend of his - he said to me in a minute or two, "Where is the bundle;" I said, "That woman who has been drinking here, took it" - he then went away - the prisoner returned in a few minutes without a bundle, and I detained her.</p>

            . I was at the house and saw the prisoner go out with the bundle - I am quite certain of her person - she was absent about five or ten minutes, when she returned, and was detained - Ward was talking to me when she took the bundle out.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker. I was going towards the house, and met the prisoner about six or eight yards from it - she had a handle in her hand which she tried to secrete under her shawl. When I got into the house I heard of the robbery - I waited till she returned, and saw her taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to get some bread and cheese - the witness asked me to have some beer with him, which I did not, as I said I had a friend with me; as to the bundle I did not see it - I had one of my own, which was taken before the Magistrates.</p>

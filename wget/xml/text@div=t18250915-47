            . I am inspector of the watch at Spitalfields. On the 25th of July, about three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Wentworth-street; I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor come out of a court - the prosecutor was putting up his breeches; I asked him if he had lost any thing; he said, No. I said, "Make sure of it;" he then said he had lost his watch: I pursued the prisoner, who was running, and took her about one hundred yards off; she stopped down - I pulled her back, and found the watch close by her feet; I said that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150030"></xptr>wanted - she said she knew nothing of it, so help her God. I took it back to the prosecutor, who said it was his.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JURY to THOMAS ARNOLD. Q. Had you seen the prosecutor go over the ground where the watch was found? A. No. I do not know which way he went to Wentworth-street.</p>

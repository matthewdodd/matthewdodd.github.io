                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Robert Blockley, of 9, Albany-street, Barnsbury, it is our dwelling-house, and is in the parish of Islington—on the night of 13th February, I was alone in the house from about 9 o'clock till ten minutes past 10—I went to the street door at 9 o'clock; it was then quite safe—I was in the breakfast-room—I did not go up stairs again till a little past 10, the door was then ajar—I missed nothing at that moment; next day about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I missed most of the property from the second-floor front-room a black cloth cloak, a black velvet mantle, a black scarf shawl, and a black silk dress, five brooches, two rings, a bracelet, a necklace, a pencil case, a ring, a metal spoon, a caddy spoon, a medal, and a silver thimble—I should think the value of them together was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another brooch taken from the second floor back<lb></lb>room—I am quite sure they were all safe at a quarter to 8—I am position they were all safe on that same evening.</p>

About quarter to 1 o'clock on the morning of 14th, I took the prisoner into custody for assaulting me in the Borough-road—there were several other men with him, who got away—whilst I had hold of him I saw him drop something wrapped up in a piece of paper—it dropped into a constable's hands—I saw that myself—when he did that he said, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Charley,</hi> take this to my mother"—<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> got away with the others—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a silver medal, a silver thimble, part of a silver pencil-case, and a plated caddy-spoon; that is all.</p>

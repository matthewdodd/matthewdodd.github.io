                  </hi> I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. Tonnes was brought there between two and three o'clock on 23d April—he was in a state of collapse; he had four wounds on the head, two punctured wounds, one incised, and the other partly lacerated—the punctured and incised wounds might have been given by such an instrument as this white-handled knife, or dagger, but not the lacerated wounds—the punctured wounds could not have been given by a table-knife; they were too small; about a quarter of an inch long—the incised wound was about an inch long; the lacerated wound might be given by a fall, or from something sharp—it might have been done by the point of a table-knife, or by a kick—the wounds were dangerous; he remained in the hospital nine days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been long a medical gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been in practice about nine years; I have been four years in the hospital, and have been house-surgeon and dressing pupil about two years and a half—the wounds on the top of the head were about a quarter of an inch deep—it is more than one-eighth of an inch to the bone—I will under<lb></lb>take to say it was a quarter of an inch on the top of the head—the bone is</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prosecutor take up the knife before there had been a struggle between him and Antweiler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before he had hold of Antweiler he took the knife from the table—when he first came into the room there was a quarrel between them—there was a push before he took the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fieg, in his defence, entered into the origin of the quarrel, and stated that Antweiler locked the door; that Keyser and Tonnes came and wanted to come in; that Antweiler said they should come to-morrow when they were sober; that Key<lb></lb>ser tore at the door till the lock broke away, and Tonnes got through No. 49, got over the roofs, and came down while they were at dinner; that Tonnes went towards Antweiler and knocked him down: that they struggled by the fire-side, and during the struggle the images fell down; Tonnes fell a few times with his head against the mantelpiece; and when he could not get the best of Antweiler he took hold of the knife; that he (Fieg) took hold of it, which cut him twice, which the policeman saw; that he seized him, and his wife took the knife out of his hand, and while he held Tonnes, Antweiler went and opened the door; he ran for a quarter of an hour for a policeman, and could not find one.</hi>

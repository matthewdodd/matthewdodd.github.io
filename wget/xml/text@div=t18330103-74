             (Police-constable N 40). I apprehended the prisoner; I told him it was on suspicion of intermarrying, his first wife being alive, and for robbing Mrs. Catling of 5l.; he said it was no such thing, that it was a trumped up piece of business against him - he told me not to disgrace him in the street, but to let him walk; he went a short distance, and then made his escape - he was taken again, and at the station he asked if there was any letter from the country; I said there was, but I could not let him see it till the Magistrate had seen it: he said it was a bad job, but he must make the best of it, the worst they could do was to transport him for seven years, and he should petition the Court to let him go out of the country.</p>

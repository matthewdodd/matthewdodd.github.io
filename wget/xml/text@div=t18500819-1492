                  </hi>. I live at the Somerset Coffee-house. On my return home, on the afternoon of 23rd July, my wife gave me information—I went to the till and missed the note—the prisoner was the worse for liquor, but seemed to know what he was about—after leaving the house, he returned again without a hat—about half-past four he went out again, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what my wife said I missed the cash-box, which had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. -note several bills of exchange, a gold seal, and a key, safe in it at twelve o'clock—in the evening I went with Ashman to the prisoner's lodgings, 3, Fetter<lb></lb>lane, to the second floor—the door was locked—he was asked repeatedly to open it, and would not—the officer was obliged to force it, and we found the prisoner in the room—he made very violent resistance—he was searched, and I saw 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver taken from his waistcoat pocket, and several bills of exchange, which are mine, and had been in the box.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. -note inside the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as well as the one tucked under the handle—the box had been locked; it was found broken open—I had given the prisoner notice to leave in consequence of intemperance—I had a character with him—he was not sober all that day, but he knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the 12th battalion of Fusileer Guards. On 23rd July, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I met the prisoner in a public-house, in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—he asked me to drink with him—I did so—I rode with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and when we got out he gave me this cash-box, and said, "Take it, it may be of some good some other time"—I took it to the barracks, opened it, and found the papers in it which are inside now, and a purse—by looking at the papers I found the name of Stewart, by which I afterwards returned it.</p>

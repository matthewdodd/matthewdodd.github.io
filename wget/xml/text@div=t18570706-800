                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Shankster, of No. 307, Oxford Street; we let furnished lodgings. Norriss lived with me for a fortnight as cook—on 27th June, about 5 o'clock in the morning, I was called, and found the house broken open—the front door was shut when I went to bed—I was the last person up except Mr. Wetherell, who had gone to a party, but the door was left on the latch; he came home at ten minutes or a quarter before 3 o'clock, and I directly went and shut up the bolt—that bolt was still up at 5 o'clock, I had to undo it to admit the policeman—I examined the apartments, and missed these articles, which I had seen safe over night—the trowsers, and boots, and slipper were taken from the room of the gentleman who was out that morning, and the other things from a second floor sitting room—this table cloth belongs to Betsy Thorne, a lodger of mine, who has the keys—Norriss had left me exactly a</p>

               <p>fortnight before, and I think it possible that she took one of the latch keys with her when she left my service, for I found this latch key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under the kitchen window; it opens the street door; it was made on purpose—the kitchen window was left open as it was so hot, but nobody could get in, because the gate was closed—Norriss must have used this key to open the door, and thrown it in at the kitchen window to get rid of it—we have three latch keys, one of which is always left in the kitchen—I did not miss one the night Norriss left; I asked her whether she had left it when she went away, and she said that she had, but I cannot say whether she did; I did not miss it, having two—having found this one, I have not got more than my number—I heard the front door close as near half past 2 o'clock as I can guess; that was not more than a quarter of an hour before my lodger returned—I think it must have been a person who knew the house, because the other rooms were bed rooms—the house is in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Norriss.</hi> The housemaid had been out several times with the same key while I was there, and I have been out also. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, very frequently—there was one key for the two servants, and each hung it on a hook after using it—the lodgers had other keys.</p>

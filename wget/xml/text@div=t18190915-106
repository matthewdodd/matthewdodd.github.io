The other desk was Mr. Jones's, and contained about four 1 l. notes, and some memorandum-books; he is an infirm gentleman, and I manage his affairs; I saw the property in the desks a few days before.

            . I am a watchman of St. Marylebone. On Wednesday night, the 4th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Davis-street, close to Baker-street - he passed me with two writing-desks in his hand. I followed him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, friend, this is an unseasonable hour to be carrying things about." He made a full stop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes watchman, but I could not get away sooner, all is right, the things are all my own." I said I must see into that. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, if you are so particular, come with me to No. 4, Baker-street, and there you will find all is right." I followed him till he passed No. 4, and got to No. 10, then put my hand on his shoulder and said,</p>
               <p>"You have passed No. 4."</p>
               <p>"No, I have not - I am a d - d long way from it; I am going to No. 4, Alfred-cottages, if you will go there you will find all right" - I am certain he at first said No. 4, Baker-street. I then said he must go to the watch-house. I had scarcely said the words before he let go the desks with one hand, which, being open, threw a quantity of papers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150038"></xptr>and books on the pavement, he said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, watchman, what have you done?" I told him if they belonged to him to pick them up - he laid the desks on the pavement and began to pick them up; I called to Burrows, who was on the other side, for assistance. The prisoner immediately ran off, leaving the desks on the pavement - all the papers were not picked up then. I sprang my rattle, called Stop thief! and followed him about thirty yards, then returned and took the things to the watch-house. Burrows pursued and brought the prisoner back.</p>

            . I am sergeant of the watch. On the night of the 4th of August, Salter called me to him in Baker-street; I crossed to him, and saw the prisoner run on the other side of the street towards the Regency Park - the watchman called Stop thief! I ran after him, and overtook him in Hart-street, where he had either fallen down or was knocked down; he was on the ground. I had only lost sight of him in turning the corner, and am sure he is the man, I took him to the watch-house in North Baker-street, and called to Salter to know what charge he had against him; at that moment a man called out that he was cutting his throat. I turned, found he had cut his throat, and took a knife from him. I got his wound dressed, and took him to Middlesex hospital. He said, he was no thief, and I need not hold him, that he found the things under a hedge, as he was coming from Portsmouth.</p>

            . I keep the Royal Oak, public-house, Circus-street, New-road. The prisoner came to my house one afternoon with two desks tied up in a bundle - he offered them for sale to my son; I did not see them - he went to sleep in the room. I awoke him, and told him to take care of them. He said he came from Leicester, and had had a misfortune with one of them, as he was getting out of a boat, and stepping on a truss of hay he fell back into the boat, and broke the hinges. He left between ten and eleven o'clock with them, I afterwards heard that he had cut his throat that night. I will not swear to his being the man.</p>

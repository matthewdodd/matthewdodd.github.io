Treacher at the time that letter was written—my partner keeps the books at Sheffield—when I came to town, and saw the prisoner at the office, I said, "We must go round and get promises for the accounts owing, "and we went to Treacher's among the rest—I had the whole of the accounts with me—he took them in his hand, and arranged them, which would be the most simple way to go—I said, "If the distances are too far apart, we will hire a cab rather than walk it—he said, "No, we will not take a cab, I will arrange it in nice day's journeys, and we will do it in two or three days;" and amongst his arrangements was this of Treacher's—we had Treacher's account; a balance of 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I</p>

Mappin—he told me he was receiving 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year there—I don't know that he said he also made 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission—I will not swear he did not, I cannot bear it in mind—I don't know that I went to him at Mappin's warehouse, and told him that I thought he could do better if he established a business for us; it was more his arrangement than ours; it came about in a casual conversation; he said the place did not suit his health, being confined in the room and so on, and I told him we had often thought of an agency of that sort; that was the way in which it first sprang up—I did not tell him that we could not allow him quite the commission he asked, but that I and the two partners would share thirty per cent. between us, each taking ten per cent. profit on the goods; I swear that—I believe during the six yeans he was at Mappin's he bore a most excellent character—I did not give him notice according to the terms of the agreement; he had a very nice way of putting things off; when I came up again in December, he said his wife was confined, and one of his children was very ill, and made many feasible excuses, and I know that both of his children have died since, and I passed it over more easily perhaps than I might have done—I asked for his books, and he said they were at his private house, and from these circumstances I did not press the matter then, but arranged to come up the second week in January, which I did—I should say he has not sent accounts to Sheffield constantly according to the terms of the agreement; I will swear that—he has sent some few accounts, I think about three or four—he has sent shuffling letters; I could produce letters that would take you almost a week to read—he has sent an account of the money he has received from various parties on the one side, and the money he has paid on the other—it was not a balance-sheet; we never could get one; we often pressed him for one, and he always framed some shuffling excuse—we placed trust in his accounts at the time, from what we thought, till we found him out—we took stock in February, 1864; the balance is contained in the letter of March, 1864.</p>

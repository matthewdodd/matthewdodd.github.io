                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, at 43, Old Fish-street. The prisoner is my brother-in-law, and has been in my employ—he left about 11th Sept.—I deal with Mr. Dale—this is not my signature to this order—I never authorised any one to write such an order—I did not send the prisoner with it—I have not received the nails—I cannot say that the signature is the prisoner's writing—it is not so much like his writing as the order is.</p>

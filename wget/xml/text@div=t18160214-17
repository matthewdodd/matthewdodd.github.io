            . I am porter at the White Bear; I did not live there on the 12th of December; but went there first on the 8th of January. I saw the prisoner at our house on the 12th; I took his boots off. I saw him in the coffee-room, and took his boots off there. I saw the chamber-maid light him across the coffee-room to No. 17, in the second gallery at the back of the house. I saw him again between one and two the next day; I then saw him come down with a bundle on the first gallery. I carried the boots up to him about half past one o'clock, or nearer two; he came down to the first gallery stairs; the chamber maid told him he had better go into the coffee-room, and put them on there, as they were there; but he said, he would rather put them on there, and he gave me sixpence for cleaning them. He had a bundle with him, and he went away almost immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is the person whose boots you helped off at night, and whose boots you cleaned and carried to him in the morning - A. Not the least doubt.</p>

            . I am a married woman, and my husband's name is William Cater. I came to London by the Dover coach, before Christmas; but I don't know on what day of the week it was. I stopped at the White Bear Piccadilly; I went up stairs into a bed chamber; I had a small trunk with me; that trunk contained wearing apparel. I staid only a few hours at the White Bear; I left my trunk in the bed chamber; it was locked, and I then went away; I called a short time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after Christmas - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You may recollect whether you left it there a week, a fortnight, three weeks, or a month - A. I had left it there about three weeks; I am not certain; I called for my trunk; it was there; but had been broken open; all the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of these things again - A. Yes, at Bow-street; it was a short time after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all the things, or only some of them - A. All that I can remember; I recollect a person who shewed me those things; I don't know his name; but he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the situation of the room - A. The back part of the house, in a long gallery.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the trunk in the inn - A. I did not expect to remain so long in town, and I was detained in expectation of a letter.</p>

            . I produce the bundle. I am an officer of Bow-street, I and Westbrook were sent for to the Angel-inn, St. Clements, to take the prisoner into custody. We went, and found him there; he had been stopped there by one of the porters. The greatest part of this bundle was tied round his person with a bit of packthread; some of these things were round his person; the rest were in a bundle. Those tied round his body were tied under his arm pits, and went into the waistband of his breeches. Then I took him into custody, and kept the things. I asked him where he got them, and he said, they belonged to his sister. I have had these things ever since.</p>

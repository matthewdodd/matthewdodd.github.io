            . I am the wife of John Kidd. On Ash-Wednesday I lost these articles from my children's bed-room - I had seen them on the Tuesday; a lad came and told me a person was up stairs - I went, and found the prisoner with them; I asked how she came by them- she said the door was open, and any one might have taken them as well as her; I had never seen her before.</p>

            . I live in the same house. I saw the prisoner there with some things under her cloak - she was coming from the room; I asked where she got them - she said she had been to bring them down for a friend of hers to take care of, and asked if a person named Turner lived there; there was no such person there - she said she knew she was right, because she saw the corpse lying in the house; I called the prosecutrix, who said she was a very bad woman for taking her things; the prisoner said that the door was open, she came up by mistake, and was going to get a coffin of the parish, but that was for a person at another house, not at the prosecutor's - it did appear to be a mistake.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not she knock at the door on the first floor? A. Not to my knowledge - I met her there; she did not say she came to see Mrs. Turner, whose husband was lately dead, and she found those things about, and knocked at the door to mention it; a woman, named Turner, lived very near, whose husband lay dead; I have heard so since - I do not know whether the room on the second floor was left open.</p>

            . I was going to get a coffin for my husband, who was dead - I met the prisoner, who asked me to have a glass of something to drink; she asked me to take her to see my husband, which I did - it was dark, and she was rather in liquor; she said she would call again, and see if she could relieve me with something - my house is twenty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
